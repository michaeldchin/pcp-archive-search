00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint and I just don't have the fucking patience for it today. And we got Gibbontake here.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, I wonder why Ben is feeling down right now.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm gonna fucking kill you. It's literally your fault. It's literally your fault. You did this.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What did I do?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who the fuck are you? Oh, it's Zero and Hoodie, the Kato guys.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello, and just so everyone listening knows, Ben invited us to record this 55 minutes ago. But of course, this had to be delayed because he had to get some beef on Twitter real quick.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I had to take a rare L. I had to set aside time to take a rare L. I'm not used to it. It really snuck up on me and just laid me out.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, it was pretty ridiculous.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The gist of it is that I assume it was you that made the comment. I mean, who else would it be? I guess on the PCP Twitter.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wait, okay, wait, okay. We don't wait. Let me just like the context of it is that Trixie has had Radcon footage since Radcon.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And we've been asking her for it. I have personally asked her for it and you have personally asked her for it for months now for months.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We have sent messages being like, when are we going to get it? When are we going to get it? We need that footage.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She said in YouTube comments, she told people she would give it to us. She said she would do that and she has ignored all of our requests for it.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And we had a meeting the other day and we talked about like Radcon stuff and we all agreed like, yeah, she hasn't sent it. She's ignoring us.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't think it's coming. So today I log into Twitter and I make a fucking tweet saying Trixie has the stuff and it's probably gone.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's probably destroyed. She's lost it, whatever. Only for her to reply that no, actually, she sent it like two hours before I made the fucking tweet as it could completely randomly.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is the implication of this that maybe she does listen to the PCP still because it wasn't the last episode that you guys were talking about?

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No. No.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No to her. She's just psychic.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know. It's just, no, because we didn't talk about that. We didn't talk about this stuff in specific.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We talked about it at the meeting we had. We didn't talk about that stuff that she has saved.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The last time I asked her about it was the 19th and I mentioned it on Twitter, DM and Discord and she didn't respond. So I don't know.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right. Just so happens that she sent it to me. She sent it to me while I was asleep and then I woke up and I had seen, I saw the tweet that Ben made first and then assumed Trixie sent it to me in response.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But it was the other way around. I looked at the time that she sent it.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The worst part, the worst part, Ben, is that you got fucked on the math is not only were you wrong about the initial tweet.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I was wrong on the math.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The initial tweet is just fate, right? That's coincidence. No one can really blame you for that. But afterwards, the three more tweets doubling down. That was the rough one. That was the big O.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I mean, it just, yeah, it's an L and I just, it just seemed so, it's just so unlikely that the timing would have been like, I was like, no, it can't possibly be.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I insisted like, no, you didn't know the math's wrong. No time zones, blah, blah, blah, but no, no, it's all wrong. It's all, it's all in vain.

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know. I don't know.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's really tragic.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It is tragic. This is, it's also really fun.

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know, I, I think this is probably the worst thing to happen on the world stage, you know, within the last several weeks.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Probably of the decade so far.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, I think so.

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think news heads are going to start talking about the PCP debacle instead of Israel versus Palestine. I think one of these is you serve the other one.

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Finally.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Benz finally takes an L.

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Headline.

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's fucking and, and, and Joe Biden withdraws critical aid from Benz saying when he takes an L on the world stage.

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Are we much humanitarian aid?

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Much like Israel versus Palestine. I mean, this, this has been going on for centuries. I mean, it's really like just a lot of historic.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, really continue long after we're all dead.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, it is.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm so mad. I'm, I just, yes, I'm late. We started the episode late because this, she made that reply like literally as the episode was about to start and I was so flabbergasted and I just, I had to respond to it.

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it, and I just had to see you for like an entire hour.

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I just, I just, it's just, it's just the way these things go. And if you don't understand, you have a lot of growing up to do. I don't know.

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, we, we're the immature ones here.

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's right. Everyone, everyone else, everyone else is the problem. Yeah. It's your fault for not understanding why I needed my, my me time.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's, it's, it's a coming of age ceremony when you have your first big seas.

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What, what a, what a fucking disaster. Okay, so that's, so that's why I'm just not in it. That's why I'm not feeling it today, but it doesn't matter.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You guys, you guys are our guests this week. And I was, someone suggested I invite you on because you're running the Kickstarter for the anthology, right?

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you guys want to like introduce yourselves and tell us what your deal is?

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They know who we are.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay. Well, I'll introduce ourselves.

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, you, well you, wait, hoodie, you were on the all guests episode, right?

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah. One of the masses in that episode.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah. You were, I remember you were in team red.

63
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah. Actually, in that case, it was actually just me and one other guy, which that was slightly uncomfortable.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yup. It sure was.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I remember.

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, anyways, we are the two, two person team behind Kato, Kato, however you want to pronounce it. And yes, as Ben alluded to, we are currently running a Kickstarter for the Kato anthology, which both Ben and Gib are part of, which is basically just a collection of short stories in all different styles and genres about 80 pages.

67
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Definitely check it out. We just passed our stretch goal, literally, not, not our stretch goal. We passed our initial funding.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You hit your own. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just last night.

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
On the next day. On the next day after, yeah, 36 hours, I think it was around there.

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah. It really fucking crushed it. What, there's a stretch goal, right? I didn't check, but you said you were going to add a stretch goal when you hit the goal, right?

72
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah. So we, what's the, what's the first one?

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We have a few stretch goals lined up and ready to go. We try to be pretty meticulous in the planning of this.

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But the first one that we just announced was a variant cover done by one of the included artists in the anthology, Nas.

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It is a sort of Bakuman homage to one of the covers that we both really like, which is Ashiro, Ashiro, Ashiroki? I mean, whatever the character's name.

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was, I was going to, I was going to ask you guys are zero and hoodie, but together you are Kato. Is that a Bakuman thing?

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That was going to be my first, like, interview question.

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And the answer is yes.

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, cool.

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, yes and no. It's in some ways a happy coincidence, but obviously we both, both really big fans of that property. So, you know, I'm sure in some way it warms its way into our subconscious.

81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So where does, where does the name Kato come from?

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's largely a nonsense name, but in the anthology, we do have, we included a page, which is a series of text messages that zero and I had, I guess, four and a half years ago at this point where we were trying to come up with the name.

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And the methodology behind it was, well, it was kind of inspired by Trixie, to be honest, because Trixie had put out a video back then explaining why the name was Digi Bro and not Digi Does Anime or whatever.

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And the, the gist of it was that, you know, you don't want to tie your branding down to like one specific thing if you wanted to branch off.

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So the methodology going to our name was basically like, let's just come up with something that is short, catchy, simple, but does not limit itself to any specific property.

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We don't want to just be talking about, you know, fucking Naruto or whatever, or, or any, you know, specific anime.

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's basically just a bunch of nothing.

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wait, so what is Kato then initially? Was it supposed to be?

89
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I was going to ask what is, which came first, the YouTube or the comics?

90
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because you guys, because you guys are make comics.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, we do, we do comics, but the YouTube was definitely first.

92
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I've always wanted to, you know, like before I even wanted to be a YouTuber, I wanted to be, well, you know, I don't even know if right now I necessarily want to be a YouTuber, but my main goal is to be a writer.

93
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So that technically came first, but my first comic came out after the YouTube channel because I am not an artist, I'm just a writer.

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it was through the popularity and the funding of Kato that I was able to launch that.

95
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Unlike me, who's been a comic book artist from day one.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's not true.

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Is that right?

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not true at all.

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, that's true.

100
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was making comics before I met you.

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It is.

102
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, you are an artist in the way that won the author of One Punch Man as an artist, except you lacked all of the writing.

103
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's so cruel.

104
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's such a cruel thing to say.

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And it's accurate.

106
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
However, one is a genius.

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So thank you.

108
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're right.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're right.

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're right.

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're both right.

112
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, okay.

113
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sick.

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sick.

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, you showed me.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I've seen, you have the one comic called Embers, and then the other one that I read of yours was the one about the espion, right?

117
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Which I think is not finished.

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah.

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But Embers is a complete story.

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The first one that came out was called Always Tomorrow, which is a sort of apocalyptic Pokemon fanfiction.

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Which is, I like, I think it's a pretty good first couple of chapters.

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But unfortunately, just looking at it, it was going to cost me a ton of money to make to hire the artist and also not make any money in return because it's Pokemon and I can't monetize that.

123
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So I was very limited in my options for that.

124
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So unfortunately, that series just had to get put on indefinite hiatus until I'm rich as fuck.

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So after that, I was kind of at a loss for what to do.

126
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And that's when webtoons announced they were doing this short story contest, which was basically that anyone could post on their canvas or discover or whatever it's called, basically where you put amateur comics.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And they were going to pick a bunch of short stories in two different categories and give out like a $15,000 in rewards.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I found an artist who, like the script I had written, luckily was willing to work for a very modest rate and I put that together.

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So yeah, Embers is a completed short story.

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And in my opinion, it's pretty good.

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I liked it.

132
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I thought it was cool.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Actually, I wanted to talk about not Embers too much, but I wanted to use Embers to talk to Gib about something because Embers, because it was for a contest and we had a very strict deadline.

134
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We were actually coming up on the wire on that and I had to rewrite the ending entirely because we just didn't have enough time to make it work.

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think, Gib, correct me if I'm wrong, you had a similar thing happen with the Tezca Awards, right?

136
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You had to rewrite Clarissa?

137
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, yeah.

138
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was drawing the Clarissa thing.

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I had written out like, oh, this is going to be a fun little short story, but I don't know.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't have much experience understanding how much comic page a page of script becomes, usually.

141
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So it was too long and the maximum page limit was coming up, so I had to chop it off.

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I had to stop the story at a point where it could potentially end and it's a bad ending.

143
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Instead of being like, well, it's a bad ending and then Clarissa gets thrown in jail and then there's a joke and that's the end.

144
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Instead of beating the bad guy, she doesn't.

145
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's just all his lost moment.

146
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's the, what's the second Star Wars?

147
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's the Empire Strikes Back.

148
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Empire Strikes Back, yeah.

149
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And there's more that happens after that, that I didn't end up drawing.

150
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So did you write this out as a script, like as a screenplay?

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You know, I can't really remember.

152
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I think, well, I definitely had a Google Doc of what happens.

153
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was trying to figure out like plot points and stuff.

154
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I could check, but I think with regards to it being like a script, like everything being written down, I don't think I had that.

155
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I think I had some basics and then I sort of made up the dialogue on the fly.

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I knew what was going to happen, but I don't know how they were going to say the things.

157
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And yeah, not as well planned as the Lord of Ghosts, but it's still, it's alright.

158
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It is absolutely bizarre to me how common that is among people who draw their own comics.

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Because as someone who just writes, well, first all of my informal education is in screenwriting,

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
so all of my scripts are written in a screenplay format.

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I was relating to the fact that like, you know, sometimes I write, like I wrote a 14 page script for Embers

162
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and that ended up being super, super long just because I had, I thought that would be short.

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I thought 14 pages of a screenplay, that's, you know, I could probably do that in three chapters.

164
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's not too crazy.

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Massively wrong.

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It took a lot, a lot of panels to cover all of that.

167
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And it's not even like an action comic, so massive difference in mediums there.

168
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I just, I just would, I just, I wouldn't, I don't think I would ever script out a comic

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
because that's just not how I conceptualize things.

170
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
When I, when I have an idea, I see it, I visually see it in my head.

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't think about like, I mean, I don't think about like the words.

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So I don't, yeah, yeah, I don't like write it out.

173
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I see it and then I'll draw it and then I think of what the words are later.

174
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I write it out only so that, because like I also have like flashes in my head of like,

175
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
ah, this shot would be great, this panel, I want something to lead up to this panel.

176
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And then I have to think about like story structure, like, okay, beginning, middle,

177
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
end, you know, all that shit, like, oh, it's got to have, you got to set things up

178
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
so that they come back later and it's like, it's like everything is there for a reason.

179
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You don't want a meander, you don't want a bunch of bullshit in there that has no relevance

180
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to the climax or whatever.

181
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And so I just say, okay, so this happens and then this happens and I get the basic plot points.

182
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
For the Lord of Ghosts, I did script out the dialogue just because I wanted some lore to be explained

183
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and I wanted to figure out what was the least lame way to do that.

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I wanted, I wanted to like write it out just so that I, so that it felt like a conversation

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and that it wasn't like exposition-y.

186
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like I would, I would write something and realize, I don't want them to talk for that long.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I need something to happen here so that like, I don't know, some noise happens at the window

188
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and they get interrupted or whatever.

189
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's just like something to interrupt the flow so there's not just a big block of text.

190
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's usually why I would go into writing the script dialogue.

191
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, I was thinking maybe this, like, this style of just unscripted, not freestyling necessarily,

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
but a little more freeform, is a little easier for you, Ben,

193
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
because you do the vapors because that's, you know, this is so light on plot.

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's just, there's a lot of variance and there's a lot of room to sort of mess around

195
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
with how structure is played with.

196
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But I would, I wonder if maybe that wouldn't work as well for the champion

197
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
because champions seemed like it was going to have a larger sort of narrative overarching story.

198
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, even so, I still didn't like write out any scripts or anything.

200
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I just had kind of like a plot outline like, this happens and then this happens and then this happens.

201
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And it was a matter of like, yeah, I don't know.

202
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I didn't, I don't write anything like dialogue wise until I've drawn the picture.

203
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And then when I see what they're doing, I can imagine, what are they saying while they're doing this?

204
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Uh, yeah.

205
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is that usually accurate right off the bat? Like, do you have the first line of dialogue

206
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and that's usually the last line of dialogue, or is that, like, does it, are you readjusting the bubbles constantly?

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't do any, uh, yeah, I'll, oh god, I don't know, it depends.

208
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It depends. I'll just, I'll just fit text wherever I need to.

209
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Usually I have an idea like, okay, in this bubble, she's gonna have to say a lot, so I'll leave like a bunch of space.

210
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But I don't, I don't like have it, um, I don't know exactly what, I just have an idea like, ah, she can probably get this across in like two sentences.

211
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Um, I need to go to the bathroom all of a sudden, so I'll be, I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

212
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Should we just keep going or should we stop?

213
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, I, I got something. Yeah, I found my, my, my Google Doc folder of the Tezuka one-shot planning.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think initially Clarissa wasn't a fully formed character in my head and I needed to figure out what type of person she is.

215
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So I've got like, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

216
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I've got eleven overall documents that have like, outline volume one, brainstorming, uh, what is Clarissa?

217
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Uh, outline version two, uh, plot points.

218
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Uh, and then there's like world building for the Wild West place that she lives in.

219
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And it's all stuff that I should read again, but I never will.

220
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I never look at my own notes.

221
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There was this one panel in the Clarissa comic that I really, really liked, which was, um, I don't know which page it was,

222
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but it was, it was this dramatic pose where it was, the camera was like lowered and she was just saying shut up while she pointed the gun to someone.

223
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I thought that was perfectly, uh, in my opinion, representative of why I like your comics and why, you know, I wanted you in the Cato anthology so bad,

224
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
which is that like, you don't, I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way.

225
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Is your art is not like the most mind-blowingly, technically amazing art in the world,

226
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
but I do think you have a really solid eye for clean paneling, you know, interesting poses.

227
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I think you put a lot of thought into like, uh, the occasional action shot that I thought was really, really good.

228
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And particularly with Lord of Ghosts, I was really surprised with, beyond that, when that first couple pages of the comic was so empathetic,

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
it was so, um, emotional, maybe not.

230
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Like, I really immediately fell in love with the character, with the Lord of Ghosts character.

231
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So I thought, like, that to me, your Lord of Ghosts comic is the perfect blend of every talent Gib has, which is that it is these simplistic,

232
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you know, charming character designs, the occasional really badass panel, uh, and then suddenly this amazing heartfelt story about this, like, really touching character.

233
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, well, thank you.

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Um, yeah, I feel like I do, I do put a lot of thought into everything.

235
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Um, I, I remember while I was streaming the, the drawing of the Clarissa comic, I would have revelations and then I would just feel the need to explain.

236
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You see, I, I'm deciding, I'm putting this panel here because, like, it's like two viewers.

237
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And I was like, ah, you see, this is the, the reason for this is sort of, it implies, like, I'm thinking of theming when I'm drawing, like, panels and, and locations of characters.

238
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I love everything that I'm doing for it to, like, have a purpose for being the way it is.

239
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And if I can think of one, if I can, like, if I'm just drawing something and it just so happens to be, like, relevant in, if you think of it in a certain way, then I'm like, yes, fuck yeah.

240
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's the coolest thing ever.

241
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's, it's all linked.

242
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's all deliberate, even though it was, it's kind of made up in, in a moment.

243
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But that's relatable.

244
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I think that's just how, how art usually is, is like, yeah, not everything is planned ahead of time.

245
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You have to be making it at the same time.

246
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I feel I've, I've done a lot of planning in for other things.

247
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Then, then I make it and it's different.

248
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I mean, the Lord of Ghosts had different dialogue every time I would come up to a point where they would say the line that I had written.

249
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's the same amount of text because I made the speech bubbles, the right size for the thing.

250
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But then I'm like, you know what, this is a cringe way to say it.

251
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I should rearrange, I should change what they say and I don't want to redraw all the speech bubbles.

252
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So I just make it work.

253
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Right.

254
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I mean, if for fans of Lord of Ghosts, for fans of the Lord of the Ghosts, if you pick up the Cato anthology, you will see that 99% of the

255
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
99% of the same is the same pages that were, you know, on your website and everything.

256
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But there's like just two small changes to the dialogue and stuff.

257
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So, you know, I think art is like a really malleable form and I'm like huge into planning.

258
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Right.

259
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So I like, unlike, unlike Ben, I do script out all of my comics.

260
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I do script out every story I write.

261
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I also outline.

262
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I write pitch documents.

263
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I, you know, the story I'm working right now, I have like 30 pages of stuff.

264
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then also I'm currently writing 25 pages of stuff, like 30 pages of outlines.

265
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And then 25 pages of the actual story.

266
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So like, I am very heavy into planning, but even doing that, you know, I start, I open up my document.

267
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I start actually typing out the story and things change.

268
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I'm like, hmm, that I can't find the line of dialogue to make this work.

269
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Maybe I need to change the scene a little bit.

270
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe I need to put another character in here.

271
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah.

272
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, I didn't even consider this, you know, XYZ, whatever.

273
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Things are super malleable when you actually start writing.

274
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's like, because, you know, how like a sketch or a first draft, it's hard to write the first time, but once you're reading it, you can realize what could be improved.

275
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And when you have all the different pieces there, like if you, when I get to a point where I've got the sketch of the drawing of the page, and I have the dialogue from before, and I put them together, I realize the dialogue could be improved, or maybe I should leave this revelation for the next page and then move the panel away.

276
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And then change or add a different panel to make up for the space.

277
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And, you know, when you're looking at something that does exist, it's easier to edit it to make it good.

278
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
When you're planning it, you're always imagining what it looks like in the end.

279
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I think one of the things that changes the easiest is scenes that, the way scenes transition into each other, right?

280
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So when you're planning something, you kind of, at least I don't think too much about like the overall weave.

281
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't like, well, you know, overall structure is definitely important, but I don't think of like, how am I going to make this scene connect, scene one connect to scene two in an interesting way?

282
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I just kind of think, well, here's scene one and here's scene two, and I'm going to start working on scene three.

283
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But when you're actually writing, you're like, is there anything I could do to make this like, can I put an interesting cut right here?

284
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Can I make a matching piece of dialogue?

285
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Can I, you know, have these scenes reflect each other in some way?

286
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And there's a lot of different ways you had to think about, you know, interconnectivity and you had to think about segues and natural transitions and, you know, interesting ways to cut between things.

287
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think that's the type of stuff that ends up getting changed when I'm actually writing the most.

288
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Zero, what about you?

289
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This is, from my understanding, Zero, this is your, the comic coming out in the Cato anthology is your first real, you know, quote unquote real written work.

290
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Am I wrong or no?

291
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That is correct.

292
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What was the process for writing?

293
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, initially, I wanted to go in, or I went into this wanting to do an excerpt from this story, and initially it was going to be an entirely separate excerpt.

294
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But then I realized, wow, action, it takes up a lot of time, doesn't it?

295
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, we were working in an interesting time frame, or not a time frame, but like a page limit, which is that because this was all self funded and because neither of us artists, we did have to hire someone.

296
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So it was very much working within specific constraints, which honestly, in my opinion, tends to breed creativity.

297
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But correct me if I'm wrong, this is, you originally had like a shootout scene, and now we just have a dialogue.

298
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Can you actually, can you just pitch the people what exactly your comic is?

299
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Sure.

300
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So, Queenside is like a battle shounen superhero parody.

301
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's about this group of, you know, three young individuals who sort of get roped into Zeus's ambition.

302
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And Zeus, like the ringleader.

303
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Her philosophy, her nindo, is to surpass the old Titans.

304
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's also something, I mean, there's no way to say this without sounding a little pretentious, but that's something I'm attempting to do with this story.

305
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I want it to, you know, be the next one piece.

306
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Dude, same.

307
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It always feels like that.

308
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's such a dangerous ambition, though.

309
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You got to try, though.

310
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You got, I mean, I, speaking about like loads of planning, there's like hundreds at this point of Google Docs in my folder for webcomics,

311
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:29,000
ultimately to set up the biggest, coolest story with all the characters that I've written, all of them, and they're all going to be in one piece,

312
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
but it's going to be written by me instead.

313
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And it's going to have all of these interconnected lore things that don't mean anything yet, because I don't fucking know what they mean,

314
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
but they will mean something and people will be able to go back and say, oh, Pog, chapter one of bell shape.

315
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's like it set us up the whole thing.

316
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's every artist wants to do that, everyone.

317
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think that it's the coolest.

318
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That is exactly what I was just thinking, which is that it's the ultimate, ultimate comic gambit, which is that you have such this great ambition that probably is not going to work.

319
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's just being no one.

320
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
There's a reason there's only one one piece, right?

321
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
There's no reason not everyone's doing that.

322
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But if it does, you look like the genius is the type of thing they make documentaries about.

323
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's the type of thing people will be like, can you believe he was working on this for 30 years?

324
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And can you believe that she in bell shape chapter one?

325
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It did this and that paid off 30 years down the line like Oda with the fucking laboon.

326
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You know, it's the ultimate comic writers have it.

327
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Have you guys seen you guys seen fully coolie?

328
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I've not.

329
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, I didn't watch season two.

330
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What the fuck?

331
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Well, I haven't seen season two either.

332
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't care about that.

333
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The bit where Nina Mori gets hit with the Vespa and then later at dinner when all the the family is eating the curry, the little Prince curry that's too spicy.

334
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And then she gets sick.

335
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,000
She gets diarrhea or something and she her face goes all and she has to go to the bathroom because she having a delayed onset like stress reaction.

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's me.

337
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's what what I just had to do in the bathroom right now and getting and getting hit.

338
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But for me, getting hit with the Vespa was taking an L on Twitter.

339
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It was so traumatic that it made me sick.

340
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And I'm probably going to have to go back again.

341
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I wasn't thinking that sees shit has been gone for a long time.

342
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So if I'm sorry, I'm going to try and I'm going to try and it's because I'm going to try and I'm going to try and cope while I see, but I don't know if I can do it.

343
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's because you're so unused to feeling an L, you know, you're not inoculated to the L virus and it's like doing severe damage.

344
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That girl got hit with Vespa's more often.

345
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
She wouldn't have had any issues.

346
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's like what's the it's like at the end of Oh God, what was it called?

347
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Dr. Horrible.

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You guys know Dr. Horrible sing along blog.

349
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, the Dr. Horrible sing along blog when Captain Hammer feels pain for the first time.

350
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
When he takes when he gets it's that's me.

351
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm Captain Hammer.

352
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm Captain Hammer looking at my what does he get like shot in like the chest or something.

353
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He gets shot somewhere and he starts like screaming on the ground like mommy mommy.

354
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That's me, but it's because I think the solution here is that you need to take more L's.

355
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh yeah, you think so.

356
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's let's let's up the Twitter L game.

357
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You know, it's time to cringe post everypony.

358
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I you guys were saying every artist wants to make the next one piece.

359
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:47,000
My ambitions are more like I want to make the next Cerebus, which is to say a like weird piece of art that like has no that like clearly doesn't know what it's doing.

360
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And meanders for like 17 years and everyone now just goes, you know, Cerebus.

361
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, that was that was really weird.

362
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But boy, he sure did make it for a long time.

363
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I feel like that's literally that's also a goal.

364
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

365
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, you've already made it.

366
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You've been working on the you've had three chapters of papers over eight years.

367
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Well, it's because I don't work on it because I have all these other weird flights of fancy that I have to actually said this is interesting.

368
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Sorry, I'll let you go in a second.

369
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But I was what I was saying before about envisioning it and seeing it visually in my head so I don't script anything.

370
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's true of like the game to like I saw what the game would look like in my head.

371
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And I was like, I that's what it has to be.

372
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And like right now I'm working on cut.

373
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm putting cutscenes in and I don't know what the dialogue is.

374
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I just like I'll make the cutscene.

375
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll make the characters move around the screen and then it'll be like, OK, here's where a dialogue box pops up.

376
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The cutscenes already made.

377
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What am I actually going to have him say?

378
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I guess he'll say clickety clickety clickety clickety click.

379
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, wait.

380
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, that's that's it.

381
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, that works.

382
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I do envision that there is a cutscene, but not even that there is some information that needs to be delivered to the player.

383
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Like you don't know that.

384
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I envision that there is a cutscene and there is dialogue, but I don't like there.

385
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
There's no reason for it to exist other than that you can see a cutscene.

386
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No, it no, it's it's not that it's that I'm like, OK, at this point in the game, it would make sense.

387
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You know, there would be a scene.

388
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There would be a little cinematic scene and, you know, plot would be conveyed through dialogue.

389
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I wonder if maybe you approach this from a tone and pacing perspective as opposed to like a sort of necessary plot perspective, right?

390
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So like it seems like you're saying it would feel right for the game to have a cutscene here because that will help the tone and pacing.

391
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But I don't know what that cutscenes about and I don't know how it's going to progress this plot structure.

392
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That's just not a concern.

393
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
No, I don't think I'm explaining this well.

394
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I know what it's going to be about because I have a very clear idea of what the story of the game is.

395
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So I know like what what beats need to be hit along the way the path from the start to the end.

396
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Well, that's what I was thinking.

397
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So then I'm thinking like, OK, yeah.

398
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So I'm thinking like, OK, this part is where we can hit that beat and then then we can hit that beat right here.

399
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And then I know in this beat, you know, Phantom Horn encounters such and such, you know, they interact in such and such way, you know, he'll he'll they'll talk.

400
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And I know generally what they're going to say.

401
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I just don't I don't know the actual words they're going to use until I write them.

402
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I think this is an interesting topic because I wanted to ask I want to ask a question just a sort of thought provoking question, which is that if money were no object, what is all of our artistic dream projects?

403
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But I wanted to specifically ask you, Ben, is your like, is your end goal to be someone who makes comics or is it to be someone who makes games?

404
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Because it seems like this is just a feeling, but it feels like you make comics because you're good at it and it's pretty marketable.

405
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But I get the impression that you have a lot and maybe even more passion to just making the occasional game or two.

406
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't I don't really care.

407
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like what medium I'm working in.

408
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know.

409
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I just the reason why I'm making a game right now is because when I thought about how does this story end?

410
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I just envisioned it happening as a game.

411
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And so I was like, well, I guess I got to do that.

412
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I mean, I plan to make more comics in the future.

413
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll fucking do I'll fucking do whatever.

414
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't care.

415
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I probably wouldn't.

416
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I was I was going to say I probably wouldn't do like prose writing because it's not very visual.

417
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But I guess I wouldn't like never say never about that.

418
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But yeah, I wouldn't say that I have a preference one or the other.

419
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I mean, I think the reason why I the reason why I started making comics was just because I just think I thought comics were cool

420
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and I kind of had some of the skills necessary for making them.

421
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So I was like, I guess I'll just I guess I'll just do that.

422
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

423
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But I'm not.

424
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yeah.

425
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah.

426
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

427
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay.

428
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The question was like if you had unlimited budget or something.

429
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah, just like if there was no reason if there was no limitations on like practicality or time or whatever.

430
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I guess the larger question here is like, what is the end goal of your artistic artistic ambitions?

431
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You know, like,

432
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, it's it's odd because a lot of the time I think of the things that I want to make and I see my characters, but just in the place of

433
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the feeling of reading or watching or playing a thing that I have already played.

434
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So like, oh, wouldn't it be cool if I made Homestuck?

435
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Like that's the way I think.

436
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Wouldn't it be cool if I made one piece?

437
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What if it wouldn't be cool if like I made my favorite PS2 games?

438
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And I'm like, I don't really know other than like, I guess it's it's a weird question to answer for me.

439
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Because it's like, why'd you make art?

440
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't know.

441
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Sometimes I look at the stuff I make and it's cool.

442
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And I want to do that again.

443
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:43,000
When I had when I think of like, if I had all the the resources, I guess I would pay people because I don't feel like I'm good enough to make the things in my head reality.

444
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And I would need a team like I could make a Ghibli film.

445
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I could make a fucking, I could make a, you know, classic PS2 game.

446
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I could make all these things, but they would be with my cactus in them.

447
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And then I would have to say it's kind of childish now that I think about it.

448
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You just want the credit actually.

449
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, well, it's it's not that I don't want any creative input, because obviously the point of it being by me is that it's my idea of a story.

450
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And I don't know why create anything, because I feel like it.

451
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
If I had all the resources, I would make bigger things than I am currently able to do with just myself.

452
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And that wouldn't be, it's not like I have a passion for a specific craft or trade.

453
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'd like drawing, but I'm not very good at it.

454
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And it's, yeah, I don't have a lot of patience for learning because I'm stupid.

455
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So I'm improving, but slowly.

456
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I also like all these other things that I never I'm like, dipping my toes into every profession ever.

457
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
A creative profession I wear at me.

458
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And, you know, it would be cool to make games.

459
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It would be cool to make animations or music or or, you know, all these things.

460
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Drawing just seems to be the easiest one because right now all I need for that is a drawing tablet of some kind and.

461
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I make comics.

462
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't think I don't even read that many comics.

463
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I do like mine.

464
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Same. I don't read.

465
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't read enough.

466
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I do think there's this sort of cultural obsession with being the artist, being the director or being the writer or some sort of like having a really direct control hands on with a, you know, artistic product or whatever.

467
00:38:47,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But I do think one of the lesser aspire to positions, but talk to any professional and it will be one of the most important is the role of like an editor or the role of a producer, which is that like this person is not necessarily, you know, quote unquote creating the art, but they are invaluable to the process, at least in like larger scale productions.

468
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And they, in my opinion, it is still very artistically satisfying.

469
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Like 90% of this anthology has nothing to do with anything that I technically created.

470
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I wrote one comic and I helped zeroes a little bit.

471
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But other than that, it was just the process of recognizing talent and other people collecting, you know, collecting information from different people, providing slight input on what might need changed or how things can fit and like basically just the act of producing this anthology.

472
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Even though I wasn't involved with a lot of the artistic process for most of it, still felt incredibly artistically satisfying.

473
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I do think more people should are would be in it would be it would behoove more people to really think about the artistic process in a less specific focus lens of just I, you know, I am a writer, I am an artist or I'm a director or, you know, so on and so forth.

474
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah, I mean, if it turns out that like, ultimately, I would be heading a project to make my things that other people other people, I just like, I don't need to be the one to draw all of my comics or all of my ideas.

475
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I definitely design them first and then they would draw them better.

476
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But yeah, I guess I just the way I see art that is fulfilling for me is a way for me to communicate emotions, feelings, ideas, things like that through any medium.

477
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And usually just the mediums that I personally enjoy experiencing, which is like comics and animation and games, I probably wouldn't write prose because I don't like reading.

478
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I probably wouldn't, you know, do I don't know if I can take talks because I don't like those I don't care about that.

479
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But the the thing that would like get me to want to continue is is the the ability to be making the decisions.

480
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't like the idea of working hard for someone else's vision.

481
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And I feel like I know a lot of people who are exactly the same, which is unfortunate because we do.

482
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The world does need a lot more like managers and and people who can organize these idiots we are and put us into into a place where we'll actually make the things we're trying to make.

483
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And producers and stuff like that.

484
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's just I just I'm just selfish.

485
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I just want my thing.

486
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I want my thing on there.

487
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I think I have to go to the bathroom again.

488
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'll be back.

489
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm dying.

490
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm I'm dying so much.

491
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm sick.

492
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm ill.

493
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm I'm I'm wasting away.

494
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
No, the capital.

495
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'll be I'll be I'll be I'll be fast this time.

496
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I promise.

497
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Well, let me use this as a transition point.

498
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And this is better to talk about what Ben's not here because Ben will just go on an angry tirade give.

499
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I wanted to talk about Kickstarter's and obviously you guys have a lot going on with with Trixie and all that and divorced from that divorce from those.

500
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, yeah.

501
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, whatever.

502
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh, we can talk about it if you want to.

503
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I don't mind.

504
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I just didn't, you know, I wanted to ask like I wanted to get some input into because this is our first Kickstarter.

505
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And this is the first time we're doing anything even remotely related to this.

506
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
There's a lot that we don't know about like what's going to happen.

507
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
We don't know about the obstacles we don't know about yet.

508
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So I was wondering if I could get some insight into some of the first Kickstarter's you ran individually.

509
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You ran for like rad cons and stuff and some of the things that like notably went wrong and not including the whole Trixie to Vakul.

510
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Okay.

511
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah.

512
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I don't have as much direct experience with the Kickstarter's as Ben does because Ben has had a number.

513
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
How many?

514
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Is it two or three?

515
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
There's the RFCK pins thing as well as the Vapors chapter one and two physical books.

516
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Those were all successful.

517
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Those are great.

518
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Ben would obviously know how to do it properly.

519
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I did one Kickstarter attempt, which was like aiming too high and it didn't get funded for like the punk plushie.

520
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It was the plushie.

521
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah.

522
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The punk plush Kickstarter.

523
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah.

524
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Still on the table like in the far future.

525
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's never not going to be possible.

526
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I just need more of a precedent that people would have the money and also there are enough of them because people did want those.

527
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
They're just not enough people.

528
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I guess what could go wrong for like the Radcon stuff, especially Radcon four less so Radcon three.

529
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I think it was the stretch goals got out of hand on Radcon four.

530
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Not that far out of hand, but it was just sort of we were streaming right during the end of the Kickstarter.

531
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:26,000
We streamed because the hype machine really gets people going and people wanted to pledge because they could they could watch the stream and watch our reactions to it reaching higher and higher heights.

532
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And we ran out of stretch goals.

533
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And so we started making shit up.

534
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And you know, some of them.

535
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I think the animated for animated was one of the ones we came up with on the fly.

536
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I think I'm not sure.

537
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
No, no, no, no.

538
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's not true.

539
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No, no, no.

540
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The animated OP was was one of like the long standing.

541
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Was it?

542
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Okay.

543
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I guess I guess that one was just like we didn't know how that was going to be possible.

544
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
We just thought it was a cool idea.

545
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I don't.

546
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And we didn't realize how much money it would cost.

547
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't.

548
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't agree.

549
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
No, we did.

550
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We totally did.

551
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
We didn't have like a set amount of money set aside for like what?

552
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You're technically right, but I feel like the spirit of what you're saying is wrong

553
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
because no, we didn't know exactly how much it was going to cost,

554
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but like we knew it was going to cost some money to get done.

555
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And we knew it was going to take a while to get done.

556
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I mean, you're right.

557
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

558
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm just saying we did not even have like any contacts by the time that was part of the Kickstarter.

559
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We didn't know who we could contact to get it.

560
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Exactly.

561
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So after the Kickstarter ended, we started looking around.

562
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And I feel like that was a mistake.

563
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We should have looked around before and gotten like a better idea.

564
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I mean, we knew it was going to take a while.

565
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know.

566
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You're talking as though a mistake was made.

567
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Well, I don't know.

568
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I just feel like as general advice, it would be better to have a plan of action of how to

569
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
like how to make the stretch goals real so that there is no chance.

570
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There's less of a chance that things could be, you know, unexpectedly more expensive.

571
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I mean, you're right.

572
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You're right.

573
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But the OVA animation is not a good example of that because that is a success and it will.

574
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And it will.

575
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And it will be a success.

576
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It will be successfully executed.

577
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But what is the status on that?

578
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It is finished, but the OVA itself is not edited.

579
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, it is finished.

580
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Nate is on that.

581
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So that will be out at some point.

582
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Nate is on it.

583
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Nate is on it, but he was busy for a while and he couldn't work on it.

584
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But I think he is freer to do so now.

585
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So it is.

586
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah.

587
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Well, all that content, you know, really.

588
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I don't know exactly why.

589
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But yeah, Nate says he's like more able soon to work on all the things that need to get

590
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
edited, including the OVA and the Brad lecture and the music video.

591
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
The stuff that we came up with on the fly was the, I think it was the dojin.

592
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The dojin was definitely one.

593
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Maybe the print version of Road to Radcon in book form might have been one that we came

594
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
up on the fly.

595
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm not sure about that one.

596
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah, I can't remember.

597
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But the dojin definitely was.

598
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The dojin definitely was.

599
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I think having plenty of feasible stretch goals ahead of time is an important thing,

600
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
obviously, because if you have to make stuff up on the fly, there's a chance it could go wrong.

601
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, even though I don't feel like it had terrible consequences or anything, it probably

602
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
wasn't a great idea to just make shit up on the top of our heads.

603
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But it's fine.

604
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, it's fine.

605
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I mean, my second Kickstarter, the Vapors 2, there came a point when I just kind of started

606
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
making up joke stretch rewards because I didn't have anything.

607
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
The Oculus Rift.

608
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I started doing the like...

609
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That was funny.

610
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That was the first one.

611
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, the first Kickstarter had the Oculus Rift Kickstarter, or a stretch goal, which

612
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
we hit and which, yeah, I bought an Oculus Rift and which we ended up using at Radcon 4.

613
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So, you know, some content came of that.

614
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And then, yeah, the one for Vapors 2, I just started making shit up about the Slime and

615
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Punishment character, Uwupati.

616
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It just was like, send him to college, send him to rehab.

617
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh, yeah.

618
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm surprised it worked as well as it did, because that went pretty far.

619
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I think people just leave off with him not being able to go to rehab.

620
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I believe he...

621
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yeah, he didn't make it to rehab.

622
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He didn't...

623
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
No, canonically.

624
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And this is canon because I say it is.

625
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
If Christine Weston Chandler had just retweeted the Kickstarter, we would have reached enough

626
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
for Uwupati to go to rehab, but she callously ignored its plight.

627
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And so it saw no other alternative but to hurl itself into the Slime or Dissolve vats in

628
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
the Slime Corp laboratories tragically.

629
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But then, of course, the timeline split again when two different characters appeared to rescue

630
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
it from its fate.

631
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So, you know, it all gets very complicated.

632
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What the fuck even is Slime and Punishment?

633
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's just some bullshit.

634
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's just some bullshit.

635
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Don't worry.

636
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Don't worry.

637
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It was a small joke, but it became the biggest thing ever.

638
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah, my next Kickstarter that I'm going to do is when Slime and Punishment is done,

639
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm going to make a book version and sell that.

640
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That'll probably be this year.

641
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't see why it would take longer than that.

642
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That's going to be fun.

643
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But yeah, I don't know.

644
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
The thing about Stretch Goals is that everyone kind of understands that they're just sort

645
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
of there to generate hype.

646
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's not, with a Stretch Goal, you don't really have to justify the price.

647
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't know.

648
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You don't have to be like, okay, this Stretch Goal, if I make exactly another $1,000, the

649
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
next Stretch Goal is something that will cost me exactly $1,000.

650
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
People just want to hit Stretch Goals just for the hype factor.

651
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And even if the thing that it gives you is very insubstantial, even if it's just like,

652
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
oh, we will make the cover glossy.

653
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Nobody really cares if the cover is glossy, but that's a perfectly acceptable Stretch Goal.

654
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
What sort of person would like not donate to a Kickstarter unless a specific Stretch

655
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Goal is reached like a glossy cover or something like that?

656
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yes.

657
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You're browsing Kickstarter.

658
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
You see the Kato anthology.

659
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You think, hmm, I'm on the fence about this one.

660
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh, I see that if we reach the next Stretch Goal, the cover will be converted from, will

661
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
be card stock, glossy cards.

662
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'll come back when we reach that one.

663
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm not investing until we get that goal.

664
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
No, no, it's just not how it works.

665
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah.

666
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I think we have.

667
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
By the way, I saw the two.

668
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Sorry.

669
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The delay.

671
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I saw that the, the, it got the, it got the, the, the mark of the Kickstarter approval,

672
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the project we love stamped on it, which was pretty cool.

673
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And also it's like close to the top of the anthologies list.

674
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Like, like if you browse anthologies on Kickstarter right now, Kato anthology is like number like

675
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
three or four or five.

676
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So it's in like the top couple rows.

677
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah.

678
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
The highest I saw it was number three, but I don't really know how that worked.

679
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Like, I don't even know how they organize this at all.

680
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Cause now we're at number six.

681
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So I think, I think it's some kind of weighted thing where like probably the fact that it

682
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
made its goal like really fast, uh, pushed it up a little bit in the, in the algorithm,

683
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I think.

684
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And probably also the fact that they gave it project we love, which I have no idea how

685
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
they decide what to give the project we love stamp.

686
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
My, my first Vapors Kickstarter got it.

687
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Uh, and, but neither of the other ones that I did, uh, got it.

688
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Vapors too didn't get it.

689
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And the RFC Cape Inn Kickstarter did not get it.

690
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I wonder if the second Vapors was too, uh, with all the slime stuff, maybe that was just

691
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
too weird for them to sign.

692
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Cause it's probably like some sort of liability there.

693
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Like they want to be careful about who they give it to.

694
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I don't think so because I didn't add that stuff in until like way later, like until

695
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I was adding like late, late stage stretch goals.

696
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So I don't think that would have done it.

697
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The RFC K1, I totally understand because it literally has fuck in the name.

698
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And so probably they might have been like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Like that one I get that one.

700
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I am like, yeah, that makes sense.

701
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Um, oh, let me tell you my, my genius idea, my genius idea though, um, to double dip,

702
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
right?

703
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Cause being, being a successful, being a successful artist is all about double dipping and extracting

704
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
as much profit as you can out of as few, out of as little, as little work as you can.

705
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So I'm going to double dip on the RFC Cape Inn Kickstarter.

706
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Cause now since I have all these extra pins from that Kickstarter, I can offer that stuff.

707
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I can offer the coins and the pins and the patches and stuff as bonus rewards on the

708
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Slime and Punishment book because it's all related.

709
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's all, it's the same cannon.

710
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's the same setting.

711
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It all connects.

712
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It's like a spider web.

713
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It, it, it's like poetry.

714
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It rhymes.

715
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I gotta, I gotta be honest.

716
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I am a little jealous at how, how successful Ben St.

717
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Kickstarter lore is.

718
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's just like you have these, these, these pins and everyone's really hype about them.

719
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And then I failed, man.

720
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I still feel bad about it.

721
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I gotta, I gotta have successful Kickstarter one of these days.

722
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I gotta make something to be, to be fair, the pins did not actually make very much money.

723
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Like most of what we made on the Kickstarter went back into like, it made a little bit,

724
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
but like most of it did.

725
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We didn't like keep most of that as profit or anything.

726
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But the second Vapors one was, was a huge success.

727
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And like, I couldn't believe how successful it was actually.

728
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I was shocked.

729
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The, the, oh, the other, the other synergy.

730
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I did a similar synergy with, with Vapors two, because with Vapors one,

731
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I ordered 500 copies, which is more than I needed because there was a price break at 500.

732
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And I did that knowing that if I Kickstarter number two, I could offer the extras of number one,

733
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
which I had paid less for it because the lower price point, because the price break at 500,

734
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I could offer that as like bonus rewards.

735
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And that's exactly what it did.

736
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I didn't have to make any new copies of Vapors one.

737
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I just had like hundreds of them left over.

738
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And I, and it was almost, I literally have like only like 20 copies left of Vapors one

739
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
because the number that I ended up selling with the Vapors two plus Vapors one was like exactly 500

740
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
or like really close to it.

741
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It was just like, no, no, it was, it was, it was Belissimo.

742
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It worked out.

743
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It worked like a dream.

744
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's pretty clever.

745
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I wanted to say, Gib, I do think a plush just happens to be a pretty niche product.

746
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
If you kickstarted any of your comics, it would be, I mean, within reason it'd be successful.

747
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
The problem with, the problem with the plush Kickstarter was just that it had a high price point.

748
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah.

749
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
The, the, like a comic is cheap, you know, like my, like, you know, 30, my like 40 page Vapors comic,

750
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I think the basic tier was like 15 bucks plus shipping for the book.

751
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And that's just, you know, that's a low, that's a low floor with the plush.

752
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What was it like $40 or something?

753
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's a, it's a big, it was a big, it was a big initial hurdle for people to, to jump through to get it.

754
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It's a lot of ghosts isn't technically finished yet.

755
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
There's still like act three they need to make, I guess.

756
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah.

757
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I've been wondering about whether it would be like a good or a bad idea to like package act one and two,

758
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
what currently exists and then make that a book.

759
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Because I feel like that's, that's what I was thinking.

760
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It would be like possible.

761
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I just, I just liked the idea of all being in one, like, oh, the whole Lord of ghosts all like 190 pages.

762
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah.

763
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That's, that's really long though.

764
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's already like 90 pages.

765
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So who knows?

766
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I mean, you could always just reprint it as a completed book once you're done.

767
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I think you could do a Kickstarter for the first part and just say that this is going towards the funding of doing more.

768
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And at that point you are not only getting people who want a physical copy of Lord of Ghosts,

769
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
you also are getting people who just want more comic and therefore see it as desirable to give you money.

770
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And then yeah, just reprint it again at a later date once you have the entire thing as like some sort of deluxe edition or whatever.

771
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah.

772
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It makes more sense, I guess.

773
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I could, I could do that.

774
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I, it's, it's all, it all exists.

775
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Why not?

776
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
All right, Lord of Ghosts Kickstarter launching tomorrow.

777
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Link in the description.

778
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh God.

779
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Now I've got to think.

780
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Now I've got to think about stuff.

781
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Well, all right.

782
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah.

783
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That'd be good.

784
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I've got, I've got to think about stuff.

785
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Sorry.

786
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I hope, I hope a topic change isn't unwelcome.

787
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But speaking of stuff that you got to think about.

788
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm losing my house.

789
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And that's fucking epic.

790
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Talk about elves.

791
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah.

792
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That's only the second biggest L of today.

793
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
They saw your dope and there's like, oh, the lease is up.

794
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Get out.

795
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Lose it.

796
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Lose it.

797
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
L losing my house?

798
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Losing my house, no reaction.

799
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Taking an L on Twitter, it's like, I got to go punch a wall.

800
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I got to, I get, I get stressed diarrhea.

801
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I got.

802
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Fuck, I'm going to throw up.

803
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah.

804
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's, it's be like that.

805
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yeah.

806
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna, I got to move.

807
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I got to move in like two months and I don't know where I'm going.

808
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And my rent is going to go up because there's no way I can find a place.

809
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Consider it an RV.

810
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I, I stole an RV.

811
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So, but, but it's condemned.

812
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It was condemned.

813
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Well, like haunted.

814
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Yeah.

815
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah.

816
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It was haunted.

817
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It was bewitched.

818
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
You might say.

819
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Haunted by the soul of Trixie's career.

820
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You got him.

821
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Got him.

822
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You killed him.

823
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But no, I can't live in that.

824
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
No, it's cursed.

825
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's, it's out of the question.

826
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So yeah, I got to find a new house and my rent's going to go up and I'm, I'm, I'm sad about

827
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
it.

828
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm kind of, I'm a little stressed about it.

829
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What do you guys think?

830
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Homelessness?

831
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Pretty cool.

832
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I don't know.

833
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Are we pro or anti?

834
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I don't know.

835
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's pretty cringe.

836
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Pretty sus to be homeless.

837
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
No, I think it's pretty base.

838
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Thank you.

839
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Thank you.

840
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Zero.

841
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Someone had to say it.

842
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I can't, I can't.

843
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm named after my number of possessions.

844
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I can't take the idea that once homeless, I would be cringe.

845
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I just have to think it's based.

846
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I, I saw, um, oh, I saw, uh, that artist did the, the zero and hoodie like drawing of

847
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
you two.

848
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
By the way, I saw you, you retweeted it.

849
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That was a really cool piece.

850
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Uh, which one are you referring to?

851
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Um, oh God, who did it?

852
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It was, um,

853
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Was it, was it like the little chibi things?

854
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Yeah.

855
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah.

856
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah.

857
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Okay.

858
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Wait.

859
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah.

860
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Those are fucking dope.

861
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Like, I don't know what I'm going to, I need to use that for something.

862
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Put that in the fricking, put that in the fricking like bonus page or something.

863
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Uh,

864
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yeah.

865
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That's a good idea.

866
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm going to put that, put that here in the chat for Eleazar, uh, show that one on

867
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
the fricking, on the fricking video by Nass, by Nass in the sky.

868
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah.

869
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Who also did our stretch goal, uh, variant cover and is in the comic.

870
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Uh, she does, she does pretty excellent like slice of life manga.

871
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I have, I have a question.

872
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I don't think Gib asked this while I was gone.

873
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Uh, how did you choose what to include?

874
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
What was your criteria?

875
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Oh yeah.

876
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Um, well you two got invited because we're just both huge fans of your work.

877
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Right.

878
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Even though my work is shit, I just, I'm, I'm, I was grandfathered in.

879
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yeah.

880
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Just how I like it.

881
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Uh, the six other people all paid us lots of money to get in.

882
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Uh, epic.

883
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
That's how those was.

884
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
All of which, all of which you then turned around and gave to me with the privilege

885
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
of putting my stuff in there.

886
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
So it was the circle of life.

887
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Uh, yeah.

888
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
We had to, you know, it's like getting a new credit card to pay off the old credit

889
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
card.

890
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
We had to pay you so we had to get them to pay us.

891
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It was a lot of work.

892
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
That's right.

893
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
The real answer is just to clarify all the, all the contributors got paid for their

894
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
contributions.

895
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Right.

896
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Right.

897
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Okay.

898
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That is something we are touting pretty heavily is that regardless, even if this

899
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Kickstarter failed, everyone got paid.

900
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Everyone retains the rights to their comics.

901
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
We didn't want to, this was never about, you know, uh, owning the lord of ghosts so that

902
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Gib couldn't run her Kickstarter tomorrow.

903
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah.

904
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Yeah.

905
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'll, I'll, um, uh, if I can contract where it explained that you don't have the rights

906
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
or, or, but you, I give you permission to publish it in a thing.

907
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It's like, wow, that's like professional.

908
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
What, what the fuck?

909
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That's like sensible.

910
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yeah.

911
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I think the terminology was like until the end of the universe or something or like ad

912
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
infinite.

913
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It was something like till death, like the, you know, till death of you.

914
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah.

915
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,720
Um, that, that, I mean, that contract was just something I found online, not to shatter

916
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,000
the illusion of professionality, but yeah, that was just a basic template I found.

917
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,680
Well, that means it's, but it does hold up in court and I will sue anyone who tries

918
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,680
to fuck us.

919
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,680
Good.

920
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,680
That's right.

921
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,680
He's lying.

922
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,680
He wrote it down as I dictated it.

923
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:21,680
Um, the real answer to how we, how we chose these is that we had, uh, we, we put out the

924
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:28,040
announcement video saying like, uh, you know, any two to 12 page comic can enter and we

925
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,680
had about 70, 70 or 80 entries.

926
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,680
I don't remember the exact number, but, um, we had a lot of entries, Ben, you were actually

927
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,800
on, uh, you were on the form.

928
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,560
I had sent you an invite, uh, so I don't know if you, uh, I assumed you didn't want

929
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,680
to help us choose, but you weren't allowed to.

930
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,160
We did, uh, you know, invite you.

931
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
Really?

932
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
Yeah.

933
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
That was like one of the first things I had told you about.

934
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,580
You had, you had asked me like, uh, you would ask to see if you, you'd ask to see the

935
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,580
entries.

936
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,580
I was like, oh yeah, sure.

937
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,580
And if you want to help us pick, that's cool too.

938
01:03:54,580 --> 01:04:01,560
I, you should have reminded me cause I have a vague memory that you did tell me that,

939
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,720
you, you could have, you could have, you could have asked me once or twice, like, hey, Ben,

940
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,360
do you want to weigh in on this cause maybe I would have.

941
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,360
I don't know.

942
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,080
I assumed, I assumed you were busy by the fact that you had a failed deliver on the cover

943
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,080
for two weeks.

944
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,080
Oh my God.

945
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,080
Yeah.

946
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,080
Well, whatever.

947
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,920
I'm sure, I'm sure you, I'm sure you've made great choices.

948
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,600
Yeah.

949
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:33,240
I mean, I, I think the comics and the anthology are the criteria.

950
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,480
We didn't, we didn't have like a list of, you know, a rubric or anything, but we read

951
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,480
through them all.

952
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,240
We had narrowed it down to a fair amount that were good.

953
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:46,120
We actually had, we were deciding for a long time who was going to get in and we had like,

954
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:51,000
by the end of it, we had like four different lists and we had decided on one and it didn't

955
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,640
include someone that we thought like maybe we just increased the number to 11 comics

956
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,680
because we just liked their story so much.

957
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Yeah.

958
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:02,600
It was, it was incredibly difficult, but one of the things that we were looking for was

959
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:09,080
that like, we didn't want all the comics to feel the same as, you know, as people who

960
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,600
make and consume art, we have our own interests.

961
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,440
We have our own subjective things and there are comics in the anthology that might not

962
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,640
have been my particular interest, but I thought a story as varied and as wide appealing as

963
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,120
I want this to be should have a comic that appeals to people who would like this story,

964
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:32,520
even though it's not necessarily like my ideal aesthetic or whatever.

965
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:40,400
What, what made you, what gave you the idea to do like a community anthology in the first place?

966
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,320
I think anyone would have paid attention to this Kickstarter if it was just us.

967
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,440
Well, I don't know.

968
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:57,160
I think there's, there is a, an answer that is true, but so the real answer is that there's

969
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,080
a lot of practicality behind it, which is that are you saying, are you saying that like

970
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,040
having more artists involved with it just gets more eyes on it?

971
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,360
Is that the idea?

972
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,720
I think that that is, that was definitely 70, 65 percent of why we did it.

973
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,400
There was, it started, it started with the idea of I was looking, I had, for the first

974
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,600
time, I was just like, how much does it actually cost to print a comic?

975
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,520
Because I, I've always assumed it was super expensive.

976
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,440
I didn't even want to bother.

977
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,840
And I looked at it and I was like, oh, it's like 10 bucks, it's 10 bucks per comic,

978
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:31,080
basically, you know, with, with a lot of variants and depends on the page count and

979
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,000
color and whatever.

980
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,800
But yeah, yeah, it's something.

981
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,560
It was not wildly expensive, like I thought.

982
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:41,440
So I had considered, you know, do I want to adapt embers, which is written in like a

983
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,760
scrolling webtoon format?

984
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,480
Do I want to adapt that into a print thing?

985
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,920
Because I kind of just wanted something to hold.

986
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,280
And I decided, no, that's lame.

987
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:58,080
And then I thought, well, we also kind of have had terrible success with raising

988
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,640
money in the past.

989
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,360
This is our first Kickstarter, but we do have a Patreon, which I think we are,

990
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,840
we are fairly bad at promoting and it's something we've never really pushed too

991
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,040
hard and therefore it's not super successful.

992
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:12,680
So there was, there was my practical mindset was thinking like, it's going to be

993
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,440
really embarrassing if I launch a Kickstarter for my own comic book and it

994
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,360
fails entirely.

995
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,800
So part of that was like, well, this would be a good opportunity to get the

996
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,640
community together.

997
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,480
This would be a good opportunity.

998
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,480
Cause one of the other things that I say this in the Kickstarter description is

999
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:32,680
that like I am very heavy on the mindset of like just creating even if you don't

1000
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,480
necessarily have the skills.

1001
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,480
So constantly on the channel, I'm telling people like, if you want to be a writer,

1002
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,160
just go write something.

1003
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,840
If you want to be, if you want to make a video, go make a video or anything.

1004
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,920
I constantly tell people to do that.

1005
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,040
But one of the things that I think I am particularly aware of is that there is a

1006
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:51,000
financial element to making art and not always.

1007
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,080
I mean, I think if you are very comfortable with the baseline of only doing

1008
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,560
things yourself, even if you absolutely suck, you know, you can do it for free at

1009
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:57,840
that point.

1010
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,560
So it takes time, but you know, as someone who has paid artists for all of their

1011
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,800
comics, I understand that like this is something that I can do because, you know,

1012
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,600
I, I have a good amount of savings or, you know, the channel makes a good amount

1013
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,240
of money or whatever.

1014
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,480
It's not something that everyone could do.

1015
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:15,600
So part of the anthology was like, for as much as I want to push this idea, it is

1016
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,720
also, you know, I think a good thing for us to do is to help fund people who we

1017
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,520
think can do it.

1018
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,840
You know, to go back to something I was saying a little while ago is that I find

1019
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,760
one of the most artistically satisfying things that I could do.

1020
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,840
And I don't know if everyone feels this way is finding talent, identifying people

1021
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,760
who I think have the skills and helping them cultivate it.

1022
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,720
Whether that means, you know, like saying, hey, this little tweak to writing

1023
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,800
could make your story a little better.

1024
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,480
Or like, hey, have you considered framing the panel this way?

1025
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,840
Or even just saying, hey, do you need money to make this work?

1026
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,520
I find that stuff incredibly satisfying.

1027
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,440
So that was, I wish, I wish more people asked me that question.

1028
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,600
Yeah.

1029
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,640
Yeah, I get you.

1030
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:00,720
I, I do think I, I actually feel this way a lot about you, which is why I wanted

1031
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,240
to, you were the first person outside of zero.

1032
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,840
You were the first person I reached out to about this.

1033
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,600
When I, you know, this was back in November or December, like six months ago,

1034
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,840
I had asked you, I told you we had this idea and we wanted you involved in it.

1035
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:18,160
Because the fact of the matter is I do think the vapors and the champion and all

1036
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,640
of your work is incredible.

1037
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,320
And I do think, you know, it seems like you have, you are underrated for your

1038
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:24,840
skillset.

1039
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,480
So I, I thought if there was anything I could do to help out with that, even

1040
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,880
though I'm always saying this, I'm always saying this.

1041
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,640
I don't want to overstate our audience.

1042
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,400
We are not huge.

1043
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,560
Like we have, we have a hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube.

1044
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,200
You have a hundred thousand subscribers is a big channel.

1045
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,000
You're, you're, you're like as big as Nate.

1046
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:47,880
You're bigger than Nate.

1047
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,920
If you, we could go, we could go and kill Nate right now.

1048
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,640
That's probably not true though.

1049
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,280
You're probably going to be bigger than that.

1050
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,560
Yeah, there's no way we could kill Nate.

1051
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,840
No, he's too big.

1052
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,400
He's too big.

1053
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,560
He's too big.

1054
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,120
Yeah.

1055
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,640
Have you seen his posture?

1056
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,480
It's incredible.

1057
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,440
There's a line of people waiting to fuck me and how are we going to get

1058
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,400
past those guys?

1059
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,720
Okay, but go on, go on.

1060
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,520
What I was going to say is that Nate has the same size as audience,

1061
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,280
audience as us by numbers, but his are way more passionate.

1062
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,480
His are way more dedicated to sporting him.

1063
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,520
You can see this in like Patreon numbers, average view count, whatever.

1064
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,400
We have a pretty large audience, but that just, I think that's kind of just

1065
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,160
because we hit the algorithm a fair amount.

1066
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,800
Like we tend to make videos that YouTube likes.

1067
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,600
So we hit a wide net, but we don't have like the most dedicated core fan base.

1068
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,880
So in a lot of ways, I actually think, you know, the PCP, you know,

1069
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,720
in your individual audiences kind of outweigh us in at least certain regards.

1070
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,560
So, you know, I don't want to make it seem like I'm just doing charity work here.

1071
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,880
I mean, like, I've come down from Mount Olympus to bestow this boon upon you.

1072
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,120
Congratulations Ben.

1073
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,920
I was, I was going to say, you talk about like, no one would pay attention

1074
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,400
if there weren't like, it's like, you have like 100,000 eyes on you.

1075
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,640
But I guess, I guess the YouTube audience is not necessarily

1076
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,280
the comic book Kickstarter backing audience.

1077
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,840
Certainly not.

1078
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,120
Yeah.

1079
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,720
Like if you, if you look at our Twitter accounts, our Twitter followers,

1080
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,960
Twitter followers, you are like in the thousands and we have like 500,

1081
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:16,600
which is fine.

1082
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,320
Like I'm not complaining or anything, but yeah, yeah, it was, it was this,

1083
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,600
is this reaching out to you was both a business decision.

1084
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,320
And like, I feel like having someone who's done Kickstarter's and,

1085
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,360
you know, does have a pretty good audience would be good for the comic.

1086
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:35,160
And also it was like, I think Ben is really cool and I want to work with him.

1087
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,000
And I think I want to get his comic in front of as many people as possible.

1088
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,880
And then I reached out to Gibb too later on.

1089
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,040
And I was like, I think the Lord of Ghosts is a fucking awesome comic.

1090
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,640
And if I could, Lord of Ghosts is too long to be in the anthology,

1091
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,520
but if we could figure out a way to make it work, I wanted it.

1092
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,640
And we luckily were able to.

1093
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,000
Yeah, it's a very small slice, but it's it's a nice one.

1094
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,320
Oh, oh, fuck, my headphones are about to die.

1095
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,120
And wait, no, they won't die though.

1096
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,120
I can prevent it. I can prevent it this time.

1097
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,800
When you told me that you were doing a.

1098
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,960
Well, I like the idea of like a of like a community project.

1099
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,600
I like the idea of a project that many different people contribute to.

1100
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,320
So I thought it was neat just and when you told me that like,

1101
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,440
yes, you know, we're looking to we're looking to pay the artists that contribute.

1102
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,720
I was like, oh, OK, they're not just these these guys aren't fucking around.

1103
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,720
Is this serious? This is a professional endeavor.

1104
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,200
They have a professional attitude about it.

1105
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:38,880
So all the ingredients are there for a success, in my opinion.

1106
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,640
So I was like, OK, yeah, I'll work with these guys.

1107
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,240
This seems good.

1108
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,360
Yeah, I mean, the last thing I wanted this to come across was like a grift or something,

1109
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,400
which is why I was like really adamant about the fact that every

1110
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,000
single person involved has the rights to their comic.

1111
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,480
You know, we just want like we the contract states that we could like republish it.

1112
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,360
That's only because, you know, if we want to do more anthologies,

1113
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,320
if we want to reprint the first anthology that we not we want that as an option.

1114
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,160
But like I have no interest.

1115
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,920
I don't even want like soul publishing rights.

1116
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,040
Like I hope Lord of Ghost gets its own book.

1117
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,920
I hope you do that, Gibb, on Kickstarter that, you know,

1118
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,040
and I wouldn't I didn't want to do anything to impede that.

1119
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,560
And likewise for anyone else in the anthology,

1120
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,320
I never wanted to own anyone's comics.

1121
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,720
I wanted to pay them to get their story done because, you know,

1122
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,080
frankly, for the past two years, I've been trying to find anthologies

1123
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,720
that I could submit to and there are not many and there tend to be super specific,

1124
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,960
which is another thing about ours, which is that like we did maybe in the future,

1125
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,640
there's going to be themes like, you know, we want comics around this idea

1126
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,440
or around this aesthetic right now.

1127
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,840
It was really just about like submit whatever you want.

1128
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,920
If it's good, we want it because, you know, I don't want I don't want a small crew.

1129
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:50,240
I want to I want to empower as as many creatives and artists and writers

1130
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,960
as I possibly could.

1131
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,240
I am looking at the Kickstarter.

1132
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,920
I am looking.

1133
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,080
It is.

1134
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,640
Damn, that first day, that first day was a was a roller coaster.

1135
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,000
It's leveled off a little bit right now.

1136
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,680
This is this is how mine went to all.

1137
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,160
I think all Kickstarter's do this.

1138
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,400
They have a they have a good first day, then they slow down for a while.

1139
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:17,400
And then and then, you know, you promote it where you can.

1140
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,520
Sometimes you get some new eyes on it.

1141
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,560
You get some new you get some new support there.

1142
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,400
And then you have another big push at the end.

1143
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,520
And that's when you hope that all the people that were like on the fence before

1144
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,560
come back and go, ah, FOMO, if I don't submit that, if I don't pledge now,

1145
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,600
I'll never get to I have to do it.

1146
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,840
You got me by the balls.

1147
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,400
And that's when you.

1148
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1149
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,600
I have been worried that we might be a bit of a hot start.

1150
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,000
And then this is sort of the the height of it minus, you know,

1151
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,680
give or take a hundred or whatever.

1152
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,840
I honestly don't know how how it will go or what I hope I hope.

1153
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,640
I mean, I hope that maybe some people who had not checked it out before,

1154
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,280
because I've mentioned it on the show a bunch of times,

1155
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:06,520
but I hope maybe a few more people from listening to this will take a look at it.

1156
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,360
Obviously, the link will be in the description.

1157
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,120
And I don't just keep plugging it.

1158
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,200
Just keep keep keep yelling about it.

1159
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,800
You know, be obnoxious. It's fine.

1160
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,680
Yeah, I will say that we don't want to give out the number just yet

1161
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,800
because it's it's very used, depending on, you know, how many people of a certain

1162
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,640
tier or whatever.

1163
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:31,200
But we do have a stretch goal in mind that is if we hit this number,

1164
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,320
we will get to work on the second volume now and, you know,

1165
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,200
send out another calling card for artists to submit their comics.

1166
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,000
So I do, you know, this is this is something you would just go right into.

1167
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,320
You would just go right to volume two.

1168
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,600
If we if we got a certain number, which I will say is a pretty high number,

1169
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,480
because the fact of the matter is this took, you know, like we started six months ago,

1170
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,160
it took maybe two the last two or three months of like strong effort.

1171
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,680
We barely uploaded to the channel or anything.

1172
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,800
It was a long time of just solely focusing on this and not to mention

1173
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,120
because I wanted it to be that even if the Kickstarter failed, everyone got paid.

1174
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,520
This cost a lot of upfront money.

1175
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,760
So it was it's definitely not something I could just

1176
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,560
continue to do unless this one is pretty successful, which, you know,

1177
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,520
I'm not trying to guilt or anyone, but if you're someone who makes comics

1178
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,480
and we've got a couple of messages like this, like, hey, this is just a bad time

1179
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,560
or hey, I heard about this too late.

1180
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,880
This is something I want to do a lot of.

1181
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,640
So if that's something that interests you, if you want to just support

1182
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,200
anthologies like this in the future or, you know, purely greedy,

1183
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,800
greed wise, you want to support it so you get another chance in the future.

1184
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,160
That is something worth considering.

1185
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,080
That one, that's the one.

1186
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,520
You've got to be kind of cool, cool, cool.

1187
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,400
Well, I mean, I'm really glad to see that it's it's it's that it's funded

1188
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,680
one one way or another.

1189
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,960
It is funded now, so it's it's real.

1190
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,480
It's happening.

1191
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,760
Congratulations.

1192
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,880
A book.

1193
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,240
And I'm going to get one.

1194
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,960
I'm going to put it next to the Vapors.

1195
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,000
And I really like physical comics.

1196
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,480
Part of me.

1197
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,120
I almost I almost was like, I almost sent you a message like, hey,

1198
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,240
I get a free one, right?

1199
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,800
But then I was like, no, no, Ben, don't be a bitch.

1200
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
And I back.

1201
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,880
You know, I did.

1202
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,560
I did message zero right after you had pledged.

1203
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,760
I was like, I wonder if we could scam Ben Singh, because he does get a free one.

1204
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,800
But I mean, he just pledged, does he need two books?

1205
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,560
Why would he want? No, it's.

1206
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,720
Fuck it. No, fuck it.

1207
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:35,160
No, no, I kind of I half the reason I backed was just so I could take a

1208
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,240
screenshot of it saying you're a backer and tweet it just to prove

1209
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,600
just to just to put my money where my mouth was.

1210
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,120
I mean, that's a tax write-off right there.

1211
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,880
That's marketing.

1212
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,440
That's that I couldn't afford not to.

1213
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,520
Base base.

1214
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,480
Uh, yeah.

1215
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,480
All right.

1216
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,560
That's all good shit.

1217
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,880
Anything else to say about that?

1218
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,200
Or should we like, should I complain about being homeless more?

1219
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,400
Well, I'd love to hear about your homelessness a little more.

1220
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,520
I did want to. I'm scared.

1221
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,160
I'm scared of the elements.

1222
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,840
I'm going to freeze. I'm going to starve.

1223
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,360
I'm going to die.

1224
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,560
I did want to at least mention this just because it's been something

1225
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,880
I've been thinking a lot about recently is that recently the author

1226
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,880
or the monk of Berserk died.

1227
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,760
Yeah, I heard about that.

1228
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,520
Yeah, I was going to bring this up as well.

1229
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,120
Miura, right?

1230
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,240
Kentaro Miura. Yeah.

1231
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:36,560
Yeah, I had read like the first, you know, I've read the what is it

1232
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,800
called the eclipse arc?

1233
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,400
Is that what the first part is called?

1234
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,440
No, I think it's the Black Knight, the dark.

1235
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,520
The very first part of the Black Swordsman.

1236
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,480
The very first part is its guts going around with his big sword

1237
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,160
and he kills few demons.

1238
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:54,440
Then there's the guts going around the flashback to the thing

1239
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,640
that leads up to the eclipse.

1240
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,520
The eclipse, the eclipse, I swear, like the beginning of Berserk

1241
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,560
up until spoilers, Griffith.

1242
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,720
Yeah, I mean, that's the god hand that is the eclipse arc,

1243
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,240
but it takes a very long time.

1244
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,280
It doesn't feel like the beginning of the comic.

1245
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,720
OK, there's a lot of changes.

1246
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,240
Yeah, but like it goes on and on after that,

1247
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:20,000
because I have not read further than that.

1248
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,440
I read like the next chapter couple cut the little next like

1249
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,360
mini arc after that and then I fell off.

1250
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,600
So I wasn't like a regular.

1251
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,560
I wasn't like keeping up with Berserk or anything,

1252
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,640
but I did really appreciate that that first bid.

1253
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,400
It's very, very sad that he died before it completed.

1254
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,440
He was a fantastic artist, you know, like he was insane.

1255
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,080
Like just even even if you don't watch the series,

1256
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,080
just looking at any manga panel from Berserk is like this looks insane.

1257
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,120
It looks like this is probably took him a month to do this one panel.

1258
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,240
It is something that can be appreciated by anyone.

1259
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,840
He's he's the quality and quantity boy.

1260
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:58,560
He had like so many.

1261
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,480
I mean, you should definitely reread all of Berserk.

1262
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,880
Well, yeah, you should read all of Berserk

1263
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,920
because it's not going to be continued and then reread it again.

1264
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,720
And then reread it again

1265
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,760
because there is a lot of really, really incredible

1266
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,280
like mind shattering stuff that is like stuck with me forever

1267
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,960
beyond the eclipse.

1268
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,600
There's just like, oh, wow, wow, Pog, you know, it's like a Pog manga.

1269
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,920
You read it and you just can't help saying you're saying

1270
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,480
that it's a manga filled with with real with real life Pogger's moments.

1271
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,800
Yeah, for sure.

1272
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,880
It's very good. It's really good.

1273
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,000
It's not really much other than like

1274
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,240
to say that it's like extremely accurately illustrated.

1275
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,720
Like he's he's really good at drawing people.

1276
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,640
He's really good at drawing expressions, action,

1277
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:59,360
like like horses, armies, landscapes, buildings, like everything.

1278
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,760
He's just good at everything.

1279
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,560
And it all is incredible to look at.

1280
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,800
And it's so much of it.

1281
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,960
The boy worked incredibly, like incredibly hard.

1282
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,720
And it's really sad that he wanted he's he's he's dead.

1283
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,680
It's so young, fifty four years old.

1284
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:17,880
Right.

1285
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,240
One of the things I want to talk about was that I, for my understanding,

1286
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,880
and this could be wrong, so take with a grain of salt,

1287
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,080
I did hear that this is like a stress induced illness.

1288
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,480
And to me, that is utterly tragic.

1289
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:35,640
I mean, he did work a lot from what I read,

1290
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,200
from what I pieced together.

1291
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,720
He seemed like kind of a recluse and was constantly working.

1292
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:47,120
Not that that's too different from, you know, any other given manga author in Japan.

1293
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,560
They work extremely long hours and they have very few breaks.

1294
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,040
And that's just the culture.

1295
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,200
And that's just how it is.

1296
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,280
It's just what you got to do.

1297
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:03,320
And yeah, I wouldn't I would not be surprised to learn that his lifestyle

1298
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:09,720
and his speed at which he made all the stuff contributed to his death,

1299
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,400
which is really fucked up and sad.

1300
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:20,120
But didn't he he he was slow, right?

1301
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,360
I thought people complained about him going on hiatus all the time.

1302
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,120
Yeah, missing weeks.

1303
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,520
Am I confused?

1304
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,800
They they did because he he did take months off

1305
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:35,600
probably because he was working so hard when he was doing it and he needed breaks.

1306
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,880
And people would constantly tell him, you've got to not take breaks anymore.

1307
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,880
And he's like, OK.

1308
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,480
That's one of the things I mean, I'm I'm sure we can all relate to this

1309
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,240
is that like even when you're doing no work,

1310
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:54,000
if the if the expectation is that you should be working a lot harder,

1311
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,040
doing no work is still fucking stressful.

1312
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,520
You know, like taking a day off sometimes is the most stressful thing I could do.

1313
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,560
Yeah, I feel that all the time.

1314
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,560
I it's yeah, what is stress over not working?

1315
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:10,240
I mean, it's like the theme song says I'm supposed to be working right now.

1316
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,640
You all know you all know what I'm talking about.

1317
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1318
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,120
I mean, he wasn't a procrastinator.

1319
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:25,040
He was when he was working on the the things

1320
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,200
it makes sense why they take so long.

1321
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,920
I feel like earlier on in his career,

1322
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,280
he would be like a beast of a human being

1323
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,160
churning out panels that look that good at a like a consistent schedule,

1324
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,720
like how the fuck and the fact that he slowed down is like, OK, well, he is human.

1325
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,280
He needs he needs to take breaks.

1326
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,880
And here's what I don't get about the manga industry is why.

1327
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,320
So there's been a lot of talk recently about like should

1328
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,360
Shonen Jump switch to a bi weekly model instead of weekly,

1329
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,760
you know, giving all their artists a little more leeway and their deadlines and stuff.

1330
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,840
My question is instead of doing that, why not just have bigger teams?

1331
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:10,560
You know, like it feels like Japan has such this culture of a tour ship that

1332
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,280
and I and I get it, right?

1333
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,440
Like I understand why being the sole creator of Berserk or being, you know,

1334
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,160
Togashi and being the one guy who does.

1335
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,160
I mean, I'm sure they have assistance, but it seems like not.

1336
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,800
It seems like a lot of focus is put on the work that they do individually.

1337
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,160
It just feels like with all this money, I mean, I guess I don't know.

1338
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:31,040
It seems like they would make a decent amount of money with with all the infrastructure in place.

1339
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,400
Why not just instead of doing bi weekly, just have twice as many people working on it?

1340
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,040
You know, I'm not sure.

1341
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:43,000
I think I wouldn't really know because it would not.

1342
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,040
It wouldn't necessarily depend on like the the artists themselves,

1343
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,440
whether they want a team or not.

1344
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,520
They usually they definitely have assistance for things.

1345
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:55,840
Not not every artist works with assistance and not every production could necessarily be

1346
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,800
sped up just by like, you know, increasing the amount of people working on it.

1347
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,480
I think I say every every every man is different.

1348
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,400
Right. I mean,

1349
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,320
certainly at least kind of it could because right, I mean,

1350
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,320
I mean, some some people just work solo.

1351
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,800
The neighbor industry of this being anime.

1352
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,640
I mean, every anime has I mean, anime still has its crunch problems,

1353
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,880
but like every anime has like 20 plus people working on it at least, right?

1354
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,720
Fuck, I don't know.

1355
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,680
Well, I guess my point is just that I feel like the reason why some manga,

1356
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:37,400
mangaka or solo has more to do with culture and just like sort of a bad mindset.

1357
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,880
Oh, you know, my opinion, bad, a bad mindset.

1358
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,640
I think I think it is dangerous to be so focused on the individual.

1359
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,680
And I think, you know, I OK.

1360
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,880
But I mean, most I think most like serialized manga are not solo.

1361
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,360
Like I think most of them do have assistance, but not all of them.

1362
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,680
Like at least at least one.

1363
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,200
Do you watch do you watch Mon?

1364
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,640
Do you guys watch Mon Ben?

1365
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,640
You know, the Mon Ben now?

1366
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,520
Oh, God, Naoki.

1367
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,560
Oh, what's the fucking Urisawa?

1368
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,240
Uris, Uris.

1369
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,280
Oh, my God.

1370
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,040
Wait, I posted a link.

1371
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,040
I posted a link

1372
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,000
in my server before it's the guy Naoki.

1373
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,680
Naoki Urisawa.

1374
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,040
Yeah, Mon Ben with Naoki Urisawa,

1375
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,480
the show where he interviews manga people and films them working.

1376
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,120
One of the two episodes that you probably didn't see.

1377
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,280
There's one where the guy he's interviewing is like he draws

1378
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,640
like he draws animals like he loves drawing animals.

1379
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,960
And the series he's working on is about like human animal hybrids

1380
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,520
fighting each other.

1381
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,960
And he draws like very naturalistically and he draws very naturalistic

1382
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,480
like backgrounds and like natural environments and stuff.

1383
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:56,200
And that guy is like some kind of weird prodigy and he works completely solo.

1384
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,600
But he's like the only one.

1385
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,360
Every other one has like a team of people that they work with,

1386
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,960
either in like an office where they're all in there together

1387
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,040
or some of they just some of them just ship it off to to people

1388
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,120
to do like processing and stuff on it.

1389
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,920
So I guess most of them do, you know, split up the workload like that.

1390
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,680
This is speculation.

1391
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:21,720
And I guess I just worry that someone like, you know,

1392
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,840
Mira and someone like particularly Togashi, because I think Togashi has stated

1393
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,800
that he tries to limit his assistance.

1394
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,880
I worry that people like that are putting so much pressure on themselves

1395
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,360
to be the guy, to be like, I'm the one who does this manga.

1396
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,600
I do every panel.

1397
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,560
I do everything but the backgrounds or whatever.

1398
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,560
I think they put so much pressure on themselves to do that.

1399
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:46,800
And again, just speculation that I could easily see how that stress can overwhelm

1400
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,720
and turn into, you know, in the worst scenarios, severe illness.

1401
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,960
And in the best scenarios, just an unhealthy lifestyle.

1402
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,280
It's it's silly.

1403
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:01,880
I mean, fucking Quentin Tarantino is still thought of as like supervisionary man,

1404
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:06,080
but he literally does not do everything in the production of a film.

1405
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:11,320
Quentin reviews is seen as a visionary filmmaker, but we know that he has a team.

1406
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,080
He has a script.

1407
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,120
I am sorry.

1408
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,640
You just said Quentin that I this is how fucked up I am.

1409
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,840
Is that when you said Quentin, my mind goes to Quentin reviews and not Quentin Tarantino.

1410
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,200
God, you you're you're a cursed being right now.

1411
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,600
And it's awful.

1412
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,360
But yeah, like you can you can be considered like a cool person

1413
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,760
and still be not the sole creator.

1414
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:40,640
I mean, I know a manga is different, but like having assistance to learn

1415
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:44,280
that somebody has assistance does not devalue from them.

1416
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:51,080
Or like that if if somebody writes and somebody draws, like, I don't know,

1417
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,720
you don't need to.

1418
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:56,960
I don't I don't actually know what the culture is in Japan,

1419
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,800
whether it's like, oh, you're not cool unless you do it by yourself.

1420
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,960
I feel like it's probably just normal and people have assistance.

1421
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,960
I have just looked up Kintaro Mira.

1422
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,840
He's had over the years, so not all not not necessarily at the same time.

1423
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,400
He's had four assistants working on.

1424
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,560
See, that's isn't like a pitifully small number.

1425
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,720
Yeah, it's that's way too small at the moment.

1426
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,800
They said that apparently they say Kintaro Mira's assistant,

1427
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:31,160
like singular, posted something on social media saying they'll do their best,

1428
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:36,840
which could imply that he's going to try and continue it or maybe not.

1429
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:43,240
But the important thing is that it's one at the time he had one assistant.

1430
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:47,000
That's just him and one other guy working on it.

1431
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:51,440
Yeah, I think it's not enough.

1432
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,320
It's not enough.

1433
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,920
I don't want to speak to all of Japanese culture, because I don't know what the

1434
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,520
fuck do I know?

1435
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:00,840
You know, but I does feel like it might be just a distinctly Japanese thing,

1436
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,360
because I don't, you know, you know, referring to Bakumon.

1437
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,760
There's that whole arc.

1438
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,600
This arc was so funny reading it for the first time, which is that, you know,

1439
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,560
the main character has to go to the hospital and the editor is seen as a bad guy

1440
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,800
for making him want to for telling him to take a break.

1441
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,040
Like the whole fucking cast bands together, say, fuck you, editor.

1442
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,360
This guy should be allowed to work himself to death in his hospital bed.

1443
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,400
That's what I assume with the Japanese culture.

1444
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:31,360
A fucking streak of like, yeah, it is good to work yourself to death to do art.

1445
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,440
And like, no, it's not. You'll die.

1446
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,840
What are you insane?

1447
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,320
You can you can live a few extra years and get it done a little slower,

1448
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,960
and it'll be fine. You don't need to do it now. I mean, yeah.

1449
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:46,320
I don't know. I feel like there is a bit of a culture around that.

1450
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:53,160
I'm maybe thinking incorrectly about after World War Two,

1451
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,840
there was a lot of like a wave of humility hit Japan.

1452
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,760
Like they just got nuked twice.

1453
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:05,120
And so, like struggling and working hard,

1454
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:10,080
even at the cost of one's own life is important for the restructuring of the nation.

1455
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,040
I feel like that sentiment is carried over through generations.

1456
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,720
And it's still sort of around where it's like your own personal well-being

1457
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,520
is important, sure.

1458
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,160
But really try to get the chapter released on time.

1459
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,040
It's like, OK, I will do that.

1460
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:29,880
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1461
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,760
It just it seems like I don't know.

1462
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,640
This is again, this is just speculation on my part.

1463
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,040
It just seems like a pretty big issue.

1464
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:41,160
And I hope that there is if if Mira's death has anything to do with

1465
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:47,600
the lifestyle of being a normal mankaka in Japan, I just hope I doubt it will.

1466
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,680
But I just hope something changes.

1467
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:56,520
Yeah, I mean, the the reason why isn't isn't the reason why.

1468
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:04,160
Oh, God, it's it's it's a bit of a I guess a chicken and egg problem, maybe.

1469
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:10,640
About like is it the industry like the publishers like pushing them

1470
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:14,680
to like work really hard in their chapter, or is it just that like the industry

1471
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:18,760
is so competitive that the the artists have to compete with each other

1472
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,880
to such a degree that like that does definitely seem to be.

1473
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,400
Yeah, like they like they have to push themselves really hard,

1474
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,640
or else someone else is just going to do it better.

1475
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:32,720
And the magazines are just going to run whoever is is doing the best work.

1476
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,840
Like I guess I guess I could whatever means it takes to do the work, you know.

1477
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:43,080
Like you can't like you can't like regulate and say like, you know,

1478
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:47,880
mangaka are not allowed to like spend more than like 40 hours a week drawing.

1479
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,600
No, it's like they're going to do what they want to get it through.

1480
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,840
Yeah, it's it's just like a cultural thing.

1481
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:59,360
Like it's I assume it's it's more so that if somebody is pushing themselves too hard,

1482
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,960
not as many people will try to stop them.

1483
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,760
They'll just see is like, ah, damn, he's working hard and just move on with their own life.

1484
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:13,880
Something interesting not in Japan, but in Korea is for this is only semi related

1485
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,400
is that if you're playing a video game too long, at least I know this

1486
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,920
for like League of Legends or something, if you're playing League of Legends

1487
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:22,880
for too many hours, the game itself will send you a message which says like,

1488
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,240
hey, you know, take a break, you know, go get some water, stand up.

1489
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:31,160
Let's not I assume there is some wide epidemic problem of people in Korea

1490
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:35,160
just being too addicted to video gaming that like it is now baked into the systems

1491
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,440
to be like, you know, ease up a little bit.

1492
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,040
So, you know, hey, maybe someone from Shonen Jump can just give

1493
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,760
send everyone a text, say like, hey, ease up a little bit.

1494
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,200
Why they work so hard?

1495
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,960
They should learn from us Westerners how to be lazy.

1496
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,480
It's so much better.

1497
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,000
I agree.

1498
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,560
You get to wake up late and be like,

1499
01:33:55,040 --> 01:34:00,360
but they make better manga just objectively make better manga than we do.

1500
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,640
So, you know, what at what cost?

1501
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,440
Yeah, but we've got a fucking Steven Universe.

1502
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,280
How about that?

1503
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,320
That's true.

1504
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,040
That's they make better manga until mine comes out.

1505
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,480
Yeah, they haven't read the Cato anthology yet.

1506
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,760
So it's a flip in the script.

1507
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,480
Flip in the script.

1508
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,280
I would have won the Tezuka the Tezuka contest.

1509
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:30,600
If only I had finished it like properly, like it had an ending.

1510
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,560
I think they were turned off by how it didn't end properly.

1511
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,560
And a curatorial on a red end, he was like, ah, there's no resolution

1512
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,800
to the conflict, dislike.

1513
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,320
They could tell you weren't working yourself to death.

1514
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,600
And that's yeah, it reads in the comic that you took a break at some point.

1515
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,160
I do like the the knowledge that they did look over the Clarissa comic.

1516
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,560
Even even if it was briefly, they did look through all of them.

1517
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,720
And if they saw mine and they were like, oh, OK.

1518
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,600
Sammy and and the guy Hunter Hoda's eyes.

1519
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,640
Toriyama's eyes, eye holes,

1520
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,440
absorbed photons that bounced off of your work.

1521
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:15,360
Yes. And H and H for Oda as well.

1522
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, not going to lie.

1523
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,400
I feel like good connection there.

1524
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,200
Just the knowledge.

1525
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,120
Just the knowledge I wanted you to you.

1526
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,960
Stimulate you stimulated their neurons.

1527
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,960
You did it.

1528
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,440
So what is Oda like exactly?

1529
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,400
Yeah, tell us now that you have such a close connection with them.

1530
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,760
What was it like basically?

1531
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,680
What was it like to stimulate the?

1532
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,040
What was it like to stimulate the neurons of the age here, Oda?

1533
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,520
Oh, I was like looking into the end of one day.

1534
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,400
It was like looking into the one piece itself.

1535
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,920
I know all of the secrets now and I laughed.

1536
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,880
Because that's what that's what Gold Roger did.

1537
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,760
Excellent. Very good.

1538
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,880
That's what he would have wanted.

1539
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,480
That's what Oda would have wanted. God rest his soul.

1540
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,280
Ben, you want to tell us about your homelessness now?

1541
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,640
Well, there's not much to tell other than that.

1542
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,040
I everyone in my house is moving out.

1543
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,200
And I mean, I can't afford the place on my own.

1544
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:17,040
So I just got to find a new fucking place to live.

1545
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,160
And it's a.

1546
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:26,680
It's probably going to mean I have to spend more money to live in a house.

1547
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,480
And that makes me a little sad, but it is what it is.

1548
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:36,720
I don't know. I guess I'll fucking have to get on Craigslist or something.

1549
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:40,880
Is there a possibility to like to like get in another apartment

1550
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,680
with a bunch of other people?

1551
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:46,120
Well, I mean, I guess probably not to this degree.

1552
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,160
This was a bit of a unique situation.

1553
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:51,400
We had a bunch of people all come together and split the place.

1554
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,520
And we had, I mean, you know, we had like six people living here,

1555
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,240
which is more than I'm likely to.

1556
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,760
Oh, my rent is probably going to double, honestly,

1557
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,840
just because it's most houses don't fit as many people

1558
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,040
into a smaller space as we did here.

1559
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,520
But it's fine.

1560
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,360
I'll just.

1561
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:19,480
Oh, God, the the the housing market in Boston is a real nightmare.

1562
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,120
It's bad both around.

1563
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,480
Yeah, it's it's bad.

1564
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,840
Both are you guys are from here, right?

1565
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,080
Or one of you is.

1566
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,640
No, both of Massachusetts.

1567
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,440
You both are. Yeah, OK.

1568
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,520
Yeah, there's nothing.

1569
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,800
There's like nothing to find when it's not like September,

1570
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,840
but then like when it's September and leases are up,

1571
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,160
like everyone is looking and the competition is fierce.

1572
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,880
So it's like you're always fucked.

1573
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,680
Uh, uh, I kind of just haven't got to start squatting.

1574
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,880
I have started squatting.

1575
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,080
I have started squatting again.

1576
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,120
I've been working out for a whole week now.

1577
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,480
I feel so powerful that I could take on anything.

1578
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,880
Even take on any landlord.

1579
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,440
You could beat them to with an inch of their life

1580
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,160
and then say, can I have this place or I'll kill you now?

1581
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:08,000
And then they say, yes, now that I can.

1582
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,960
I'm so fit now that I can sleep

1583
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,200
on the anti homeless architecture benches

1584
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,600
with like the spikes on them designed to keep me.

1585
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,160
I haven't even I found out about this

1586
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,040
maybe like two weeks ago or something.

1587
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:26,080
And I just kind of have not thought about it that much.

1588
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,000
I've just kind of been like,

1589
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,440
well, I'll just think about something else

1590
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,520
because it's it's two months away, which.

1591
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,400
And I'm it doesn't feel like a long time.

1592
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,960
It feels like no time at all.

1593
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,760
And I'm like, oh, God, there's a clock on me.

1594
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,880
But but but like I want to finish my fucking game.

1595
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,880
I just want to finish my fucking game in peace.

1596
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:50,000
How much how much left on the game?

1597
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,720
Aren't you?

1598
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:54,680
Didn't you a pretty solid version of it already?

1599
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,920
I well, I released that.

1600
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,600
I have I have been working on like I mentioned before,

1601
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,960
I've been working on it, adding cut scenes,

1602
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:04,200
which I didn't have very much of that stuff

1603
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,600
in the initial demo.

1604
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,880
And I have been really banging my head against it.

1605
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,440
It's taken me a while to work through it.

1606
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,640
So progress has been a little slow recently.

1607
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:19,240
I feel like yeah, getting it done within two months

1608
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,840
is not is should should probably be doable.

1609
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,880
But it's hard to say because I won't know what's

1610
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,560
I won't know what problems crop up until they do.

1611
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,720
I don't know.

1612
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:39,520
But but it's like, OK, should I should I know to the grindstone,

1613
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,440
like really like grind out the rest of the game

1614
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,400
and get it done really fast so that I can then focus

1615
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,600
on looking for a new house?

1616
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,280
Or is do I need to start looking for a new house now

1617
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,480
so that, you know, maybe I'll have it'll take my attention

1618
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,200
away from the game, but that'll mean that I can, you know,

1619
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,120
go somewhere, not be homeless and be able to work on that

1620
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,960
uninterrupted, even if my focus is off for a while.

1621
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:10,880
These are the questions that I am grappling with at the moment.

1622
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,640
Do you you don't have like a side job?

1623
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,960
Do you you do this full time?

1624
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:22,520
Yeah, I I do not I do not currently have any side gigs or anything,

1625
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,640
which is why my which is why my uncommonly low rent

1626
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:31,720
living situation was such an instrumental part of my setup.

1627
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,240
And now I don't have it anymore.

1628
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,000
So I got to deal with it.

1629
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,840
I got to cope.

1630
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,040
I got to cope.

1631
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,320
But I'm not going to see you about it.

1632
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,360
I'm not going to see it, but I am going to cope.

1633
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,680
That's the ticket.

1634
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,000
I don't know. That's all I have to say about that.

1635
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,800
Pray for me.

1636
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,320
Will do.

1637
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,800
Thank you.

1638
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,680
Well, shit, anything else or should we go into voicemails?

1639
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,720
Let's do it. Hear the voicemails.

1640
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,600
OK, then let me let me find them.

1641
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,280
Voicemail number one.

1642
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,920
Let me pull it up here.

1643
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,120
Message three, one, eight, five.

1644
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,280
Yes, here it is. This is the first one.

1645
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:14,800
It is called out, out, and there it is in general chat.

1646
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,520
OK, so let's give this a listen in three, two, one, go.

1647
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,240
This vaccine is fucking killing me.

1648
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:28,440
Damn, I like just got a new job and now I have to call in sick,

1649
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:31,160
even though I've only been with them for like three days.

1650
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:35,160
And fuck, I'm going to I'm going to get fired

1651
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,240
because I got the vaccine.

1652
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,520
Damn, fired because you got the vaccine.

1653
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,960
That's I do feel like this probably.

1654
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,800
I think we've we've we've accepted that that's going to be OK.

1655
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,640
I don't think your job will fuck you on that.

1656
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:52,120
I feel I feel like they'll understand.

1657
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,800
I'm this makes me nervous, though,

1658
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,880
because I am getting my second dose in three days, I think.

1659
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:04,240
Yeah, on the 26th, so I will be fully vaccinated by the time this episode comes out.

1660
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,440
And I don't want to get sick, man.

1661
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,080
Sucks, man.

1662
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,200
So which which shot did you get the first time?

1663
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,280
I got Pfizer. I got Pfizer.

1664
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,880
Oh, the elite.

1665
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,160
What is the center?

1666
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,760
Is that the elite? I don't know.

1667
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,480
You should be OK.

1668
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,960
I was one of the unfortunate few who got Johnson and Johnson,

1669
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,160
which did mean I only need one shot,

1670
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:30,320
but also means that I'm now fucking bottom class.

1671
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,080
Oh, you're a pro.

1672
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,880
You're a pro.

1673
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,440
That's Hufflepuff. I got that Moderna.

1674
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,640
Very excellent pathetic.

1675
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,720
Let me tell you, it did kill me.

1676
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:43,040
Real a few hours after that second shot.

1677
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,680
Really dead. Yeah.

1678
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,240
God, no, I don't want to.

1679
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,120
I don't want to be made to feel ill.

1680
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,400
This is this is despicable.

1681
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,120
This is a nightmare.

1682
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,680
It can't be worse than the Twitter L.

1683
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,200
So, you know, nothing's worse than it.

1684
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,720
Nothing's worse than a Twitter L.

1685
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:57,960
Oh, they're making fun of me.

1686
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,520
Oh, they're making fun of me on Twitter.

1687
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,480
They're still going.

1688
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,960
Oh, they're having a fucking victory lap.

1689
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:03,960
No.

1690
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:08,000
Oh, this is the worst day of my entire life.

1691
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,080
This is even worse.

1692
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:12,080
This is even worse than the day when I get vaccinated.

1693
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,960
Ben, Ben crying and diarrheaing from having a Twitter L

1694
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,240
needs to be the title and thumbnail of this video.

1695
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,560
OK, all right, shut up.

1696
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,560
No.

1697
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:32,120
Wait, was it was I was I talking about something

1698
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,840
about getting a vaccine?

1699
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,720
Oh, oh, yes, I was going to make a genius analogy.

1700
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,520
Pfizer is team mystic.

1701
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,000
Moderna is team Valor and and Johnson and Johnson is team

1702
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,600
Big Bird team.

1703
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,680
What's the other one?

1704
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,960
Instinct. Yeah, it was instinct.

1705
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,760
I literally forgot what it was.

1706
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,760
Pfizer.

1707
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:54,800
Pfizer is AstraZeneca, I think, right?

1708
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,760
Oh, I don't.

1709
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,080
Pfizer and AstraZeneca is like a joint, joint venture or something.

1710
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,000
They is.

1711
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,800
They're only now in the UK.

1712
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,040
Are they are they vaccinating 35 year olds?

1713
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,960
So soon, I guess I can get my first one.

1714
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:13,040
Yes, I and I are both fully vaccinated because we're just that important.

1715
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,320
Oh, no, I'm wrong.

1716
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:19,280
No, it's Pfizer BioNTech is like the joint one.

1717
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,480
And AstraZeneca is AstraZeneca was the one they took off the market

1718
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:25,000
because it was given people like blood clots, right?

1719
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,520
Oh, yeah, I think that was disputed.

1720
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,240
It was it was made up.

1721
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,400
Well, it wasn't made up.

1722
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:37,080
It was just like like no evidence for there's no like causation,

1723
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,920
like not enough data to suggest that was true.

1724
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,720
It was just sort of like blood clots in people

1725
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,440
that were the same as like normal unrelated blood clots.

1726
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,240
Unrelated.

1727
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:52,640
But people were scared because Europeans hate medicine, I guess.

1728
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,400
It was just a bunch of stress induced mangaka, you know, just normal.

1729
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,760
God, I can't believe it.

1730
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,960
I got I got the Pfizer shot and then less than three weeks later,

1731
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,680
I take my first L on Twitter.

1732
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,040
It's it's not a coincidence.

1733
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,400
It's a side effect.

1734
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,280
There's correlation implies causation in my in my opinion.

1735
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,240
Ben, you're impaired.

1736
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,760
Next voicemail is called put it there.

1737
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
What's it called? It's called I am coming.

1738
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,960
Loud sound warning.

1739
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,120
OK, three. Yeah.

1740
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,920
Three, two, one, go.

1741
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,160
I'm coming.

1742
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,760
Oh, I'm coming.

1743
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,600
I'm coming. Where's he going with this fucking kneecaps?

1744
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,600
You hear me?

1745
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,200
I'm going with like ten nine elevens on your fucking kneecaps.

1746
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,520
Your knees are going to bend so far back.

1747
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,600
You're going to look like a goddamn singer.

1748
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,960
No, no. Yeah, I hear you.

1749
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,920
I hurt my head for the sake of this fucking joke.

1750
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,360
Are you happy?

1751
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,000
And I had to re-record this thing.

1752
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,520
God damn guys, because I wasn't satisfied with it.

1753
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,800
I hope you're pleased.

1754
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,960
I am pleased. I am pleased.

1755
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,400
You know, joke's not bad.

1756
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,680
I don't know if it was worth the first four seconds.

1757
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,840
I just don't know.

1758
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:16,080
Well, what I I appreciate that he just went for it.

1759
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,440
Yelled full volume.

1760
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:20,360
There was no like, you know, whisper yelling.

1761
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,440
Don't want my parents to wake up.

1762
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,760
Bullshit.

1763
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,400
So like that's refreshing.

1764
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,760
So I mean, this guy lacks nothing in commitment, if anything.

1765
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:31,160
So he has no shame.

1766
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,880
He's he's going to go for it.

1767
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,800
Next voicemail is called

1768
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,160
Oof, addendum.

1769
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,640
OK, three, two, one, go.

1770
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,320
Excuse me, addendum.

1771
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,560
I actually meant to say three weeks, not three days, but, you know,

1772
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:51,600
still pretty bad to call in sick after three weeks.

1773
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:53,280
I don't care.

1774
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,920
I actually hope this thing just fucking kills me.

1775
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,960
I hope it's population control, like all the righties say.

1776
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,400
And we're all just going to like start dropping like flies pretty soon.

1777
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,560
Because you know what?

1778
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:08,160
Everything's going to get automated in like 15 years and like I live in America.

1779
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,440
America is just going to like totally collapse.

1780
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:15,520
Because the right wingers would like the idea of like a shot

1781
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,400
that like kills the pain right now.

1782
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,520
I'm like so sick of going to get fired from my job.

1783
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:21,480
Sounds right up there.

1784
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,880
Have to be an artist again.

1785
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,640
No, you would you would think they would be like, you know,

1786
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,560
they love they love Corona for its for its, you know,

1787
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,760
less than one percent killer death rate, you know, it calls the week.

1788
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,920
You would think they would love a shot that gives you blood clots

1789
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,520
and, you know, gives you sends you into a anaphylactic shock

1790
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,160
and kills you if you're allergic to stuff,

1791
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:46,360
because it's going to it's going to fucking eugenics us into the moon.

1792
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:49,440
It's going to it's going to make a stronger human race

1793
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,640
free of our free of our weaknesses.

1794
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,840
So I don't I don't get what the problem is.

1795
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,120
It is I don't see the conflict that they think they they realize

1796
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,560
they are weak and they would be scared of. Yeah.

1797
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,920
That's what I was going to say is that these are the same people

1798
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,200
that probably would be offed by that stuff.

1799
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,800
Oh, I see. I see one for me and not for me.

1800
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:13,200
Yeah, self-preservation trumps all ideals.

1801
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,600
Naturally, we've we've cracked it.

1802
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,280
We've cracked it.

1803
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,360
Next voicemail is called

1804
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:25,280
outdated description and thoughts.

1805
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,120
And I am uploading it right there.

1806
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,680
OK, three, two, one, go.

1807
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,600
So I noticed that the description of the speak pipe page

1808
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,360
is actually kind of outdated because it says that it's a show

1809
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,760
where a bunch of content creators pick a topic and talk about it

1810
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,280
until no one cares anymore.

1811
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,120
But now it's just more like the content creators talk about whatever is on their

1812
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,040
mind until you guys get bored and move on to voicemails.

1813
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,040
True. So, you know, I just wanted to let you guys know that so you can like update it.

1814
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:53,520
No, it also says that you guys take questions when I know for a fact

1815
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,360
that you guys haven't done that in a long ass time.

1816
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,800
We're doing it right now.

1817
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,880
What do you? Your cloud doesn't matter.

1818
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:03,560
You can literally ask for anyone you want on this podcast.

1819
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,560
There have been plenty of people I know, whether it be interviewers or podcasters

1820
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,640
who have gotten people way larger than them on the podcast just by asking.

1821
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,160
It doesn't hurt to ask.

1822
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,400
Even if they say no, have a nice day, guys.

1823
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:16,720
You're right.

1824
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,840
I know.

1825
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:23,680
I saw today the lead singer from Eve Six was asking, was saying, like,

1826
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,720
I will be on anyone's podcast.

1827
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,800
And I'm like, that's funny.

1828
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,760
That's cool. What if I asked the Eve?

1829
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:35,760
What if I asked the Heart and a Blender song guy to be on the podcast?

1830
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,240
But what do I want to talk to him for?

1831
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:39,120
Yeah, what do I want to?

1832
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:42,560
What do I have? What do I have to say to the heart and blender who he was?

1833
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:45,800
I can't believe you've never heard the Heart and a Blender song.

1834
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,480
Well, it's probably an American radio, I guess.

1835
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,600
Maybe didn't make it.

1836
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,240
I had a talking about.

1837
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,240
You don't know.

1838
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,720
You don't know Inside Out by Eve Six.

1839
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,600
Maybe if I heard it, I don't think it's the one that goes like.

1840
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,800
Faith, but how does it go?

1841
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,760
And I found nothing but faith in nothing.

1842
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,400
Want to put my tender heart and a blender.

1843
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:12,840
Watch has been around to a beautiful oblivion.

1844
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,000
Rendezvous and I'm through with you.

1845
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,920
No, no.

1846
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,160
I appreciate the commitment, but no, I had a camp when I was a little kid.

1847
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,160
Then maybe not that little.

1848
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:26,840
I had a counselor at camp who would sometimes he was a guitar guy.

1849
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,920
He would pull out his guitar and sing camp songs.

1850
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,600
And sometimes he would sing the Heart and a Blender song.

1851
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:34,560
And that's where I know it from.

1852
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,920
Also, it's just on the radio.

1853
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,480
OK, whatever.

1854
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:41,160
That guy's that guy's cool on Twitter, but I'm probably not going to ask him

1855
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,560
on the podcast because like, why?

1856
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:49,560
Even though he offered them out next voicemail.

1857
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:50,840
Hold on a question, huh?

1858
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,120
Do you guys do you guys get like?

1859
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:57,800
Is it harder for you to do guest episodes like mentally?

1860
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,560
Like, is it weird?

1861
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,760
Is it uncomfortable?

1862
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:06,160
I mean, I sometimes feel like I might, especially when I don't know

1863
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:09,040
what the guest does as much as Ben does.

1864
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,120
And I'm like, oh, God, what if I?

1865
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,000
Right. What if I make it uncomfortable for them?

1866
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,880
That's the only thing that really goes through my mind.

1867
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,840
Like, I don't want them to feel weirded out.

1868
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,960
That's what actually I was a little nervous because you didn't answer

1869
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,960
when I was like PCP time for a while.

1870
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:30,560
And I was like, I'm nervous to do a solo

1871
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:36,240
Ben cast with two guests because how do I fucking entertain these freaks?

1872
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,840
How do how do I be?

1873
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,680
How do I be engaging when I'm outnumbered?

1874
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,640
And the only way out of that situation was to take the Twitter out.

1875
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:46,800
That's it was a tactical L. Exactly.

1876
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:48,840
Yeah, that's still to get good.

1877
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:50,280
That's exactly this.

1878
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:52,160
This Twitter L.

1879
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:56,240
This is arguably worse than the time that I got drunk

1880
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,920
and kept asking the bartender at the bar and

1881
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,240
where's my phone, where's my phone and made him hate me.

1882
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,280
This is this is almost as embarrassing as that was.

1883
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,840
And and and just like that, I'll never get over it.

1884
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,360
And it will haunt me for the rest of my life.

1885
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:18,920
Next voicemail is called Never Stood a Chance.

1886
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,560
Three, two, one, go.

1887
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,280
And now it may be a little bit late here, but.

1888
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,320
That anime snob bros.

1889
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,720
We fucking won.

1890
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,520
Did you, bro, is dead?

1891
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,120
Anime snob wins.

1892
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:38,640
I was rooting for that anime snob the whole time.

1893
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:41,440
You know, it was it was such an underdog first

1894
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,200
people that commented on our video.

1895
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,720
Yeah, I was just about to say that.

1896
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,320
Wait, what?

1897
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:48,040
The first recognized YouTuber or any

1898
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:49,720
tuber to comment on our channel.

1899
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:50,680
And he he was out.

1900
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,360
He was out for us.

1901
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,440
He did not like the video.

1902
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:55,640
Wait, which which which video?

1903
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,960
It was God, I don't remember.

1904
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,160
It was a Code Geass video.

1905
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:03,000
Was he the one that called us a fascist?

1906
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,360
No, no.

1907
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,200
No, no, that was someone else on the same video.

1908
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,480
Although, I guess I guess if you're defending,

1909
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,160
if you're if you're like if you're pro,

1910
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:16,040
if you're pro, if you're pro gay, I could see why.

1911
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,720
Maybe you're like, that's a little fasc, right?

1912
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,120
Because it's kind of a fast show, right?

1913
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:24,160
Like the protagonist is kind of like I haven't actually seen it.

1914
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,320
I don't I only know by reputation.

1915
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,960
I'm not going to call it a fascist.

1916
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:31,440
That's that's obviously that's harsh language.

1917
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,600
But it deals with that.

1918
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,840
It deals with like an authoritarian government or whatever.

1919
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,840
Right. It's it's like imperial for sure. Yeah.

1920
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:40,080
Yeah. I mean, if you think about it like really,

1921
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,480
I mean, all the chosen one shows, they're all fasc.

1922
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,920
I mean, I'm just hotter.

1923
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,960
I'm just I was really funny.

1924
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:48,400
No, it would be really funny if he called you a fascist,

1925
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,880
if you made like a Dragon Ball Z show or something.

1926
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,200
But when it's when it's like a show

1927
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,000
that's specifically about politics,

1928
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,320
it's like, OK, I get why it would come up.

1929
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1930
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,920
If he called me a fascist on my Dragon Ball Super video,

1931
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,880
that would take personally.

1932
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:04,840
Yeah, yeah.

1933
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:09,080
The the Kaiser or I don't know, colonists or something.

1934
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,680
I don't know.

1935
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:11,960
I always thought that is a great honor.

1936
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,440
And I think anime snob every day for blessing us

1937
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,680
with his fucking dumb, useless comment.

1938
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:20,440
We we after that, we really started seeing the algorithm.

1939
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:23,520
We stand that anime snob.

1940
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,280
And his he's Greek, right?

1941
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:28,000
He's Greek.

1942
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,080
I think he's weird Greek accent.

1943
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,320
And his and his and I don't know.

1944
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:35,240
That guy's that guy's funny.

1945
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,920
Is he is he doing good?

1946
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,440
Is his channel is his channel blown up?

1947
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,760
Is it? No. No. OK.

1948
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,720
I mean, I don't know.

1949
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,800
But the answer is no.

1950
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,120
I mean, I was guaranteed.

1951
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,400
I thought so. All right.

1952
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,080
Sabotrave. OK.

1953
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,920
Next voicemail.

1954
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,600
Oh, I uploaded these out of order.

1955
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,920
Why did why did I do that?

1956
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:58,040
The next voicemail is called.

1957
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,840
Wait, I think that one was actually called

1958
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:06,160
Never Stood a Chance and this one is called The Prophecy is True.

1959
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:08,200
Whoops. Three, two, one, go.

1960
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,600
Women who would give attention,

1961
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:13,400
bitchy attention to certain guys doesn't make sense.

1962
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,720
So my fantasy of a bitch would be one who somehow needs some skill that I have.

1963
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,320
She like hates the world, but she has to make YouTube videos

1964
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,200
proclaiming it and she needs someone to edit them.

1965
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,880
And so, you know, like, and she can only pick you who she hates.

1966
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,720
And are you saying that if Digi was a girl, he'd be your waifu?

1967
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,520
Yeah.

1968
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,040
Unbelievable. OK.

1969
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,520
That's that's a little second for me to realize it was a clip.

1970
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,720
I thought DeVoo had sent in a voice.

1971
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:45,760
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

1972
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,000
That's a good clip. Wow.

1973
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,680
Yeah, what a pull. Wow.

1974
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,320
You went deep for that one.

1975
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:58,360
I don't think I can say anything that would add.

1976
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:01,280
I'm just just let it I'll just let it stand on its own.

1977
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:03,000
Voice Grail.

1978
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,360
It's just a clip from the PCP.

1979
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,960
So, yeah, yeah, Voice Grail.

1980
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,280
We'll put DeVoo in Voice Grail, Lamal.

1981
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:11,320
Well, yeah, we'll put it.

1982
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:14,160
Yeah, we'll put all of ourselves because, yeah, it's a group.

1983
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,560
Grail default.

1984
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,720
Next voicemail is called

1985
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:23,960
Henlo Corgo to and there it is.

1986
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,600
Three, two, one, go.

1987
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,120
Hello, everyone.

1988
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:36,400
And by everyone, I mean boring, probably give and maybe Tom.

1989
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:41,080
So I see a lot of people on the PCP Reddit

1990
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:43,960
and on your guys discord channels.

1991
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,200
There's not a lot of people there.

1992
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:49,040
Like asking to be made members of the PCP

1993
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,200
and asking you to hold open auditions.

1994
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,680
I don't think that happens.

1995
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,760
That's never going to happen

1996
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,800
because they're not showing enough initiative.

1997
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:01,960
I officially declare myself the manager.

1998
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,600
Producer, host, call yourself the producer,

1999
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,520
the sole founder of the PCP.

2000
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,160
So I found I did it.

2001
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,480
It's my show.

2002
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,720
Well, you're the boss.

2003
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,720
No one else.

2004
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,600
I'll be in charge of screening voicemails from now on.

2005
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,440
And I'll see you guys next week for the recording.

2006
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,760
You should have said you're all well.

2007
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:23,960
You have a PCP.

2008
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:26,880
The idea of a PCP tryout is hilarious to me.

2009
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,960
Like what even is what the fuck is a podcast?

2010
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,240
He he doesn't understand now that he's our boss.

2011
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:33,160
He needs us.

2012
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,640
You know, we have the power.

2013
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:35,520
We can strike.

2014
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,720
We can strike and bankrupt him.

2015
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:41,040
The thing is now that he's the soul, he's the owner of the PCP.

2016
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,360
But the PCP has jokes on you.

2017
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,680
We're losing money.

2018
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,200
It's a it's a white elephant.

2019
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,400
We're an albatross around your neck.

2020
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,520
All our debts are now your debts.

2021
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,040
You're fine.

2022
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,440
The stock is plummeting.

2023
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,640
Elon Tweet is ruining the PCP.

2024
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,840
Elon, no, he declares himself boss.

2025
01:57:58,840 --> 01:57:59,960
He declares himself.

2026
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:04,560
He declares himself boss of the PCP only for Elon to see the epic L

2027
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,400
that Ben St. just took on Twitter and say, man, the PCP is so cringe

2028
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,640
and our fucking stock price plummet.

2029
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:15,360
Thanks, Elon.

2030
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:20,080
Next voicemail is called

2031
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,920
where is it? Not an incel.

2032
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,600
OK. There we go.

2033
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,880
No, wait, it's uploading.

2034
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,120
There we go.

2035
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,040
There it is. OK. Not an incel.

2036
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,880
Three, two, one, go.

2037
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:36,520
Considering these facts, am I still an incel?

2038
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,920
Yes, opinion doesn't matter.

2039
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,400
I am a sociable person who in no way has problems talking to women.

2040
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:47,000
I do not hate three DPD women and only like two D girls

2041
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,280
who lack the agency to question my masculinity and hurt my feefies.

2042
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,440
I have had sex multiple times.

2043
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,040
These are spliced together.

2044
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:58,760
Recently, yeah, I have aspirations to do so again.

2045
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,880
As a matter of fact, I have a girlfriend.

2046
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,520
This is Kiwi Founds Hero.

2047
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:05,760
I am not a fat neck.

2048
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,000
Straight as a board.

2049
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,040
We'll never go trans exercise and practice decent hygiene.

2050
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:16,960
I do not feel entitled for any games to be made to my or anyone else's tastes.

2051
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:20,320
I only ask that I be able to voice my opinion.

2052
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:24,000
I support myself financially and do not leech off my parents.

2053
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,400
I forget the context of this.

2054
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:28,560
I am not angry at the world for any perceived injustices.

2055
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:30,360
I think it's about people asking for peace.

2056
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:33,000
It's about Tifa's boobs. It's the video about Tifa's boobs.

2057
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,160
By all these metrics, I'm pretty sure I'm not a total loser.

2058
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:40,560
And yet I don't make a difference.

2059
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,680
I said we're making this argument.

2060
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:46,720
I am an incel in many people's eyes.

2061
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,960
And no one else is saying it will change anything.

2062
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,040
Well, I'm not asking anyone to agree with me.

2063
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,240
And I feel that I understand the other side's point.

2064
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,840
I simply think it would be.

2065
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:59,040
That sucks.

2066
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:03,760
One of my favorite things about Nate is how like it's the funniest things.

2067
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:07,960
He gets so weird on like tight definitions of like abstract concepts.

2068
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:09,560
There was one episode.

2069
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:13,040
There was one episode where he was like arguing like on a scale of how how

2070
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,800
cucked are you if your girlfriend uploads a bikini picture?

2071
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:19,400
How?

2072
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,520
Wait, was that that is the sort of philosophical discourse that I'm interested in?

2073
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:28,720
Was that a PCP or was that in a I think it was a PCP.

2074
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,960
I think it was a PCP.

2075
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,720
Oh, no, I do remember that.

2076
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:35,480
I do remember that.

2077
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:37,760
It's all about consent. It's all about consent.

2078
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:42,240
OK, well, but cucks consent, cucks and.

2079
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,920
Oh, yeah, no, you're oh, no, yeah, you're right.

2080
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:46,600
Oh, shit. No, you're right.

2081
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:49,440
Fuck. OK, never mind, never mind.

2082
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:54,840
I don't like I don't like this voicemail because it wasn't like clipped to make a point.

2083
02:00:54,880 --> 02:01:02,480
It was just like a minute and 20 seconds of Nate saying some kind of maybe cringy, funny stuff.

2084
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:07,560
Am I crazy or was it edited to like be a little it seemed like I don't know the context.

2085
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:09,680
Why did it just cut off at the end?

2086
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:12,680
I think seemingly in the middle of a word, because he's still going.

2087
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,880
I think it was just like one of those videos.

2088
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,240
It was it was from the teeth.

2089
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:21,400
It was from the video.

2090
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,880
It was from the video where he complains about Tifa's boobs being shrunk.

2091
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,320
Bad, bad video, by the way, bad video that I don't agree with.

2092
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:32,920
But I'm not sure if it was spliced together.

2093
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,920
I'm I'm left I'm left struggling.

2094
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,560
I'm left grasping for some like what was the point?

2095
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,200
Like what was like the punchline?

2096
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,760
What was the what message was intended to be conveyed here?

2097
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,240
I don't know. Do better.

2098
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,640
No, I like it. Good job.

2099
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,920
You did well.

2100
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:50,720
That has the Cato seal of approval.

2101
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,640
Oh, my God. Good voicemail.

2102
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:55,240
Well, got what? Wow. Wow.

2103
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:56,880
Your standards are really low.

2104
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,280
I'll bet your anthology is going to suck at.

2105
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,440
This is your taste in voicemails.

2106
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:05,240
I can only imagine.

2107
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,080
Yada, yada.

2108
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,480
Next voicemail is called.

2109
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:14,240
I can't read it.

2110
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:15,440
It's like a square.

2111
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,240
It's like the character is not just it's an emoji or something.

2112
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,480
Three, two, one, go.

2113
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:24,680
Guys, I haven't watched in a year and I don't know what's going on.

2114
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,680
Can somebody tell me what's going on?

2115
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,560
I know it's too.

2116
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,640
Can somebody walk me through step by step?

2117
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:33,040
Everything that's happened on the PCV last year.

2118
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:34,440
It's too complicated.

2119
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,160
Guys, I'm a big doodoo baby.

2120
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,960
Hey, can somebody tell me guys?

2121
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,040
You will never know.

2122
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,280
You will never know.

2123
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,640
You will be you will wander in darkness.

2124
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:47,000
Well, I do think people like that are funny and to be made fun of.

2125
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,440
Have you guys ever considered doing a state of the PCP type thing?

2126
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,160
Well, what would be the point?

2127
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:56,560
I mean, I think all of the things are in the episodes.

2128
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:58,320
Yeah, yeah.

2129
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,520
But I mean, that's a lot to that's a lot to watch.

2130
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,160
Just watch every episode. You'll get it.

2131
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,160
Yeah, just watch all episodes.

2132
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,400
Subscribe to what you know, it's not it's not a terrible.

2133
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,560
It's actually not a terrible idea.

2134
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:14,560
Hmm. The biggest thing I would say is I mean, a lot of the stuff seems obvious.

2135
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,400
Stuff I've like inferred.

2136
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,720
But, you know, it seems like for a long time, the PCP had a very specific

2137
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:25,520
like end goal of being this, you know, the PCV HQ and all that stuff,

2138
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,880
mostly being spearheaded by Nate and Tricks and whatnot.

2139
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:31,000
So I think with that seemingly not in the picture anymore,

2140
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:33,640
just an idea of like, what is this channel?

2141
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:34,480
And like, what is it?

2142
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,600
Is it just podcasts are now on?

2143
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,320
Is there any plans for it to be something else?

2144
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,120
I thought I think would be interesting, even if the answer is no.

2145
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,320
I, you know, you make a good point.

2146
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,720
I guess my only thing about that is that I'm not really I feel like

2147
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,840
I don't know what the plan is, like, like the plan in the interim

2148
02:03:54,840 --> 02:04:00,120
is just keep making the show with, you know, the couple people that still show up,

2149
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,720
which is fine.

2150
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:05,040
Yeah, I feel like, you know, on the one hand,

2151
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:08,360
yeah, like we could explain what's going on because a lot has happened.

2152
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:12,840
But on the other hand, like who, I don't know, do a lot of people,

2153
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,480
like is there a lot to even explain?

2154
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,240
Like, is it really do people need an explanation?

2155
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:23,280
I think I'm people like, and I've noticed this among a lot of creators,

2156
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:27,760
is that they do not consider how much people like inside baseball talk.

2157
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:33,200
I think audiences love behind the scenes, like not even like necessarily juicy drama,

2158
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:38,360
just like, hey, you know, this is the stats behind our latest videos.

2159
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:40,840
And that's why we're doing this or, you know, et cetera.

2160
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:45,880
If people knew that I was editing videos on a titty mousepad, they would lose their minds.

2161
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,200
It's true.

2162
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:53,400
I mean, I'm kind of the same as Ben.

2163
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:56,080
I don't exactly know what the future holds.

2164
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:59,880
I'm mostly just thinking of my own projects and then just I'll be on the PCP.

2165
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,880
Why not?

2166
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:05,480
It's it's not really like a like to make a declarative statement.

2167
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:08,880
Like, yes, the future is cold, dead and empty.

2168
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:10,880
There is no future for the PCP.

2169
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,640
We're just going to do a podcast now.

2170
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:15,720
I feel like, I don't know.

2171
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:19,920
People already inferred from the gravestones that we have.

2172
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:23,280
Here's a question I have that I'm sure a lot of people probably have,

2173
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:26,280
which is that, like, is there any future with radcons?

2174
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:27,800
Like, is there ever going to be a radcon?

2175
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:31,560
I think so. I think I think radcon could happen.

2176
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:35,240
I don't know who I would I feel like it's it could, too.

2177
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,560
Yeah. I mean, there would be no Trixie.

2178
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:41,880
I feel like probably no Jesse, probably no Munchie.

2179
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:47,080
But other than that, I mean, me, you, Tom, Nate.

2180
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,640
Shit, is there anyone else?

2181
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:51,680
Am I forgetting anyone?

2182
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,960
There wouldn't be any DeVoo or Mage, but they never came.

2183
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,440
Well, to one.

2184
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,440
Yeah, true.

2185
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,440
So.

2186
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,280
I don't know. Yeah, I feel like, yes, I feel like, yeah,

2187
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,360
there could be another radcon and there probably will be.

2188
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,280
And it'll be different from the other ones.

2189
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:14,080
But, you know, honestly,

2190
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,840
personally, I know Ben probably wouldn't want Trixie back.

2191
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:22,000
But like, absolutely not.

2192
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,520
After after an apology, I could I could see it happening,

2193
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,040
but probably not for a while.

2194
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:32,280
Oh, if if if we got an apology and I thought it was sincere,

2195
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,920
I would consider it, but we will never get one.

2196
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:39,680
So as far as I'm concerned, that's not an option worth considering.

2197
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:45,560
If that happens, yeah, OK, that's reasonable.

2198
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,520
But no, but let's let no.

2199
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:53,600
I guess next voicemail.

2200
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:58,160
We there put it there.

2201
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:03,080
Pirate leg Pete. OK.

2202
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,320
Three, two, one, go.

2203
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:07,880
You are me hard days.

2204
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,840
This be pirate leg Pete, and I am not a pirate.

2205
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:14,760
But me leggings on me legs.

2206
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:18,200
Many a journey across the seven open seas.

2207
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:23,480
We have spent countless hours listening to your landlub and podcast.

2208
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:29,840
And in that time, but one thing has become clear to old Pete and his pirate leg.

2209
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:35,040
And that is that Nate has the most succulent of boy.

2210
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,360
Yeah, another one of these.

2211
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:38,160
You're hard.

2212
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:41,560
We be the crew of Nate fuckers.

2213
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:45,400
And we will take his back for the lead.

2214
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:49,280
We will dig into it like so many very treasured.

2215
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:53,760
Also, fucky Ben St.

2216
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:56,280
Return the pirate's girl.

2217
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:57,280
God.

2218
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,520
Crossing the street.

2219
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:03,600
I keep I keep finding out about all these new scrolls I have.

2220
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:06,160
And it's just exciting every day.

2221
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,400
They messed up. They should have said pirate booty.

2222
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:13,040
My collection is growing apparently.

2223
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:14,720
Pirate booty. Yeah.

2224
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:19,760
No, no, I mean, like in relation to the the Nate fucking, they didn't say booty.

2225
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:26,520
This is a Nate fucker and a scroll hunter.

2226
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:31,480
And there's a lot going on in a scroll.

2227
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:33,400
There's potential there needs to be cleaned up.

2228
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:36,040
It should be a map instead of a scroll.

2229
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,240
Not after taking that L after taking that L.

2230
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:41,640
I just don't have room in my heart for this for this right now.

2231
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:43,120
We got to move on.

2232
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:47,440
Next voicemail is called a fuck.

2233
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:49,640
What's it called?

2234
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:53,120
SF2 is based again, not that one.

2235
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:56,320
OK, three, two, one is correct.

2236
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:00,120
As SF2 Street Fighter two.

2237
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:03,880
Yeah, three, two, one, go.

2238
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:09,480
It was Saga Frontier to Saga Frontier to pay attention.

2239
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:13,240
Ben, OK, also try not to get softlocked at the egg fight.

2240
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,600
OK, when they said Street Fighter two, not that one.

2241
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,600
I thought or rather SF2, not that one.

2242
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:22,480
I thought it was just a joke about how many Street Fighter twos there are.

2243
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:26,200
No, this was I don't know if you listen to the last episode,

2244
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:31,480
but no, there was some guy called into opine about how Saga Frontier is based.

2245
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:33,920
And I think I remember I think I was not impressed.

2246
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:37,640
I think I remember I like looked up and thought it was ugly or something.

2247
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:45,000
Next voicemail is called Horse Throat.

2248
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,440
Nice. I'll put it right there.

2249
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:50,240
There it is. OK, three, two, one, go.

2250
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:54,840
Ben St. Jesus.

2251
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:58,920
I have the files of the growing lecture,

2252
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:04,120
and I want to give you to them if you meet my three demands.

2253
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:09,800
Number one, you must change your name from Ben St.

2254
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,720
to Ben St. to a leaning.

2255
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:17,280
Number two, you must cancel.

2256
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,640
Best guy ever.

2257
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:21,960
This shouldn't be hard to do.

2258
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,960
There are dozens of cancelable moments on this very channel.

2259
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,560
And lastly, number three,

2260
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:34,280
you must invite Si to the podcast.

2261
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,080
That's why, why we should have Si on

2262
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:42,640
and they come upon that number of PCP.

2263
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:46,680
We should have Si on the piece of news in the next 13 days.

2264
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:50,120
I'll just leave the brownie lecture.

2265
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,600
What was the second one?

2266
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:57,080
Cancel date, I think. OK, done.

2267
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:00,200
I was going to I was going to do that anyway.

2268
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:02,800
It was the first one.

2269
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:05,320
Change your name to Ben, something I didn't catch it.

2270
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:08,480
Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't get what you wanted.

2271
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:10,680
Something Saint Ben St.

2272
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:15,480
On a technical note, that guy's voice modular was too deep.

2273
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,000
You got it. Don't do that next time.

2274
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:17,920
It's too hard.

2275
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:20,240
It was a force through.

2276
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:21,320
I'll do two out of three.

2277
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:24,600
I'll I'll do I will cancel name and I will invite Si on the podcast.

2278
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:27,120
So that's take take it or leave it.

2279
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,280
I got I got a I got to update.

2280
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:34,200
I got to do an update on the state of the Twitter L right now.

2281
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,640
I got I got to explain what's going on with it

2282
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,360
because they're a development.

2283
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:41,680
The current state of the Twitter L is, you know, I had to walk it.

2284
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:45,960
I had to walk it back and be like, wow, OK, I guess you did send it.

2285
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:49,920
And and, you know,

2286
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:54,560
Riley has taken a big victory lap retweeting all these all these people.

2287
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:58,560
All these weird Trixie simps that like called me mean

2288
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:02,000
for like saying that she she deleted our content and stuff.

2289
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:07,280
And and Riley, the story is like, haha.

2290
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:11,640
Wait, wait, I'll literally really said because it's very because it's very weird.

2291
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:18,320
He said like Trixie didn't send the the the stuff.

2292
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:23,440
Trixie didn't send the the the the things because you asked her to.

2293
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:27,440
He says that like a fan contacted him

2294
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:31,200
and asked him to get Trixie to send the stuff.

2295
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:33,600
And that's why she did it.

2296
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:37,080
So it's not because I asked and it's not because Gibb asked,

2297
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:39,080
which we again, we were asking for months and months.

2298
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:44,200
It's because someone got Riley to tell Trixie to send it.

2299
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:46,600
And that's what made her send it.

2300
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:48,440
Doesn't it look worse?

2301
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:52,240
Yes, in my opinion, it's very embarrassing.

2302
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:56,600
But but this is this is what Riley is having his fucking victory lap over.

2303
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:00,520
And I. I just I just don't know how to.

2304
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:03,360
I don't know how to respond.

2305
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:06,000
I don't know how to respond to this.

2306
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,680
And so I will not.

2307
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,520
Anyway, that's the state of the L.

2308
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:11,200
Fuck fuck us.

2309
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:13,440
Fuck a state of the PCP video.

2310
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:18,520
We got to make a state of the L every every every day for the rest of the week.

2311
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,920
You say one on the podcast permanent fixture.

2312
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:26,080
State of the L. All right, here's here's the fallout

2313
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:29,880
from that time that I said something wrong on Twitter and got made fun of.

2314
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:35,240
It's like it spawns a whole the whole diaspora

2315
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:38,440
of responses that ripple throughout the time stream.

2316
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,840
Anyway, next voicemail is called.

2317
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,920
I'll post it right here.

2318
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,920
It is called.

2319
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:49,600
That's base joker nine.

2320
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:51,240
So get get ready.

2321
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:53,240
We got some shit coming up.

2322
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:56,200
OK, base joker nine, three, two, one, go.

2323
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:59,360
Yeah, the studio.

2324
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,080
More like.

2325
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:03,040
Yeah, Pudio.

2326
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,200
I mean, not the best one.

2327
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,440
Not the best one.

2328
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:09,240
Not the best one.

2329
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:10,000
There was only one.

2330
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,320
There's only one layer to that one.

2331
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:13,160
Yeah, I know.

2332
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:14,680
I wanted more.

2333
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:20,400
The best base jokers are when there is multiple things

2334
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,840
you could think it could be.

2335
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:27,920
Yeah, the base joker set the bar really high for these puns,

2336
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:32,120
because a lot of them were very clever and like worked in multiple ways.

2337
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,000
This was just normal.

2338
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,720
I feel like the setup on the better ones is a little longer.

2339
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:40,040
You know, it's maybe like an idiom instead of just like a small phrase,

2340
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:42,640
you know, this one was just a little too quick for me.

2341
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:46,720
The the the good ones have like multiple parts, like, you know,

2342
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:51,160
waiting, waiting for the poo to plop is is not just

2343
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:53,960
it's not just that shoe sounds like poo.

2344
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:59,320
It's that it's the two words in the same phrase were like both were both

2345
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:03,560
transformed in a way that worked and and changed the meaning of the

2346
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:06,200
of the phrase to match.

2347
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:12,520
So this is my in-depth dissection of why this shit pun didn't work.

2348
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:18,640
This analysis would have skyrocketed way more than the Winnie the Pooh stuff.

2349
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:21,040
I'm just telling you, that's your new series.

2350
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:25,080
I'll finish that Winnie the Pooh series.

2351
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:28,200
I'll finish I'll finish reviewing season one of Winnie the New Adventures

2352
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:29,520
of Winnie the Pooh one of these days.

2353
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:32,840
Surely someone online is doing poop joke analysis.

2354
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:38,000
Winnie the Pooh, more like Winnie the Diarrhea.

2355
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,920
More like Winnie the Stress Diarrhea from taking an L on Twitter.

2356
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:46,640
Hey, oh, uh, shut up.

2357
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,040
Shut up.

2358
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:49,520
You're all fucking critics.

2359
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:51,560
You.

2360
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:54,880
Have you?

2361
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:56,680
Have you been seeing?

2362
02:15:56,680 --> 02:16:00,200
There's been some things going around on Twitter where someone has been

2363
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:04,760
doing like three Stooges bits, but they're bits about like.

2364
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:11,000
Zoomer phrases like suss, like, hey, hey, hey, Moe, you're looking.

2365
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,320
Hey, Moe, you're looking a little suss.

2366
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:15,040
Suss? What do you mean suss?

2367
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:16,240
What are you knuckleheads talking about?

2368
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:19,360
Hey, yeah, Larry, I think we got ourselves an imposter.

2369
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:25,640
I'm just, I love these and I just wanted to let you know how I feel about them.

2370
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:28,040
OK, thank you for sharing.

2371
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:30,000
You're you're welcome.

2372
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,400
OK, next one is called there it is.

2373
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:41,480
It is called cross aspect ratio preference three to one go.

2374
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:45,880
What aspect ratio do you think looks the best in why one?

2375
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:50,880
I think I like one.

2376
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:55,360
Not one, one, just one.

2377
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:57,600
Like it. There is no second dimension.

2378
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:03,760
I think I think I like I think I like the old CRT three to four.

2379
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:08,160
Like widescreen is fine.

2380
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:13,160
There came a point in my life when I realized that like old three to four

2381
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:16,680
ratio had been like completely supplanted by widescreen.

2382
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:21,760
And I was like, huh, OK, but why?

2383
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,360
I I don't I don't really prefer it.

2384
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:29,160
I don't really know why it seems to have become the dominant thing.

2385
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:31,360
Like whatever, I don't hate it, but I don't get it.

2386
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:33,520
I think three by four is good.

2387
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:37,480
I'm a bit of a zoomer, so 16 by nine is is pretty comfortable for me.

2388
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:41,840
There was a great video by Captain Disillusion about aspect ratio

2389
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:49,840
and it goes into how it works, but also what what works in widescreen

2390
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:53,760
and four by three and like for what purpose and, you know, with phones now.

2391
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:56,880
It's like two to one, but like vertically.

2392
02:17:56,880 --> 02:18:00,920
And it's like there's lots of different things

2393
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:05,440
because like human beings, we see things

2394
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,720
because the land is like pretty horizontal.

2395
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:12,880
You go outside and outside shots work well in widescreen,

2396
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,440
but more personal shots work well in four by three

2397
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:19,160
because you need you don't need to see

2398
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:22,480
so much of a person to the side of them.

2399
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:25,200
A person is like vertical.

2400
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:26,120
There's a good.

2401
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:29,560
Yeah, I'm just just, you know, is this pros and cons to both?

2402
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,800
I don't really know what I prefer.

2403
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:38,280
I, I, I, I, you know, maybe it's just because I grew up with three, three to four.

2404
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,200
Maybe maybe I'm just nostalgic.

2405
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:42,840
I don't know. I don't think. Yeah.

2406
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:49,120
I do wonder if the next generation of people

2407
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:53,440
will have a wildly different preferred aspect ratio because, like you said,

2408
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:56,520
you grew up on one thing, I grew up on 16 by nine.

2409
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:59,640
And then weird thing now is, you know,

2410
02:18:59,640 --> 02:19:01,960
so many people are just not only watching stuff on their phone,

2411
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:06,640
but like webtoons whole platform is like scrolling vertically.

2412
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:10,200
And yeah, I can't get used to reading comments like that.

2413
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:13,800
I like the pages that you turn.

2414
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:20,080
The scrolling is the scrolling is because it's what's the word?

2415
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:23,840
Like it's it does that because it's on a phone, right?

2416
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:28,200
Like scrolling webtoons is like it's a format designed to be read on a phone.

2417
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,400
I mean, I don't see why the aspect ratio would need to change,

2418
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:35,240
but like it did once.

2419
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,840
So I guess it could change again.

2420
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:41,040
I don't know. Maybe.

2421
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:44,040
I mean, what do you what do you think it would get longer?

2422
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:46,560
Yeah, I guess I it's weird to think about,

2423
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:49,160
but I guess you would probably say the same thing 20 years ago.

2424
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,640
Yeah, I don't. Yeah, I don't really see why it needed to get longer.

2425
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:57,760
But it did. And I don't know, whatever.

2426
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,560
It'll morph to whatever the viewer base is watching things on.

2427
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:06,720
Since phones are like thin, they can hold them horizontally

2428
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:10,160
or they can hold them vertically, which is much more comfortable in the hand.

2429
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:18,200
And so like tiktoks and vines and other mobile app videos are all tall.

2430
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,560
So would it be fair to say that like the

2431
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:26,680
the shape of the shape of like our media has changed

2432
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:30,760
literally just because a phone needs to be a certain length

2433
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:33,960
to reach from your ear to your mouth.

2434
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:35,800
So you're interesting.

2435
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:38,440
Yeah. So it's like that's why it's long.

2436
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:40,280
Like that's why the screen is elongated.

2437
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:42,560
Yeah, it can't just be a square.

2438
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:47,360
Yeah, ergonomically, it's also like you could have a square phone,

2439
02:20:47,360 --> 02:20:49,760
but it would be weird to hold in your hand.

2440
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:50,880
Yeah, that's that's what I mean.

2441
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:53,800
It's easier to hold it the long way with your fingers.

2442
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:55,560
And so it stretches from your ear.

2443
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:58,040
Yeah, like imagine if your phone were just a big square,

2444
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:02,400
you just have your whole like hand around the square and it's like a handle

2445
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:07,280
on the back of it so you can lift it up to your face like an iron.

2446
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:09,480
You hold it like an iron.

2447
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:13,520
Yeah, like you're branding yourself with a maybe, I don't know.

2448
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:17,240
I mean, I guess maybe if it were square,

2449
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:20,000
you could have like you could hold it diagonally.

2450
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,680
So like the speaker is on like one corner and like the mouth,

2451
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:27,920
the receiver is on the other corner and you kind of hold it diagonally

2452
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:31,240
between your ear and your that sounds so that I could imagine

2453
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,920
that would be annoying to hold with a with a human hand.

2454
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,280
Maybe aliens would have different aspect ratios.

2455
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:39,960
And I guess you would have to you could have like your one finger

2456
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:43,040
on top of the one side and then your pinky on the other side

2457
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,760
and your thumb on the other you could have.

2458
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,560
Yeah, that's awkward.

2459
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:48,960
I think about what a duck like aspect ratio would be

2460
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:51,040
because they have eyes on the side of their head.

2461
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:56,080
A screen would need to be like a semicircle or like I don't think this one.

2462
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:59,360
Go ahead.

2463
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:01,480
Oh, no, I was done.

2464
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:03,760
A duck wouldn't have to make a phone call.

2465
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:06,720
Who knows?

2466
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:10,680
I don't think this will happen, but there is at least a small possibility

2467
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:14,560
that aspect ratio will change because of VR,

2468
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:19,120
in which case you're being like transplanted into the media of choice

2469
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,920
in which in like there is no screen.

2470
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:26,600
I mean, VR is never going to supplant

2471
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:30,080
just, you know, traditional screen media.

2472
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:34,200
I find myself agreeing, but I do.

2473
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:37,400
I mean, predicting the future is pretty hard.

2474
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:38,960
I guess so.

2475
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:41,680
I mean, that would just mean that like the normal

2476
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:44,920
if that if that became the norm, then like normal screen

2477
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:48,520
resolution would be, I don't know what the fucking

2478
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:51,720
it'd be like goggle, goggle shape or whatever.

2479
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:53,960
Right. I don't know.

2480
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:55,960
I don't see it happening.

2481
02:22:56,840 --> 02:22:58,760
But maybe.

2482
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:01,600
Yeah, that's not even like.

2483
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:05,160
Honestly, I don't know enough about how VR works to even talk about it.

2484
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:08,440
So let's go to the next voicemail.

2485
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:10,040
And it is called OK.

2486
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:15,000
The next one is called Gibbs centralism three to one go.

2487
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:17,800
Gibbs, the Middle East would be had you for being trans.

2488
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:21,120
Why do you defend people who are more neo-Nazis and the neo-Nazis are?

2489
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:25,600
I defend people who get blown up for no reason.

2490
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:28,560
That's that's a pretty.

2491
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:31,360
Yeah, pretty obvious decision to come to.

2492
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,880
I.

2493
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:36,200
I understand this point.

2494
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:40,560
Because like, I know Hamas is a like fundamentalists.

2495
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:42,760
Or I mean, I've heard.

2496
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,160
I don't really know anything.

2497
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:48,320
But I've heard that Hamas is a fundamentalist Islamic organization.

2498
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:49,720
Yes, a terrorist organization.

2499
02:23:49,720 --> 02:23:52,840
But it is not representative of the children that are being killed.

2500
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:55,240
You know, like Palestinians are not Hamas.

2501
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:57,600
So Palestinians are not Hamas.

2502
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:58,880
OK, you know what?

2503
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:00,160
I guess that's not really the point.

2504
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:04,080
Maybe the culture in fucking Gaza or whatever, maybe they are, you know,

2505
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:08,600
very Islamic, very traditional, kill gay people, kill trans people.

2506
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,240
I mean, that could be the case.

2507
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:12,080
That could be the case.

2508
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:15,680
But it's still not it's still not a case for like genociding them, right?

2509
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:19,640
Like the the the extrapolation from when you make this argument,

2510
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:22,800
is is the end result like, oh, like, therefore,

2511
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:27,800
because these people are homophobic, because these people are regressive,

2512
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:30,320
we should just kill and displace them.

2513
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,320
Is is that the argument?

2514
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:34,360
Yeah, would you advocate for that?

2515
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:36,040
I don't agree with that or anywhere else.

2516
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:38,760
Like I wouldn't write a little extreme.

2517
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:43,920
Should we should we fucking bomb people that are like that here in America?

2518
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:47,480
These are some things you might want to ask yourself,

2519
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:50,920
because we have that here, too.

2520
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:53,160
Next voicemail is called.

2521
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:56,200
Oh, wait, there's a there's an imager link.

2522
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:58,640
So I guess I will I will link that here.

2523
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:05,520
Images found for ClusterPunkHell Department of Machine Verification

2524
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:13,680
Appointment 99th May 7 20 7 2 0 22.

2525
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,680
Oh, there's like a whole bunch.

2526
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:19,280
OK, well, it's two images.

2527
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,520
I guess we'll show this on screen.

2528
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:26,760
There's a like a DMV schedule and a DMV card with a number.

2529
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,920
24096 tough luck kid PA system says,

2530
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:33,480
please refrain from starting revolutions while our staff

2531
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:36,480
sort through the punch card record for your nanomachines.

2532
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:39,720
Followed by a cyborg.

2533
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:46,280
This is this is Error Array, who is the the the the voice modulator

2534
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:50,000
poem person, the the the submarine.

2535
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,400
What was their name for that stuff?

2536
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:52,960
I don't even remember what it was called.

2537
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:55,880
I don't even know how to how to refer to it, but hopefully you know what I mean.

2538
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,280
This is this all started with the bear, right?

2539
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:01,280
This all started for the bear for the bear, right?

2540
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,280
And there's and there's Error Array and there's the bear.

2541
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:08,280
OK, OK, context achieved voicemail.

2542
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:11,800
Let us listen three, two, one, go.

2543
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:20,400
There's so it guzzling bottom feeders over at the DMV.

2544
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:30,040
They've confiscated our submarine, which means dealing with bureaucracy.

2545
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:41,400
Who wants to stand in line and waste away when the office only opens three of seven days.

2546
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:54,400
If you could end bureaucracy, which agencies do we close immediately?

2547
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:59,400
This is so weird.

2548
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:02,400
I don't think I know this guy.

2549
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:10,400
I really like the imagery of a person standing in the DMV and then singing like this about how annoying it is.

2550
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:17,400
And then at the end, they down on like a down like like the the Phantom of the Opera like on their pipe on the pipe organ.

2551
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:19,400
That just happens to be sitting there.

2552
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:24,400
Which which agencies do I close if I'm ending bureaucracy?

2553
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:28,400
Oh, my God.

2554
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:30,400
Where do you even begin?

2555
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,400
Ice.

2556
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,400
Done.

2557
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:45,400
The the the the one where they the one where they do the Pentagon.

2558
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:51,400
Yeah, the Pentagon, the CIA, just for starters.

2559
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:53,400
I don't know.

2560
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:54,400
I don't know.

2561
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:55,400
It's hard.

2562
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:56,400
It's complicated.

2563
02:27:56,400 --> 02:28:01,400
The DMV, despite being a nightmare, does serve a valuable function.

2564
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,400
I wouldn't close it.

2565
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:04,400
I would probably streamline it.

2566
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:06,400
Sorry for the boring answer.

2567
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:11,400
God, next voicemail is called.

2568
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:13,400
How many more do we have?

2569
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:16,400
We have like literally three more.

2570
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:17,400
All right.

2571
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:19,400
I know there's so few.

2572
02:28:19,400 --> 02:28:20,400
So few this week.

2573
02:28:20,400 --> 02:28:23,400
This is just a paltry.

2574
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:30,400
This one is called hashtag when Sonichu three two one go.

2575
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:35,400
You know, Ben, if you really want to stick it to Trixie, there's no bigger power move

2576
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:37,400
than releasing Sonichu one or two.

2577
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:40,400
You know why I'm not going to do that.

2578
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:42,400
You know I have a plan for it.

2579
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:44,400
You know this.

2580
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,400
You know this.

2581
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:49,400
How would that even stick it to Trixie?

2582
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:52,400
I guess because like, oh, I released my lecture and you didn't release your lecture.

2583
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:53,400
I don't care about that.

2584
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:54,400
She's not going to do it.

2585
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,400
Whatever.

2586
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:56,400
I'm over that.

2587
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,400
You know, I'm not going to.

2588
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:01,400
I'm not going to release the Sonichu lecture until funded punishment is done.

2589
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:03,400
This is well established lore.

2590
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:05,400
I'm sorry.

2591
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:08,400
I apologize.

2592
02:29:08,400 --> 02:29:13,400
Next voicemail is called.

2593
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:16,400
Pfizer gang, Pfizer gang.

2594
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:18,400
One percenters, baby.

2595
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:21,400
Three, two, one go.

2596
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:24,400
Ayo, vaccinated gang.

2597
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,400
Ayo, second shot gang.

2598
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:28,400
Pfizer gang.

2599
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:31,400
We talked about this already.

2600
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:34,400
We already we already covered this, but good question.

2601
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,400
Pfizer for life.

2602
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:39,400
Pfizer is like Ravenclaw.

2603
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:43,400
AstraZeneca is like Slytherin.

2604
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:48,400
Moderna is the Gryffindor and Johnson and Johnson is like awful.

2605
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:49,400
Fuck you.

2606
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:52,400
Fuck you.

2607
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:53,400
You're.

2608
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:55,400
You know, it's an underrated house.

2609
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:56,400
All right.

2610
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:57,400
It's an underrated house.

2611
02:29:57,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Helga Hufflepuff just wanted to teach all kids equal.

2612
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:04,400
Honestly, honestly, Hufflepuff is the best house because it's not stupid.

2613
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:05,400
All the.

2614
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:06,400
Oh my God.

2615
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:08,400
You got me unironically Harry Pottering right now.

2616
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:13,400
But Hufflepuff philosophy was just like, we'll teach anyone, anyone that wants to learn

2617
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:15,400
can be a student and that's fucking based.

2618
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:20,400
Ravenclaw is the only other one that's even like justifiable because it's like we only

2619
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:21,400
want smart kids.

2620
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:26,400
We only want like the really like best students and like, okay, I get that.

2621
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:27,400
Helga Hufflepuff.

2622
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:28,400
I'll teach anyone based.

2623
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:29,400
Slytherin.

2624
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:30,400
White people.

2625
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,400
I mean, wizards only.

2626
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:33,400
It's like, hmm, okay.

2627
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:35,400
Not a fan of that one.

2628
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:40,400
And then, uh, uh, Gryffindor, uh, only if you're brave.

2629
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,400
It's like.

2630
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:44,400
Especially like Chad's like fraternity.

2631
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:45,400
Yeah.

2632
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:49,400
You need a big enough chin to be in Gryffindor.

2633
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,400
It's literally, Gryffindor is literally the Chad house.

2634
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:55,400
Like the frat, the frat one for the, for the jocks.

2635
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:56,400
I just don't think.

2636
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:57,400
Harry Potter is a juke.

2637
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:59,400
Harry Potter is literally a juke.

2638
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:00,400
It's canon.

2639
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:02,400
Well, I mean, he is a cop by the end of the series.

2640
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,400
And he also becomes a cop.

2641
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,400
But I mean, no, he's like a star athlete.

2642
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:11,400
He's the fucking, he's the fucking star player on the fucking wizard football team.

2643
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:12,400
Wizard football.

2644
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:13,400
Yeah.

2645
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:15,400
I think that's, I think that's what they call it.

2646
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:20,400
The problem is, I don't think there's a single, a single interesting character in Hufflepuff.

2647
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,400
I don't think she put one.

2648
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:23,400
No.

2649
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:26,400
Well, that was, there was a Robin Pattinson guy.

2650
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:27,400
Was it Cedric Diggory?

2651
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:28,400
Cedric Diggory.

2652
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:29,400
He's not that interesting.

2653
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:30,400
No.

2654
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:31,400
He's just like, he's.

2655
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:32,400
He's like.

2656
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:33,400
Everyone likes him and he's cool.

2657
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:36,400
And that's like his one thing, but he's not interesting.

2658
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:37,400
Um, yeah.

2659
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:38,400
I mean, that's true.

2660
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:39,400
That's true.

2661
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:41,400
Uh, oh fuck.

2662
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:44,400
I was going to say, I was going to say something.

2663
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:46,400
No, it's gone.

2664
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:48,400
It's gone and they'll never come back.

2665
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,400
Something about wizard football.

2666
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:51,400
Oh no.

2667
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:52,400
Um, that's the.

2668
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:53,400
I don't know.

2669
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:58,400
Something, something about how Harry Potter and, uh, legend of the, no, no, no, not legend

2670
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:05,400
of the 10, no, no masters secret in the basement by Oolulilia, both and with the protagonists

2671
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:09,400
using their new magic powers to become the ultimate cop.

2672
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:13,400
Uh, they have the same ending.

2673
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:15,400
All cops are based.

2674
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:18,400
All cops are based and all cops are wizards.

2675
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:23,400
All cops are fight our spellcasters is the, is the, is the lesson here.

2676
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:27,400
I think the next one is this might be the last one.

2677
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:29,400
Uh, this one is called.

2678
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:30,400
Uploading it.

2679
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:33,400
Bitcoin will never be a real currency.

2680
02:32:33,400 --> 02:32:36,400
Uh, three, two, one go.

2681
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:41,400
So I had to break it to anybody's still holding out on this, but Bitcoin's never going to be

2682
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:48,400
a real currency that you can widely use for like goods and services and shit because it's

2683
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:54,400
baked into it that the value of it is volatile because there's a hard cap on the amount of

2684
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:55,400
it that can ever exist.

2685
02:32:55,400 --> 02:33:01,400
So anytime demand for Bitcoin increases because you're trying to spend it on stuff, the value

2686
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:06,400
automatically goes up and there's no way to counterbalance it by increasing the supply,

2687
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:12,400
which is what you ideally do with a real currency is you increase the supply to match

2688
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:13,400
the demand.

2689
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:18,400
So the value remains the same and that keeps prices stable and keeps the market like functional.

2690
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:24,400
So, uh, with Bitcoin, this volatility is baked into it and it's going to keep happening

2691
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:30,400
forever because that's just what happens when you have a coin that works like this.

2692
02:33:30,400 --> 02:33:35,400
There's other coins that don't have that hard cap on the amount of it that can ever exist,

2693
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:36,400
but Bitcoin does.

2694
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:37,400
So it's, it's fucked.

2695
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:39,400
It's, it's always going to be like this.

2696
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:45,400
I mean, just, just imagine the type of purse like a fucking mom and pop shop or a Walmart

2697
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:51,400
or whatever, adjusting the prices of everything on a daily basis in order to match the fucking

2698
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:53,400
the changing in the price of Bitcoin.

2699
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:58,400
Like you can do it if you're a fucking artist, a commissioner who only does like a couple

2700
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:04,400
transactions a day or whatever, but fucking Walmart is never going to do it.

2701
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:05,400
Is it?

2702
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:06,400
Okay.

2703
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:11,400
I haven't, I haven't heard this argument before about like, you know, because the supply

2704
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:16,900
being inelastic, which means that like, which makes the, the, the value inherently volatile.

2705
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:18,400
I haven't heard that before.

2706
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:25,400
I guess my initial reaction is just that like the dollar is also volatile.

2707
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:30,400
Like the dollar, the dollar value, the value of a dollar does change on a day to day basis,

2708
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:32,400
like relative to other currencies.

2709
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:40,400
And I know that like, yeah, they can mint more dollars in a way that they can't mint more Bitcoin.

2710
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:48,400
I don't know whether I'm convinced that that is like a complete impediment to it becoming.

2711
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:53,400
I don't want Bitcoin to become like a real currency that's widely used.

2712
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:55,400
I watched a little video.

2713
02:34:55,400 --> 02:35:00,900
I watched some like fucking network news, Bitcoin news network video the other day where a guy

2714
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:05,900
was talking about why like Bitcoin is, you know, basically destined to become, to become

2715
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:09,900
like, you know, a, a adopted as a widely used currency.

2716
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:13,900
And, you know, he explained all the properties of money that it has and that it has better

2717
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:17,900
than like, you know, gold and better than, you know, traditional currency and whatever.

2718
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:29,900
And it sounded like maybe, and I don't know if I buy that like this is,

2719
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:37,900
because the price of the dollar does fluctuate and like the fact that you can mint more dollars,

2720
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:42,900
does that, does that like really help control control the price of the dollar that much?

2721
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:43,900
Maybe it does.

2722
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:45,900
Honestly, I feel like I'm out of my depth.

2723
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:53,900
Yeah, I'm not a smart man, but I do think even if volatility was an issue, even if it like

2724
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:58,900
steadily just increased in value at a very calculable, calculable rate.

2725
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:03,900
Yeah, the fact that it is a fixed supply does seem like a bad idea.

2726
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:09,900
Like, like a currency that is encouraged to save and not spend does not seem like it would be good for the economy.

2727
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:11,900
But I am not a smart man.

2728
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:12,900
You're right.

2729
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:20,900
Because like, I mean, this, this guy, the guy who's the video I watched, he seemed to think that like,

2730
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:29,900
he basically felt that like the Federal Reserve printing money is like a form of violence,

2731
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:35,900
in that it is like devaluing money that people exchange their, you know, time for.

2732
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:40,900
And obviously, you know, knowing, knowing a little Marxism as I do,

2733
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:47,900
I know that like money is not like the money that people have is not actually equivalent to like time that they spend to obtain it.

2734
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:52,900
Because like, that's not how capital works, capital accumulates more of itself.

2735
02:36:52,900 --> 02:37:02,900
So, so like, yeah, now that you mention it, the, I think that that makes that makes it a very unattractive option for me,

2736
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:09,900
because yeah, if the supply of Bitcoin is completely inelastic, then if somebody gets tons of Bitcoin,

2737
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:11,900
they just have all the money, right?

2738
02:37:11,900 --> 02:37:13,900
They just have it all.

2739
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:21,900
And whereas like, if someone has all the dollars right now, theoretically, the bank can print more dollars and distribute more dollars.

2740
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:29,900
And that person with all the dollars now only has half the dollars, their value has decreased because the supply was increased broadly.

2741
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:32,900
And you can't do that with Bitcoin, which is horrifying.

2742
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:39,900
I mean, I think it's optimistic to say that like, oh, that means it can't be adopted as a currency.

2743
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:43,900
It can and it will just lead to a horrible dystopian libertarian nightmare.

2744
02:37:43,900 --> 02:37:44,900
Yeah.

2745
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:55,900
To his other point, I do think the idea that a store could not change its prices every day probably is not true as we get more and more technologically advanced.

2746
02:37:55,900 --> 02:38:03,900
Like, I think what you're imagining when you say that is like, what are they going to write on a new sticker and have to replace put it over the object every single day.

2747
02:38:03,900 --> 02:38:11,900
And like, the answer is probably not. The answer would be that each price would have a screen underneath it and there would be an algorithm that updates the price under the screen.

2748
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:15,900
And the algorithm is attached to the value of Bitcoin.

2749
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:20,900
It's not something that's immediately available right now to every mom and pop shop, but like, I would not be crazy for like 20 years.

2750
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:23,900
Don't stores without checkout already exist?

2751
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:25,900
Yeah, they do.

2752
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:38,900
And like, maybe, I mean, maybe the prices could be listed in some sort of like stable conversion metric, but like the actual transaction could still be conducted using Bitcoin.

2753
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:47,900
And the Bitcoin value might fluctuate, whereas like the conversion rate is weighted in a way that the listed price stays the same or something like that.

2754
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:52,900
I mean, each store has its own microtransaction currency.

2755
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:56,900
Oh, like, like for loot boxes.

2756
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:59,900
Yeah, yeah.

2757
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:08,900
Oh, we got one more one, some fucking idiot submitted a voicemail at 636pm on Sunday.

2758
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:10,900
He just he just right now.

2759
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:12,900
Yeah, right now.

2760
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:14,900
So this is the actual last one.

2761
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:19,900
This is called High Tabuska Sky Don't Watch Odd Taxi.

2762
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:22,900
Three, two, one, go.

2763
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:25,900
What the fuck I was listening to the fucking podcast.

2764
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:28,900
I knew that I didn't send any voicemails.

2765
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:35,900
But there was like a little nagging in my head like, haha, wouldn't it be funny if like you did send a voicemail and you just don't remember.

2766
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:40,900
Come in Tabuska Sky, who sounds just like me, at least to me at that.

2767
02:39:40,900 --> 02:39:43,900
That's easily scariest experience in my life.

2768
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:45,900
Easily. This is fucked up.

2769
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:46,900
This is scary.

2770
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:47,900
Watch Odd Taxi.

2771
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:48,900
Pretty please.

2772
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:49,900
Okay, bye.

2773
02:39:49,900 --> 02:39:51,900
That's a weird thought to have.

2774
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:54,900
Like what if I what if I accidentally submitted one?

2775
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:55,900
I didn't realize it.

2776
02:39:55,900 --> 02:39:56,900
That's a weird thought.

2777
02:39:56,900 --> 02:39:59,900
Just because someone's voice sounded like your voice.

2778
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:00,900
I don't know.

2779
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:01,900
I can't.

2780
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:03,900
It's a memento shit.

2781
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:09,900
So now I'm confused whether I should watch Odd Taxi and I'm like, I'm getting mixed mixed messages.

2782
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:12,900
She said watch it.

2783
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:13,900
Huh?

2784
02:40:13,900 --> 02:40:14,900
She said watch it.

2785
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:16,900
That was a very distinct message.

2786
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:21,900
Yeah, she said watch it, but the title of the voicemail said don't watch Odd Taxi.

2787
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:28,900
Well, I guess you should go in between and watch with one eye open and one ear open.

2788
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:30,900
A true shrug.

2789
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:32,900
Just watch regular taxi footage.

2790
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:38,900
Put yourself in a box with a screen and for us, we won't know if you have or have not watched it.

2791
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:41,900
So I think you've done both.

2792
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:42,900
Spoiler.

2793
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:43,900
I won't.

2794
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,900
I won't do it.

2795
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:46,900
Experiment ruined.

2796
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:48,900
Okay, we've made it to the end.

2797
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:49,900
Yes.

2798
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:50,900
Fucking done.

2799
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:52,900
We've paid our pound of flesh.

2800
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:56,900
We have come to the end of the podcast.

2801
02:40:56,900 --> 02:41:04,900
So I guess before we leave off, anyone got any final thoughts or objects of interest or

2802
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:08,900
notes to mention before we sign out for another week?

2803
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:09,900
What are we thinking?

2804
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:11,900
How are you feeling, guys?

2805
02:41:11,900 --> 02:41:16,900
Everybody go check the link in the description for Gibbon Takes New Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

2806
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:17,900
Starting tomorrow.

2807
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:18,900
No.

2808
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:23,900
Check out the Cado anthology, link in the description.

2809
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:27,900
Throw it some money its way if you feel like it.

2810
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:28,900
Yeah.

2811
02:41:28,900 --> 02:41:32,900
If you make comics, if you pledge enough, we will do another anthology.

2812
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:33,900
So it's an opportunity.

2813
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:34,900
True.

2814
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:35,900
True.

2815
02:41:35,900 --> 02:41:36,900
That would be cool.

2816
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:39,900
It would be cool if these were your regular thing.

2817
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:43,900
I mean, I saw a bunch of people that were listed.

2818
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:49,900
I think it was Michi Foster, I think, said it was going to be her first.

2819
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:52,900
She's excited that it's getting printed because it's the first time something she's drawing

2820
02:41:52,900 --> 02:41:53,900
is being printed.

2821
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:56,900
I'm sure that a bunch of the artists feel that way as well.

2822
02:41:56,900 --> 02:42:00,900
Just excited to be like, wow, something I drew is, one, I get paid for it.

2823
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:04,900
Two, it's going to actually be in print and distributed.

2824
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:05,900
Really cool.

2825
02:42:05,900 --> 02:42:06,900
And Michi's comic.

2826
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:10,900
Michi's comic is by far one of the things I'm most excited about.

2827
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:13,900
It is, I mean, her art is amazing.

2828
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:14,900
Her art is amazing.

2829
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:18,900
It's definitely, I mean, it's almost worth the price of the book alone.

2830
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:19,900
True.

2831
02:42:19,900 --> 02:42:20,900
Yeah.

2832
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:27,900
I haven't actually looked at, I guess I do have access to the entries, which I didn't

2833
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:28,900
know.

2834
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:31,900
I haven't read all the contents.

2835
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:36,900
I didn't look at it.

2836
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:37,900
I'm sorry.

2837
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,900
Oh, but I will.

2838
02:42:39,900 --> 02:42:40,900
I promise.

2839
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:45,900
I promise I'll look if I feel like it.

2840
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:49,900
The only reason I said it is because I kept seeing messages of you being like, I haven't

2841
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:50,900
actually been sent anything.

2842
02:42:50,900 --> 02:42:51,900
I haven't seen anything.

2843
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:52,900
So I was like, all right, fuck you, man.

2844
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:53,900
Here, read it.

2845
02:42:53,900 --> 02:42:54,900
And I knew you wouldn't.

2846
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:55,900
I knew you wouldn't.

2847
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:56,900
I didn't.

2848
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:59,900
Okay, but link link in the description.

2849
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:00,900
Go check it out.

2850
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:04,900
These guys deserve thanks for setting all this up.

2851
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:05,900
It's pretty cool.

2852
02:43:05,900 --> 02:43:10,900
And become a patron at patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2853
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:16,900
If you want to support us also, hell, you could even do both.

2854
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:20,900
You could pay, you could give money to both things if you really wanted to.

2855
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:25,900
If you were really dedicated, if you were a true fan and not some faker.

2856
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:26,900
But we'll see.

2857
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:27,900
Okay.

2858
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:33,900
And if you were a real PCP fan, you'd go to patreon.com slash kato yt.

2859
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:35,900
You have a patron too?

2860
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:36,900
Okay.

2861
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:37,900
Yes.

2862
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:38,900
Also that.

2863
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:40,900
That is classless zero.

2864
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:42,900
You should be ashamed of yourself.

2865
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:43,900
Check out the kick.

2866
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:44,900
I'm a villain.

2867
02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:47,900
Check out the Kickstarter in the short term and the patreon in the long term.

2868
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:48,900
Right.

2869
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:49,900
You got it.

2870
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:50,900
You got it.

2871
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:51,900
You have to funnel them.

2872
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:54,900
You have to funnel them down the, you have to whittle them down the pipeline.

2873
02:43:54,900 --> 02:43:55,900
Right.

2874
02:43:55,900 --> 02:44:00,900
You have to radicalize them on the kato ideology.

2875
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:01,900
Like an onion.

2876
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:05,900
You have to progress them from the outer layer all the way to the inner layer.

2877
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:06,900
Okay.

2878
02:44:06,900 --> 02:44:07,900
I guess, I guess we're done.

2879
02:44:07,900 --> 02:44:08,900
I guess that's the episode.

2880
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:10,900
Thank you guys for coming on.

2881
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:11,900
Yes.

2882
02:44:11,900 --> 02:44:12,900
We're done for free.

2883
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:15,900
Finally, finally over.

2884
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:16,900
All right.

2885
02:44:16,900 --> 02:44:17,900
Thanks everyone.

2886
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:18,900
Thanks for watching.

2887
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:19,900
Goodbye.

2888
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:20,900
Good night.

2889
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:21,900
See you next week.

2890
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:22,900
Peace out.

2891
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,900
Bye.

2892
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:24,900
Bye.
