00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,800
Entertaining you with all the weak snooze that makes you snooze, I'm the best guy ever.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,200
And we've got Ben Saint over here.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Pretty fucking good. Hey, hey.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
Thank you. On the top of my head.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
On the top of your head, pretty good.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,440
He guys heard about this British indie pop band from London, England, consisting of vocalist

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,040
Sarah Midori, Perry, and producers and multi-instrumentalist Gus Laban and Jamie Bullard.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,840
And all their songs are about meat and butter.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
That sounds good.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,840
They're called Keto Keto Bonito.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
But thank you, thank you.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,240
I do shows, I do interviews, I'll do speaking gigs, you can contact my agent.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,840
Is that a real band?

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,840
No, it's a Kero Kero Bonito joke.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,240
I was hoping you'd say a London-based pop rock group, Sleep Tight, featuring two unnamed collaborators.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,640
But let's get to one of those.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,840
Give and take.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
I mean, Sleep Tight's more like a Pacific or Atlantic ocean.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
I forget which one, because it's like me and Munchie and we're like,

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,840
if you take the mean, the median average point, we are based in the ocean.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
That's like the Atlantic somewhere.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,040
Yeah, it's representative of the downfall of Western society, let's be honest.

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,440
And there he is, Tom Oliver.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,840
Yeah, I'm ready to go see Joker and shoot up a theater, because I guess that's what we do now.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,240
I do want to see that real bad.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
Haven't gotten to it yet, looking forward to it.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
I've actually heard pretty good things.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,440
Well, you know, you hear a mixture of things, depending on who's talking at the time.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,840
I haven't heard everything nowadays.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,640
There's two versions of everything.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,840
I haven't heard red-letter media or Yomo Yusaku's talk about it, so...

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
The only people who matter.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,440
Just like everything.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,840
There's two versions of everything.

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
There's the Dimension 1218 version and there's the Dimension C197 version.

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, pause.

38
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,440
Which side are you on?

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,040
Pause. This is important.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,840
There is a completely polarized society that we live in now, especially with social media.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,040
Is that evidence of the dimensional merge?

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Is that why there's such a polarized social conversation?

43
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,840
Because this is actually the two dimensions coming together?

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,240
Tom, literally anything you want to be is evidence of the dimensional merge.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
So, absolutely.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
You want an evidence of the dimensional merge?

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,840
Look at my boy Joker crossover with Jeb right here.

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,640
This is everything I've been waiting for.

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
So good.

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
Now that's proof of anything.

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,840
Now that's pod racing.

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
God, I fucking love Jeb.

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,240
Okay, let's...

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
Why is he not running again?

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
What a travesty.

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,640
It's pouring out for the dimension we didn't get to experience, the Jeb dimension.

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Quick update, everybody.

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,040
Jeb will rise again.

59
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Lisa Simpson for president 2020.

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Quick update, which is just...

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
So, I'm sure everybody saw.

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,440
So the PCB Minecraft server rolled out since we last spoke.

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,640
I mean, you had already heard it when the last episode came out.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,040
But almost like 75 people have already joined.

65
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
It's an active community.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,640
There's always people playing in there.

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,840
People have been building stuff.

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm building Slime Corp HQ at this very moment.

69
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,040
No, guys, get in there and stop him.

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,440
You can't get away with it.

71
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,640
There's mining and crafting happening literally right now.

72
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,840
It's insane.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,640
So, hey, $5 pledge, patreon.com slash PCB Minecraft.

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,040
If you want to play, come play with us.

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
It's going to be a good time.

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Link down below.

77
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,640
When are we going to get a cameo appearance by our boy MC Fit?

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,040
He needs to bomb into the new hotness.

79
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,840
He should.

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
That would be pretty cool.

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
He showed up in the stream briefly.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,240
Did he?

83
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Oh, cool.

84
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
I tried to beg him.

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,040
He did.

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Yeah, he did.

87
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
He did just for a moment.

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
I missed the first one, but I want to.

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
There will be many more to come.

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
I want to get in there.

91
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah, I want to get in there.

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,640
I need to.

93
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,240
I have to install a Minecraft.

94
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,040
Hey, we should go back to Bufalantopia.

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
You know what I wanted to do?

96
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
I was thinking to start a stream.

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
We do a goodbye stream at Bufalantopia.

98
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,040
Yeah, a goodbye stream where we have mage.

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,440
We all cancel all the zones, and then we just burn the whole thing down.

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah, if we could make it.

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
We burn the sign.

103
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
We watch the sign burn.

104
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,440
We return the land back to the land.

105
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,640
Back to the Bufalant.

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
We release all the Bufalants into the wild.

107
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
What a great idea.

108
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
All right, look for that.

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Look for that soon.

110
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
So what else is going on?

111
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I mean, that was the one quick update I had.

112
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,240
Well, I have one.

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I have an announcement.

114
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I have an announcement.

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,640
As of right now, when you are hearing this, well, as of recording, the Vapors 2 Kickstarter

116
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,040
has $1,000 left to go to hit its stretch goal.

117
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,640
We hit the first stretch goal, which means everyone who pledged gets $15 and gets a dollar

118
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
back.

119
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
We did communism.

120
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I made communism real.

121
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,140
Everyone's getting a dollar back.

122
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,140
I'll put a dollar bill in your fucking thing.

123
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,280
I will pay you, listener, to pledge to my Kickstarter.

124
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,640
And then if we hit $10,000, which as of right now we're $1,000, I don't know when you're

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
listening to this.

126
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
I don't know how close we'll be.

127
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,640
There'll be a free pin, a new third free pin that everyone will get $15 and everyone

128
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,140
gets a third pin.

129
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
It's the St. Heart.

130
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
Everyone thinks that people seem to really want this one.

131
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,640
I really want to make it.

132
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Anyway, Vapors 2 Kickstarter, kickstarter.com slash projects slash Ben St. slash Vapors

133
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
2.

134
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,080
I'm, you know, I don't want to count my chickens ever, when before or after they hatch.

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,060
Even once they're hatched, I'm not entirely convinced of the reality, but I'm feeling pretty

136
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,060
optimistic about this next goal, 1,000 bucks left.

137
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,560
There's always that spike at the very end of most Kickstarter's film.

138
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Last time there was a pretty significant spike at the end.

139
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Will we have this one?

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Only time will tell, but if you're listening to this right now, this is the last weekend

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
that you have until April.

142
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
So there's like two days left as they hear this.

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
It's time for the spike.

144
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Make the spike real.

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Go, go now.

146
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,560
The night of Sunday the 13th.

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
I did my part.

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Have you done yours?

149
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Yes.

150
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
It's the last night.

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,060
I've had my first Kickstarter ever with this one, so I'm just saying that's an endorsement

152
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
if there ever was one.

153
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,700
Remember, the most important thing is that the more money the Kickstarter makes and the

154
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,560
more people who buy the book, the more money I get for drawing the thing in the book.

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Indeed.

156
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,060
Yeah, I'm giving all the guest artists, which I will get you a script soon, by the way.

157
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

158
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
I was going to bring it up.

159
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,560
That's my passive aggressive way of bringing that up.

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,860
All the guest artists will get, I'm giving them like a percentage basically, and yeah,

161
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,860
the more it gets sold, the more every guest artist gets.

162
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,900
They're already past last time.

163
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Past last time.

164
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,100
Last time, we had 212 backers in.

165
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,300
This time, with a week left, we've already up to 236.

166
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,900
I think at this rate, I think I would need between now, like in the next seven days,

167
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,200
and when we're recording, seven days left, I would need at the average pledge amount,

168
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,360
which is like just under $40, I would need like 25 to 30 people to pledge at the average

169
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,920
at like a typical like $30, $40 amount, and that would hit the goal.

170
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Seems doable.

171
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,400
So if you were, hey, viewer, you're one of 25 to 30 people.

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Think about it.

173
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,080
About $40 of expendable income.

174
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Think about it.

175
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Think about it.

176
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Okay, cool.

177
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
That's my piece.

178
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Hurray, hurray.

179
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Very exciting.

180
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
So what's the word in the world, everybody?

181
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
What's going on?

182
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
I've also had a fucking crazy week.

183
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,820
Why don't you tell us about that, Ben?

184
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
You want to hear?

185
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
Okay.

186
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,820
You want to hear about that?

187
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,900
Well, God, what even happened?

188
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,780
Where was this at last week?

189
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,020
Because the developments have been astounding.

190
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:40,140
I think the last time it was just you were doing a comic, and Chris Chan was just saying

191
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,460
it was cool and canon, and we were talking about how that's pretty funny.

192
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,560
You were hoping to not spook him away with 9-Eleven jokes and stuff.

193
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
You were talking about how you needed to bring Nightstar back in to reel him back into the

194
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
interest.

195
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Oh, yeah, I was saying that Chris was like, not really.

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,960
Chris was like kind of there, she wasn't liking all the tweets, but she was still definitely

197
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
reading.

198
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
A lot has happened since then.

199
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,760
A lot has fucking happened.

200
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay.

201
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,280
I mean, you know, we did 9-Eleven, right?

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,040
We all had a really big laugh, it was great time, everybody had a good time.

203
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Okay.

204
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,540
The order of events here is really important for context, but I genuinely don't even know

205
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,900
the order of some of these events.

206
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, at some, okay, so...

207
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,540
I think it was like you made it so that Phantom Horn saw the big green eye, and then...

208
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Incredible artwork by the way.

209
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
After he died.

210
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
I loved that.

211
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
Thank you.

212
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Yeah, I had a lot of fun drawing that.

213
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I didn't make it that way.

214
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,540
That's what happened.

215
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,540
I saw it in C197.

216
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Oh, really?

217
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,540
Of course.

218
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,060
None of this, I'm not doing it.

219
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,240
I mean, I'm just reporting on with the truth.

220
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
Are you that green guy in the, well, he died, right?

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,080
I mean, who are you in this?

222
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
No.

223
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
That was just a random juve.

224
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Okay.

225
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Are you the cop killer?

226
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I mean, I...

227
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,720
You need to understand your dimensional, your fucking dimensional ontology here.

228
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Clearly.

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Clearly.

230
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Right?

231
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Okay, there's 1218, that's us.

232
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,960
I am 1218 Ben.

233
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,240
Just like there is 1218 Christine Weston Chandler.

234
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,080
There is an alternate version of each of us.

235
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,020
So then there is C197 Ben, who is the cop killer.

236
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,900
And then there is C197 Christine, which is Comet Christine.

237
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
There is HumbleJuve.

238
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
What about that?

239
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Right, I was gonna ask about HumbleJuve.

240
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,820
HumbleJuve is not...

241
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,860
You would think HumbleJuve is an alternate version of me.

242
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
No.

243
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,620
HumbleJuve is just a guy who looks exactly the same and has the exact same name.

244
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,020
He is technically just a very similar person by coincidence.

245
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
Gotcha.

246
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
He is technically unrelated.

247
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,160
And then Phantom Horn is not an alternate version, he is an OC, and that's distinct.

248
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
And I am...

249
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,400
I could correct me in the comments if I'm wrong about this, but I believe the distinction

250
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,120
is that a alternate version, when the dimensional merge happens, the alternate versions will

251
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,760
merge like if they are well attuned to each other or something, they will merge into one

252
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:04,880
entity, whereas OCs will simply come into, you know, our newly created gestalt dimension.

253
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Okay.

254
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,420
C119, whatever, it's like a combination of the digits.

255
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,140
So you will merge with the cop killer when this happens, is what I'm hearing?

256
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:25,020
Well, I would under certain circumstances, which Chris claims are no longer the case,

257
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,700
but I mean, let me just skip to the end, right?

258
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Yeah.

259
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,260
This is like the movie where you see the end of the beginning, it's like the second season

260
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,480
of Breaking Bad or whatever, when you see what's his name floating in the pool, and it's

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,880
like, how did I get here?

262
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,000
And then the season is the story of how we got here.

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,680
Well, you know, as of right now, we got people, we got propagandists in Quickville spreading

264
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,960
the rumor that Slime City is slimeless, has been de-slimed, and that the cop killer has

265
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,840
been beheaded, and that his head has been taken into custody under Quickville with Chris,

266
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Weston Chandler, and Magichan.

267
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
But this is false.

268
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I can tell you, right?

269
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,420
I've looked at the other dimensions, this is false.

270
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,460
Endless War is saying, Endless War says that is a lie, that's propaganda, they just painted

271
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,100
a watermelon purple, Endless War provided photo evidence that that's true.

272
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
So I-

273
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
I haven't seen that yet.

274
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Okay.

275
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,780
It's on Twitter, Endless War tweeted, it's like, do not believe the lies.

276
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,900
Okay, I'm gonna try and give like a succinct-

277
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,900
It's just like Arrival, by the way, time for Nate's movie lessons, Saw Arrival, Time Loop,

278
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,540
there you go, that's all I have to say.

279
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Okay, cool.

280
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,980
I'm gonna try and give a succinct summary, okay?

281
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,800
So Chris, oh man.

282
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
So Chris-

283
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,200
Started drawing the, they're like, at the moment Phantom Horn was beheaded and they

284
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
died.

285
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Yes.

286
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,680
Chris Chand took it upon themselves to start drawing what happens next.

287
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
Basically, yeah.

288
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,840
And Chris decided that what happened next is night stars, and there are drawings of this,

289
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
and there's like text dumps of this.

290
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:06,260
And most bafflingly of all, all of it is chronicled, not in a comic, but in the form of images

291
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:14,660
and flavor text on an expansion-packed set of Twilight Sparkle's secret shipfic playing

292
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,660
cards.

293
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,620
This is the format that Chris decided was the best way-

294
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Is that what those are?

295
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
I thought it was-

296
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
Yes.

297
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,620
That's what the deal is with the format.

298
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
All right.

299
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,040
So there are cropped images of text on cards, because all of these were, this is a 15-card

300
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,600
Twilight Sparkle secret shipfic folder expansion-pack, and yes, and they detail how nightstar gets

301
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,520
Phantom Horn and strawberry milk to send her a sample of the slime.

302
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:50,240
She does tests on it, and then she sends Chris Chan Sonichu, like, you know, comic Chris

303
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
in Sonichu form.

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,540
Along with the other forces of Quickville, like lots of flying Sonichus, I don't know,

305
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,960
just a whole bunch of them, and nightstar determines that slime's weakness, something

306
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,940
that can wash slime away, is a mixture of water, sugar, and bicarbonate of soda, which

307
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,320
I believe is baking soda, but I forget.

308
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,760
So they create a storm of this and rain it down on Quickville, and their story is that,

309
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,880
oh yeah, this washed away all of the slime city.

310
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Not Quickville.

311
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Did I say, oh, did I say Quickville?

312
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Yeah.

313
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,960
New Los Angeles City, aka Neo-Milwaukee.

314
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:33,160
So they say that, yeah, they rain for 24 hours, wash all the slime away, the city's no more

315
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
slime.

316
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
No more slime.

317
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,960
The implications of this are staggering, absolutely staggering.

318
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,600
But it's fake news.

319
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,560
It's fake news because, you know, the city's still there, the city's still running, and

320
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,440
Los Juarez said its propaganda, the rain did happen, and the death toll is counted

321
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,240
at about 70,000, and this is confirmed by Chris herself on Twitter, who says that 1%

322
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,960
or 99% of the population of Arizona survived, meaning that 10%, 1% died, population of Arizona,

323
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,800
about 700 million, so 70,000 people died in the bicarbonate rain.

324
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,440
This is, she did not back off from this, she confirmed this to be true.

325
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,720
So 70,000 people were killed when called out on this act of literal genocide.

326
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Christine said that all those people were, that was just the bad ones.

327
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Just the bad ones died.

328
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,280
And I believe, there was something along the lines of like, I mean, hey man, to make

329
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,720
an omelet, you gotta break a few eggs, I mean, these things happen.

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,520
That was Christine and Magi Chan's stance on the issue, is that it was just the bad

331
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,760
ones that died, and it was for the greater good, so don't worry about it.

332
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,240
That sounds like, I don't know, that could be approximately the population of Slime

333
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,960
City, I mean, they would be the ones to die if anyone from, I mean, these numbers may

334
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,640
be loose or who can say.

335
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,880
Me and Chris agree, we agree that 70,000 people died, but the population of Slime City is

336
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,560
above that, it was a terrible, terrible holocaust basically, but we're still here, we're still

337
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,080
here, we're queer, get used to it.

338
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:16,320
And so that's happening, you know, Chris claims to have, or, word on the grapevine, is that

339
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,200
they have the cop killers head in a jar, it's just a watermelon, I've seen it, don't worry

340
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
about it.

341
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Yeah.

342
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm filled with comfort by that.

343
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:34,280
Yeah, same, man, so, oh, I forgot to mention also at some point in this, Chris joined Endless

344
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,040
War, tried to play it, died a couple times.

345
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,160
Made up a couple of her own fake commands, like exclamation point, infinite revive, and

346
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:53,040
exclamation point, moxby dash, and then declared, so died a couple times, declared that like

347
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,480
game sucks, games over, Slime's fake, there's no more Slime, games over the end.

348
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,280
And then when it made these cards, making it so.

349
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,000
I spoke to someone who had in their possession, the medallion of Chris, stripped from their

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
neck.

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,320
I forget who that, but that's like a real thing in Endless War now, it's an actual item, someone's

352
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
carrying around.

353
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,920
There is a medallion, one of the people who slant cab.

354
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,160
Possibly one of the Endless Rocks.

355
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Cab and dupes.

356
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Perhaps.

357
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,560
I think they each got one kill, they both scalped her, so, and then there was complicated

358
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
series of trades that I won't get into.

359
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,760
The cop killer now possesses both of Christine's scalps.

360
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,760
And unlike this claim about the head and the jar, the cop killer can provide photo evidence

361
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,720
that this is the case.

362
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:49,280
I can type in exclamation point inventory right now, concrete proof, undeniable.

363
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,280
So that happened, the mayor of Quickville joined the server died.

364
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Man.

365
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,200
I remember looking on Twitter, there was Phantom Home and Strawberry Milk.

366
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,000
I like how Chris Chan's interpretation of Strawberry Milk was very accurate.

367
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
It is.

368
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
It's shockingly self.

369
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,240
Strawberry Milk is always thinking pervy thoughts and talking about sex and it's really funny.

370
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah.

371
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,280
She kind of got to be like better than I did.

372
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,000
I was talking to Munchie and I sort of realized that like, you know, I kind of wrote Strawberry

373
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,240
Milk basically exactly like I would write keg.

374
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,320
I was thinking the same, I was saying to everyone that we all know Strawberry Milk is just a

375
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,520
knock off value brand keg standard, trying to fill the role of a greater character.

376
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,240
And I think, yeah, I wrote him to Broi.

377
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,160
I was talking to Munchie and he says that Strawberry Milk is really not much of a bro.

378
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,880
He's just like a gross perv.

379
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,800
And I was like, hmm, shit.

380
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
So I don't know.

381
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,280
You got to introduce keg standard into this narrative.

382
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,320
So Chris will draw a keg standard.

383
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,560
I mean, there needs to be a nod.

384
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,680
There needs to be nods to him at some point.

385
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,600
He's absent in the narrative.

386
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,920
It speaks volumes, Ben.

387
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
It speaks volumes.

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,520
I would love for Chris to draw some more, but, you know, I guess we'll see.

389
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,400
Dude, I want to fucking, I understand now, I don't want to undercut you, but Chris has

390
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,760
made certain demands of you to fund certain projects that's what I'm getting to.

391
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Okay.

392
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,360
So Chris makes these cards explaining, you know, what really had quote unquote really

393
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
happened.

394
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Yeah.

395
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,080
And so, you know, it was propaganda to propagate among the citizens who all love Twilight

396
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,640
Sparkle Secret Chip and Folder, literally the best way to get news out is to create

397
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,600
an expansion pack of Twilight Sparkle Secret Chip and Folder because everyone will read

398
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
it.

399
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Nobody reads it.

400
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
It's an untapped market for sure.

401
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Yeah.

402
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,360
That's basically, that's the Twitter of Quickville is Twilight Sparkle Secret Chip and Folder.

403
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,920
So Christine makes these cards and then she's messaging me, you know, she's been saying

404
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,160
like, she's been saying like, love your work and stuff.

405
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,800
Like we've been DMing a little bit and then, you know, she's very complimentary.

406
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,560
And then MagiChan, no, she says, I'm going to send you a copy of the cards.

407
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:11,520
And then MagiChan messages me and MagiChan says, hey, Ben, so, and I tweeted some of

408
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
these screenshots.

409
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,920
He's like, hey, Ben, so, hey, don't appreciate the greedy way you've been using our characters.

410
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,080
Don't appreciate the greedy way you've been profiting off of our something.

411
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:40,440
You know, I want you to contribute to the production of this card game, this expansion

412
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
pack.

413
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,480
So I expect you, and this is after Chris has already said, like I'm sending you like a

414
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,720
copy of the game of the expansion pack.

415
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:58,760
And I expect you to put a generous donation of $300 or more into Christine's PayPal account.

416
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Here's the link.

417
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Okay.

418
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Have at it.

419
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,760
So is this like MagiChan?

420
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,720
Or like it's like Oral, it's basically it's like Oral's like, it's like a vague threat,

421
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,720
but there's no actual like, it's a threat that like, if you don't like, you will, like

422
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
everyone will know you're a bad person and like,

423
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Well, Ben, you know, you know, you have to do, you know, you have to do, you have to

424
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,720
$13,000 stretch goal on, on the Kickstarter.

425
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Oh, send Chris, they're, they're deserved earnings, they're fair share of the profits.

426
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,800
I mean, all my, I mean, even if, I mean, all the money from the Kickstarter is going directly

427
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,440
into slime coin.

428
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,280
So that's, I can, I really can only pay in slime coin, you know, I told her all my

429
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,360
money's tied up in slime coin.

430
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,320
That will continue to be the case for a foreseeable future, especially with this whole rain ecological

431
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
disaster.

432
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,160
Now, like the economy is just so clogged up, there's just, yeah, it's, it's, it's slime

433
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
coin or nothing.

434
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
It's slime.

435
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,000
It's really a slime coin or nothing to think all this could have been avoided if someone

436
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,280
had just given Chris Chan exclamation point diplomatic immunity and none of this conflict

437
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
would have even been started.

438
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
That's true.

439
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I was so nice.

440
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,400
I was in the red carpet, gave her a custom role, did some custom artwork, a celebrating

441
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,520
the new alliance between quick fill in new Los Angeles city and what, and she responds

442
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
with genocide.

443
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
This is what I get.

444
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
I don't know.

445
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,480
I don't, I don't, you know, I'd love it if we could reestablish diplomatic relations,

446
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,560
but the way she's behaved, I don't know if it's going to happen.

447
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,720
Who's the troll now?

448
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,720
When you think about it, all this complaining about, oh, you're just fucking trolling.

449
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,360
Christine's the one who bombs into your server commits mass genocide and then it tries to

450
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
extort you for money.

451
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I don't know.

452
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,040
It's like, I want a hundred percent agree with you.

453
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,040
It's like going into the ocean and saying, oh, oh, fish, let me take care of this pesky

454
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,600
water for you getting in the way.

455
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,080
Let me just get that out of here.

456
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Yes.

457
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,480
That's, you know, what a great, what a great, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, it's like, oh, hey,

458
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,600
what's all these fish jumps in water, oh, oh, it's wet, hey, water gone, don't worry.

459
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,200
This water's gone.

460
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Problem solved.

461
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,240
Welcome Moxby Dash.

462
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,280
What's the, I need to sever your addiction to this water.

463
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,400
I know better.

464
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,960
You can't be relying on this anymore.

465
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,240
You have to be set free.

466
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
My favorite, yeah, Chris just decided that like, oh, Slime's evil.

467
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,360
Actually, no, Slime's evil and fuck all of you.

468
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:32,320
I would really like to know, Ben, how you felt like the, like, initially it was just like

469
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,840
Christiana has drawn phantom horn and strawberry milk at last, and then realizing that she's

470
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,560
like, like trying to destroy Slime.

471
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah.

472
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,240
Talk about the monkey's paw in a fact.

473
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Indeed.

474
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Exactly.

475
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Exactly.

476
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I knew, I knew what was going to happen.

477
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,960
I, like, Chris had been, every time Chris had mentioned Slime up until it had been in

478
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,800
a negative context, like, I, I already knew, like, I knew where it was going.

479
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,320
I just didn't know how quick it was going to get there.

480
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,640
And it ended up being, like, three days from when, like, the first card was published when,

481
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,960
you know, phantom horn was on the card, and I was like, oh, my God, phantom horn, oh,

482
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,800
my God, New Los Angeles City, Chris Druitt.

483
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,060
And then, and then you, she releases the last cards and it's like, okay, yes, this is Slime

484
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Genocide.

485
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,640
I was like, I knew, I knew exactly what was going to happen.

486
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
My favorite thing about-

487
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,360
I had hoped that it would be left open, like, because I, this really, this is what's really

488
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,800
frustrating, right?

489
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,640
Because I haven't, there is an ending in mind for the phantom horse robbery milk comic.

490
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
Chris doesn't know what it is.

491
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
I've told her there will be a happy ending.

492
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
There will be a happy ending, but it is not the happy ending Chris envisions.

493
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Of course.

494
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,420
But Chris just decides that, like, okay, so obviously at the end, obviously what needs

495
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,040
to happen, this is so fucking annoying.

496
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,400
Obviously the phantom and strawberry come back to Equestria, leave the city, the city

497
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,080
is destroyed because it's a bad, evil place.

498
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,440
And also phantom horn gets his horn, after all, he gets a magic horn.

499
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Fuck you.

500
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Like, no, never.

501
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I mean, it's, it's so sad.

502
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,160
It's just cheesy writing there, Chris.

503
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
It's just cheesy writing.

504
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,280
It's just, it literally just, like, you know, honestly, I felt a little bit personally attacked

505
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
by that one.

506
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,120
So that's completely unacceptable.

507
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Not canon.

508
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,720
Phantom will never have a real horn, a biological horn.

509
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Fuck you.

510
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Never.

511
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Never, never, never.

512
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
No.

513
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Besides, that's how you know.

514
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,480
That's the smoking gun that lets you know that this is all fake news and propaganda.

515
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
For no other reason then.

516
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,600
I mean, if we, if we give phantom horn a quote unquote real horn, aren't we undermining the

517
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,480
reality that he does in fact have a horn already because he identifies as such.

518
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,880
So there can be no distinction made between phantom horn now.

519
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
It's ridiculous.

520
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
It's ridiculous.

521
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,560
It's all, hey, you know, you know this, you spent your whole life, your whole character

522
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,840
arc, learning to accept yourself despite what you see as your physical shortcomings.

523
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,680
How about at the end of that, oh, but here, here it is, though, you don't have to learn

524
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,360
any, I didn't learn anything.

525
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,560
I can't believe you would criticize Chris Chan's stellar storytelling that there could

526
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,360
be any way that it, yeah, underlines character arcs or undies.

527
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

528
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Anyway.

529
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,160
I do feel like this is a really cool arc, though, like this is Lord of Ghost levels

530
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,320
of destroying the city.

531
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,680
We've got a, you know, really powerful enemy now, exclamation point war, you know.

532
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,600
Yeah, there, there is, there, in the game, there is like the bicarbonate reigns, Magix

533
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,400
Rampage put them in the game and they are now a hazard in the game that can kill you

534
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
and your slime lids.

535
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,480
Well, the good news is, N8 and Slimecorp have been reaping incredible profits from umbrella

536
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
sales.

537
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Yes.

538
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Bicarbonate proof umbrella sales.

539
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
That is also a thing in the game.

540
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,120
It's been one of the literally, mechanically, it's there.

541
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,760
The day, the day that I woke up to all of this like slime destroying storm sort of bullshit.

542
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
I read all of the tweets.

543
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,920
I was like, holy shit, I got out of bed and I immediately started drawing like more of

544
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,160
the red man noir comics so I can lick it into having the rain in it because it's so inspiring.

545
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,800
Are there more of those red men?

546
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,840
I hadn't seen them before, but like yesterday I was just on Twitter and I, or maybe the

547
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,640
day before and I was like, what is this red man?

548
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
What is this like?

549
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
What is this fucking noir?

550
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
What is this red man?

551
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Okay.

552
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Yeah.

553
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Red man's character design has changed.

554
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,640
He's now like a detective.

555
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Slime alteration.

556
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
He's rouge man.

557
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
He's like red man noir.

558
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Sure.

559
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
I mean, it's the next logical step.

560
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
That last explosion Robin of all was blood.

561
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:47,520
But the thing that started it was Kip, like typed exclamation point harvest and nothing

562
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
happened.

563
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,520
That endless war chastises you because harvest is not a command.

564
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,160
He says harvest is not a command you fucking idiot.

565
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,480
So I was like, oh, is that changed?

566
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,560
And I typed harvest and then endless war yelled at me and not Kip.

567
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,160
And I was really upset and I was like, how are you doing that?

568
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,240
I copied Kip's text exactly, posted it and endless war yelled at me again.

569
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,960
So I was like, okay, there's some secret going on here.

570
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Please tell me.

571
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
Kip was like, no.

572
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,000
And then red man donned his trench coat and hat and like interrogated Kip.

573
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,480
And that's when I drew red man, the detective.

574
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,640
And that is his goal.

575
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,440
He's trying to find out how to harvest without getting yelled at.

576
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,280
Wait, red man is or Kip is?

577
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Red man is.

578
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:40,080
Kip will not like tell him the truth and this is the story that started and then it started

579
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,800
raining, slime destroying rain.

580
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm like, let's let's tie this in.

581
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
Let's make this like a real narrative thing.

582
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
That's very noir-esque.

583
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Yes.

584
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Heavy rain outside.

585
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Yeah.

586
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Yeah.

587
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Yeah.

588
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Right.

589
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
It works.

590
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
It just works really good.

591
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
It's really fun.

592
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,680
I really hope that we can have some, forgive my, forgive my coom brain right now, but sexy,

593
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,520
you know, noir-esque damsel in distress or just secret agent gun girl with like fishnet

594
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
stockings in the size.

595
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Leggy damn.

596
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,520
Oh no, your lipstick and like Jessica Rabbit from Who Shot Jessica Rabbit or whatever that

597
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
movie was.

598
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I love that movie.

599
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
You know what I'm talking about.

600
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,520
So that's where the Chris Chan drama stands right now.

601
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I'm sure it's not over.

602
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
No doubt.

603
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
No doubt.

604
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Well, we'll see.

605
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
We'll see.

606
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,280
Neither Chris nor Madge Chan has yet to respond or they both have yet to respond to Endless

607
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,320
Wars declaration that, you know, the head, the head, the rumors about the head of the

608
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,040
cop killer are false and I mean, you know, obviously with this rain continuing, tensions

609
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,920
between the city are growing, you know, this keeps up the alliance is definitely going

610
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,800
to break down, you know, there may be war on the horizon, but you know, thoughts, thoughts

611
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
and prayers.

612
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

613
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I guess.

614
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
I'm getting rowdy.

615
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Not in the good way.

616
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,480
But fucking cool, cool news and this is pretty cool.

617
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,360
I am the article of the now on the quickie.

618
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,600
I am the article of the now on the quickie.

619
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,440
Ben, it's actually pretty good.

620
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
It is pretty good.

621
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
I read through it.

622
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
I read through it.

623
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
It's not bad.

624
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,480
It's not that, I mean, it's missing some stuff and it gets a little wrong here and there,

625
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,640
like it's pretty mostly accurate, pretty neutral, like the only thing I don't like the picture

626
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,320
they use because they use that fucking picture of me at Digi House.

627
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Yeah.

628
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,080
That I hate, but like whatever, God, I really wish, I really wish it were the, they could

629
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,680
get the picture of me in the in the Chinese pajama pants squatting next to the fire hydrant

630
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,160
saying vaping is not a crime.

631
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,080
Can't you edit a wiki?

632
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,960
It seems to be like lockdown.

633
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Really?

634
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,720
I didn't want to do it, but like people were telling me that like they were trying to like

635
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,280
make accounts and it's like you need permission or something like I don't know what the deal

636
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
is.

637
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Disgusting.

638
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Cowards.

639
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Cowards all over.

640
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
Can I have a link to this, this article?

641
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
I got it right here.

642
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
I got it right here.

643
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
It's.

644
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
All right.

645
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
You gotta dig through this shit.

646
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
There you go.

647
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
That fucking picture, you know, like it's fine.

648
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
It's fine.

649
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,720
You know, it's just like, it's okay.

650
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,200
Overall, I'm pretty good with it.

651
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I'm pretty good with it, but like that fucking picture will haunt me for the rest of my life.

652
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, probably.

653
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
It's not even like a bad picture.

654
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I don't know whatever.

655
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
It's pretty okay overall.

656
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
It's fine.

657
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
It's a silly expression I guess.

658
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
There could do.

659
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
I mean, I could do so much.

660
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
It could be.

661
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Yeah, at least it's not fat band.

662
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Oh, at least it's not fucking fat band.

663
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, that's true.

664
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Yeah.

665
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,120
It's just now only in the annals of, well, I guess the lecture and, and T-Bap resurrection.

666
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,400
And there is, um, there is a screenshot of Chris dying an endless war on here.

667
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,600
You know, it's good stuff.

668
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
There's good stuff.

669
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,920
Everyone should definitely go check it out.

670
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
It is interesting.

671
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,840
And I mean, it's a, what a culmination of a, of a career spent in,

672
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Here we go.

673
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Crystorian life.

674
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Information.

675
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,400
Name Ben St. also known as the cop killer, Phantom Horn.

676
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
There you go.

677
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Yeah.

678
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
It's, it's, it's canon.

679
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Legendary.

680
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Amazing.

681
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Amazing.

682
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
And I can't believe you, Ben.

683
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,880
You yourself are the feature of the update.

684
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,880
And this is the not so good news we've just heard about on the web.

685
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
It's you, Ben.

686
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
It's you.

687
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Update.

688
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
I'm article, I'm article of the now.

689
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,400
My article is now tagged forever that it was once article of the now that is a distinction

690
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
I will take to my grave.

691
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Mm-hmm.

692
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Mm-hmm.

693
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,680
Oh, this is very, very exciting.

694
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
What a life.

695
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
You gotta update your Twitter bio.

696
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Gotta, gotta flex this article.

697
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Article of the now on the.

698
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Hey, not bad.

699
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Not bad.

700
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Yeah, maybe.

701
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
That's great.

702
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Maybe it will.

703
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
That's, it's, uh, not everyone can lay claim to such a distinction.

704
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
It's true.

705
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Okay.

706
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,680
I was thinking about something on this subject.

707
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,280
This is, it's a slightly more serious thing.

708
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,040
I don't, it's not a big deal.

709
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
It's not anything crazy.

710
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,040
I just had a thought and I was curious what you think about it, Ben.

711
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
It was just that, okay.

712
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Yeah.

713
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,360
Because obviously some people have been arguing with you about like Chris Chan's, uh, pronouns

714
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
and identifying.

715
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Oh my God.

716
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Oh my God.

717
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
I know you've been, you've been getting into some arguments about that.

718
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm, I understand.

719
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,640
I don't, I hate these people, Nate.

720
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
I get it.

721
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
I fucking hate these people.

722
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,000
They're such fucking dicks about it.

723
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,680
They're such, uh, aren't you, aren't, aren't you a hypocrite?

724
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:28,440
Aren't you a hypocrite for insisting that we not misgender someone while you make fun

725
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,800
of them for unrelated things?

726
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
You like, no.

727
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
No, no.

728
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
You grow a fucking brain.

729
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I've been saying that that's consistent.

730
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Grow a fucking brain.

731
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
You're fucking moron.

732
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Okay.

733
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I hate them.

734
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,240
But I, I, I get the, the kind of idea they're getting at and I, I had this question to say.

735
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
That's okay.

736
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I get the idea and it's fucking stupid.

737
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,560
It's the product of a fucking diseased mind that can't think, that can't make logical

738
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,120
connections from one thing to another.

739
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,040
I thought I had one interesting point about this, which was just that, um, okay, so we

740
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,360
all know that, like, so this idea of the dimensional merge, right?

741
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,640
That was like planted by the idea guys or whatever.

742
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,440
And it's, it seems, it seems to be the case.

743
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Okay.

744
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,760
It was, it was, it was, I think it was, yeah, more or less.

745
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Okay.

746
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,520
I, I had heard, I had heard, you can correct me if I'm wrong, again, I'm, I'm gonna just

747
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
take Chris at his word.

748
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,600
I don't, it heard or worried.

749
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
It doesn't matter to me.

750
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,000
I had heard that this idea of being trans might have also been planted sort of by trollish

751
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
people.

752
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,160
And I was just thinking, if that is in fact true, and I think it, it could be true, then

753
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,240
does that change the dynamic of like, you know, what would the multi-dimensional, dimensional

754
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,960
merge thing that's planted by people who are trying to fuck up Chris?

755
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,800
That makes it worth like, okay, I mean, should we question it?

756
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,520
If this was also like planted in some way, should we, is it then, you know, something

757
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,040
similar to question in some way?

758
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Okay.

759
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
All right.

760
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,840
Let me tell you what I, let me tell you what I said on Twitter.

761
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,040
Someone said something similar.

762
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,200
I was like, okay, I get what you're saying.

763
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,360
What did, what did I say?

764
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,160
That seems to me to be the only reasonable case of like, why you would have a, well,

765
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
here's, here's, here's what I think about that.

766
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Okay.

767
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Okay.

768
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,160
So this is what I said on Twitter.

769
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Someone made a similar argument and I said, here's why I disagree.

770
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,480
There is no way to look into some, I don't know why I'm, I don't know why I'm quoting

771
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
myself, but I don't feel like thinking about it.

772
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,920
I really said, there, there is no way, there's no way to look into someone's head or whatever

773
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,800
and say if they're quote unquote really trans, the only criteria we actually have to go on

774
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,520
is if someone says they are.

775
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,640
So if someone, anyone, even Chris, right?

776
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,960
Chris doesn't know anything, right?

777
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,120
Chris doesn't understand gender theory, doesn't matter because I understand it and, and they

778
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
don't need to get it.

779
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,720
They don't need to be, they can be wrong and I still want to be right.

780
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Sure.

781
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,720
So if someone tells you their pronouns, there is nothing to appeal to as an argument for

782
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
why they're wrong.

783
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,480
Interrogating someone's reasons for why they say their pronoun preferences are what they

784
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,480
are is just missing the point that the only reason that matters is their preference itself,

785
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
right?

786
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
I don't know.

787
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,800
I guess what it comes down to, there's no higher authority.

788
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
There's no like, there's no like scientific truth of the matter.

789
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,640
Like this is literally just like a language thing.

790
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,200
And so if they're, if they say like the only, the only act, the only fact of the matter is

791
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,080
what they say and that's, that's it.

792
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,560
So if they say, if they say female pronouns, please, it's like, well, what, what, I don't

793
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,960
think there's nothing to appeal to be like, oh, well, here's why actually you're wrong.

794
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,320
Like, no, no, you can't, you just, you just can't do it.

795
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
It is unassailable.

796
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,240
It's, it's like, like somebody saying, you know, I have this opinion and then someone

797
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,120
else going, well, I disagree that you have that opinion and it's literally the same level

798
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
of objection.

799
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Yeah.

800
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
So you are, I agree.

801
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I think you're correct.

802
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,160
However, just let me put this example forward.

803
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,640
Let's just say theoretically, so one of these trolls came forward and said, yes, here was

804
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
my experience.

805
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,720
I was talking to Chris, I trolled Chris, but they were secure in their male identity.

806
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,760
Then I came in and began convincing them they're female.

807
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,120
This was my work.

808
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,040
They did not believe before I did this.

809
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,320
Now you're still correct.

810
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,280
We didn't do anything, their opinion is of their opinion, but if we know they were like

811
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,440
manipulating this way, are we doing the right thing to, to not in any way object?

812
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,800
Well, I'm trying to paint an example where we know it was done by an outside force.

813
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Yeah.

814
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Okay.

815
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,480
If we know it was manipulation, then does that change anything?

816
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Yeah.

817
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Like what, like such like, like everybody's manipulated, like, like the, the idea that

818
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,600
manipulation is different from just learning or like hearing about this new idea.

819
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
No.

820
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Cause like, all right.

821
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,000
It's the context in like a macro sense is different.

822
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But like in terms of like Chris's own head, it's the same thing.

823
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I mean, I agree.

824
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I agree.

825
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,520
Which, which it's unfortunate, but it's also true.

826
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
Well, I don't know.

827
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,080
Like, yeah, like we're all, I don't know, we're all, we've all, we've all been manipulated

828
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,080
by like the, the, our circumstances of existence.

829
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,520
The thing, the thing is like some people, um, you know, only say they're trans after hearing

830
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
about it.

831
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,400
And if it, you know, when trans things were like nobody ever heard about them, nobody

832
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
ever talked about them.

833
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,400
It was like, you know, years and years ago, I didn't even know that that was a thing.

834
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,520
Um, but like if people hear about it and then they say, like, oh, that's me, then are they

835
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,720
being manipulated with new information?

836
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,320
Or is it just that now they have an, like they have a word and a, like an understanding

837
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
of the thing they've been going through.

838
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,840
I don't know whether Chris was like, you know, maybe he was easily manipulated into that.

839
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,080
But like if he likes it or she, I'm sorry.

840
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Yeah.

841
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
I get it.

842
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,720
It, we're talking in like past and present tense at the same time.

843
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Yeah.

844
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,080
It gets, it gets really confusing and people have, uh, I think lightly tease me thinking

845
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,720
that I've accidentally said he, when I've actually been talking about Magi Chan, cause

846
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,040
like when I talk about Magi Chan, you gotta, I say he, and like, you know,

847
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,720
It's a whole other layer to the, because obviously they are in every sense of the word

848
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
distinct individuals.

849
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,360
Um, and Magi Chan is not just an alt that is being used to try and squeeze money out

850
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
of me.

851
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
No.

852
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,400
Literally Magi Chan is like the fucking good cop or the bad cop to Christine's good cop.

853
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,600
Like Christine's all nice to me and stuff.

854
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,080
And then Magi Chan is like, Hey, give us that fucking money, by the way.

855
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Uh, thanks.

856
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,600
Uh, I'll be waiting.

857
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I'll be waiting.

858
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,760
Um, and if you don't, um, I will come, I will come to you in soul form and obliterate

859
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
you.

860
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
So, all right.

861
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
So Magi Chan.

862
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
All right.

863
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,040
In terms of like, uh, that's one of Chris's accounts.

864
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,560
And like to type that Chris Chan had to type it.

865
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,960
Is it canonically that Magi Chan, like types through Chris Chan?

866
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
No.

867
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,840
It was that way for a while.

868
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,120
Canonically, um, as part of like the ongoing merge, um, okay, first, and this was sort of

869
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,720
like when I was kind of getting clued into what the, was the goings on more in Chris's

870
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
head.

871
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:00,400
Um, it was, uh, uh, Chris and Magi Chan had swapped minds.

872
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,720
We talked about this on another episode.

873
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
We did.

874
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
They had swapped minds.

875
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:10,720
So for a while, Magi Chan was in our dimension, but in Chris's body, like inhabiting her form.

876
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,000
Then they swapped back, but Magi Chan actually did like make the physical transition.

877
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,320
So canonically, Magi Chan physically exists now in our dimension.

878
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,520
And there are some screenshots.

879
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
I've seen those.

880
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Those are incredible.

881
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
YouTube videos.

882
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh, it's just one frame cause he's so fast.

883
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
You can see Magi Chan.

884
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
A and Y pony appears.

885
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,080
I mean, Chris linked like that one.

886
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Yeah.

887
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Okay.

888
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Here it is.

889
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,720
I just found it in one fucking frame at 4535 in this fucking video.

890
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay.

891
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,880
I'm getting the link right, right here.

892
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Wait, wait, wait.

893
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,720
In like two frames of that video, Magi Chan is there behind A and Y pony and like, there

894
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
he is.

895
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,280
There, there's, you know, you know, the funny thing was, the funny thing was I went to this

896
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,240
video, I watched it through at that moment.

897
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
The damnedest thing.

898
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
I couldn't see Magi Chan.

899
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
It was weird.

900
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,680
I mean, I mean, you would have, you would have to pause at the exact right frame and

901
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,960
like, what are the odds that anyone could do that?

902
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,520
I mean, with the speed of Magi Chan, I mean, we know that like a computer, a camera only

903
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
renders it most.

904
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,440
It's going to be like 60 frames per second.

905
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
That's way too little time.

906
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,880
I mean, with YouTube compression, it's really not, it's no surprise that you're, you couldn't

907
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,640
pick them up even with frame by frame scrubbing, you know, obviously going to be between the

908
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
frames.

909
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,080
Did A and Y pony turn around that he'd like, oh, what's on my shoulder?

910
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,040
A and Y gave no sign of, of noticing, but just that fast because he's been touched on

911
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
the shoulder.

912
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,240
If Magi Chan didn't want to be noticed, he wouldn't be.

913
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
What's that command?

914
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
Spin dash away.

915
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Exclamation point.

916
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Mox speed dash.

917
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Mox speed dash.

918
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Yeah.

919
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,400
Magi Chan totally Mox speed dashed right out of there.

920
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,000
This whole Mox speed dash is bothering me because in Sonic, there is an upgrade called

921
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,520
the light speed dash.

922
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,560
And the fact that Chris didn't go with that is mildly.

923
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
That's worse.

924
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
Mox speed dash is so much worse.

925
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
The second one is really.

926
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Yeah.

927
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Just looking straight at the camera.

928
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
Magi Chan.

929
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
That was at 3210 in the video.

930
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Incredible.

931
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Oh my God.

932
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I love that it appears on an A and Y live stream.

933
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Dude, I wonder, I wonder if Magi Chan is going to appear in this PCP episode.

934
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,680
Magi Chan went so fast, not even in the video at all.

935
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Oh my God.

936
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
You're right.

937
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
He might be in it.

938
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
He might be here among us right now.

939
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,280
He's probably visited all of us, like while we're on here, just to make sure that we're

940
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
not slandering his and his wife's name.

941
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,640
It's kind of terrifying.

942
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
We are not.

943
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Praise the God.

944
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
What is it?

945
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,040
Exclamation point, infinite revive, exclamation point, goddess protection, exclamation point,

946
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
goddess healing.

947
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,000
Is there any irony in the fact that it's a live stream of them discussing the God Delusion

948
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
by Richard Dawkins?

949
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Is there some symbolism involved in this particular?

950
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Is that true?

951
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Is that really?

952
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah.

953
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
They're reviewing the God Delusion.

954
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's fucking rich.

955
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That's fucking rich.

956
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,800
By the way, I just want to point out, my favorite, this amazes me that one of the panels that

957
00:41:51,800 --> 00:42:00,360
Chris Drew is Chris Chan Sonichu holding up a slime podron, the one that Phantom Horn

958
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,080
mined on his first mining.

959
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,200
He holds up the slime podron and he discusses it, and I forget his exact wording, but he

960
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,640
calls it a podron.

961
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,040
He says a slime podron and he says that it can be used as a healing crystal with minor

962
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,440
slime side effects, which is absolutely true, and literally what it does in the game, or

963
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,000
one of the things it does in the game.

964
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
He knows what's up.

965
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,200
He literally says this thing is good, this is a good item, and then he says, oh, but

966
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,600
slime is all evil and he tries to obliterate all slime.

967
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,680
It's funny to me how it attentive Chris Chan is.

968
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,200
The fact that he was attentive enough to, she, fuck, getting confused, talking about magic

969
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Chan.

970
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,320
She's attentive enough to talk about the podron and call it by its proper name.

971
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,120
The fact that enough care was put into it, enough consideration was given that she learned

972
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,920
the word podron and used it is like, oh, that fucking is like success, mission accomplished,

973
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,920
we got her.

974
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,640
By the way, Ben, so Chris was on your case, and okay, I loved some of these tweets about

975
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,560
like, hey everyone, just letting everyone know that it's also ugly is going to be financing

976
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
this expansion.

977
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
Yeah.

978
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
I mean, okay.

979
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Incredible.

980
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,720
And everyone will love the fact that Ben is going to be paying for it.

981
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I love that fact.

982
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
I really do.

983
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
Why would anyone else care about that?

984
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,680
I could not be going to put that social pressure on you, Ben, you know?

985
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,480
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

986
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
That's what it is.

987
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,680
It's like, it is like a weird like sort of like social bullying kind of thing.

988
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,960
It's like, well, now I got it, now I got it, because she said I will.

989
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,720
I think that was the intent on Ironclash.

990
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,080
It's absolutely, absolutely that was the intent.

991
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Okay, but be amazing.

992
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,760
So, not only is Chris literally like kind of extorting you for this money, but also

993
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,800
like talk about, in a way, in a way, not exactly, but they're whatever.

994
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,240
Any normal person did this, we'd be like, well, this is fucked up.

995
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
What the hell?

996
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,640
But like beyond that, Chris is getting on your case for using her OCs and like, you

997
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,480
know, cloud chasing and whatnot, and yet is making, is using phantom horn and strawberry

998
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,800
milk and endless war rampantly in her own work.

999
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,880
I mean, the hypocrisy is off the fucking charts here.

1000
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,040
She literally, you know, that's funny.

1001
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,040
I didn't even consider like, it's actually even worse than it sounds, because she

1002
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
literally does the exact same thing.

1003
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Exactly the same.

1004
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,760
That she demands that I pay her for, like we both do the same thing to each other.

1005
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,880
And then she says, okay, well, now you have to pay me for both things.

1006
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,440
It's, you have to pay, you should pay me.

1007
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:41,440
MagiChan literally says, the two reasons are, like one, because Chris made the cards, you

1008
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
should pay her.

1009
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,440
And also because you use the characters, you should pay her.

1010
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
Yeah, exactly.

1011
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Are you fucking kidding me?

1012
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,920
You're you, and then Chris is using the setting, you should pay her.

1013
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,120
You know what it is?

1014
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,120
I feel a little bad because I know, and I have had interactions with these people, there

1015
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:03,400
are some like, there are some real, there are some real fucking like weird kids or something

1016
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,160
that like, Chris thinks are her friends that are like, and like, this is, this is their

1017
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,800
influence, I think, like I think, I think some people that Chris, that have tricked Chris

1018
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,480
into thinking they are her friends, they're definitely not, they're very, very not, very

1019
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,880
much not, I'm sure.

1020
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,080
But I don't know, I think these people are telling her to do this.

1021
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,400
So I'm maybe not as mad as I would be.

1022
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,680
I feel like, I mean, she shouldn't do this, but also someone else is telling her to, I

1023
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
don't know.

1024
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,960
It sucks, and I don't like it, but there's nothing I can do.

1025
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:44,960
If I, honestly, I wish I could get rid of these people, like literally for Chris' sake,

1026
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:53,080
I wish I could get rid of these, I don't know, weird pseudo trolls slash white, and I don't

1027
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:58,400
know, a lot of them seem to be pretty, they're either like really, they might be kind of

1028
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,040
sick people themselves, honestly, like they seem unhinged.

1029
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,400
Just on that one grilling of you on that live stream doesn't speak too highly.

1030
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:13,240
I think it's like they put themselves forward as if they were white knights, but clearly

1031
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,560
some of them have ulterior motives that just like fucking with Chris, but they sort of

1032
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,160
shield themselves with people who do care about Chris.

1033
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,480
I think a couple of them genuinely think that they do, like there was that one girl who

1034
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,120
seemed genuine, and then all the other ones were just like, yeah, make it interesting

1035
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,120
though, yeah.

1036
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
Yeah, that one.

1037
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,720
Hey, we're gonna dox you, hey, give us your, give us your, give us your, send, you better

1038
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,000
send Chris all the money from whatever, from the comic that you're putting for free on

1039
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Twitter.

1040
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Indeed.

1041
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,320
And then, I don't know, just, and there's like, there's like a weird little cabal of

1042
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:52,520
people that are all associated with this person who is like sort of Chris' internet boyfriend

1043
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,440
or something, and they all seem like, there's something wrong with them, I don't know what's

1044
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,640
going on, I don't like, I don't like thinking about them, and I don't care, like to me the

1045
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,760
least interesting part of the Chris thing is like the real life antics, like my favorite,

1046
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,360
my favorite Chris stuff was Alec Benson Leary who made Asperchu, and which was, you know,

1047
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,680
which was like a comic, and, and, and liquid Chris, which was basically just like an extended

1048
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,560
role play thing, like these, this was like, these were like fake, these were basically

1049
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,720
like fake story arcs that people just invented, and that's just like, that's so much more

1050
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,840
interesting to me than like, I don't know, what if we made Chris shove the medallion up

1051
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
her ass?

1052
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,400
Yeah, like that's fucking lame.

1053
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,600
Or like destroy their PS4, PS3 or whatever was, I mean, there's a certain amount of hilarity

1054
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
in there.

1055
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Oh, okay, well, I mean, that was a little funny.

1056
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:49,760
I mean, yeah, when, when, when you get Chris to do something herself, that, that, like

1057
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,680
that's what's funny, and, and the, the, I don't know, I don't, I don't, I don't care about

1058
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,680
that stuff.

1059
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,440
I kind of like that to think about it, but I guess it's, I guess it's all interwoven

1060
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
now.

1061
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,840
Some people have compared, like me and the, and the Nightstar comic to like Alec Benson

1062
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,360
Leary and Asperchu, which I'm flattered by that, because that's, that was a good arc.

1063
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,920
I would, I would, if I were, if I were, if I were, if I were, if I were remembered in

1064
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,040
Crystery as another Alec Benson Leary, I would say Mission Accomplished, great job.

1065
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,160
I did everything I wanted to do out, that was a good, it was a good arc, boys.

1066
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Yeah.

1067
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:25,720
Anyway, so that's, feel a little bad, feel a little bad for Chris being manipulated,

1068
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,440
but also like fucking, get the fuck out of here, this $300 bullshit.

1069
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,120
I mean, well, we all know Chris is not a perfect individual, many, many character, personality

1070
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,640
flaws, et cetera, et cetera, but I mean, yeah, I feel bad for anybody who's being taken advantage

1071
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
of.

1072
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,080
I mean, I guess you could say that, like, your involvement makes you somewhat part of

1073
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,120
that, but I mean, not, not, I don't think it's fair to give you the, the, you know,

1074
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,560
I haven't done anything.

1075
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,240
I haven't done anything wrong.

1076
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,080
I'm adamant that everything I've done.

1077
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,480
You've really only drawn a comic at the end of the day.

1078
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,600
That's really, and yeah, it's involved with Chris and Chris is a long time ago.

1079
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,840
I've just drawn a comic and if Chris's reaction to that involves some like weird psycho shit,

1080
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,320
like I don't think that's on me.

1081
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
I really don't.

1082
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Yeah.

1083
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
I don't know.

1084
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,720
Maybe the criticism would just be like to get involved with Chris period and openly

1085
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,120
invites these sorts of things and they're inevitable.

1086
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,600
So there's, you know, some.

1087
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
Victim blaming.

1088
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
No, it's not.

1089
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,560
Well, don't, you're blaming me.

1090
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
The victim.

1091
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
Uh, well.

1092
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,920
How short was that skirt, Ben?

1093
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,440
Perhaps you, uh, deserve.

1094
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,800
Uh, good.

1095
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
You know what?

1096
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Good point.

1097
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Okay.

1098
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
Touche.

1099
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,320
Um, boy.

1100
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,320
What a fucking week.

1101
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
Okay.

1102
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
I think, I think that's everything.

1103
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,360
How close are you to the end of Phantom Horon's comic?

1104
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,360
That's a good question.

1105
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Well, we're in the sewers right now.

1106
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,240
Uh, I'm not going to say exactly what's going to happen, but I think where it's probably

1107
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,520
maybe two thirds.

1108
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,400
I think I've been saying for a while that like it's almost done.

1109
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
It's almost done.

1110
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,200
Um, but it's, it's getting there.

1111
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,760
It's, uh, I know.

1112
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,040
Well, like acts one, two or three.

1113
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,040
Where are we?

1114
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,280
This is, uh, this is probably late act two.

1115
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Okay.

1116
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
It's cool.

1117
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Okay.

1118
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Yeah.

1119
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
Yeah.

1120
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
This is like, this is late act two.

1121
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,280
Well, I'm very interested to see where it goes.

1122
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm not sure what it's going to be like, but it is interesting to note that like when

1123
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,240
you're waiting for a Ben, uh, you know, like Vapors chapter, it's like, uh, Skeleton sitting

1124
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,400
at computer waiting for the update.

1125
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:32,040
But with this, it's like, every fucking day, there's like, basically every, basically every

1126
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
fucking day.

1127
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,040
Yeah, it's great.

1128
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,040
It's, it's wonderful.

1129
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,000
Well, I think it just speaks to the nature of the distribution of the product.

1130
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,440
You know, when you're working on the Vapors, you get no short term, uh, response.

1131
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,080
But with this, you're getting feedback and like engagement every day.

1132
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,080
It's got to be addicting.

1133
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,160
I mean, just a positive feedback cycle of, you know, people, plus you're contributing

1134
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,320
to something bigger than your own work, something that you've been following religiously for

1135
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,320
years.

1136
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Yeah.

1137
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
Yeah.

1138
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,320
Yeah.

1139
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,320
And like this.

1140
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,320
Yeah.

1141
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,320
There's like, I'm getting constant feedback about it.

1142
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
It feels really good.

1143
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,200
And also the sense that like I need to strike while the iron is hot on this.

1144
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
Yeah.

1145
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,200
If I, if I left it, it would be a big missed opportunity to let this go cold.

1146
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,000
So it's, um, and also I'm just really excited to, cause I have a really, I have a really

1147
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,800
an ending in mind for it that I really like.

1148
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,800
And it's just a, a story that I really want to be out there in the world.

1149
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,640
I'm just saying, Ben, wouldn't it be amazing if at the end of this, you also somehow in

1150
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,360
another way released this in some physical medium that one could put next to your other

1151
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,360
Ben words.

1152
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,080
I'm thinking about it.

1153
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,480
And at some point, I would love that all the custodians would buy a copy.

1154
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
It's Christian.

1155
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,200
At some point, that's, that's when you'd have to give Chris a $300.

1156
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Oh, he's right.

1157
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
He's right.

1158
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,240
I mean, it's like 120 or 140 pages long at this point.

1159
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,760
So, well, like pages, I mean, panels, right, right.

1160
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,400
But you know, Twitter size images, but like, yeah, no, it's long enough to be like a little

1161
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,400
mini book.

1162
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,560
So, um, yeah, honestly, at some point, I think I probably will do that.

1163
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,760
Ooh, I look forward to it.

1164
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,760
I want that too.

1165
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
Yeah.

1166
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,760
Yeah.

1167
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,080
I've been thinking of like the potential like, and maybe when I do, maybe, maybe like

1168
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,760
I make a bunch of money off and then I'll maybe I'll send, I'll send Chris $300.

1169
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
You are using his OCs.

1170
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
I did.

1171
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,760
I did you.

1172
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,360
I did use your OC in this.

1173
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
I did do that.

1174
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,920
And as a show of goodwill, here, here you go.

1175
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,420
Here you go, friends.

1176
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,880
I've been thinking myself about like making like book comic things and like whether Bale

1177
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,760
Jap would, would work because there's a lot of panels in that, there's a lot of text.

1178
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,740
It would work probably the same as like, uh, like a problem sleuth where the gifts would

1179
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:48,360
be just, you, you, Dave wouldn't be animated a series of images, but like that's technically

1180
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,360
possible.

1181
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
For sure.

1182
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,160
But I don't really feel like, I don't really feel like getting into another Kickstarter

1183
00:52:53,160 --> 00:53:00,200
before like, I know like the viewer base is big enough, at least the finished project

1184
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
though.

1185
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I mean, you know, it already exists.

1186
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,880
It's just a matter of do enough people want it to be on print and willing to buy.

1187
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,920
Maybe like when you finish like the next work or whatever, or have that started, that'd

1188
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
be a good time.

1189
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Well, give, you don't even need to run a Kickstarter.

1190
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,480
You could just put it on like KDP on Amazon and just have it be a print on demand book.

1191
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,200
And if people want it, they buy it.

1192
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Is that a thing?

1193
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,200
Yeah.

1194
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Now that's what we're looking into.

1195
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,440
Like I would design the entire like PDF of it or whatever and then you just upload it

1196
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,960
and people order it, they buy it.

1197
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,960
How did it all work with like covers and then hardback and paperback and the size of the

1198
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
book?

1199
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,520
They have like, you know, they have templates and you download and you format the templates,

1200
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,440
the book to the templates and stuff.

1201
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,880
I mean, people self publish all the time.

1202
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
That's how it works.

1203
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,440
You just upload it and people can buy it.

1204
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,040
That's our, I'll look into that.

1205
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,040
What was it called again, Tom?

1206
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,040
It's just on Amazon.

1207
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,080
You just go to Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing and you can do whatever the fuck you want.

1208
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
And then you're on Amazon.

1209
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,680
So could you do that with like a fully like illustrated?

1210
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,680
Yeah.

1211
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,680
People publish comics through Amazon all the time.

1212
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,680
Okay.

1213
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,680
Okay.

1214
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,720
Man, I wonder if like, because I have given absolutely no care at all to like color formatting.

1215
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,000
It's all just, there's a gradients all over the place.

1216
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,600
I feel like, I feel like physical printing would probably run into problems with the

1217
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,520
colors on a lot of my pages.

1218
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,800
I mean, Amazon has decent quality.

1219
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,120
I mean, it's going to be easier to print through Amazon that would be to like busting

1220
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,240
out a laser printer yourself and like grinding through it, you know?

1221
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
Yeah.

1222
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,240
Yeah, probably.

1223
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,640
So yeah, I had thought about this.

1224
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,200
Like, I'm like, this is like, this is like approaching book length almost.

1225
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
And yeah.

1226
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,760
I definitely like the idea of having physical comics.

1227
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Yeah.

1228
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,760
Yeah.

1229
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
Absolutely.

1230
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,440
Like manga collection, Lane, there's too many of those, like too many volumes for

1231
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
each manga.

1232
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,320
Like comic book collection is just the coolest thing ever.

1233
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,240
The only comic series I really want to own is One Piece.

1234
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,720
Other than that, just to have it all there to look at and appreciate.

1235
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,280
But other than that, like I just kind of want stuff that like has particular value, like

1236
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,160
all year guys' work I would love to have and, you know, that kind of stuff.

1237
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,720
I mean, I wouldn't want to collect like huge series of stuff, because then it becomes like

1238
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,720
unmanageable.

1239
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,960
But like, if there's like one to five volumes of something that I really care about, like

1240
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,800
that's fucking sick to just have on the shelf.

1241
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,800
Indeed.

1242
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,800
Oh yeah.

1243
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:32,120
Speaking of that sort of stuff, I recently just purchased the original black and white

1244
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:39,560
Scott Pilgrim volume one to six box because I have just finished reading it for the first

1245
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
time.

1246
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Really?

1247
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Yeah.

1248
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
You never read the whole thing?

1249
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,560
What'd you think?

1250
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
You never read the whole thing?

1251
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
I did not.

1252
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,560
I did not.

1253
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,560
I always meant to.

1254
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,560
Never got around to it.

1255
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,560
It's pretty solid.

1256
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,680
It's really good.

1257
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:58,360
I like something like it like seeing the movie and knowing that it's cool and stuff.

1258
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,920
I always felt like I should, but I'd never got around to reading it.

1259
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:09,200
But it's it's surprisingly like, I was not surprisingly way better in terms of a lot

1260
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
of things.

1261
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
It's different.

1262
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,200
The movie's good.

1263
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:19,040
But like so much of like how the story is structured with all of the seven or something

1264
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:25,800
evil exes and the amount of like the volumes are all like each is a self contained like

1265
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,400
part of the narrative.

1266
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:34,280
It deals with a different aspect of romance with Ramona and the evil exes related to that

1267
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,840
and everything that happens in that volume is related to that sort of thing, that sort

1268
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,240
of problem.

1269
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,040
And it's like, it's really clean.

1270
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,720
It's very clean as they say.

1271
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,720
It is very clean.

1272
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,960
So there is, I did reread it a couple of years ago and I was struck with the feeling

1273
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,840
of like, yeah, a lot of this stuff in the middle.

1274
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,560
I can see why they didn't make it in the movie.

1275
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,200
I feel like it's a little bloated in the middle.

1276
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,640
Like in the one that sticks out in my mind is the, okay, you know, there's the vegan

1277
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,640
guy Todd, right?

1278
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,640
Is it the vegan guy?

1279
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,600
In the manga, there's like an extended sequence in like the third or fourth book or something

1280
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:20,080
where like they, they had the part of their battle is they have to do like a race through

1281
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,840
this one Canadian like chain store and like the challenge is that they keep being blinded

1282
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,240
by all the deals.

1283
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,240
Okay.

1284
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,240
That's funny.

1285
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,240
It's like, oh yeah.

1286
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,240
I didn't understand that.

1287
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,240
No.

1288
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,240
Yeah.

1289
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,320
You'd have to be, it's just like a really stupid joke that only a Canadian would find funny.

1290
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,600
And even then I think they would probably, it seems a little eye rolly.

1291
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
I don't know.

1292
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,840
It's funny that it's there.

1293
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,800
It's like, it's a little charming that it's there, but also like, I can see why they skip

1294
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,800
this.

1295
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
Yeah.

1296
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
Yeah.

1297
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,480
I mean, there's a lot of like stuff in like the middle.

1298
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,640
There's a lot of like extraneous other characters that come in that are like really tangential

1299
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,640
and tertiary.

1300
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,200
I mean, I can't think of too many that are like pointless.

1301
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,640
Like that thing with Todd in the supermarket was like pretty pointless, but like.

1302
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,200
There's like other girls that show up.

1303
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,360
There's like another, like Scott's old classmate shows up and he like wants to fuck her for

1304
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,720
a while, but she just goes away later.

1305
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Yeah.

1306
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,000
But she plays into like the thing that he's dealing with with Ramona at that point is sort

1307
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,920
of like a, like a rejecting her, like staying true to Ramona was like a thing that allowed

1308
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,920
him to do.

1309
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
I can't exactly remember.

1310
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Yeah.

1311
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
I don't either.

1312
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,840
Like I can't analyze it off the top of my head, but I felt like that it was all like

1313
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,080
properly put there.

1314
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:44,080
Like it was very deliberate, very goodly done, but most mostly what I really love about Scott

1315
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,440
Pilgrim is just sort of like, yeah, why not like feeling to everything?

1316
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,440
Yeah.

1317
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,440
That's true.

1318
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,440
It has a lot of attitude.

1319
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,600
It has like a just a really good fun attitude to the way that it's just like, it's great

1320
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,000
and it's like reserved.

1321
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,760
It's reserved in the fact that it doesn't go ridiculous and it only goes ridiculous in

1322
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,560
the places where it would be like most, you know, beneficial emotionally for the reader

1323
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,640
to, for it to go that ridiculous, like near the end and all that.

1324
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,160
It's just, you know, it can do anything, but it doesn't do everything, which is great.

1325
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,000
I just, I just really appreciate it.

1326
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,280
It's an instant classic.

1327
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,800
Obviously, lots of people already knew this, but I, I finally, I finally read it.

1328
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,920
And if you saw my Twitter, I drew alley-oop in the style of Scott Pilgrim and people like

1329
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,920
that.

1330
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,080
The debate rages on about whether the black and white versions versus the color versions.

1331
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:47,920
And a lot of people say that the color adds a lot, which seems to be, it seems like it's

1332
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,600
a pretty high quality coloration, but the fact that the black and white was the way

1333
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:58,040
it was originally published, just, I don't know, it gives it a sense of like, this was

1334
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,320
how this was, this was what, like historically, this is the work that got popular and then

1335
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,480
it was changed later and given color.

1336
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,200
And just something about the fact that like this was the product as originally delivered

1337
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:15,160
that had that impact, that made that impact, that became what it eventually did, just gives

1338
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,040
it like an inherent value to me.

1339
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,240
Same with like one piece, which has a colored version that exists out there, but we all

1340
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,280
know that the black and white was the, it's, it's hard to imagine because I, I, I read

1341
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,840
it like illegally on illegal.com and I saw the color version first.

1342
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:39,280
I read all that, but I decided to buy color version online, like, uh, I don't know how

1343
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:45,240
good it is in print, but like the scans or like the, the PDF, whatever it is, it's perfect.

1344
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
It's really, really good.

1345
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,800
I mean, like perfect quality, but like, um, the coloration is like, it's really good.

1346
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,120
Like I can't imagine it having no color.

1347
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,120
And so that's why I'm buying, I'm buying like the physical, uh, colorless one so I can read

1348
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,120
it differently.

1349
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,800
And you know, Ben, on the subject, I actually gotten probably cost a lot less to, it probably

1350
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,800
true.

1351
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,800
Yeah.

1352
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Yeah.

1353
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:13,440
Each color one is like 26, like, uh, buckaroos, but like the black and white is like 15 for

1354
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,440
the whole set.

1355
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,440
So I definitely get in that.

1356
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,560
That's, uh, that, that's fucking, that's good value right there.

1357
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,560
Yeah, for sure.

1358
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,560
Indeed.

1359
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,880
Uh, so yesterday on my stream, uh, somebody asked me a question that was like, we were

1360
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,960
talking about like subs versus dubs a little bit and I, I like, I had made a point in my

1361
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:35,080
last we Agua that was like, whenever something exists that is like the original, but like,

1362
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,840
okay, you got your traditional, you got your anime, obviously it's in Japanese first.

1363
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:44,600
Um, my, my thing I want to do, I don't hate all dubs, but I always will want to hear it

1364
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,660
in the original version first.

1365
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,640
That will be my preference, all things considered, because it's obviously going to be the closest

1366
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,440
to like the base artistic, you know, vision of the creators who are Japanese, even something

1367
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,720
like, like space dandy, for example, was simultaneously produced in Japanese and English at the same

1368
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,640
time and released that way.

1369
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,920
But nonetheless, by knowing the fact that the guys like are Japanese who made the show,

1370
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,240
that just makes my brain think that the Japanese one is like, there's things that translate.

1371
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,320
It's kind of hard to capture everything in Japanese and English and like cultural differences.

1372
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:22,200
I mean, if the dialogue was written by a Japanese writer, then I guess you could say that like,

1373
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:27,560
even if it was simultaneously produced, you know, it was still like written in, in Japanese.

1374
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,640
It's just like the time it was, which I imagine it was.

1375
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:36,040
I feel like though, like space dandy is one of the, the closest it comes to have the English

1376
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,640
version just being like almost better, like, like it's at least equal.

1377
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,360
I did like the dub of space dandy a lot.

1378
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:49,160
And like, if there's a choice, I mean with language, it's different from like color versus

1379
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,160
non color.

1380
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,960
Experience whatever I feel like, and that'll be my initial one.

1381
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,120
And then I can make a judgment later.

1382
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,960
I don't have like a preference for what was originally intended necessarily.

1383
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:07,280
But with language, I guess I, I don't really have a, I guess it's just usually whatever

1384
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,280
I click on first.

1385
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:16,240
I was watching Karakana and I initially started watching the dub just because like, you know,

1386
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,360
maybe it's good, I don't know.

1387
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:24,400
But the, the, the boys like character voice was like super deep and like chocolatey and

1388
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,520
like that didn't fit as like character design at all.

1389
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:34,160
It was like too old, like, like a 34 year old man and like a teenager's body didn't work.

1390
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,000
So I switched to Japanese and it was immediately incredible.

1391
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,120
So like, I always like to do a little bit of testing the waters because I, I don't assume

1392
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,080
all dubs are worse.

1393
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,520
So I might try them, but sometimes I just forget to try them.

1394
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,760
I just, I, I want to get the original version.

1395
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,080
I don't know.

1396
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,280
I already said something about that.

1397
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:53,920
Yeah, I need to.

1398
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,520
I feel like I'm getting, when you watch the original original, it feels like you're getting

1399
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:03,840
the historical context in a way that you're not getting as much with like an adaptation

1400
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,080
or a translation or a remaster or whatever.

1401
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,560
That were both released simultaneously.

1402
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,440
Oh, I mean that, yeah, then I think you, well, you know, that's, that's closer to the original.

1403
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,760
You know, there's a thing with that because like with video games, remasters and emulation

1404
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:30,640
and remakes and stuff, I would generally like them, the earliest version of the thing, but

1405
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,400
I think realistically in the, in the, in the ways that as like consoles break down and nobody's

1406
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,680
making these old consoles anymore, these old games on these old hardware is going to be harder

1407
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,560
and harder and much more expensive over time to play.

1408
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,160
And so it's like,

1409
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,320
Like an emulation.

1410
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:50,960
Yeah, but that's the thing.

1411
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,240
And emulation is not always the same as how it plays on the original hardware on like a

1412
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,760
CRT television and stuff.

1413
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,680
Like it's designed for that kind of television.

1414
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,120
It's designed to be played in a certain way with certain hardware.

1415
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:08,160
And if you don't, if you can't get the hardware, you may as well just judge it based on how

1416
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,440
emulatable, like how the emulation works, because getting all of that stuff, like if you,

1417
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,080
I mean, I was thinking about this when I used to review things.

1418
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,520
What is the purpose of reviewing the original version of something when somebody would need

1419
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,480
to like invest so much money in order to play it properly?

1420
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,440
When there's the emulation, there's like worse.

1421
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,400
So like, do you review that as the game or do you not, or do you review both?

1422
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,440
You know, it was a fascinating example that did you once brought up years ago,

1423
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,760
which was that during design of games for the Game Boy Advance, I don't know if he knew this

1424
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,480
for sure, but it seemed to be his impression that like when designing for the Game Boy Advance,

1425
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,560
which did not have an inherent backlight or anything, they deliberately seemed to

1426
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,800
artistically choose really bright colors for the games that they were designing,

1427
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,800
because they had to make up for the fact that there was no backlight and they were playing

1428
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,040
with like, you know, whatever light was in the area.

1429
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:06,240
So brighter colors and whatnot would stick out more and be easier to register on the screen.

1430
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,200
And now if you're just playing that on an emulation on your fucking TV,

1431
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,360
it can look like fucking neon crazy shit.

1432
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,440
I mean, sometimes it's a little too much.

1433
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,520
I'm so used to how Fire Emblem seven and eight look on my Game Boy Advance

1434
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,480
SP with the little weak backlight that had.

1435
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,760
And then emulating it is like, it's too vibrant.

1436
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:31,040
It feels like a different game or like a lower quality version of the same game,

1437
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:36,400
where like you just up the contrast and now like there's no nuance in the colors,

1438
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,000
even though, you know, the original is the emulation.

1439
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,240
Yeah, yeah.

1440
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,440
I mean, that even happened during the Game Boy Advance's lifetime itself,

1441
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,320
because you had the original Advance, which had no backlight.

1442
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,400
Then you had the first SP, which had the side light, like the side lit screen.

1443
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,000
So kind of wash the colors out.

1444
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,200
But then they released the actual backlight version, which changed everything again.

1445
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,120
And then that was like super saturated.

1446
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,640
Which one was the folding one?

1447
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,080
Like the laptop one?

1448
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,960
That was the SP.

1449
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,320
But like they released two versions of it.

1450
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,720
They released another one that had an actual backlight.

1451
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,840
Oh, I didn't know.

1452
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,760
And that like because it was backlit, it was way more saturated the colors.

1453
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,400
And it looked like super over.

1454
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,800
I think I have the side light SP because.

1455
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,400
If you can turn the light off and still play it, it's the side light one.

1456
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,120
Maybe not.

1457
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,640
With the actual backlight, you turn it off and the whole screen turns black.

1458
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,400
Game Boy Advance SP, little laptop, adorable case, folded up.

1459
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,600
Backlight for the first time ever.

1460
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,240
Oh my God.

1461
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,760
And essentially a fucking charging cable so you can play forever and never have to stop.

1462
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,240
The SP was a life changer.

1463
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,040
What a revolution.

1464
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,720
Like the best thing in the world.

1465
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,480
Incredible.

1466
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,680
I can now play under my covers with the lights off, except my Game Boy.

1467
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,280
Oh, I used to do that all the time.

1468
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,240
Fucking based.

1469
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,360
Same here.

1470
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,720
How many of you.

1471
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,080
I wondered why I was so tired.

1472
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:59,040
How many of you with that Game Boy Advance SP power would hide it from your parents by

1473
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,000
closing the screen, saying, good night, I'm going to bed now.

1474
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,120
I'm going to be asleep.

1475
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:03,760
Oh, of course.

1476
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,080
Then you turn it back and flip it back open.

1477
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,280
Love that.

1478
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,400
Yeah, those.

1479
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,400
Those fools, those naive fools.

1480
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,480
They didn't understand technology and I did.

1481
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,760
I am the new generation.

1482
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,320
Exactly.

1483
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,680
Yep.

1484
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,160
You didn't.

1485
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,320
There's a literal intellectual stratification going on between you and your parents at this time.

1486
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,520
They couldn't even comprehend what was going on before their eyes.

1487
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,480
My parents grew up playing fucking Pong.

1488
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,840
Pong came out like the first shoot ever on my mom's when she was a kid.

1489
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,360
And now we got fucking SP.

1490
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,560
Now we got Pong too.

1491
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:35,920
Insane.

1492
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,040
Yeah.

1493
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,320
Now we got Pong too.

1494
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,200
There's no going back.

1495
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,720
He's being a Pong.

1496
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,040
I saw, you guys know the channel Ahoy?

1497
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,080
Nope.

1498
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,680
I don't know.

1499
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:47,760
I'm not sure.

1500
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,160
Okay.

1501
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:54,800
It's a really weird channel and it has like two or three really good videos and one is on the

1502
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,440
history of Polybius, you know, like the fake video game.

1503
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:58,720
Yeah.

1504
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,280
I know that.

1505
01:08:59,280 --> 01:08:59,840
I don't know.

1506
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,080
And they just released another or this guy.

1507
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,080
I think it's just one guy or maybe he's got a team.

1508
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,560
I don't know.

1509
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,680
He released another one about like what's the first video game.

1510
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:13,120
And it's like, you know, he goes like space war for some computer.

1511
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,640
That's there's it kind of tennis for two, right?

1512
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,240
Tennis for two on the yeah.

1513
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,240
He talks about all these.

1514
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,360
There's there's a couple other ones that are like contenders that I had never heard of.

1515
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,160
It's good.

1516
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,400
I really like these two like history videos are great.

1517
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,560
The rest of his channel is dog shit.

1518
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,280
It's amazing.

1519
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,160
Like really?

1520
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,240
These videos are really well researched, well written, well produced, great content.

1521
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,680
The vast majority of his channel is complete shit.

1522
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,160
It is like.

1523
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,120
How so?

1524
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,800
It's like he'll it'll all be some of them are talking about a specific game and some of them

1525
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:57,920
are talking about he has tons of videos that are just a like exploration of a of like a

1526
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,760
particular weapon like a specific like the talk about the rocket launcher.

1527
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,680
And he'll just talk about like every game that's ever had a rocket launcher in it.

1528
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,240
So I guess like the history of the rocket launcher, the history of the AR 15, the history.

1529
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,040
They get a lot of views.

1530
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,320
I'm seeing like millions of views.

1531
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,760
They get millions of views.

1532
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,720
They suck.

1533
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,920
They're so bad.

1534
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,760
I've seen a couple of them and it's okay.

1535
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,200
And it's just why are they bad?

1536
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:25,680
They're bad because I tried watching some and they all feel like I'm not learned.

1537
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,360
It's not really learned.

1538
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,520
Like maybe he'll talk a little bit about the gun itself.

1539
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,960
It's like I don't really care about that.

1540
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,760
But like fair enough, that's relevant to the subject.

1541
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:39,120
But like then he'll go through, he'll elaborate about the gun each and it's literally just like

1542
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,240
it just feels like each one is just like a five second blurb where he like talks about like

1543
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,440
in this game, this gun is really good.

1544
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:53,840
And here's like, in this game, this gun really gives you a fucking punch for your money, bro.

1545
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,040
But in this game, it really was felt like the dog shit and was bad.

1546
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,680
And this one, it really captured the way that the fucking bullet comes out fast and makes you go, ah!

1547
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:12,240
I hate, I was so amazed by the disparity in quality between these two videos that I love

1548
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,640
and everything else he has, which I hate.

1549
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:21,600
Those strange like 107 facts videos where the number of facts dilutes the

1550
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,360
interestingness of every fact.

1551
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,560
Yes, yes, you watch, like you start one of these videos and it's like

1552
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,640
two minutes into the actual knowledge, you're like, I'm over it.

1553
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,360
I'm so over it.

1554
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,400
I don't need to hear anymore.

1555
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,160
No more, please.

1556
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,440
I noticed that this guy went seven months without a video since this new video game

1557
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,960
one just came out two days ago.

1558
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,080
Well, I mean, I hope that means he's pivoting towards making stuff like this,

1559
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,760
because like this and the Polybius video are really great videos.

1560
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,480
Super good.

1561
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,280
The Polybius one is like, I've watched it like four times.

1562
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,320
It's excellent.

1563
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,480
Damn, it's an hour, eight minutes long.

1564
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,400
All right, well shit, I gotta check that out.

1565
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,280
Link in the description.

1566
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,880
That reminds me a little, you know, the guy I talked about who is crossing Wales,

1567
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,280
the country, the country Wales is not a whale.

1568
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:09,840
Yes.

1569
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,520
He crossed it in a straight line, you know, he finished that series,

1570
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,920
but the rest of his channel had up to that point been GeoGuessr videos.

1571
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,480
And, you know, like, basically he goes into a thing and he's like, hmm, well,

1572
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,480
you know, he's very good at GeoGuessr.

1573
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,040
He can guess the countries pretty accurately by looking around.

1574
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,880
What is GeoGuessr?

1575
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,360
It's a Google Maps based game where it plops you in a random location

1576
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,720
and you have to look around for a bit and then guess where you are in the world.

1577
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:49,280
And you can use like road signs and like language things and like environmental clues,

1578
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,400
like figure out where you are.

1579
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,800
And he's very good at it, but they're very boring.

1580
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,200
They're just the sort of like, it's a let's play show.

1581
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,040
And it's like, if you don't really care about it.

1582
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,200
Yeah, you know, like doesn't sound gripping.

1583
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,760
So like he does that and then he does this walk across Wales video.

1584
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,360
Most incredible video series on YouTube this year or like the last five years probably.

1585
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,360
And then he's finished.

1586
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,040
And then he goes back to GeoGuessr videos and like obviously nobody cares.

1587
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,280
Like you could gain so many subscribers and they all are like me included.

1588
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,040
And we're like, oh, what a shame.

1589
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,800
Can you do that thing?

1590
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,200
You thought you'd found a big well of new content and then you dive into it and you're like,

1591
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,480
like maybe he may in the future do.

1592
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,080
I mean, he's talked about doing another one.

1593
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,360
It'll probably be like four years or something.

1594
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,800
And then, oh, there it is.

1595
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,040
I don't want to watch these videos in the meantime though.

1596
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,720
But you know, I guess he has to make money.

1597
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,160
I just, you know, that's probably how most people feel about my channel

1598
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,160
and how it's got the two lectures that they like.

1599
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,640
And then all of a sudden like Pokemon Nuzlocke bullshit.

1600
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,560
Yeah, I imagine someone makes these incredible life changing anime reviews.

1601
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,120
Then they just churn out these shitty vlogs every week.

1602
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,880
I mean, geez, what a disappointment that would be.

1603
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,280
I mean, I get the feeling because I feel that way about Ahoy

1604
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,200
and I'm sure people feel that way about me.

1605
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,640
And I don't know, what are you going to do?

1606
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah, yeah, what are you going to find out?

1607
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,480
That's all.

1608
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:19,120
You separate your content, separate the content into different channels

1609
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,200
so people can subscribe to one or the other.

1610
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,520
But YouTube doesn't like you to do that.

1611
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,600
So they punish you for doing it.

1612
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,440
Yeah, they sure do.

1613
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,560
Yeah, I don't know.

1614
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,960
I mean, what good does it even do to have a channel?

1615
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,160
I mean, I guess it's easy.

1616
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,240
But like if you have it, let's say you have a channel where you just post

1617
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,680
like these amazing walk across the world videos and everybody loves them.

1618
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,360
But you only post once every year, maybe?

1619
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,080
I don't know.

1620
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,200
Is that good?

1621
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,400
Is that better?

1622
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,040
I don't know.

1623
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,880
It's obviously not better for him as like a business.

1624
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,240
He, you know, reaps an audience.

1625
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:54,000
I mean, people are very, very used to a content creator existing only

1626
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,720
if they upload every day.

1627
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,560
And if they don't upload every day, the people forget that they exist.

1628
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,160
And they're like, oh my god, you're alive?

1629
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,320
Like, lol, that was a joke a while back.

1630
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,480
People still say that.

1631
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,000
They do.

1632
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,640
And it's, I mean, it's what they really feel.

1633
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,640
Like you basically are dead to them if you stop posting for more than like two weeks.

1634
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,840
And I've always, I've ever since like this happened to Igoraptor way back where like

1635
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,000
animations were taking a long time to come out.

1636
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,760
People would go to his like comment section, like on his channel

1637
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,360
and just complain that he wasn't uploading frequently enough and they would unsubscribe.

1638
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,480
And I never understood-

1639
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,920
Oh, how we paid for that mistake.

1640
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:38,080
I never understood the, like the problem there because if you're subscribed to something,

1641
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,280
it's not like that you're paying money.

1642
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,640
It's not like you're doing anything.

1643
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,600
You just said, I'd like to see the next thing that comes out.

1644
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,640
And if it takes a while to come out, then you'll be notified for it later.

1645
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,560
Then you would maybe hope.

1646
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,760
But like, why would you unsubscribe?

1647
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,280
They put in the hard work of clicking subscribe because it's not putting out content fast enough.

1648
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,320
But if the, yeah, but if the content that it is putting out, even if it's infrequent,

1649
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:10,000
like if it's still stuff you like, you don't lose anything by being subscribed to a channel.

1650
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,400
I mean, I don't think people do that anymore.

1651
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,160
But like the way YouTube works now, it definitely plays into that because

1652
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,320
you're just, you're just nothing.

1653
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,040
You're nothing.

1654
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,920
You have no money if you don't post every single second.

1655
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,200
Yeah, you gotta, I mean, you should be posting daily.

1656
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,160
Everybody should be.

1657
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,120
Like that's the ideal way to do it, which is disgusting.

1658
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,440
But what are you going to do?

1659
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,480
I put a one second video every day of like-

1660
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,360
You just, you just got to like make an update video every day.

1661
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,160
Just you basically just have to become like a life blogger.

1662
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,000
Just be like, yeah, I'm just going to vlog my entire-

1663
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,880
All right, here's my new project.

1664
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,640
I'm going to record-

1665
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,080
You have to be a new storyteller.

1666
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,360
I have to, I'm going to record a 365 second long video.

1667
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,120
Oh yeah.

1668
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,400
And every day for one second of that video will be uploaded.

1669
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,480
That's a good idea.

1670
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,800
You know, literally you should make a new channel and do that and like see how it does,

1671
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,240
you know, like see if people are interested in-

1672
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,160
What if it just algorithmically crushes?

1673
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,400
Like who knows?

1674
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,800
It could, it could.

1675
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,480
There are other things that don't seem like they're going to be-

1676
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,680
I mean, there's no watch time because like I'm not going to get anything from it.

1677
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,600
I guess that's true.

1678
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,080
I guess that's true.

1679
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,800
Like 17 million videos and a one second video is like-

1680
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
You'll just, you'll just please the algorithm.

1681
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
It'll just be like, it'll just be like a sun offering-

1682
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,280
Please just punch.

1683
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,880
The algorithm to favor you.

1684
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,920
Just think about this.

1685
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,080
What if before, forget the watch time.

1686
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,800
What if before all those watches, if it gets a lot, you, you have just one ad,

1687
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,400
you know, just one ad before it.

1688
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,000
Financially, I mean, it could do well.

1689
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,880
It posts every day.

1690
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,680
You have like a 15 second ad before each of your one second videos.

1691
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,960
Exactly, exactly.

1692
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:45,680
Why not?

1693
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,560
Why not?

1694
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,920
And an ad afterward.

1695
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,320
Yeah, and then no, you have a one second of the video and you go,

1696
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,440
hey guys, thanks for watching.

1697
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,200
This video is sponsored by Skillshare.

1698
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,320
It'd just be like, hey guys, thanks for watching.

1699
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,920
Oh, I mean, it's a really funny idea.

1700
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,520
I wish someone would do it.

1701
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,480
If, if not you-

1702
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,840
I mean, I may as well.

1703
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,400
Why not?

1704
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,520
Like who gives a shit?

1705
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,400
Yeah, you should.

1706
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,480
Take a day and schedule them all.

1707
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,880
Put them up on, I don't know, some, some monetized channel.

1708
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,080
I'll just put it up on Gibbentake.

1709
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,440
Oh, actually, that's not, that's-

1710
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,720
Gibbentake 2020.

1711
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,120
Gibbentake is like completely demonetized forever,

1712
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,320
so I can't do anything on there.

1713
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,520
What?

1714
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,160
Yeah.

1715
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:26,560
Why?

1716
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,040
Why is that?

1717
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:27,440
I don't know.

1718
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,080
I, I appealed it twice and just said no.

1719
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,360
So like, I don't know why.

1720
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,640
Obviously they didn't tell me.

1721
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,560
I think I've explained this on the PCB before.

1722
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,120
It's got it.

1723
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,320
It's just sort of like fucked.

1724
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,920
So I can't put it on there.

1725
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,720
Maybe it's like-

1726
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,400
They really didn't like your My Little Pipe.

1727
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,840
Yeah, that's probably it really.

1728
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,400
It's just like-

1729
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,720
Clopping is not okay, Gibb, and you need to learn.

1730
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,080
Oh, no, you're right.

1731
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:46,400
Whoops.

1732
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,280
That's not family-friendly content.

1733
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,600
I do, I do have a few videos where I say fuck.

1734
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,560
At, even in the title.

1735
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,360
Are you crazy?

1736
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,720
Including this one where I just said fuck.

1737
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,080
I don't, I don't, I don't pretend.

1738
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,480
I don't pretend to understand how the algorithm works.

1739
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,280
It's beyond me.

1740
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,160
Me either.

1741
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,120
It's praise be.

1742
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,120
All right.

1743
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,720
Bullshit meta art piece YouTube things.

1744
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,160
I remember Jay Bauman had a YouTube channel,

1745
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,080
or still does under his name.

1746
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,280
All the thumbnails and titles are him talking about something or other.

1747
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:33,360
But then the content of the video is just a static shot of a candle and a book.

1748
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,920
It's just they're completely out of order,

1749
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,840
all these different puzzle piece videos.

1750
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,440
You click on a new one,

1751
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,000
you think it's going to be Jay Bauman talking about something.

1752
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,320
And it's no, it's more footage of the candle flickering

1753
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,560
and the wax melting slowly for like 20 minutes.

1754
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,120
And there's nothing, I don't get it, but it's cool.

1755
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,600
It's-

1756
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,560
Is it the thumbnails?

1757
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,400
Are the thumbnails a joke of some kind, perhaps?

1758
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,560
Well, I think the joke is that you think that this is just some sort of stupid video bullshit thing.

1759
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,360
And it's even funnier than that.

1760
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,200
It's nothing.

1761
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,480
It's just nothing.

1762
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,280
Perfect.

1763
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,080
It's just what I want.

1764
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,720
Imagine that.

1765
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,960
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

1766
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,240
I remember looking at that and wondering what the heck the deal was, but it's good.

1767
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,360
Just his sense of humor.

1768
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:25,840
All right.

1769
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,680
Well, we could just get to the voicemails now if you want.

1770
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,400
I have something I want to bring up, but it is in the voicemails,

1771
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,720
so we will get to it inevitably in time.

1772
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,880
Wasn't there- Tom, didn't you have something that happened?

1773
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,800
He did, Ben, but that's within the voicemail.

1774
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,720
It's the same thing I wanted to discuss, and we will get-

1775
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,640
I will say that I'm working on DevTober.

1776
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,440
It's going great.

1777
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,160
I posted a video showing the work in progress of the boss fight.

1778
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:48,640
It's great.

1779
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,400
Give me money so I can keep making the game.

1780
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,520
I also added a new thing to my Patreon yesterday where I'm going to have rants for a dollar.

1781
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,680
So you can listen to me rant about shit for a dollar.

1782
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,480
Wow.

1783
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,600
You know, I also, incidentally, added something similar to mine,

1784
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,360
which is just if people pay five dollars in my monthly video or whatever,

1785
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,040
if you're at the $10 one, then I will also just answer whatever fucking question you want.

1786
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,920
So there you go.

1787
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,400
We were both had the similar of one month.

1788
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,480
So I have the $5 podcast where people can request topics for podcasts,

1789
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,080
and then for $1 you get rants, which nobody gives me questions for.

1790
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,480
I just do it whenever I get mad at something.

1791
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,760
Because I'm too much of a bitch to put them on Twitter and get the blowback.

1792
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,640
I don't want to deal with it.

1793
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,640
So I just put them on Patreon instead.

1794
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,360
Yeah, makes sense.

1795
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,360
It's great.

1796
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,800
So, yeah.

1797
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,560
Those people are already invested in that.

1798
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,240
Those people will give you the benefit of the doubt.

1799
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,520
Exactly.

1800
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,280
I can have a conversation with people who don't want me to die.

1801
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,960
In fact, they want me to live.

1802
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,840
Hence, they give me money.

1803
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,520
Rare, rare privilege.

1804
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,120
Indeed.

1805
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:49,680
Indeed.

1806
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,480
I have also been doing monthtober,

1807
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,600
which is where you do something every day for a month during October.

1808
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,080
So I've been drawing.

1809
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,000
It's the same as last month, basically.

1810
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,800
Yeah, it's doing the draw streams and stuff.

1811
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,400
Are you still doing the streams daily?

1812
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,920
Is that still a daily thing?

1813
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,280
Yeah, every weekday I do a stream to a wrapped audience of seven.

1814
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,680
And that's pretty cool.

1815
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,720
Well, I mean, the end result is these noir red man comics, which...

1816
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,720
Boy, I've got fucking excited when I saw those.

1817
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,600
I saw those on your Twitter.

1818
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,640
I was like, oh my...

1819
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:32,960
Okay.

1820
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,440
Yeah.

1821
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,080
You're going to make more?

1822
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,200
You're going to make more?

1823
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,760
I'm going to maybe make one tonight.

1824
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,000
Because I haven't thought of an idea for today what I'm going to draw,

1825
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,240
but the more red man is good.

1826
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,840
I'm going to be...

1827
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,520
I'll probably continue streaming myself drawing more of the Phantom Horn comic,

1828
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,640
because that's pretty good.

1829
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,720
I think people like that.

1830
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,440
Pretty epic.

1831
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,080
Pretty epic.

1832
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,200
Maybe I'll get trolled some more.

1833
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:03,840
You never know.

1834
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,200
God, I hope so.

1835
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,400
God, I wish that were me.

1836
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,160
All right.

1837
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:10,880
Well, let's do it.

1838
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,400
Let's go to the voicemails.

1839
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,200
We got them right here.

1840
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,000
Speakpipe, people, link down below.

1841
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,280
Speakpipe, link, whatever.

1842
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,240
Leave us voicemails.

1843
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,280
And I've got to say, so we're getting there a little bit early today,

1844
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,280
because there's just a fucking bunch of them.

1845
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:27,360
And they've been of higher quality, and they are good, and I enjoy them.

1846
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,840
I'll be the judge of that.

1847
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,200
So we'll spend a little longer.

1848
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,160
Yeah, well, you can let me know if that's true or not.

1849
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,000
Oh, I think there was one.

1850
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,720
This is like the classic pre-real start of the voicemails.

1851
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,880
This is just kind of a life update one.

1852
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:48,640
So let's see what the PCP Shadow Puppet Master has for us today.

1853
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,760
All right, get to it.

1854
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,000
Go.

1855
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,200
Okay.

1856
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,320
Okay.

1857
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:59,840
Secretly, I am the PCP Shadow Puppet Master.

1858
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,160
You may not realize it.

1859
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,440
I might sound familiar, but here's the thing.

1860
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:14,880
I originally submitted a voicemail a few weeks back, calling for more voicemails.

1861
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,240
And what happens?

1862
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:16,960
That's not true.

1863
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,560
More voicemails come in.

1864
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,800
That's kind of strange coincidence.

1865
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,720
It might I say the quality of them has been higher.

1866
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,600
I knew you could do it, PCP audience.

1867
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:36,080
I am grateful for you because I too have submitted many fucking voicemails that have

1868
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,320
all gotten in.

1869
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,200
Okay.

1870
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,000
This is what is up.

1871
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,160
If you guys have noticed that quality increase of voicemails,

1872
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,720
you might want to thank me, PCP Shadow Puppet.

1873
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:51,280
Master.

1874
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,160
Well, there you go.

1875
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,400
Like I said, thanks for all the voicemails.

1876
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,320
My dude, you did.

1877
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,640
I don't know if he's the PCP Puppet Master.

1878
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,080
He's more like the voicemail.

1879
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,720
He's the PCP audience master pulling their strings and yanking their chain.

1880
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:12,000
Pulling the strings that connect to his own arms and legs.

1881
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,640
And their vocal cords to elicit dulcet tones for us to respond to here.

1882
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,080
Let's thank you Shadow Master.

1883
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,120
Let's get the next one.

1884
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,160
Yeah.

1885
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:22,720
Here we go.

1886
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:27,600
Next one is from BradoSanDakoku.

1887
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:27,920
Okay.

1888
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,640
Great.

1889
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,360
Go.

1890
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,040
Like what the hell bros?

1891
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,880
So like there's this chick, right?

1892
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,480
And I said that she was fat, but I still fuck her.

1893
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:37,520
Right?

1894
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,520
I'm like, she got some piss at me.

1895
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,000
Like what the hell is her problem, bros?

1896
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,320
I need some opinions on this, especially of mages on.

1897
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,120
Like is this a compliment or an insult?

1898
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,080
I mean, I'm pretty sure it was a compliment.

1899
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,200
Yeah, no, no, for sure.

1900
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,840
It's a very, no, it's a very funny insult.

1901
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,920
And I think you should continue to do it.

1902
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,560
It's yielding results already.

1903
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,000
So just stay the course I say.

1904
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,520
We got a great voicemail out of it.

1905
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,080
So we all had a lot of laughs.

1906
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:10,560
Keep it up.

1907
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:11,920
Keep up the good work, my dude.

1908
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:13,600
Yeah.

1909
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,960
I have no further commentary.

1910
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,240
I'm gonna stay the course.

1911
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,880
The problem is clearly with the children, not with you.

1912
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,960
No, it's the children that are wrong.

1913
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:24,400
Well, there you go.

1914
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,280
That's all there is to it.

1915
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,920
Excellent work.

1916
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,440
This is great, by the way.

1917
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,360
These are great.

1918
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,160
Okay, no, no.

1919
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:30,880
Get ready for this.

1920
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,440
Get ready for this.

1921
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,000
Because we've got an actual five-star chef,

1922
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,440
not a joke on why we're all wrong culling in.

1923
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,200
So, okay, let's hear it.

1924
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,400
Sweetest chef.

1925
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,200
Okay, what's up?

1926
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,120
I'm a real actual five-star chef.

1927
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,200
I've worked in a couple of famous hotels,

1928
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,040
like the Jefferson and Richmond, Virginia,

1929
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,560
and the Omni in Charlottesville.

1930
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,720
I'm a culinary school grad,

1931
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,360
and while I was there,

1932
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,200
I cooked with a bunch of celebrity chefs,

1933
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,240
including Guy Fieri, oddly enough.

1934
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,120
Jesus Christ.

1935
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,200
I'm here to settle the score on Hello Fresh.

1936
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,120
Here's it.

1937
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,640
Here's it in a nutshell.

1938
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,120
Ben is both correct and a massive retard.

1939
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,800
Nate is just a retard.

1940
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,320
Munchy is a little baby boy,

1941
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,080
so he gets a pass, but he's wrong.

1942
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,960
I made it at the best.

1943
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,200
What I think Ben is trying to say

1944
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
is that the biggest problem with Hello Fresh

1945
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,280
and those Amazon ready meals or whatever they're called

1946
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,200
is that they teach you recipes and not techniques.

1947
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,440
And in order to be a good cook,

1948
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,320
recipes are literally not worth the paper they're printed on

1949
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,520
because they don't teach you things like knife skills,

1950
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,960
searing, sauteing, blanching, flavor bases,

1951
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,560
how to season things properly.

1952
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,360
So here's the difference between you and me.

1953
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,600
We could both be given one of those ready meals

1954
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,040
with the same instructions,

1955
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,520
the same pots, pans, and stove to cook it on,

1956
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,040
and mine will come out better 100% of the time.

1957
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,080
And that is because I know these foundational things.

1958
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,480
So if you want to learn those,

1959
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,360
you need to check out Tim Ferriss as the four-hour chef.

1960
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,480
Tim Ferriss is a guy who wanted to be a post-food boy

1961
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,200
and hated cooking and decided the best way to do that

1962
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,800
was to master cooking.

1963
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,280
So it's written for people exactly like you.

1964
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,480
So yeah, learn some techniques.

1965
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,040
Peace.

1966
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,720
Sounds really cool.

1967
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,600
And that was a quality voicemail.

1968
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,080
Yeah.

1969
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,080
Now that's what I'm talking about.

1970
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,240
It's almost like when someone has experience,

1971
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,440
they can speak on a subject with some sense of intelligence.

1972
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,160
I'll put that...

1973
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,440
It's very rare on these parts.

1974
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,240
I'll put that guy in a voicemail for dropping genuine...

1975
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,280
Any of voicemail?

1976
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:28,800
Am I crazy?

1977
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,920
Oh, come on.

1978
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,120
I didn't even get one giggle, one goofle out of that.

1979
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,240
I learned...

1980
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,520
But I gained knowledge.

1981
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:36,640
I gained...

1982
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:37,920
We didn't do the category.

1983
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,880
It's the voice braille.

1984
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,360
It's not the voice comedy award.

1985
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,720
I disagree with the distinction.

1986
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,160
The distinction without a difference.

1987
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,840
I definitely agree with him, by the way.

1988
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,320
From my dad, I've learned a lot of cooking techniques.

1989
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,440
And so I know what you're supposed to do with steaks

1990
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,640
and when you're frying and how to do this and that,

1991
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,400
and how to chop onions properly.

1992
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,680
But I don't know any recipes at all.

1993
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,680
But when I Google something, it works out.

1994
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,040
So...

1995
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,160
That's all you need.

1996
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,120
Now, okay.

1997
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:11,920
Sure.

1998
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,320
See, I agree with his point.

1999
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,240
But I will say, I will say,

2000
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,200
that I think he's coming from a different perspective.

2001
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,160
Yeah, a perspective of knowledge, as opposed to ignorance.

2002
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,080
Okay, because here's who I am.

2003
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:24,800
Here's who I am.

2004
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,760
I'm a poor orphan boy on the side of the road saying,

2005
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,840
Papa, please, sir.

2006
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,280
I need something that tastes at least kind of decent.

2007
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,560
I'm dying of hunger.

2008
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,600
I don't know what I'm doing.

2009
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,640
Why is like a ready...

2010
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,440
They were literally free.

2011
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,560
They were literally free.

2012
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,520
They did not pay for it.

2013
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,480
Well, this is important.

2014
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,600
That is important for you.

2015
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,480
That makes all the difference.

2016
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,720
The voicemail guy did direct you to a book thing that would...

2017
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,240
A resource that I'm sure you have.

2018
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:53,760
That is from your perspective of a guy who wants to be post-food.

2019
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,440
Intellectual elite, five-star chef coming on and saying,

2020
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,600
like, Nate, you need to go to school for five, 10,000 years

2021
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,560
before you can cook a meal.

2022
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,040
That's not what he said.

2023
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,080
So just die of hunger, Nate.

2024
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,400
He said, read a book by Tim Ferriss.

2025
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,680
Just die of hunger, Nate.

2026
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,040
I'm hungry now.

2027
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:09,840
No eating until you read this book.

2028
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,000
I'm going to McDonald's.

2029
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,120
And that's final.

2030
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,240
I'm getting a Big Mac.

2031
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,040
He also said you're a retard and you're proving it right now.

2032
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,560
You keep getting McDonald's.

2033
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,720
I'm going to have to kill you one of these days.

2034
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:22,960
I'm just...

2035
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,280
No, I'm for McDonald's.

2036
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,320
I'm pro McDonald's.

2037
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:27,600
McDonald's is one of the better.

2038
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,800
McDonald's isn't even keto.

2039
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,280
It is if you do it like me.

2040
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,680
Dude, $3 for two McDoubles.

2041
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,120
You just take the buns off.

2042
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,560
And it's four beef patties for $3 and you just eat them.

2043
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,120
And it's great.

2044
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,000
It seems...

2045
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,320
It's great.

2046
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,600
Are they, like, good, though?

2047
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,080
Yeah.

2048
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,200
Like, those patties are kind of...

2049
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,360
Honestly, I highly recommend it.

2050
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,800
It's keto, keto, bonito.

2051
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,560
Bringing it back to the first thing I said.

2052
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,920
Bring it all the way back to the beginning.

2053
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,440
All right, we're ending the podcast right here.

2054
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,240
Good night, everybody.

2055
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,400
All right, what's next?

2056
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,360
Oh, oh, you know what?

2057
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,000
There was another call from the five-star chef.

2058
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,120
Now, I thought he was good.

2059
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,320
I'm tempted to just skip it because it's...

2060
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,240
Okay, it's the five-star chef one last time on why I subsist on...

2061
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,920
Why I subsist Huell, which I think was a typo.

2062
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,840
I think he meant, like, resist or something.

2063
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,960
And I'm afraid this will bring his average quality of voicemail down.

2064
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,160
But, okay, now I have to play it.

2065
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,520
Yeah, I want to hear it.

2066
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,240
I want to hear what he has to say.

2067
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,520
All right, let's hear what he has to say.

2068
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,400
Here's the second one.

2069
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,400
Beware of the tipping point of cooking.

2070
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,840
Once you reach it, you will never be able to eat out again.

2071
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,720
Because even if the food tastes good,

2072
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,560
you will always know that it could be better.

2073
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,080
And as a result, it ruins the experience.

2074
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,200
This is why it's a great way to become a post-food boy, however.

2075
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,240
So, this is...

2076
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,600
And another reason to bother to learn it

2077
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,600
is when it comes to impressing dates, you're done.

2078
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,320
You're set.

2079
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:52,800
That's true.

2080
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,400
Impressing your significant other.

2081
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,560
You never have to buy a birthday present ever again.

2082
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:01,760
You just make them standing rip roast with some fucking mashed potatoes

2083
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,280
or some other shit like that.

2084
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,240
Bitches love that shit.

2085
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,120
Some rice pilaf and some salmon.

2086
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:08,800
There you go.

2087
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,240
You're never obligated to buy a present

2088
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,920
or pay for an expensive dinner.

2089
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,040
Literally ever again.

2090
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,360
Well, I don't know about all that.

2091
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,400
Bitches still want that diamond, that rock.

2092
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,440
Just put a gold bar in the pie.

2093
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:23,760
Yeah.

2094
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,960
I love this idea of the best way to...

2095
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,600
Like, if you hate cooking, if you want to be post-food,

2096
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,600
you must acquire the knowledge necessary to defeat it.

2097
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,440
I don't understand this point.

2098
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,000
I love this.

2099
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,200
What am I missing here?

2100
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,960
It's like to be a post-food boy, you learn and you cook.

2101
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,920
Because if you can't cook for yourself, then you are a slave.

2102
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,280
You are a slave to others' ability to feed you, right?

2103
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,160
To cook for you.

2104
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,840
I think the difference here is that...

2105
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,880
You no longer depend on others.

2106
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,440
The more you understand food, the more freedom you have.

2107
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,600
The more leeway you have in how much control...

2108
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,520
Once you become a fucking elitist about it,

2109
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,360
you're not just going to go down to McDonald's

2110
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,240
and get your two McDoubles and just eat the four patties.

2111
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,520
Because you're going to look at those patties

2112
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,600
and see how disgusting they are compared to what you could do

2113
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,720
with your own two hands.

2114
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,240
So you'll get higher quality ingredients.

2115
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,120
No, that will always be great value.

2116
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,160
Value is one thing.

2117
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,600
Quality is another thing in time.

2118
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,880
Value is eternal.

2119
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,480
Value is undeniable.

2120
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,240
All right.

2121
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,680
That sounds very capitalist of you, Ben.

2122
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:37,600
I really feel like you could get an equivalent amount of meat

2123
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,240
for less than going to McDonald's for it.

2124
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:42,640
What's less?

2125
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:44,880
You're saying that McDonald's is not valuable?

2126
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,400
The four, whatever you said.

2127
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,720
Two McDoubles for $3.

2128
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,840
I feel like you could find an equivalent amount of meat

2129
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,400
like of an equivalent.

2130
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,840
I go to Walmart and I get 20 patties for $8.

2131
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,720
So I'm pretty sure that's...

2132
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,520
That's pretty good.

2133
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,560
...that balances out much better.

2134
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:08,400
Okay, I defy anyone to find a better keto deal than two McDoubles

2135
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,840
for $3. Throw the patties away.

2136
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,600
You just buy the meat from a butcher's.

2137
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,080
I just said 20 for $8.

2138
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,880
You buy the meat from a butcher's?

2139
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,720
20 for the patties for $8.

2140
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,440
But it's pre-cooked.

2141
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,240
You don't have to cook it.

2142
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,160
Okay, but we're talking...

2143
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,600
That's part of the value you want to offer here

2144
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,800
is that you don't have to prepare it.

2145
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,040
Yeah.

2146
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:25,680
Is that you just get it.

2147
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,480
I suppose that's true.

2148
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,360
I mean, okay.

2149
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:34,960
If I have to get in my car, drive down to McDonald's, order the food,

2150
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,240
spend the gas, take them apart and put them back together

2151
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,960
versus buy them once and then just throw them in a pan.

2152
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,960
Well, I'm with you in making the trip as a nightmare.

2153
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,600
I feel like the scale at some point starts to balance in my favor.

2154
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,040
Well, you know, we're not...

2155
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,960
You're on the road and you're just McDonald's right now.

2156
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,280
You just buy a cow and then you cut it in half

2157
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,200
and then the other half grows back

2158
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,120
and you can get another cow again.

2159
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,880
You can do this all day and day.

2160
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,320
Just take a bite out of your arm.

2161
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,520
It'll grow back eventually.

2162
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,520
All right, let's move on.

2163
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,360
We've got a thank you five-star chef.

2164
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,880
Are we putting them in the voice grail?

2165
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,000
Put them in the voice kitchen.

2166
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,720
Yeah, that's there.

2167
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,600
There you go.

2168
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,160
That's where he belongs.

2169
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,320
Your honorary PCP cook.

2170
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,440
All right, we got...

2171
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,360
Where we can extract the most value from him.

2172
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,400
Jade Murrow sounding dumb is the title of this.

2173
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:24,880
I know.

2174
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,680
Okay, Jade.

2175
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:25,920
All right, Jade.

2176
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,760
Sorry I haven't given you that script yet.

2177
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,320
One of these days.

2178
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:30,960
All right, go.

2179
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,240
Seeing as you all are different ages,

2180
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,920
how do you think you all would get along

2181
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,720
in a timeline where you're all your 20-year-old selves?

2182
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,560
Now, I thought this was an interesting question

2183
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,480
because we have to age up, munchy,

2184
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,960
and age down most of us and see like,

2185
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,480
what's that going to be like?

2186
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,920
What was I like at 20, you know?

2187
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,360
We wouldn't get along...

2188
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,640
Me and munchy wouldn't get along

2189
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,360
because I would be dumber and he would be smarter

2190
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,760
and then we wouldn't be on equal intellectual footing.

2191
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,080
I mean, I was like...

2192
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,400
I mean, this is before Nate's journey to the East,

2193
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,600
you know, the famous story.

2194
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,000
So, I was still a little bitch boy.

2195
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,200
I mean, well, I was 20...

2196
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,960
This is an incredibly difficult question

2197
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,360
because you're talking about changing our ages,

2198
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,640
but like, it's also like,

2199
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,960
are we going back to like what we were at the time

2200
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,560
or are we in present time now?

2201
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,240
This is like, what if we are all of our 20-year-old selves?

2202
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,280
Because we all have different levels of experience

2203
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,120
at that age.

2204
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,680
So, it's difficult to say.

2205
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,200
I mean, I think munchy would just be bored all of us.

2206
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,560
If we all grew up at the same time,

2207
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,480
we would all probably be on similar levels

2208
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,920
in terms of like cultural and like just ideas

2209
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,760
because like we've all come to the same conclusions

2210
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,280
as the culture has...

2211
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,440
A 20-year-old munchy will still be in college.

2212
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,000
He'll still be a nascent pupa of a nothing boy.

2213
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,040
But he's done so much more than I did at 20.

2214
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,720
He's done all these internet things that we've now done.

2215
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,560
Right, but the reason he's done more things at 20

2216
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,720
is because when we were 20,

2217
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,640
all this stuff was just starting to emerge.

2218
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,680
But I think we...

2219
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,240
I think it's still fair to like give munchy that up

2220
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,080
just because like it's...

2221
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,440
He just started earlier than us.

2222
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,000
He just did better earlier in life.

2223
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,160
Right, he started earlier because the culture allowed you

2224
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,240
to start earlier, became more of an accepted thing.

2225
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,960
There is that aspect, but not everybody who is munchy's age

2226
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:17,760
is like munchy.

2227
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,440
So like munchy is exceptional even among his age bracket.

2228
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,680
The thing that ties us all together right now

2229
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,200
is that we all have similar value structures.

2230
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,960
So if we were all the same age,

2231
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,720
I feel like we all would still be pursuing

2232
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,720
the same kind of things because those are reflective

2233
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,720
of our values combined with our modern experience.

2234
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,200
When I was 20, I thought I was going to go on

2235
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:41,280
to get my like PhD in physics and become like a scientist.

2236
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,800
I thought that was going to be like or become a professor,

2237
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,160
I think was what I wanted.

2238
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,960
But then it was as like the world continues,

2239
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,040
like as things happen to you, right?

2240
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,160
And you experience new things.

2241
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:52,880
And look at me now, falling.

2242
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,800
And that changed you into who you are today.

2243
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,280
Yeah.

2244
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,000
So like, I don't know.

2245
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah, yeah, it's complicated.

2246
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,440
We get it, old man.

2247
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,120
You're just trying to justify your decrepit body and soul.

2248
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:10,160
I mean, yes, I guess, sure.

2249
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,040
I'll cop to that.

2250
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,040
Hey, well, how is the, what are you saying?

2251
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,800
Like, how is that an argument against?

2252
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,160
I mean, Tom's point is making a fair point that like we,

2253
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,000
Munchie has had many advantages by simply existing

2254
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,800
later in time than we would have had slightly earlier

2255
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,240
because the development of, you know,

2256
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,000
things like YouTube online businesses,

2257
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,840
I mean, a 20 Patreon didn't exist.

2258
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,600
What would the fuck would we have all been doing,

2259
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,200
you know, without Patreon?

2260
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,960
And Munchie will have that at 20.

2261
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,760
That's okay.

2262
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,600
According to my YouTube channel at 20,

2263
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,080
I was like getting tired of the compilations

2264
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,480
and I was thinking about making a pony analysis channel.

2265
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,000
Okay.

2266
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,040
So that's where I was.

2267
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,040
Interesting.

2268
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,600
Sad.

2269
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,120
I was, I was a nothing man.

2270
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,960
I was the nowhere man of being the same.

2271
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,680
I was still in college and I was sad

2272
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,960
and I was making comics and trying to get them self-published

2273
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,520
and trying to, making my huge mistake

2274
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,280
of networking with terrible people

2275
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,040
and they're dragging me down.

2276
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,760
And I swore off humans for like three years after that

2277
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,720
until I got into MLP and realized that friendship was magic.

2278
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:15,200
Oh, ironically, what happened?

2279
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:15,840
Cramp.

2280
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,400
Cramp.

2281
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,120
Okay, it's fine.

2282
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,520
No, don't worry about it.

2283
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,000
All right.

2284
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,080
Speaking of decrepit old man bodies,

2285
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,400
a mere laugh drives back to the ground.

2286
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,880
Can I tell you, I have a story about my decrepit old man body.

2287
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,400
I've been feeling, I've been having, I've been suffering.

2288
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,680
I've been just waking up or like, just like,

2289
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,880
my back's been hurting, right?

2290
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,640
I've just been like, and like, there's nothing I can do.

2291
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,480
Like, no matter how I sit, it doesn't help.

2292
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,320
I can lie down, it doesn't help.

2293
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:41,280
It sucks.

2294
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,960
And exercise help with this?

2295
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,600
Not really.

2296
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,840
I hate to tell you, but that's how my back problem started

2297
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,680
and I'm getting surgery in two weeks.

2298
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,720
Well, I mean, I discovered, well, I mean, who?

2299
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:55,520
Yesterday, I discovered that like, it actually helps

2300
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,320
if I just fucking like, jam my knuckles into my back

2301
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:58,640
and just like roll it around.

2302
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,240
That's probably a massage.

2303
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:00,560
Yeah.

2304
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,960
And I, yeah, I've spent my entire life

2305
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,880
saying that massage is fake and a scam.

2306
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,920
And so now, so now I found the solution

2307
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,520
but I can't use it on principle.

2308
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,640
Yeah, that's fair.

2309
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,440
I've been thinking of going to a massage parlor,

2310
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,200
just the idea of like, you know, seeing what it's like.

2311
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:19,760
And then.

2312
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,280
No, massage is fantastic.

2313
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,080
I swear by it.

2314
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,160
I don't do it nearly enough because I can't anymore

2315
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,080
because if I lie down on my back for more than two minutes,

2316
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:26,960
it breaks in half.

2317
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,800
But before that, it was fantastic.

2318
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:30,080
Huh.

2319
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,480
I mean.

2320
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:30,960
Interesting.

2321
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,360
You know, when I was at Dom, maybe there's a little something to it.

2322
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,960
At my, at my last job, you know, my programming job,

2323
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,840
actually like once a year or so, fairly, there was like these

2324
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,560
every week, there would be like on Wednesday,

2325
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,520
there'd be like a get little take a break.

2326
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,680
Everybody hang out and kind of like chill for a few minutes.

2327
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,440
But, but really, you guys can get back to work.

2328
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,240
You got things to do.

2329
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,280
But as part of that, once every like six months or year or something,

2330
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,320
they have like a masseuse in the area,

2331
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,560
come to the place and give like little like 10 minute

2332
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:07,600
promo massages of like what she could do at like her actual boutique.

2333
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,760
So she would just come in and do like free massages.

2334
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,680
She probably got paid by like the company or something.

2335
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,520
But as a result, every once in a while,

2336
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,400
you could just sign up for like a free short massage at my job.

2337
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,560
And pretty, pretty, pretty sick.

2338
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,520
Man, what'd you leave?

2339
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:21,920
It's good.

2340
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,000
I can't, I don't know.

2341
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,640
Cause I'm an idiot.

2342
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,880
You had it all.

2343
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,760
He threw it away.

2344
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,920
It was a, I mean, like I said,

2345
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,440
I could have done that job the rest of my life

2346
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:32,320
and been pretty happy.

2347
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,360
And maybe I will when things don't go well on YouTube.

2348
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,080
We'll see.

2349
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,160
You know, when Ghost in the Shell finally comes out

2350
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,280
and everybody turns up in here.

2351
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:39,600
And nobody likes it.

2352
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:39,840
Yeah.

2353
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:40,400
Oops.

2354
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,600
Well, there I go.

2355
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,480
I'm the Ghost in the Shell of my YouTube career.

2356
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,240
Oh, don't you know that show is made by white supremacists though?

2357
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,360
And you're like, ah, damn.

2358
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:49,840
Is that true?

2359
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,680
Probably, right?

2360
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,560
Statistically, it's likely.

2361
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,960
I can't wait for next year, April, 2020,

2362
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,560
when Ghost in the Shell finally comes out

2363
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,840
and it's an April Fool's joke

2364
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,720
and it's just Scarlett Johansson movie review.

2365
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,800
And you prank everybody and everyone mass on subscribes.

2366
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,680
Oh, would that be epic?

2367
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:05,520
All right.

2368
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,520
Let's, let's move on to our next question here.

2369
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,720
Erdek's call.

2370
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,440
This is from Autism Quantified.

2371
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,640
And I think it's a little quiet.

2372
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,840
Oh, Digi's calling him.

2373
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,080
Yeah, indeed, indeed.

2374
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:16,400
All right.

2375
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,920
Let's, let's go here.

2376
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,400
I heard there's a new way of categorizing autism.

2377
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,040
My therapist cocks an eyebrow.

2378
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,720
He says that I seem like a well-adjusted guy

2379
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,400
and that there's surely nothing to worry about.

2380
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,480
I respond that I like to make sure.

2381
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,600
She nods and asks what kind of media I typically consume.

2382
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:36,080
The usual, I say, I read and I'm quite partial to anime.

2383
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,280
Her brow furrows.

2384
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,280
The answer clearly concerns her.

2385
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,280
She writes plus one on her notebook.

2386
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,520
My neurotical divergence increases by six

2387
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,200
and my communication stat plummets.

2388
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,440
Do you have any hobbies like sports or languages?

2389
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,200
Yeah, I'm learning a language.

2390
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:52,720
Her face lights up.

2391
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,560
Japanese, I add.

2392
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,080
She winces and increases my score by one.

2393
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,880
Conventional, I think, is increased by minus eight to three.

2394
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,440
I also write fanfiction.

2395
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,600
She skips straight to four.

2396
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,400
My alcohol tolerance and degeneracy increase dramatically.

2397
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,720
Two adder all appear in my inventory.

2398
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,680
Oh, and I write for a dating son.

2399
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,640
She seems more scared than anything now

2400
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,640
than I'm on the notebook reads six.

2401
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,760
I gain the ability to communicate through Pepe's

2402
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,240
and lose the ability to communicate in any other way.

2403
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,640
I elaborate that in the dating son,

2404
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:29,680
you romance a group of niche account artists called the PCP.

2405
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,240
She stutters that she doesn't know what comes after seven.

2406
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,360
As I take the notebook, she gulps.

2407
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,400
I write the number eight and rotate it by 90 degrees.

2408
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,320
We both die instantly.

2409
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,320
A happy ending.

2410
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,840
Fuck, what was the last thing you said?

2411
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:50,480
I missed it.

2412
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:54,560
I think I should, like, everyone dies or we both combust or they die

2413
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,520
is the implication.

2414
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:55,920
Great.

2415
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,480
Great storytelling on our own.

2416
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,600
PCP is infinite autism.

2417
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,320
That's pretty funny.

2418
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,520
That was that was a great creepypasta voicemail.

2419
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,040
Didn't see it coming.

2420
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:05,600
The twist.

2421
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,560
It literally sounds like Creeps McPasta

2422
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,800
who does creepypasta narration, so.

2423
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,840
I did that joke.

2424
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,480
Great job, dude.

2425
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,520
Sorry for you and your therapist lost, my dude.

2426
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,120
Yikes, big yikes, big oof, effin' chat.

2427
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,720
We'll see you next week.

2428
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,680
See you right.

2429
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,040
Next voicemail.

2430
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,680
This is from, wait, what is this?

2431
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,920
What is, I think I linked the wrong one away.

2432
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:32,640
Let me get this again.

2433
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:33,120
Oh my god.

2434
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:37,760
Okay, it's One Piece and Munchy Extravaganza.

2435
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,440
Okay, let me re-type this, play, and okay, go.

2436
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,920
So hello, PCP.

2437
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,920
I have a story to tell.

2438
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,720
So one of my friends is retarded, okay?

2439
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,040
He says that he does not like One Piece at all

2440
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:58,240
because there's nothing going on in either manga or the anime, right?

2441
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:59,280
Oh, okay, I see.

2442
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,560
He's saying like the Luffy character,

2443
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,800
he was supposed to become the pirate king, right?

2444
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,680
But he's still not a fucking pirate king,

2445
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,160
even though it was a billion years, right?

2446
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,880
And I know that he's wrong because you guys are right, right?

2447
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,360
That's right.

2448
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,440
But I don't know why he's wrong.

2449
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:22,480
Like, what is really going on in One Piece?

2450
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,320
Well, do you read it?

2451
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,960
Also, just a quick side note, I found everybody in PCP

2452
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,120
through Munchy, through arm retrieval.

2453
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,360
It's just a fun fact and nobody cares.

2454
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:36,960
But I'm pretty sure I'm the only person

2455
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,000
who was a Munchy fan before anybody else's fan.

2456
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,800
That's not true.

2457
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,120
Fascinating.

2458
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:45,040
There is a class of people, a lower class of people,

2459
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:50,160
who found arm retrieval through the Homestuck subreddit,

2460
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:52,240
which I wonder if that's where you found arm retrieval.

2461
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,400
But I know that some people found it through the subreddit

2462
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,400
and discovered the PCP through that.

2463
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,120
I think, pretty wild.

2464
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:57,520
Fascinating.

2465
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,440
Yeah, there's a number.

2466
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:06,000
I don't know how many of the people who are arm retrieval big fans

2467
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,760
knew about the PCP at all before.

2468
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,280
Like, I don't know, like this...

2469
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,440
You could maybe say, does it count to be a...

2470
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,600
Like, if you got in through the Spirit Science lecture

2471
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,360
or the other lecture he did, the Deagle-Mation...

2472
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,360
If you got in through the Spirit Science lecture,

2473
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,760
I think definitely, Deagle-Mation.

2474
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,600
Deagle-Mation, thank you.

2475
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,320
Yeah, that would count.

2476
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,320
Then you hear through Munchie, for sure.

2477
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:29,840
Yeah, agreed.

2478
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,120
I wonder how many people found the PCP

2479
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,720
through the Christian lecture.

2480
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:35,920
I mean...

2481
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:36,640
Gotta be some.

2482
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,680
It's gotta be some.

2483
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:38,080
I've never...

2484
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:38,720
It's funny, people say...

2485
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,920
Gotta give a straw poll going.

2486
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,760
I hear people say, I found it through Munchie.

2487
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,960
I've never heard anyone say, oh yeah,

2488
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,720
I found the PCP through the Sonichu lecture.

2489
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,880
But numerically, there must be people like that.

2490
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,600
Guys, in the disc, yeah.

2491
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:54,160
Guys, viewers watching, type where you found the PCP from.

2492
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,200
Who did you find us?

2493
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,640
Don't bother Digigi.

2494
01:46:58,640 --> 01:46:59,280
I don't care.

2495
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,080
Yeah, just delete your account and kill yourself.

2496
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:02,880
Oh, only?

2497
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:06,160
Yeah.

2498
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,240
Couldn't have said it better myself.

2499
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:08,960
T-Bat.

2500
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,640
Oh, what was the guy's question or something about?

2501
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,320
Oh, and the question was just like,

2502
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,560
my friend says one piece sucks,

2503
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,360
because Luffy didn't win yet, and he isn't the pirate king.

2504
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,920
It's a series designed to go on a long time.

2505
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,640
Every...

2506
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,400
There's been progress continuous.

2507
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,440
It's not like Naruto.

2508
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,360
It's about the journey.

2509
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,280
It's about the...

2510
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,840
It's not like Naruto where we can't gauge

2511
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,720
how much progress is being made other than just beating certain guys.

2512
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,680
They are making literal, linear progress

2513
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:38,880
towards the end of one piece every time they move islands,

2514
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,520
and they do things.

2515
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,600
I mean, I don't know if the guy...

2516
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,680
If only there was a podcast you could listen to

2517
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,920
that broke down in excruciating detail.

2518
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:46,160
Imagine that.

2519
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,560
The moment-to-moment greatness that is one piece.

2520
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,360
If only.

2521
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,280
But such a thing just sadly doesn't exist.

2522
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,240
Well, it does, actually.

2523
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,240
This is called the Podicast.

2524
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,360
What?

2525
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,120
It sounds good.

2526
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,560
Where can I find this incredible resource?

2527
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,760
youtube.com slash thepodicast.

2528
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,320
It's hard for Google to type it in,

2529
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,000
and people say, you mean podcast?

2530
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:10,480
Like, no.

2531
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,400
No, idiot.

2532
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,280
You got to force Google to bend to your will.

2533
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,000
And that's the only way you can find.

2534
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,280
There's some marketing issues there,

2535
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,720
but we can work on that, I suppose.

2536
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,320
Anyway.

2537
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,880
It wouldn't be a PCP adjacent project

2538
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,760
if it was just totally algorithmically dead right from the get go.

2539
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:27,840
Oh, wait.

2540
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,400
I forgot.

2541
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:31,840
It's actually the Podicast Pirates is the full URL of that one.

2542
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:32,640
Oh, okay.

2543
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,520
But like, yeah.

2544
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,360
We're the reason projects are dying.

2545
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:40,000
Like, I don't know whether he reads the manga

2546
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,720
because he says he knows his friend is wrong because we're right.

2547
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,720
Does that mean he doesn't read the thing?

2548
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,320
Because clearly, if he did,

2549
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:52,480
he would understand how to refute that and say, just because...

2550
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,280
I don't think he does.

2551
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,360
Like, the ending of the, you know,

2552
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,640
when Luffy becomes the Pirate King,

2553
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,960
that's when the series will end and it's not over.

2554
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,320
That's all you really need to say.

2555
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:02,160
Yeah.

2556
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,800
I mean, and you hear people who aren't big fans,

2557
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,680
or maybe they've even read it,

2558
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,560
but they gave up because they're like,

2559
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,600
I thought Luffy was going to win.

2560
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,040
Why, you know, what's happening?

2561
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,360
It's just like, but every arc is like, great.

2562
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,640
And like, there's always progress.

2563
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:16,480
I mean, Naruto didn't become the Hokage until the end of Naruto.

2564
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:17,680
And if Naruto...

2565
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,200
No, not even within Naruto.

2566
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,840
It wasn't what's Hokage at the end of Naruto, I don't think, right?

2567
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:22,960
It kind of implies that he was, but...

2568
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,560
No, in Boruto, he's Naruto.

2569
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,120
And there's like...

2570
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,080
In Boruto, he's Naruto.

2571
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,360
In Boruto, he's Naruto.

2572
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,080
Tell me more.

2573
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:28,160
Hokage.

2574
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:28,560
Damn it.

2575
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:29,440
Yeah.

2576
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,160
But like, Kakashi's Hokage by the idea of hashtag spoilers.

2577
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,680
Does he become Hokage offscreen?

2578
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,520
I think he...

2579
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,600
Well, because like, after the narrative ends,

2580
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,840
literally, Kakashi becomes the next Hokage.

2581
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,160
Yeah, Kakashi is Hokage at the end of the show.

2582
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,280
And then after that, Naruto then later becomes...

2583
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,480
I don't know, I don't remember what happened

2584
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,400
in the literal last chapter of Naruto.

2585
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,960
I think he's not Hokage in that, but I could be wrong.

2586
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,600
No, he isn't.

2587
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,360
I watched Naruto Kai earlier this year.

2588
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,200
Does it end with Kakashi as Hokage?

2589
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,400
Well, there you go.

2590
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,480
He doesn't become Hokage, but we all know he does eventually.

2591
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,200
But it's implied that he will be after Kakashi.

2592
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:02,320
I got it.

2593
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,200
That's unsatisfying.

2594
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,360
But like Boruto exists, he is Hokage in that,

2595
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,200
so I guess it's fine, whatever.

2596
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,400
It seems like he's Boruto, isn't it, Boruto?

2597
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,320
I fucking guarantee you.

2598
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,360
Luffy will be pirate king at the end of One Piece.

2599
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:15,600
I fucking guarantee you.

2600
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,840
He's already the king of the pirates in our hearts,

2601
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:18,880
and that's all that matters.

2602
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,880
Yeah, that's true.

2603
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,400
It's just people see, wow, this year's been running for like 22 years.

2604
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,920
Jesus Christ, what's the deal?

2605
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:26,960
It's all been good.

2606
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,080
People just can't wrap their mind around that it's actually good,

2607
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,760
and it's the journey is valuable, and progress has been made.

2608
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,240
You're totally right, but I think the problem that some people have

2609
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,840
is just that this is, it's like when you watch a movie,

2610
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,320
and it sets up the stakes and the conflict,

2611
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,440
and you're there because you want to see the resolution to it.

2612
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:46,960
I can understand some people being like,

2613
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,360
I want this question to be answered, you know?

2614
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,240
Yeah, that's fair.

2615
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:54,320
But like, you shouldn't ignore that that question comes up

2616
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,480
like every arc and is addressed,

2617
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,880
and everything they're doing is moving towards it.

2618
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,840
You just can't forget that everything they're doing

2619
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,440
is in pursuit of that goal.

2620
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,520
Some people is just dumb.

2621
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,960
Yeah, that's, yeah, you know.

2622
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:09,520
And you know what?

2623
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,000
I don't even blame people who are like, Jesus Christ,

2624
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,520
20 years, like I'm out.

2625
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:16,960
If they don't want to be on a journey for that long, that's fine.

2626
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,000
Well, they don't need to be,

2627
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,680
because it's already been going for 20 years,

2628
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,680
but it takes a lot less time to read the thing

2629
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,880
than it does to write it.

2630
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,680
Well, that's true.

2631
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,240
That's true.

2632
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:25,840
But you get people, like even Michelle was like,

2633
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,560
Jesus Christ, by the time I read one piece all the way,

2634
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,520
like I'll be done.

2635
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,680
But it's like, no, you can read in like a month easily.

2636
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,080
Here's the...

2637
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,320
Well, not easily, but pretty fast.

2638
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,040
I understand.

2639
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,480
If you spend a full work week,

2640
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,320
if you commit 40 hours a week to reading it maybe.

2641
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,880
There's like one thing, like Game of Thrones,

2642
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,840
I will only read that when it's finished,

2643
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,760
because people have been waiting for a long time.

2644
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,360
But like, I don't...

2645
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,560
I love it, but...

2646
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,440
Just because it's been taking a long time to get written,

2647
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,560
I don't make a judgment on it being like shit or anything.

2648
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,800
Like, I don't understand people who would make judgments

2649
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,880
on things based on how long it's been coming out.

2650
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,440
I could see why people,

2651
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,120
I think a lot of people just make an assumption,

2652
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,880
because it's been going on so long,

2653
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,080
they assume it must like not be getting to the point.

2654
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,960
It must like be stagnating and not being good.

2655
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,360
One piece really is that rare exception.

2656
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,720
It really is the one that was designed with this in mind

2657
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:23,520
and has not failed to do so,

2658
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,040
unless you just need a story to get to the point faster.

2659
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:27,680
But it...

2660
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:31,360
If you need a story to get to the point faster,

2661
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,800
then you can just watch like a movie.

2662
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,120
I mean, absolutely true.

2663
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,920
And one piece is literally a series about how...

2664
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,560
Like one of the main points is

2665
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,640
that it's about the journey, not the destination.

2666
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,000
The destination matters,

2667
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,600
but it's about the fucking journey

2668
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:50,960
and boy has it been a great journey with purpose, with intent.

2669
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:56,240
I feel like if you're asking this question,

2670
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,840
like why hasn't he become pirate?

2671
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,440
Like you can't be like a fan of the series.

2672
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,200
I think that the caller here,

2673
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:04,880
I don't even know if they have not won,

2674
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,320
but you just have to like adjust your perception of it.

2675
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:09,600
You're kind of looking at it the wrong way.

2676
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,200
Well, this person's on your side.

2677
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,800
Like why do you think he's not a...

2678
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,320
I think, I'm not even saying they're wrong.

2679
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,240
I mean, it sounds to me when he says,

2680
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:16,960
I know you're right.

2681
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,640
Well, I think what he's saying is I agree with you.

2682
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:22,320
I just can't put it into words and explain it.

2683
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,320
I was thinking that he was saying it like,

2684
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,200
look, I listen to the PCP, whatever you guys say,

2685
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:27,840
I know is true.

2686
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,920
I mean, I hope that's what it is.

2687
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,800
And it's possible.

2688
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,080
Yeah, me too.

2689
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,320
And you know, if you want to be truly right,

2690
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,800
you got to go over to patreon.com slash...

2691
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,000
The podcast, no, the podcast pirates.

2692
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,080
The more you play as a writer, you are.

2693
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,760
That's the formula.

2694
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:45,280
Exactly.

2695
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,360
Like we give the true secrets of knowledge

2696
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,640
to the big patrons.

2697
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:53,600
We actually, we literally do have a stratified patron of,

2698
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,840
let's see, there's just the one piece discussion,

2699
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,720
then there's Marie-Joy, then there's...

2700
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,680
Raftel.

2701
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,360
Raftel or Lafts Tale.

2702
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,640
And then there's the actual crow's nest,

2703
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:06,800
the treasure vault, the commander's lounge,

2704
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,600
and finally the empty throne for those gods who...

2705
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,040
Ooh, that gives me the chills.

2706
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,280
Oh, Ben, you don't even know, but the empty throne

2707
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:17,440
is the thing that's been introduced in one piece

2708
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:20,320
and is, it's very mysterious.

2709
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,280
No, I'm...

2710
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:24,480
I mean, one of these days, I'll catch up.

2711
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:30,720
And then the Lord will descend from heaven with a shout

2712
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:34,160
and the beast with seven horns will do something scary.

2713
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,440
You're finishing Dros Rosa.

2714
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,240
You've got Zo next, then you've got Whole Cake Island,

2715
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,360
and then you're on Wano now,

2716
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,760
which is like maybe half or so over.

2717
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,120
Ooh, ooh, a lot of good stuff.

2718
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:47,200
Yeah, I got a lot of treats waiting for me.

2719
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:48,720
Indeed you do.

2720
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:52,480
Okay, next one we've got a voicemail from

2721
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:57,120
Mr. Over the Waste T. Itzman is the name.

2722
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,400
All right, go.

2723
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,680
Hey, Dick.

2724
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:00,240
Hey, Sean.

2725
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,720
You know what makes me a fucking rage?

2726
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,760
Calling into the wrong fucking podcast.

2727
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,600
Spend all this time thinking up what you're gonna say,

2728
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,840
and you try your best to make it interesting

2729
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,080
to impart even a modicum of entertainment

2730
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,920
to the good folks listening at home,

2731
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:19,920
but then you accidentally call the wrong fucking voice line

2732
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,640
and leave a message for the wrong fucking people,

2733
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,320
and now you're just a fucking idiot

2734
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:27,200
who can't type URLs into his browser properly.

2735
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,960
If that ever happened to me,

2736
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,120
I'd probably just fucking kill myself.

2737
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:32,720
Yeah.

2738
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,360
Anyway, that's my rage.

2739
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,640
Well, I love you guys.

2740
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:36,960
Hope.

2741
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:37,840
Go fuck yourself.

2742
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,160
Hopefully, I mean,

2743
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,640
hopefully he doesn't even listen to this podcast,

2744
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,000
so I'll never know.

2745
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,840
He'll be in sweet ignorance.

2746
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,320
That's the one.

2747
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:48,960
Ignorance.

2748
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,760
I hope, yeah.

2749
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,600
Hopefully.

2750
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,000
Stay away.

2751
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,800
That's what we all want.

2752
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:53,200
All right.

2753
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:58,240
Next up, we've got, okay, pick a number.

2754
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:58,960
Pick a number.

2755
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,840
What a dead tent, yo, PCP.

2756
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,880
Could I get you guys to all agree

2757
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:09,360
and come to a consensus on picking a number

2758
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,720
between one and 244?

2759
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:13,120
Thank you.

2760
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,720
Okay, let's pick a number.

2761
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,080
What do you agree?

2762
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,040
Give throughout 10.

2763
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:19,600
10's good.

2764
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,760
I could roll with 10.

2765
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,480
A little basic.

2766
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,040
A little basic.

2767
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,400
I'm going to go with 100,

2768
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,920
because that's what I'm always keeping it.

2769
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:28,080
Damn.

2770
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,560
I'm going to go with 144,

2771
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:31,680
because it's 12 squared,

2772
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,800
and I've always liked that number.

2773
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:33,520
It is a good number.

2774
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:34,160
I'm going to go with 88.

2775
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,000
88.

2776
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,520
Okay, then I'll change my number to 14.

2777
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,480
Something about that number, it seems good.

2778
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,680
I'm going to go with 144.

2779
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,120
I'm going to 144.

2780
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:44,240
You convinced me.

2781
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:47,440
Where are we all supposed to collectively choose one?

2782
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,200
I'm going to switch over to pi.

2783
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,800
I think pi is a really good number.

2784
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:52,880
Oh, you can't even say that's a four.

2785
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,840
Going to some floats.

2786
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,360
No more integers here.

2787
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,880
That's cheating, but I'm for it.

2788
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,040
It's going to make calculations hard.

2789
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:00,080
He didn't say how long it was for.

2790
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,480
No, no, it makes the calculations easy, Nate.

2791
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,840
It's just the ratio of the diameter to the fucking radius.

2792
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,680
Yeah, I mean, think about it this way.

2793
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,880
If you chose 144, he has to hit three buttons,

2794
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,800
but if you pick pi, you just have to hit one button.

2795
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,840
Yeah, just find the easy pi button on your keyboard.

2796
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:17,760
Yeah, okay.

2797
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,480
Oh, God.

2798
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:18,880
You know what?

2799
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:19,680
Fine, pi.

2800
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:21,120
Tom, are you in agreement, pi?

2801
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:23,760
I mean, I think it'll ruin whatever bit he's going to go for,

2802
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,160
but if we want to fucking throw a monkey wrench in there, I'm down.

2803
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:27,760
Let's fucking do it.

2804
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:28,000
All right.

2805
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,120
He didn't say integers.

2806
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,080
He didn't say integers.

2807
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,120
He did not say integers.

2808
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,480
We've done everything he has.

2809
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:32,560
All right.

2810
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:32,800
Okay.

2811
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,920
So, let us know.

2812
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:36,480
Call in.

2813
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,200
Let us know what's up if we fucked you over royally.

2814
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,360
Wait, is there any follow-up to this?

2815
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,360
No, that's all there is for now.

2816
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,200
It's a mystery box.

2817
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:46,400
Did he say there was going to be more?

2818
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,080
I thought it was just pick a number.

2819
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,560
He did not say there'd be no more.

2820
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,960
I just wanted to do us a favor and call in.

2821
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:53,600
Let us know.

2822
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:54,560
I think this is it.

2823
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,680
I think this was the point.

2824
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:57,440
Just to pick a number.

2825
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,560
I'm hoping it's four something.

2826
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,680
I feel confident that it is not four anything.

2827
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:02,560
And that the journey is a destination.

2828
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,120
I have more faith in our viewers than that.

2829
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:05,840
I would like to.

2830
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:07,920
It would have been nice if he told us what it was for.

2831
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,440
He didn't promise anything.

2832
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,080
And frankly, I don't know.

2833
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:10,960
Her ruin's the mistake.

2834
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,160
I mean, I'm okay with that.

2835
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:15,280
I'm just thinking if we say pie, then maybe he'll bake us a pie.

2836
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,320
And it'll be really nice.

2837
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:18,400
Yeah, that sounds good.

2838
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,640
Maybe it's how many candles to put on my birthday cake.

2839
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,480
And we gave him a real tricky answer there.

2840
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,920
Strawberry and rhubarb, please.

2841
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,760
Ooh, that's good.

2842
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,560
Okay.

2843
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,440
All right, enough of that.

2844
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,600
On to the next question, voicemail.

2845
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:32,000
We've got the professional Nate Triggerer.

2846
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,000
Okay, let's get to it.

2847
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:34,400
We'll see.

2848
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,120
What's your name?

2849
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:35,440
Nate.

2850
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:38,720
King de Matz 3.

2851
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:40,960
No.

2852
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,200
Final Fantasy VII Remake.

2853
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,360
A Gurren login sequel.

2854
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,880
This last chapter, one piece was the best ever.

2855
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,920
No, it's not.

2856
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,240
You read one piece wrong, my friend.

2857
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,720
You know, triggering Nate is a tough job,

2858
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,000
but somebody's got to do it.

2859
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,160
Yeah, that's true.

2860
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,240
It's a living.

2861
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,120
Just a literal brain holocaust for me.

2862
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:09,600
I like that.

2863
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:11,520
That's the beginning.

2864
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,160
All right, there you go.

2865
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,560
I'm slapping him in voice jail.

2866
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,360
We can't allow this man to run ramp.

2867
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,960
No, no, mercy.

2868
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,760
Sanctuary.

2869
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:21,600
Okay, we'll see.

2870
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,040
No, I want him out there.

2871
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,440
I'm going to get him some voicemail so he can get out.

2872
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,280
All right.

2873
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,000
I feel like we've made that joke before, but it's not old.

2874
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:30,640
It's not old.

2875
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:32,880
We need to have something between the voice

2876
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,400
grail and the voice jail, like the PC purgatory.

2877
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:39,040
That's good.

2878
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,800
Voice a community service.

2879
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:44,640
Did we decide that communist hell is below the

2880
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:47,040
dungeons of the PCP jail or voice jail?

2881
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:47,840
That seems good.

2882
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,360
I don't think we described that yet, but I like it.

2883
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,840
Can someone draw like a Dante's Inferno style?

2884
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,080
Communist hell is under everything.

2885
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:54,720
Can somebody?

2886
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,000
Cosmology.

2887
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,520
Can somebody build the PCP voice jail in the

2888
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,960
PCP Minecraft server?

2889
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,480
That'd be great.

2890
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:02,640
Yeah.

2891
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:03,280
Oh, that would be.

2892
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:03,760
I actually, you know,

2893
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,640
can we like quit like named NPCs in there or something?

2894
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:08,400
Like literally next to Slime Corp.

2895
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,040
Oh, we should.

2896
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,000
Someone was building.

2897
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:13,280
It was it was a juvenile detention center was being

2898
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:16,560
built right next to Slime Corp HQ in the Minecraft server.

2899
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:16,880
Okay.

2900
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:17,440
Okay.

2901
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,840
And I keep working on it, lads.

2902
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:20,800
Keep working on it.

2903
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:21,440
That's got a lot.

2904
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:22,880
We got a lot of Jews to lock up.

2905
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:23,760
That's pretty good.

2906
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:24,480
Okay.

2907
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,240
I got to get in on this fucking server.

2908
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:26,880
I'm so sad.

2909
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,440
I'm so sad.

2910
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,160
I missed the first one.

2911
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,120
I really wanted to be there,

2912
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:31,120
but I just wasn't around when it happened.

2913
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:31,680
Too bad.

2914
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:32,480
Yeah, there'll be plenty more,

2915
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,200
plenty more to come.

2916
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:34,160
Okay.

2917
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,760
So a few people want to be in there.

2918
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:36,880
You want to play with us?

2919
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,960
That's patreon.com slash pcb minecraft.

2920
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,560
$5 a month only.

2921
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:41,200
Let's go.

2922
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,080
Join your friends.

2923
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:42,800
It'll be good.

2924
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:43,120
Okay.

2925
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:43,840
Next up.

2926
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,160
Okay.

2927
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,040
Now here we go.

2928
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,880
So this is a sequence of,

2929
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,800
I think it's just three voicemails technically about an

2930
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,240
issue that we were going to bring up.

2931
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:53,280
We didn't yet.

2932
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:53,520
Okay.

2933
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,640
Let's just hear the first one.

2934
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:56,880
It's a message from the past.

2935
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:57,120
Okay.

2936
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:57,760
Here we go.

2937
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,080
Go.

2938
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,840
This is a message from your past.

2939
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,560
The Joker N-word countdown is at 24 hours,

2940
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,080
four hours ago.

2941
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,320
We've done nothing to stop him.

2942
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,240
There's nothing we can do.

2943
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:11,200
He's inevitable.

2944
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:11,920
He's going to do it.

2945
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,520
He's going to say the N-word.

2946
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:14,240
We're so sorry.

2947
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,760
If there's still a society after this is over,

2948
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:22,480
we want you to know when we could.

2949
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,320
There was nothing we could do to stop him.

2950
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:28,400
Okay.

2951
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:29,600
So there you go, lads.

2952
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,240
I don't know.

2953
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:30,800
If you weren't aware.

2954
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,600
I don't know this meme.

2955
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:32,880
Okay.

2956
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,240
Well, Ben, let me tell you.

2957
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:36,320
Me and Tom have been following this.

2958
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:40,560
So from 10 days before the Joker movie came out,

2959
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:45,760
a Twitter appeared at Joker and was called the Twitter N-word

2960
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:46,720
countdown.

2961
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:48,880
The Twitter, the Joker N-word countdown?

2962
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:49,840
That's right.

2963
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:52,240
The Joker N-word countdown or something approximately like that.

2964
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:57,520
And it was saying just 10 days until I say it was the only thing posted.

2965
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,120
Then nine days before the release,

2966
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:00,960
nine days until I say it.

2967
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,720
This started with zero followers.

2968
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:04,320
By the time we got to the day,

2969
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:08,160
it had over 130,000 followers on this Twitter account

2970
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,920
posting basically just this.

2971
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:10,400
Pretty cool.

2972
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,240
And so it was eight days until I say it.

2973
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:13,760
He's going to watch.

2974
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,640
Yeah, you can look at it.

2975
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,880
The whole society was crumbling.

2976
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,560
Infrastructure is breaking down.

2977
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:21,120
Moral panic was spiked to the heights.

2978
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:22,880
And this is just the Joker at work.

2979
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,160
This is just what he does.

2980
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:26,720
And so this progressed until like a couple of days before.

2981
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:30,960
I believe it was the day before he was going to say it.

2982
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,920
He released a tweet with a video.

2983
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,280
Let me see if I can get this real quick.

2984
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:40,960
But it was a video that featured countless African American individuals.

2985
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:45,520
And it was a video of him sewing image after image of them

2986
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,000
giving the Joker their N-word passes.

2987
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,960
This was like dozens, if not hundreds of people in this video

2988
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,440
giving him countless N-word passes.

2989
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:59,920
And so he just continued on his quest to say it.

2990
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:00,800
To say it.

2991
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:03,280
And so the day comes 24 hours until I say it.

2992
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:04,480
10 hours until I say it.

2993
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:07,440
Finally, there was one that was like 60 seconds until I say it.

2994
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,920
And at last he released a video.

2995
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,160
And it was the Joker.

2996
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:13,760
Okay, let me just grab it real quick.

2997
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:15,040
It's like right here.

2998
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:18,800
And it's him, it's a video produced, the production value.

2999
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:19,600
Okay, got it right here.

3000
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:23,040
Look at this shit in the main chat.

3001
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,240
Just take a look at this real quick.

3002
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:27,200
The production value, like this guy hadn't made any videos.

3003
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:30,960
He just made that one of all the N-word passes he'd been given by all those people.

3004
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,160
And it was very rough.

3005
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,240
It was incredible.

3006
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:37,200
And this video is him sitting there saying,

3007
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:39,440
you know, society isn't ready for what I'm about to do.

3008
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,440
This video has over like 2 million plays.

3009
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,000
2.7 million views at this point.

3010
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,680
168,000 likes, like 4,000 responses, 50,000 retweets basically on the day.

3011
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:51,280
And so he gets up to the end.

3012
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:57,040
He says, you know, they tried to stop me, but this is my moment and I'm doing what I can do.

3013
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,360
And then as he's about to say, he takes a deep breath.

3014
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:04,240
The black man, the black man, a Batman wearing black guy,

3015
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:07,600
bursts in and stops him and says the word instead,

3016
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:11,280
stopping the Joker and his white privilege from running rampant

3017
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:14,080
and destroying all hopes of him crumbling society.

3018
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,080
Society was preserved.

3019
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:19,760
And so, you know, the Joker accepts defeat that the black man stopped him.

3020
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,600
Maybe next time he'll be able to say it.

3021
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:23,120
And that's that.

3022
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:25,840
But at the very end of the video, if you listen carefully,

3023
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,640
he says, like, I was stopped again by the black man.

3024
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:30,880
And then he says a word that's bleeped.

3025
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,440
And then the black man says, don't say it, nigga.

3026
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,960
And that's the end of the video.

3027
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:35,200
Okay.

3028
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,640
That's the end of the video.

3029
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:37,440
So all right.

3030
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:40,000
So this is his, this is the climax of the joke.

3031
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:40,560
And okay.

3032
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,480
So that's not the end of the story, though,

3033
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,000
because there's a couple of things going on.

3034
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:47,920
So just on this subject and tell him,

3035
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:49,200
I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.

3036
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,600
I'll just say that my analysis of this is, I loved this bit.

3037
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,720
I thought it was hilarious.

3038
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:58,080
I'm a well-known thinker that, you know, free speech guy,

3039
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,360
like it's hilarious to act like just saying a word

3040
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:03,680
is like such an amazing thing that like,

3041
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:06,160
anyone's going to have a problem with just a word being said.

3042
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:06,880
It's very silly.

3043
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,720
We know it's offensive, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

3044
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:11,600
So I was, I was looking forward to this as, you know,

3045
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:13,760
just like a funny fuck you to everybody.

3046
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,360
Now, technically, at the end of the video, this, you know,

3047
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,520
he's a white guy who's playing the Joker here.

3048
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,760
He does say it, but it's bleeped.

3049
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,960
And to me, if the point of this whole thing

3050
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,720
was to be like how silly it is that we're so worked up

3051
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:32,240
about this word being so, like, just to say, not to call anyone,

3052
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:35,120
not to spit it, but just to say, and he,

3053
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:37,920
and he feels the need to bleep it in his video.

3054
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,800
Doesn't that actually reinforce the narrative

3055
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,720
that it shouldn't say the word?

3056
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,480
And it kind of cut against the point.

3057
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,320
But Nate, yeah.

3058
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,320
Did you not see the tweet?

3059
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:50,240
Oh, I did, Tom.

3060
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:54,720
So the very next day, I do the very next day,

3061
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:59,440
we see the guy say, fuck it, hashtag nigger on this account.

3062
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,640
That's, that's what happened.

3063
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:02,720
That's what was posted on his account.

3064
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,720
And okay.

3065
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,880
So, but, so everyone's like, oh my God, he said it.

3066
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:07,920
He actually said it.

3067
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,240
Now, I mean, it seems like the bleep,

3068
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:13,200
like the fact that his was bleeped and the black man's wasn't,

3069
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,640
like that seems like the point.

3070
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:19,120
Well, I mean, but yeah, that is the point,

3071
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:21,680
but isn't that by bleeping it, isn't that just saying,

3072
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,960
like it literally is okay for simply a word to be said

3073
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,880
by, you know, the demographic it's about,

3074
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:29,040
or whatever, black people, but not anybody else,

3075
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:29,920
you know, particularly white people.

3076
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,280
Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's the,

3077
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:35,440
that's the commentary or whatever, right?

3078
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,320
But I mean, but he's, he is like whipping up hysteria.

3079
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:39,760
Double standard or whatever.

3080
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,760
I think the, no, the interesting thing to me, Nate,

3081
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,560
like, okay, I don't know what, like,

3082
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,400
because when the video dropped, I was like,

3083
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,640
yeah, that was like a really well done video

3084
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:51,440
and it's fucking funny.

3085
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,000
Of course.

3086
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,320
But there was a part of me that was like, man,

3087
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,640
I kind of just wanted to watch the shit show

3088
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:59,920
if he like just actually did it and to see what would happen.

3089
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,920
Because that was really the most interesting part to me.

3090
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,640
It's like, I was interested in the, the inevitable fallout.

3091
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:07,280
I kind of think it would have been more interesting

3092
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:09,840
if it had just been like a five second video

3093
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,400
of him just saying the word and nothing else.

3094
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,880
I'm looking at this, the Twitter right now,

3095
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,720
and he's totally rebranded this Twitter

3096
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,800
from what it was like two days ago.

3097
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,880
Well, Tom, do you know why that is?

3098
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,840
I don't, I guess I've missed part of the story.

3099
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,880
Yeah, I'm getting to this.

3100
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:28,320
Okay, so like I said, like the guy, so I feel,

3101
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,440
and this guy had actually tweeted,

3102
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:30,640
I'm going to get to that point, Tom,

3103
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:31,840
because the big things have happened then,

3104
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,000
like it lasts like day or something about this Twitter.

3105
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,680
So like I said, this Twitter has like 130,000 followers,

3106
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:38,640
like a lot of people have unsub

3107
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:40,160
because the joke's over or whatever.

3108
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:43,600
But like he actually, the guy who did it

3109
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:45,840
has a separate Twitter account that I was,

3110
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,560
it's like Connor or something, I'll link in the description.

3111
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,000
So like we know who the guy is who did it.

3112
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,720
He's like a reasonably small time YouTube comedian,

3113
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,720
but he had this really funny idea for the skit.

3114
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:56,720
And like after he posted the video,

3115
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:59,360
he updated his bio to have the at to that guy.

3116
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:01,520
So we 100% know like who the guy was,

3117
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,520
looks just like him, you know, that's all there is to it.

3118
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:05,600
Behind the scenes footage, et cetera.

3119
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:08,480
Like on that guy's account, I started following,

3120
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:09,680
because I was curious, you know,

3121
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:11,600
what the man himself had to say about all this.

3122
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,800
And he was saying things like,

3123
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,320
like one thing he said was like,

3124
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:18,880
maybe the worst thing about all of this is like, if I,

3125
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:22,320
or he said like, maybe the real evil here

3126
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,960
was getting so many people to wish that I'd said.

3127
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:27,520
Right, yeah, that was going to bring up.

3128
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,360
That's an interesting point to make.

3129
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,760
So it sounds like with that point,

3130
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:33,920
he's saying that like, no, no, no,

3131
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,280
none of this was necessarily about like,

3132
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:39,760
like defanging a word or pointing to the absurdity

3133
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,720
of overvaluing a word just by itself,

3134
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,960
not insulting people, but just saying a word.

3135
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,760
It was actually like a troll, like here I am,

3136
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,640
like, like the only reason someone could want me

3137
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:53,840
to say the N word here is because they're racist.

3138
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:58,640
It sounds to me like this guy didn't really have a clear

3139
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,600
like theme or anything.

3140
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,720
I think that's what I think.

3141
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:05,520
I think the timeline of events here was that,

3142
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:09,200
I think that's my perspective on the timeline of events

3143
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:13,360
is that he started the account or repurposing.

3144
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,560
It started with zero followers, by the way.

3145
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,960
So he did not like, no, this was going to.

3146
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,360
Yeah, because this account was made in 2013.

3147
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,520
So like, he repurposed this account clearly

3148
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,920
for this purpose when he had the idea for the joke.

3149
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:27,600
So like, he starts and I'm sure he's not expecting it

3150
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:29,520
to be calm as huge as it does.

3151
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:32,640
And I'm assuming that it probably would have been

3152
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,800
a very straightforward thing if it stayed small,

3153
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:37,200
but when you have over 100,000 people waiting for you

3154
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,120
to drop an n-bomb and like question if you're going

3155
02:09:39,120 --> 02:09:41,520
to hard art and shit, like it's that point you're like,

3156
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,000
oh God, I have to do something like actually

3157
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,840
worth the attention that I have now.

3158
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,920
And I think this skit probably came from that.

3159
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,280
I think maybe he overthought it.

3160
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:51,440
I agree, Ben.

3161
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:54,000
But like the change here is that because I think

3162
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,920
he made the video probably because it's just like,

3163
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:59,280
oh God, like there might be some actual ramifications

3164
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,160
if I actually do it with this kind of spotlight on me.

3165
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:02,960
So there's this whole skit.

3166
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:03,600
Most cancel culture.

3167
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,400
But then he did it anyway.

3168
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:05,200
Right.

3169
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:10,560
But that's the point because the account after the video

3170
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,720
was very much like, okay, the bid is over.

3171
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:13,920
Here's my actual account.

3172
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,720
This is who I actually am.

3173
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:16,320
This is the comedy I actually do.

3174
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,840
And then he was making those comments

3175
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,920
because I think there were a contingent of people

3176
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:22,080
who were kind of bummed that it didn't actually happen.

3177
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,960
Like the promise was not delivered in a direct way.

3178
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,280
And so that tweet that you just mentioned, Nate,

3179
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:30,160
about maybe the real evil was getting everyone to be excited,

3180
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:33,200
that kind of feels like a justification made after the fact.

3181
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,800
Like this is a way of spinning people's disappointment.

3182
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,120
And then I feel like now, looking at the account now,

3183
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:41,920
where it's unbranded and back to just being its own thing,

3184
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,920
that he's just leaning into what everyone

3185
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,280
really wanted the whole time.

3186
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:48,880
Well, Tom, let me tell you why that's not the case.

3187
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:50,880
It's because, at least as far as we know,

3188
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,960
this could be an elaborate hoax.

3189
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:56,320
He just dropped the hard R and bomb after,

3190
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,160
like the day after, or like two days after.

3191
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:00,960
It's because both his original account,

3192
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,600
according to him on a video he posted on Instagram

3193
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:07,440
or Facebook or something, both accounts were hacked.

3194
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:10,080
Were hacked by, what was it?

3195
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:12,640
The chuckling squad.

3196
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:15,280
And if you look on his Twitter at The Joker,

3197
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:18,800
it says right now, the pin tweet is a link to a Discord

3198
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:20,880
and hashtag chuckling squad.

3199
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:23,680
So unless this is some sort of particularly elaborate hoax.

3200
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:25,120
Like it was hacked after the fact?

3201
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:28,320
Yeah, because this had drawn so much attention,

3202
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,840
and in the video, the guy bleeps out him saying the N-word,

3203
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,360
allows the black guy to say it, blah, blah, blah.

3204
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,440
It seems that he really decided,

3205
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:37,920
or whatever, maybe never intended, to say it at all.

3206
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:42,240
But now he just goes hashtag and says it on his account.

3207
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:44,880
It really does look like he almost assuredly

3208
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,440
was in fact hacked, and someone decided,

3209
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:51,040
you know, I'm gonna correct this guy's mistake,

3210
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,800
and they've gone in here and they've actually hashtag nigger,

3211
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,160
and stuff like that.

3212
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:58,800
That seems to be what's happened as far as I can tell.

3213
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,480
Yeah, because I'm seeing the Discord link.

3214
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:04,080
I've only seen the actual tweet, not the fuck it one.

3215
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:08,880
I will try to find a link to the video,

3216
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,480
because I had just seen it before,

3217
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:12,320
and it's him on his other account.

3218
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,960
He says, guys, look, all my accounts have been hacked.

3219
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,640
Even this account, I think this video will be deleted quickly,

3220
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,480
but luckily it was someone to capture it or something,

3221
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,400
because all his accounts were hacked,

3222
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:27,760
and so I don't have any control over my accounts now.

3223
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:31,920
Again, we don't know 100% that that's true.

3224
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,360
I believe that it is true.

3225
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,800
It seems the most likely thing,

3226
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,800
because I think if he was comfortable with saying the word,

3227
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,840
he would have just done it.

3228
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:40,000
Because let me just, my last point about the video

3229
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,640
is I think the joke would have been perfect and flawless,

3230
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:47,040
because the way he slips it in at the end and just bleeps it,

3231
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:50,560
he had built it up, he undercuts the moment,

3232
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,720
and then at the end, he slips in but bleeps it,

3233
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,480
and then the black guy says, nigga, whatever.

3234
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,880
I felt it would have been a perfect joke

3235
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:59,440
if he just simply had not bleeped it at the end,

3236
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:00,720
because what does that say?

3237
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:04,880
It undercuts the hype, and it points to the absurdity

3238
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:06,960
of getting so excited about this word

3239
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,960
when he can just put it in at the end totally anti-climatically.

3240
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,160
I wouldn't understand that, because if he just says it,

3241
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:18,240
why would you have the black man character in there

3242
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,760
and also say it?

3243
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:22,160
Well, because the black man's point in the story,

3244
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:23,680
the black man's point in the story

3245
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:25,600
is to stop the Joker from saying it,

3246
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:31,040
and so I felt he represented all the people who correctly or not

3247
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:32,880
want to stop him from saying it.

3248
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,160
All right, the thing with all this, I think,

3249
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:38,960
is that the meme, the original joke,

3250
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,440
I'm gonna say the n-word,

3251
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:45,280
is not really about race.

3252
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:49,920
It's the equivalent of you're at your friend's house,

3253
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:50,880
and you say to them,

3254
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,600
dude, what would you do if I stepped on all your video games

3255
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:59,440
and broke them, and then your friend goes, I hate you?

3256
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:03,120
And he's like, but what if I did?

3257
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,640
It's just sort of like a, what if I did a really bad thing?

3258
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:09,200
And it's just sort of the rush of imagining that.

3259
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:10,560
And it's like, I'm gonna say the n-word.

3260
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,920
I'm white, I'm gonna say the n-word.

3261
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:16,080
Like that's why it's funny.

3262
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:18,880
There's never really been, I mean,

3263
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,880
among the people I've seen make that joke,

3264
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,800
it's just sort of like kids who are like,

3265
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,440
haha, I'm gonna say something bad.

3266
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,520
It's hoping to sacred cow is what it's doing.

3267
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:28,960
That seems to be the point of the joke.

3268
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:32,240
Sacred cow, the n-word, precious.

3269
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:34,080
And it's like this guy, I'm sure,

3270
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:35,280
feels the same way about it,

3271
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,560
which is why he had this whole like,

3272
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:38,560
the black man stops him in the end.

3273
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,240
And he's clearly an edgy comedian.

3274
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:42,160
I've looked at his thing that I assume

3275
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:44,400
that was what he was getting at.

3276
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:45,840
If not that, I don't understand the joke.

3277
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:46,560
Well, I don't know.

3278
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,560
Whatever.

3279
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:51,040
I mean, I don't understand the joke either way.

3280
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:59,040
I mean, I don't think he had us like a vision for this

3281
02:14:59,040 --> 02:14:59,840
when it started.

3282
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,720
This is what's, I mean, based on the conclusion,

3283
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:04,480
I'm forced to agree that I think,

3284
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:07,040
look, my reading of the situation

3285
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:08,080
isn't the only valid one.

3286
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:09,600
Maybe someone else understands this better.

3287
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,720
I mean, I'd be curious to hear

3288
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:12,080
what people have to say about it,

3289
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:14,800
because this was a very interesting phenomenon I found.

3290
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:19,280
If the point of this wasn't to basically make fun

3291
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,120
of this word that I feel is given disproportionate power,

3292
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:25,680
no one's being called anything.

3293
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:27,200
He's just saying a word.

3294
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:28,480
That's the point of this.

3295
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,680
Surely, we shouldn't get too excited about that, right?

3296
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,600
So if that wasn't the point, I don't get the point.

3297
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:40,160
So yeah, that's where I feel.

3298
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:44,160
I mean, I'm going to be, it's not optimistic.

3299
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:48,400
I feel like the point was just to get the attention,

3300
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:49,120
and he did it.

3301
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:50,560
He did.

3302
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:51,040
He did.

3303
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,520
And you know what?

3304
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:53,600
We should, I actually like the guy.

3305
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,520
I think he did a good job overall.

3306
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:58,720
The fact that he delivered with an impressively made video

3307
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,880
at the end, even if it didn't exactly do the joke

3308
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:01,840
the way I would have done it,

3309
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:04,640
I still think his grounds for it's impressive,

3310
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:05,680
it's worth celebrating,

3311
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:08,320
he like almost got the joke perfectly in my mind.

3312
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:10,480
So I don't know, I still really like the guy.

3313
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:11,520
I respect what he did.

3314
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,560
I mean, really, it's one of those like,

3315
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:17,280
where the imagination is the entire thing.

3316
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,360
Like the fact that there's a Twitter account

3317
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,760
and he's counting down to saying the n-word,

3318
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,560
that's the joke.

3319
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,840
That's where you laugh.

3320
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,440
That's the punchline in itself.

3321
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:27,280
That's the fact that it exists.

3322
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:30,000
He got so many n-word passes, guys.

3323
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,680
Yeah, all the n-word passes.

3324
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:32,800
That's really funny.

3325
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,840
That's hilarious.

3326
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:36,560
The culmination, I don't think it's even possible

3327
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:37,920
to please everyone with that.

3328
02:16:38,720 --> 02:16:39,200
Yeah.

3329
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

3330
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,520
You know what, when he first ended the thing,

3331
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:44,400
he said, he changed his bio before it seemingly got hacked,

3332
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,160
he like his bio became,

3333
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,840
they're gonna hate you either way,

3334
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:49,280
with a link to his normal friends.

3335
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:51,520
So I mean, yeah, I mean, that's true.

3336
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:52,160
But let's not play the joke.

3337
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:53,760
I think he should have just committed to the bit

3338
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,480
and just done it.

3339
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:55,680
I think he should have just done it.

3340
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:56,800
Like, I couldn't agree more.

3341
02:16:56,800 --> 02:17:01,200
I think it would have been a more interesting experiment,

3342
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,560
if you want to call it that.

3343
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:04,160
If he just fucking done it.

3344
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:05,760
Like, just, like not.

3345
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,280
And so, to those?

3346
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,240
I get the temptation to subvert your audience's expectations,

3347
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:12,160
but I don't really think, I don't know.

3348
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,400
I mean, I haven't watched this video yet,

3349
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:15,520
because it's two and a half minutes long,

3350
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,560
and I have to check out the web.

3351
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:18,000
But like, the way you describe it,

3352
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,680
doesn't really sound like he subverted it

3353
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:21,440
in a way that's that funny.

3354
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:23,840
No, I don't think so.

3355
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:24,560
I don't think so.

3356
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:26,640
He's just sort of like, you know, he gets ready.

3357
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:29,760
He's like, you know, faffing around,

3358
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:31,280
like coughing, like getting his throes.

3359
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:32,080
Clearing his throes.

3360
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:37,280
Like, okay, you know, the obvious misdirect is to not do it,

3361
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,840
after all that, like, silly build up.

3362
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,800
And then he does not actually do it, really.

3363
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:44,960
And I don't know.

3364
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,240
He kinda does it.

3365
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:48,240
He kinda does, but he censors it.

3366
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,960
Which, I mean, the first time I watched it,

3367
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:52,480
I wasn't even sure what was happening.

3368
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:54,800
I think, like, the fact that he didn't say it,

3369
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,320
was like, oh, well, the video's over.

3370
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:58,000
Like, whatever happens after that,

3371
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,520
I just wasn't really paying attention.

3372
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:02,160
I don't know.

3373
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,960
I just think it's very interesting to me.

3374
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:07,280
I don't know.

3375
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:10,560
And anyone who thinks that, like, oh, he changed his mind,

3376
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:13,600
and he just tweeted it out, I don't think that's correct.

3377
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:14,800
I believe that he was hacked.

3378
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,000
This is what I think is extremely wrong.

3379
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,120
Oh, with the hashtag?

3380
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:18,480
With the hashtag.

3381
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:20,640
Yeah, I mean, with the hashtag and the Discord server,

3382
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:23,840
that does actualize it, and it seems legit to me.

3383
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:27,680
That would just be, like, that would just completely undermine

3384
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:30,560
whatever he was trying to do with the final video.

3385
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:30,640
Exactly.

3386
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,080
That would completely undermine it.

3387
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:33,120
It would be really fucking dumb.

3388
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:35,520
And that's one of the main reasons I think he was, in fact, hacked.

3389
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:38,080
And by the way, they say that these chuckling squad guys

3390
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:40,960
are the same guys who hacked Etika after he died,

3391
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:42,960
and then also, like, Jack, when Jack's account,

3392
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:45,440
like Twitter head guy, got his account hacked.

3393
02:18:45,440 --> 02:18:47,280
So, again, I don't know that for sure,

3394
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:48,800
but it seems reasonable.

3395
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:51,440
So, you know, that seems to be the best theory.

3396
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,000
I see.

3397
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,040
So, there you go.

3398
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:53,520
Fascinating.

3399
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:57,840
Oh, and you know, there was actually two more voicemails about this.

3400
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,120
They're both brief.

3401
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:02,000
Let me just play those quickly, because they are amusing.

3402
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:03,040
Okay.

3403
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:04,160
Sorry.

3404
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:05,760
About the same thing?

3405
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:07,360
It's about this issue.

3406
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:09,200
We don't need to spend long on it, but they were funny,

3407
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,080
so I just want to play them.

3408
02:19:10,640 --> 02:19:10,960
Okay.

3409
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:14,320
And here, this is the unironic gang weed guy.

3410
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:15,840
So, let's hear what he has to say.

3411
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,240
Go.

3412
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:20,640
Attention, all fellow epic gamers and gang weed members.

3413
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:21,360
That's me.

3414
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:24,960
It is I, once again, the unironic gang weed guy.

3415
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,120
Back again with an announcement for you all.

3416
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,840
Joker is now in theaters.

3417
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:33,120
That being said, no chance.

3418
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:35,680
Veronica's especially NPCs.

3419
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:39,120
Blumfters, boomers, or sheeple are loud.

3420
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:41,600
That means you, Nate.

3421
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:44,480
Which one are you?

3422
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:46,560
You should never be afraid of the outward.

3423
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:50,800
Did you see that guy on Twitter who said he was going to say it?

3424
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:51,840
But didn't.

3425
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:53,360
What a shame.

3426
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,440
In his place, I will say the n-word.

3427
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:58,720
Oh, no.

3428
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:02,640
Because he ran out of time.

3429
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,000
That was a close one.

3430
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,440
Wait, he ran out of just the time.

3431
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:07,920
Uh, interestingly, I think we have another voicemail

3432
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:08,640
on an ironic gang weed.

3433
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:09,360
Do you have to follow up?

3434
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:10,160
Let's hear what he has to say.

3435
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:11,040
Go.

3436
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:14,640
Okay.

3437
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:14,880
Yeah.

3438
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:16,720
All right.

3439
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:18,960
Oh, you rascally wab at you.

3440
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,240
Yeah, that one got me.

3441
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:20,800
That one caught me off guard.

3442
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:23,840
Better punchline than the actual punchline.

3443
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:24,800
Yeah, kind of.

3444
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:25,600
Yeah, kind of.

3445
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:28,880
Okay, another quality voicemail here.

3446
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:31,120
We've got Racky the Robot Guy.

3447
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:32,880
Oh, wait, before we end this,

3448
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:36,080
we have to, I have to say that we are suing the Joker,

3449
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:37,840
because we were talking about this before,

3450
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:40,720
that this is actually a copied bit

3451
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:42,320
from the Procrastinators podcast.

3452
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:45,520
What is this but racist forest gump repurposed?

3453
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,960
We, exactly.

3454
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:50,400
We have intellectual property to all, you know,

3455
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:51,680
attempts to say the n-word.

3456
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:51,920
All, all racism.

3457
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,120
We expect the royalties.

3458
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,680
Yeah, yeah.

3459
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:55,120
All racism is property of the pieces here.

3460
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,960
Racism is our intellectual property.

3461
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:00,320
We are the source of racism.

3462
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:01,680
That's another t-shirt in the making.

3463
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:02,480
We are the source of racism.

3464
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:04,080
We are the source of racism.

3465
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:04,320
Nope.

3466
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:08,320
Nobody else was doing anything with racism.

3467
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,520
Nobody was being racist.

3468
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:13,120
We alone, we alone were using it,

3469
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:15,680
and now you want to swoop in and recuperate it,

3470
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:17,600
and I, and I won't stand for it.

3471
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:18,640
I don't think so, buddy.

3472
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:20,320
I don't think, now when there's money on the line,

3473
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,440
sweet dollory dudes.

3474
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:22,720
All right.

3475
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:24,480
That's sticky icky cashish.

3476
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:26,400
All right.

3477
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,640
Next we got Racky the robot guy.

3478
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:29,760
Okay, let's hear what he has to say.

3479
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:30,000
Go.

3480
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:33,840
So, a while ago, I came in contact

3481
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:35,520
with my childhood friend again.

3482
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:37,680
After some chatting,

3483
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:40,080
he reveals that he's gotten his first girlfriend,

3484
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:40,960
which surprises me,

3485
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,280
since he's the most virgin loser kind of guy I know.

3486
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,440
But of course, I congratulate him.

3487
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:48,320
However, after some time,

3488
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:50,800
it comes to light that not only

3489
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:52,640
is this an internet relationship,

3490
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,680
but the chick lives in Michigan, U.S.,

3491
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,160
while we live in Sweden.

3492
02:21:58,720 --> 02:21:59,520
Yep.

3493
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,000
And he plans on moving to the U.S.

3494
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,920
in a year or two to live with her.

3495
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:04,000
How old?

3496
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:04,560
How old?

3497
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:04,880
I want to know what these people are.

3498
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:06,800
Mind you, he's 16,

3499
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,800
and longer communication is very role-playing

3500
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:11,680
over discourse.

3501
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:15,040
So, he plans on skipping out

3502
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,960
on the last year of high school

3503
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:18,400
and free college,

3504
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,680
which we have here in Sweden.

3505
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:20,480
Oh.

3506
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:21,680
So, my question is,

3507
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:23,440
how the fuck do I make him realize

3508
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:25,680
how impossible this relationship is

3509
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,600
without him, I don't know,

3510
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,880
getting mad at me?

3511
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:29,920
Off your good man.

3512
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:31,360
You let him get mad at you.

3513
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:31,840
That's how.

3514
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:38,080
Okay, he will realize this is stupid.

3515
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,640
Indeed.

3516
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:38,960
But will you be in time?

3517
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,640
I would hope if nothing else,

3518
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:43,040
the system has enough checks and balances

3519
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:44,720
in place to prevent this from happening,

3520
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,840
but he will realize that,

3521
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:50,800
and you should just tell him that so,

3522
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:53,440
because when he eventually realizes that,

3523
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,720
like he might be mad at you now,

3524
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:57,040
but he will appreciate you more in the future

3525
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:58,160
because you were right,

3526
02:22:58,160 --> 02:22:59,840
and you told him the truth.

3527
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,320
This is what happened.

3528
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:03,600
And you should play him this pod,

3529
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:05,040
you should recommend him this episode

3530
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,320
of the podcast so he can hear.

3531
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:07,680
Yeah, we can break it down for him.

3532
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,040
Let him hear this section.

3533
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:13,280
This is the symptom of the false scarcity of pussy

3534
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:16,080
that our generation is struggling with.

3535
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:17,440
There is no scarcity.

3536
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:19,520
There's millions of girls in every fucking town.

3537
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:20,240
You can go meet them.

3538
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,360
And like this is just,

3539
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:22,560
this is a guy who's clearly,

3540
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,840
like never had a girlfriend.

3541
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:26,000
Like some girl online shows him some affection.

3542
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,080
He's like, I'm all in, all my chips.

3543
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:29,920
I'm going in on this relationship.

3544
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:30,880
This is the one.

3545
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:34,000
Guys, this is why every guy needs to develop

3546
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,840
at least a fucking little bit

3547
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,720
of the basic like social graces to get a girl,

3548
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:41,920
so that they don't like sacrifice so much

3549
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,640
for some pussy across the fucking planet

3550
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,400
that like, it's a furry role play.

3551
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,400
Like, oh my God, are you fucking kidding me?

3552
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:49,680
All the red flags are there.

3553
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,640
Is this the quality woman that you want to spend your life with?

3554
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:54,640
Obviously you're probably not thinking about that level,

3555
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,160
but it's just, this is,

3556
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:58,720
the desperation is so obvious to everyone.

3557
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,880
And it just comes from, as I always say,

3558
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:02,880
the biggest problem in our world right now

3559
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:06,160
is the weakness of men, the desperation of men,

3560
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:08,320
and this false scarcity of pussy

3561
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:10,480
that guides every false mentality.

3562
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:11,840
Oh my God, don't be a fool.

3563
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,360
Don't be a fucking fool.

3564
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:16,640
Literally just go ask any girl like in your class right now,

3565
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,760
like just do this.

3566
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,280
Like, hey, I think you're cool.

3567
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:20,160
You want to hang out sometime?

3568
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:22,320
You literally do that.

3569
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:25,120
And they will be gushing as a waterfall

3570
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:26,960
before your sheer chatteliness,

3571
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:29,040
because like no guys do that these days,

3572
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,400
especially in fucking high school.

3573
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:34,560
Like literally just buy, go to PCP,

3574
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,440
Teespring buy, and I'm just being cool T-shirt

3575
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:39,120
and live those words.

3576
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:40,720
Live those words and just be cool.

3577
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:42,480
Just be cool, couldn't agree more.

3578
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:44,720
Unironically, good advice,

3579
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:47,120
because even if you get shot down, like, it like-

3580
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:48,400
You still got a T-shirt.

3581
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:50,000
So that's a win-win right there.

3582
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:52,720
That's very true.

3583
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:55,440
That T-shirt will be there for you no matter what.

3584
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:58,400
But also, it breaks like the barrier of like,

3585
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:59,520
oh God, I can't do this.

3586
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:02,720
It's too scary, you know, what you finally do,

3587
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,480
and you realize that like you don't instantly

3588
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:06,240
die on the spot if you get shot down.

3589
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:07,040
Yeah, exactly.

3590
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:10,800
It makes, it goes from something unfathomable

3591
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:12,320
to something that you've already done

3592
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:13,920
and is clearly doable.

3593
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:15,520
Oh my God, I know it's hard.

3594
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:18,000
It's literally hard, it'd be hard for me if I was single.

3595
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,320
It would be hard to just approach a girl I liked

3596
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:22,000
and like say she's cute and hang out with her.

3597
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,600
It's always gonna be challenging.

3598
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:25,440
It's hard for like every guy on the planet,

3599
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:27,600
unless you're like just like some billionaire,

3600
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,760
like a party you're hosting or some shit like that.

3601
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,560
What do they call that?

3602
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:32,960
Like situational lording, the club, whatever,

3603
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:33,920
it doesn't matter.

3604
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:37,440
Point is, yes, just let the guy listen to this.

3605
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:40,240
And like he will think like, wow, you know, I really am.

3606
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:41,120
This is kind of absurd.

3607
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,360
This is kind of like, there's that cute girl in my class

3608
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:45,200
who like I would actually love to like hang out with

3609
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,360
and she doesn't exist across the fucking planet.

3610
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:49,200
Maybe I could like talk to her once

3611
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,960
and like just see how that goes.

3612
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:53,200
Maybe she's a very role player, you don't know.

3613
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:55,360
Exactly, and you could do it in person.

3614
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:56,560
You could put your fur suits on,

3615
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:59,680
you could rub each other's paw, what's the word?

3616
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,440
Toe beans against each other.

3617
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:03,520
Oh, it could be lewd as hell, my dude.

3618
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,280
So go for it.

3619
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,600
There's literally nowhere to go but up, unfortunately.

3620
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:08,400
He's right.

3621
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:09,600
As fortunate as to say.

3622
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,520
And yeah, be mad at us.

3623
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,360
Don't be mad at your friend for pointing you're here.

3624
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:14,160
Yes, exactly.

3625
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:16,320
Tell them that you left a funny goofy voicemail.

3626
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:19,280
Friend, if you're listening, you know, it's cool, you know,

3627
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:23,200
cool, you got the internet girlfriend, that's fine.

3628
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:24,000
It's fine.

3629
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,520
You're 16, it's good, you know, good, good, whatever.

3630
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:28,720
It's cool, nothing matters.

3631
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,160
Yep.

3632
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:32,160
It's all gravy.

3633
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,720
It's like the opposite what we've been saying.

3634
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:37,120
Don't move to America, America fucking sucks, you don't,

3635
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,880
don't come here for your own sake, don't fucking.

3636
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:43,840
At least not until after you've done the whole free college and shit,

3637
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:47,040
like that'll be a huge fucking leg up over everybody else.

3638
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,600
Yeah, and like moving away from everything you've ever known,

3639
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:51,600
like your family, etc.

3640
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,920
Basically nothing by this.

3641
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:56,640
Okay, if you can't shake the guy,

3642
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:59,200
if you can't fucking shake the guy on this point,

3643
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,320
then, and you will in time.

3644
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:02,240
I mean, it's not your job to shake him.

3645
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:03,200
No, no, it's not.

3646
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:05,680
But like this guy rightly is just like, wow, this is retarded.

3647
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:08,240
He's just being the reasonable friend who's like,

3648
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:10,320
I'm 100% aware of how silly this is.

3649
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:13,600
Like if nothing else, just tell him like, okay,

3650
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:16,080
like what happens is right now,

3651
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:18,320
this is an illusion of relationships.

3652
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:19,600
It's a fugazi.

3653
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:21,200
Tell him to make it real.

3654
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,160
It's a spook.

3655
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,640
Tell him to make it real by saying like, okay,

3656
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:27,600
like initiate plans to meet up.

3657
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:31,120
And when you see all the effort that's involved in actually like,

3658
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:32,400
it doesn't have to be moved forever,

3659
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,400
but just meet up one time,

3660
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:36,480
like make plans to do that.

3661
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:38,800
And when he sees how fucking impossible it will happen,

3662
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:40,240
either one of two things will happen.

3663
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,600
One, the more likely thing,

3664
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:43,920
it will completely fall through and it won't happen.

3665
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:46,160
And I mean, let's be real, this plan will fall through.

3666
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:47,360
It's guaranteed.

3667
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:47,920
Absolutely.

3668
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,920
But if the miracle happens,

3669
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,600
and he actually puts together the money

3670
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,280
and gets over there and sees the girl,

3671
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,920
either he'll get like amazing bomb furry sex,

3672
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,440
extremely unlikely, not going to happen.

3673
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:58,240
I guarantee it.

3674
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,320
Or what will happen is to be like,

3675
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:03,520
oh, this kind of sucks and is not worth all the effort I put in.

3676
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:04,960
And then the problem will go away.

3677
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:08,880
Boy, the perfect mental image I constructed in my head

3678
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,680
isn't quite lashing up to reality.

3679
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:13,600
Has he seen what she looks like in real life?

3680
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:15,440
I'm very curious about that,

3681
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:17,840
because that would be very interesting to know.

3682
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:18,720
Or has he just seen her furry OC?

3683
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:20,960
And you've done pictures with suit off and not with suit on.

3684
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:22,000
This is very important.

3685
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:24,560
You can hide a lot of those things.

3686
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,040
Everyone looks good in their fur suit, dude.

3687
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,720
Everyone looks good in their fur suit, but...

3688
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,400
Sure.

3689
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:31,440
Yeah, I mean, when you're me,

3690
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:33,280
you know, looking at the world through furry eyes,

3691
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:35,120
it's just everything's gravy.

3692
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:37,760
But okay, anyway, there you go.

3693
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,120
Okay, moving on to our next voice.

3694
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,880
Guys, I've been waiting for this one.

3695
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:42,800
This is my favorite voicemail of the bunch.

3696
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:45,440
I am so excited to share it with you.

3697
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,240
This comes from,

3698
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:49,600
I hope someone who becomes a staple on this episode,

3699
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:50,720
or on this podcast.

3700
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,520
All right, all right, here we go.

3701
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:52,800
I give you this, dude.

3702
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:55,840
The one and only, the fall hype guy.

3703
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:56,080
Go.

3704
02:28:57,040 --> 02:28:58,800
Bro, it's fall.

3705
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:01,840
That means there's fairs and festivals and...

3706
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:05,680
I'm about to watch figure eight derby racing,

3707
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:07,280
and it's going to be intense.

3708
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:10,720
I've been eating nothing but junk food all day long,

3709
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:13,520
including no freaking ostrich burger, dude.

3710
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,080
What's your favorite part of fall?

3711
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:21,680
Incredible.

3712
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,960
Oh, come on, that was good.

3713
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:25,040
He's so hyped about fall.

3714
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:25,840
Yeah, that's what I don't like.

3715
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,040
It's infectious.

3716
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,160
It's infectious.

3717
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:29,840
I hope it's ironic.

3718
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,120
If it's ironic, I like it.

3719
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,480
That was a budget munchie.

3720
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:33,600
That was okay.

3721
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:36,960
Oh, you guys, your standards are too fucking high.

3722
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,040
Nate, your problem is that you hyped it up.

3723
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,000
If you had just let it play,

3724
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,680
we probably would have been much more invested.

3725
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:42,960
Are you fucking fall, Stan?

3726
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:45,520
I love fall, yeah.

3727
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:46,640
You know what it reminds me of?

3728
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:50,080
It reminds me of that very beginning

3729
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:51,760
of Poo's Grand Adventure,

3730
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:52,560
where they say,

3731
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,720
on the last day of a golden summer,

3732
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,560
a boy and a bear were hanging out

3733
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:59,200
as some fucking adventure was about to dawn.

3734
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,000
They say hanging out.

3735
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,080
They say about to fucking stuck around.

3736
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,040
They do say that.

3737
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:05,840
I remember that.

3738
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:09,040
That language, that flowery British language.

3739
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,160
Ooh, it gets me every time.

3740
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:14,480
Okay, well, I, for one, can't wait to fall hype guy.

3741
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:18,000
I wouldn't mind fall, except that people go fucking weird for it.

3742
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,160
I want to hear from this guy every three months.

3743
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,160
I enjoy autumn quite a lot.

3744
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:24,640
Because of the sort of gray.

3745
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:25,200
Pumpkins.

3746
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,080
Like the grayness of the outside,

3747
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,320
but it's not cold enough to not take a walk.

3748
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:32,800
So it's sort of a unique time.

3749
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:34,960
The leaves are starting to fall.

3750
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:38,560
They're picturesque in the eastern seaboard in America.

3751
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:41,280
Oh, that's why they call it fall.

3752
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,200
Because the leaves do it.

3753
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:44,400
Probably.

3754
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:45,360
Why do they call it winter?

3755
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:46,720
Because that wind sure does turd.

3756
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,640
Because it's epic wind, bro.

3757
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:50,560
Or why do they call it summer?

3758
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,480
What does that have to do with anything?

3759
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:55,360
I want to get some of these nuts in my face.

3760
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:58,800
That's what I'm talking about.

3761
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:00,320
Anyway, call back in three months.

3762
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:02,400
I can't wait to hear from winter hype guy,

3763
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,720
and then spring hype guy, and then summer hype guy.

3764
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:06,800
I'll be tired of the bit by then.

3765
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:08,800
It'll be fresh.

3766
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,280
It'll be mostly.

3767
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:12,480
It'll be fresh again in however life.

3768
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:14,160
We're all still alive at that point.

3769
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,320
I'll say to that voice, I'll say hello, fresh.

3770
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:17,520
Guys, no, climate change.

3771
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:18,720
Seasons are fucking over.

3772
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,320
We're all going to fucking die.

3773
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,880
That's true.

3774
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:21,360
All right.

3775
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:22,160
We had a good run.

3776
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:22,960
Here's a question.

3777
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:24,720
If the seasons got locked,

3778
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,560
which season would you want it to be forever?

3779
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,120
I got to go with spring, I think.

3780
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:29,840
I got to go with spring.

3781
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:30,320
I mean, I like spring.

3782
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:32,480
I like South Coruble bloom.

3783
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:33,200
I like winter.

3784
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:36,480
I think winter is aesthetic, but I'd get sick of it real fast.

3785
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,080
Winter is fucking miserable.

3786
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:39,280
Yeah, I got to go.

3787
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:40,480
I like spring too.

3788
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:41,760
Spring, maybe summer.

3789
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:43,200
But summer's kind of fucking hot.

3790
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:44,240
I want late spring.

3791
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:45,440
It's all about spring.

3792
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:46,720
It's all about spring.

3793
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:48,720
If I had to, it's not my, yeah.

3794
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,280
If you had to.

3795
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:51,360
Gibber, are you a spring boy too, Gibber?

3796
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:52,720
Imagine if it was winter forever.

3797
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:55,040
Think of the practical implications of this question.

3798
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,040
Well, I mean, there is one thing is that in spring,

3799
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:02,320
there's a lot of pollen in the air, and I have hay fever.

3800
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:06,640
So I sneeze way more than during winter, during spring.

3801
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:08,960
Unironically, when I think about the seasons locking,

3802
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:11,280
I unironically just want to center it around.

3803
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:13,200
I've actually been studying this a little bit about,

3804
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:15,120
did you guys know that the Sakura blossoms

3805
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:18,640
in the land of the Surizing Sun, Nipon, they only bloom,

3806
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:21,040
not even for like all of spring,

3807
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:23,760
but literally for like, there's like a 10 day period.

3808
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:26,000
And actually, the progression of the blooming

3809
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,560
of the Sakura trees, it progresses,

3810
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:31,200
and different areas have different days regularly

3811
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,080
throughout the year.

3812
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:34,160
So you can actually kind of follow the progression

3813
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:37,520
of the Sakura blossoms from east to west, I think,

3814
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:38,640
along Japan.

3815
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:41,600
I've been looking into it for a potential trip in the spring.

3816
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:44,000
So we'll see what happens with that.

3817
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,080
Ooh, I love Japan, period.

3818
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:46,960
Okay, but anyway.

3819
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:48,080
Disgusting.

3820
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:49,520
Next up, it is gross.

3821
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:50,720
I apologize, everyone.

3822
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:55,040
Next up, we've got IRL Riddle My Ass Batman story.

3823
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,240
No joke.

3824
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:56,800
No joke.

3825
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:58,640
So welcome back, Mr. Batman.

3826
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:02,960
Do you know the black man of Joker fame?

3827
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:03,600
I'd be curious.

3828
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:05,280
Okay, let's go.

3829
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:05,600
Go.

3830
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:06,240
Hello, PCB.

3831
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:07,280
Riddle My Ass Batman here.

3832
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:08,320
First I have a question.

3833
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:10,400
An IRL story, Rintangely.

3834
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:11,600
Related to that question.

3835
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:12,000
Question.

3836
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:12,960
Are you doing it in October?

3837
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,200
I've done it in the past and failed this year.

3838
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:16,800
I made it two days before missing one.

3839
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,000
Don't worry, I have a good reason.

3840
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,120
Okay, story time.

3841
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,320
I'm walking over the bridge.

3842
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:22,800
On my way to work, I get off the bridge, talk to my buddy.

3843
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:24,480
Not my buddy, it turns out.

3844
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:27,280
Next thing I know, I feel a big wop in the back of my head.

3845
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:28,320
Everything goes black.

3846
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,080
The next part of the story, I don't really remember.

3847
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:32,240
I have to piece together from what other people told me.

3848
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,600
I wake up on the railroad tracks.

3849
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,200
I have complete amnesia.

3850
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,400
No wallet, no glasses, and phone broken.

3851
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:40,960
Happened to stumble my way into a police station

3852
02:33:40,960 --> 02:33:42,400
via the train tracks.

3853
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:44,080
After that, they ID me.

3854
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,000
Talked to me on the hot team to the hospital.

3855
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,280
No brain damage.

3856
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,000
Talked to my family.

3857
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:50,240
They tell me to bombard me with information.

3858
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:52,240
Hopefully jogging my memory.

3859
02:33:52,240 --> 02:33:54,480
What does a little, and what jog memory?

3860
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:56,320
Not in my family photos or anything like that.

3861
02:33:56,320 --> 02:33:59,040
What happened to jog memory is a little story called,

3862
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:02,320
a little video called by Joseph Jostar,

3863
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:05,360
called Entire Riddle My Ass Gavance Saga.

3864
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:06,880
I said my memories come back to me

3865
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:09,040
and I felt like I was taking a PCV.

3866
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:10,960
Anyway, I started even told her as soon as I remember

3867
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:12,240
how to jog again.

3868
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:13,440
What happened to my next life?

3869
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:14,960
Turned the next time to find out.

3870
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:17,200
Same PCV time, same PCV channel.

3871
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:18,880
Yeah, all right.

3872
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:23,120
He said this was IRL.

3873
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:26,800
He said no joke, but surely there must be joke.

3874
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,480
I really like the idea that the story starts

3875
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:32,480
when he goes on a bridge, talks to a friend,

3876
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:34,480
turns out he's not his friend, then he gets knocked out.

3877
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,720
Who is this mysterious character?

3878
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:39,760
Yeah, I want to know about that guy.

3879
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:40,880
Perhaps that was Riddle My Ass.

3880
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:42,320
Maybe that was Joe, Joe, Joe, Jostar.

3881
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:43,120
You know?

3882
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:44,320
Maybe that was Joseph Jostar.

3883
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:45,360
Maybe that was Black Man.

3884
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,360
That could have been Black Man.

3885
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,080
He sees Riddle My Ass Batman in Fringe of his Turf,

3886
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:51,120
his copyright.

3887
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:53,120
That would make sense.

3888
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:58,240
I am not doing Inktober because I...

3889
02:34:58,240 --> 02:34:59,680
Well, I wouldn't have done it anyway,

3890
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:00,480
because I don't like it.

3891
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:03,760
I don't do traditional drawing very much,

3892
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,360
so I know I would fail at it,

3893
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:07,040
and I don't accept the legitimacy

3894
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:08,640
of digital drawing for Inktober.

3895
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:10,480
I think it's down when people are like,

3896
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:12,720
oh, digital ink counts, I don't agree.

3897
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:13,200
Stupid.

3898
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:14,720
That's fair.

3899
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:15,600
Fight me in the comments.

3900
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:18,320
This is like Never Paint's time to shine, though,

3901
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:20,560
because Never Paint always does

3902
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:22,720
like IRL shit or whatever.

3903
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:23,600
Go, Never Paint.

3904
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,600
And I wouldn't do it anyway,

3905
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:30,880
because I'm doing my fucking Phantom Horn comic,

3906
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:31,840
and if I'm going to be drawn,

3907
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:32,720
I want to be working on that.

3908
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:34,000
Makes sense to me.

3909
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,440
I'm doing Devtober, obviously,

3910
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:36,000
so that's different.

3911
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:36,160
Indeed.

3912
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:38,800
Monthtober is the most viable.

3913
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:40,240
It really is.

3914
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:42,080
I feel like it's a new movement

3915
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:44,320
that really needs to pick up some steam.

3916
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:47,280
Nate, you doing Inktober?

3917
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:50,480
I'm doing, no, just no, just absolutely not.

3918
02:35:50,480 --> 02:35:52,640
Are you doing like worktober?

3919
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:55,280
I'm doing the same amount of worktober

3920
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:57,360
I would do under the given month.

3921
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:58,160
Nate's doing work supposedly,

3922
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:59,760
but we don't see any results of it.

3923
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,200
I'm making my weeagwas.

3924
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:03,040
They're basically weekly at this point,

3925
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:04,080
and that's great.

3926
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:07,760
I'm chugging along, and I've had enough time

3927
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:08,640
to work on other stuff,

3928
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:10,960
so new videos of me, you'll see.

3929
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:11,440
You know what?

3930
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,240
By the time, I always say it by the time,

3931
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:15,280
no, don't say it.

3932
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:16,880
Don't say it.

3933
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:19,200
Nate, a new video, we'll be out.

3934
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:22,400
That's not even a weeagwa on my channel.

3935
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,040
Don't say it.

3936
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:23,440
Oh my gosh.

3937
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,560
This is like my N-word.

3938
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:26,400
This is my, you know, it's mine.

3939
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:27,280
Don't say it, Nate.

3940
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:28,080
Don't say it.

3941
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:29,120
I'm saying it.

3942
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:29,920
I'm saying it.

3943
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:31,520
You'll be able to judge.

3944
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:33,360
You'll be able to mock me mercilessly

3945
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:34,320
wherever you please, if not.

3946
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:36,560
I mean, again, it's lost its edge

3947
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,000
when we can do it constantly.

3948
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,720
He's going to say the C-word, content.

3949
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:41,440
Yeah, there it is.

3950
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:42,080
There it is.

3951
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:42,640
We'll see.

3952
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,240
Or the N-word, new content.

3953
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:45,760
New, the N-C, yeah.

3954
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,360
Well, you'll be the judge, folks.

3955
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:47,920
Let me know.

3956
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:50,640
Let me know if my thing is out when you hear this.

3957
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:51,920
Okay, here we go.

3958
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:53,280
Next up, we've only got a few left.

3959
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:56,320
We've got Peter Griffin watches the PCP.

3960
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:58,080
Oh man, what I've always been waiting for.

3961
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,360
Okay, here we go.

3962
02:36:59,360 --> 02:36:59,760
Peter.

3963
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:02,640
I'm just patron to the PCP.

3964
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:09,680
Peter, did you ever have the last time you looked at the PCP?

3965
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:13,520
Hey, Lois, I'm going to vape and smoke weed

3966
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:16,000
while arguing about politics and my little pony.

3967
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:21,120
It's Sans Peter Griffin.

3968
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:24,480
That's how it happened.

3969
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:27,120
That's the, that's Sans Peter Griffin's backstory.

3970
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:28,480
That's his backstory.

3971
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:30,160
Listen to the PCP.

3972
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:33,600
He vape and smoked weed while doing something else

3973
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,960
that I forget and then he turned on the PCP.

3974
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:37,040
Vaping and MLP and politics.

3975
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:37,600
The story started way with-

3976
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:39,120
Arguable politics and MLP.

3977
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:42,000
It was like, oh fuck, what's that movie?

3978
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:44,560
They reviewed it on Red Letter Media about Dom Delouise

3979
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:48,080
as the voice of the super skateboard, the intelligent skateboard.

3980
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,440
Yeah, I forget, but yeah.

3981
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:52,000
And just like this confluence of weird events

3982
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,520
just happened to create this super,

3983
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:56,640
it was like a lightning strike and all these like computer chips

3984
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:00,240
and like some other, like you wished upon a star or something.

3985
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:02,880
And the combination of these events just happened to create

3986
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:04,800
Dom Delouise, the magic skateboard.

3987
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,040
That it's the same with all these things coming together

3988
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:09,440
to create Sans Peter Griffin.

3989
02:38:09,440 --> 02:38:11,600
That's, that's uh, that's a bit.

3990
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:16,000
That story started with someone pledging to the PCP patron.

3991
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,200
So like, I mean already-

3992
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:19,280
Let that be an example for all of you right there.

3993
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:21,920
So it was, it started at the happy end

3994
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:24,960
and it was downhill from there.

3995
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:26,560
It was a story of false and grace.

3996
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:31,360
All right, next up we've got, oh, this is a good one.

3997
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:33,520
The grammar fascist is calling in.

3998
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:36,560
So truly an enemy to our friends and communists.

3999
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:37,840
Tell, let's see what he has to say.

4000
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:38,640
Yeah.

4001
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:40,320
All right, I'm mad.

4002
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:42,720
Anytime I try and tell someone they're a fucking dumbass

4003
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:44,560
because they use the wrong there or they're on your,

4004
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:46,480
and that doesn't make them a fucking dumbass, by the way.

4005
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:47,680
They always try to tell me, uh,

4006
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:49,200
you're just to be able to not see languages

4007
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,960
whenever people make it out to be.

4008
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:52,880
No, fuck off.

4009
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:54,480
People act like there's no objective effect.

4010
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:55,120
That's just wrong.

4011
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:57,760
Everyone knows the whole helping your uncle Jack off a horse

4012
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:00,160
and helping your uncle Jack off a horse thing by now.

4013
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:02,480
It does actually do something other than just make the eyes

4014
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:05,040
belonging to anyone with any common sense bleed.

4015
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:07,280
Everyone knows this, but they always respond with a,

4016
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:08,480
oh, that really makes a difference.

4017
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,400
It's probably not gonna actually change the meaning

4018
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:11,680
even though it could.

4019
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:13,040
That's what I have to say.

4020
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:14,400
And maybe you're right.

4021
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:15,200
It usually won't.

4022
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,520
But when you're proven you're so goddamn stupid

4023
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:18,880
you can't figure out when you're even supposed

4024
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:19,920
to use an apostrophe.

4025
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:22,800
How can I trust you to know when your grammar mistake will

4026
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:24,400
and won't actually matter?

4027
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:26,080
The people who actually know the rules of grammar

4028
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:27,760
will know when they can afford to post a typo

4029
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,520
or not bother thinking about which word to use

4030
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:32,160
because they actually understand the rules grammar works by.

4031
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:32,800
And that's fine.

4032
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:34,000
It's not annoying when that happens,

4033
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,360
but the people who always make this argument

4034
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,880
are the ones who can't even figure out which word

4035
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:39,200
or common placement or colon placement is correct.

4036
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:40,640
There's no fucking way for you to figure out

4037
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,240
if your mistake will change the meaning or not

4038
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:43,920
if you haven't bothered to learn the rules.

4039
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:45,680
But no, they just always try and make these arguments

4040
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:47,360
because they're so goddamn insecure

4041
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:48,560
about the grammatical incompetence

4042
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:50,480
that they feel when you do it so anyone who points it out.

4043
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:53,440
It's real straight.

4044
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:55,760
You make a good case, grammar fascist.

4045
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,560
Yeah, fuck him.

4046
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:57,760
Yeah, like, of course.

4047
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:00,720
Yeah, of course there are grammar rules.

4048
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:05,360
I mean, grammar is an authoritarian system, so.

4049
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:06,080
It's true.

4050
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:06,560
It's true.

4051
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:08,160
Who's to say?

4052
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:10,960
I guess I'll be a grammar fascist too.

4053
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:12,320
That's, I'll do it.

4054
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:13,280
Yeah, I'll do it.

4055
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,440
No, that's the one time that it's cool.

4056
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:16,400
It's way cool.

4057
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:19,840
I hope we get a call in from Bash the Grammar Fash next episode.

4058
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:20,800
I hope that.

4059
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:21,600
I look forward to that.

4060
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:24,320
I hope, well, I guess they don't need grammar

4061
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:25,280
when they're speaking.

4062
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:28,480
No, not really.

4063
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:31,520
Well, wait, in the spoken word, there are no rules

4064
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:33,040
and everyone's just making it up

4065
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,120
and it all, nothing matters and there's no God.

4066
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:39,520
Well, I assume grammar is like, yeah, the commas and stuff

4067
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:44,240
and those denote like pauses in speech or like.

4068
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:48,080
Well, grammar is also like nouns and vowels and adjectives.

4069
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:52,320
Okay, well, as long as he just speaks like an idiot,

4070
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:53,200
then it would be fine.

4071
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:55,760
Agreed.

4072
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:57,600
All right, we compromise on that.

4073
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:58,800
Don't learn your thays.

4074
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:01,040
Learn your thays and theirs and stuff.

4075
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,200
Like, I really don't know how people don't know them.

4076
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:08,080
It's not even that difficult.

4077
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:11,600
They just, I mean, I mean, it would be annoying, right?

4078
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:13,600
Like, if you make a mistake, like that's,

4079
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:17,680
if you make a mistake, it's a mistake and like, but yeah,

4080
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:19,520
I would be annoyed too if you say like,

4081
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:21,200
hey, use the wrong there.

4082
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:24,640
I mean, you could be in, you could do it in an annoying way,

4083
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:24,880
right?

4084
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:26,400
And they would say like, dude, you're just being,

4085
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,920
you're nitpicking, you're being pedantic.

4086
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:28,640
Like, who cares?

4087
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:29,360
Like, you know what I meant.

4088
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:30,160
Like, and that would be fair.

4089
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:34,320
But if they're like, no, there aren't any actual rules, man.

4090
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,280
Like, then they're just wrong.

4091
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:36,720
Well, yeah, yeah.

4092
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:37,920
And both can be true at once.

4093
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:40,240
You can both be an asshole and they're actually wrong.

4094
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:40,960
So, sure.

4095
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:41,840
Fair enough.

4096
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:42,720
All right, let's move on.

4097
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:43,920
Our last voicemail.

4098
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:45,440
Our last voicemail, everybody.

4099
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,440
This is from, okay, here we go.

4100
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:50,240
This is from The Cuck of Monte Pisto.

4101
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:53,840
Formerly, formerly, well-researched thesis

4102
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:56,720
who has been locked away in the voice jail where they belong.

4103
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:57,680
So, okay, let's.

4104
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,520
What was their well-researched thesis again?

4105
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:00,320
You want to remind me?

4106
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:03,600
Wasn't that about things being human core or not?

4107
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,440
And I think they said, like, the bathroom thing.

4108
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,160
Oh, okay.

4109
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:06,800
It was terrible.

4110
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:06,880
It was terrible.

4111
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:07,520
Yep, yep.

4112
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:08,480
I think that was them.

4113
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:09,280
I could be wrong.

4114
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:09,760
Let me know.

4115
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:11,920
Okay, let's hear what they have to say from the jail.

4116
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:12,480
Go.

4117
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:15,200
So, I'm sitting here at a disgrace caller in the voice jail,

4118
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:16,640
getting my daily lashes.

4119
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:17,760
And I get to thinking,

4120
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:20,000
how is an unfunny cuck such as myself

4121
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,240
going to free himself from the voice jail?

4122
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:22,880
And it hits me.

4123
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:23,360
Yeah.

4124
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:24,720
I'll suck mage's dick.

4125
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:25,760
Wait, no, that won't work.

4126
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,320
That's gay.

4127
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:26,800
Yeah?

4128
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:27,920
I'll suck mage's dick.

4129
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:28,480
Wait, shit.

4130
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:30,240
I'm pretty sure that got eaten out by piranhas.

4131
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:31,680
Well, fuck.

4132
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:34,080
There's no other choice left for me.

4133
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:35,360
I have to use my last resort.

4134
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:39,440
Go to patreon.com slash the pro-crasinators to support the show.

4135
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:41,440
$1 gets you access to the Patreon Discord

4136
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:43,760
and $5 gets you access to the bonus episode.

4137
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,200
And a currently undetermined amount

4138
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:47,200
gets you access to the Minecraft server.

4139
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,560
I'm donating right now.

4140
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:50,160
harass me in the Patreon Discord.

4141
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:50,720
Oh.

4142
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:53,520
You can recognize me as the cuck of Monty Pisto.

4143
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:55,200
But I won't be patroning for long.

4144
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:57,760
It's hard for voice jail convicts to find works these days.

4145
02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:00,160
And send in your voicemail, people.

4146
02:43:00,160 --> 02:43:02,000
If my shitty bits can get played on the show,

4147
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:02,720
yours can.

4148
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:04,480
Yours certainly can do better.

4149
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,160
Listen to that shitty audio quality.

4150
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:08,880
I'm calling for my phone.

4151
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,160
This is like take 20.

4152
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:10,640
Yeah.

4153
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:13,520
Link to the speak pipe is in the description.

4154
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,280
Oh, here come the guards now.

4155
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:15,920
It worked.

4156
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:16,720
I'm free.

4157
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:17,600
Oh, no, wait.

4158
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:19,120
What are they doing with those billy clubs?

4159
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:23,440
Getting too uppity.

4160
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:24,560
Getting too fucking uppity.

4161
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:24,960
It's me.

4162
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:25,520
It's me.

4163
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:27,600
I'm the jailer of the PC.

4164
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,560
Whatever it is.

4165
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:29,680
I'll leave him alone.

4166
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:30,720
Oh, no, he's good.

4167
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:31,680
Are we freeing him?

4168
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:32,160
Are we freeing him?

4169
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:32,720
Did you notice?

4170
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:34,400
Did you notice how he got a little uppity there?

4171
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:36,880
He's like putting that vague thread of like,

4172
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:38,640
oh, why am I in voice jail?

4173
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:40,480
I can't earn money to give to the Patreon.

4174
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:42,160
No, no, no, no, no.

4175
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:43,040
It's worse than that.

4176
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:44,640
He said he's not going to patron for long.

4177
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:47,760
Because now it's even if the convicts can't,

4178
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:50,320
convicts can't, and he's still a convict even to let him out.

4179
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:52,160
So there's no hope.

4180
02:43:52,160 --> 02:43:53,360
There's no point letting him out.

4181
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:54,960
Because if you let him out, he still doesn't have any money.

4182
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:55,760
So what doesn't matter.

4183
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:57,280
I mean, I think he's right.

4184
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:00,480
If we can't squeeze his wallet, we'll squeeze his skull.

4185
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:04,720
He's right where he needs to be, as far as I can say.

4186
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:06,240
He's right where he needs to be.

4187
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:06,960
This feels right.

4188
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:07,120
You're right.

4189
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:09,280
And thank him for doing the heavy lifting.

4190
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:10,800
Now that we're at the end of this episode,

4191
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:13,920
you heard it from the cuck of Monty Pisto.

4192
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:16,720
Go harass him in the PCP Patreon Discord.

4193
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:20,320
We'll give him an extra jello cup at his next weekly meal.

4194
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:22,240
Yeah, that seems fair.

4195
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:24,000
Yeah, so there you go.

4196
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,600
Patreon.com slash theprocrastinators.

4197
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:30,320
You heard it, $1 Discord, $5 bonus episodes.

4198
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:31,120
New one is out.

4199
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:31,920
New one is out.

4200
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,840
That's 30 episodes now.

4201
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:34,880
Incredible.

4202
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:35,360
Speak pipe.

4203
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:36,000
Link down below.

4204
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:36,880
Leave us your voicemails.

4205
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:37,680
We love them.

4206
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:40,640
And at tbcrastinators on Twitter for updates.

4207
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:41,680
There you go, everybody.

4208
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:42,640
Thanks for being here.

4209
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:43,040
Woo!

4210
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:45,440
We'll see you next episode next week.

4211
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,320
Have a good time.

4212
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:47,360
Good job, everyone.

4213
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:48,080
We made it.

4214
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:48,800
Bye-bye.

4215
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:49,440
Good bye.

4216
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:52,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4217
02:44:52,000 --> 02:45:00,320
Uh, feet are saying.
