00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint and

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,360
this is Gibbontake.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,520
That's about the, oh god, what's the phrase? That's about the long and short of it. That's

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,040
about the, that's true.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:35,680
That's about a spicy meatball. That's a Moray. That's a me, Mario. That's a me, Mario.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:44,940
No, sometimes it was just a week goes by and then I'm like, oh, a week went by and nothing

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,800
really happened.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Yeah, I feel like we just did the last one. I mean, what did I do this week? This week

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,920
I watched GameStop Plummet.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,880
Oh, yeah. What about that? You had some, didn't you?

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,680
Yeah. And in fact, I bought a little, I bought some more as it continued to go down. And in

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,720
fact, I have an order to buy even more if it goes down further.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,880
Ben, sounds like being stupid is what this means.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,960
No. I mean, it's, I mean, it's so cheap now that like, why not? Right?

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,320
I have heard like the narrative of like, this is hurting the billionaires is sort of being

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:41,000
perpetuated, like, in bad faith by people who were who like started the whole thing.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,040
Like they wanted people to buy into it and to put money into it because then they'd be

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,280
rich from the stocks that they bought initially.

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,400
There's a smaller amount of people who got off.

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,640
There was an incentive to like push that, that like the narrative of that further and

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,280
further, even if it wasn't necessarily true. I think I've learned like since then that

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,640
it's not as clean as, oh, the billionaires all lost money. Lots of other people did make

23
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
money.

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,040
It's not like I don't think it's not like I don't think that the people doing it had

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,680
a vested interest in pushing that angle to encourage people to jump on the bandwagon.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:34,280
But I don't see how it like wasn't actually Melvin Capital versus retail investors.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,960
Like that is what it was.

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:46,240
Largely, I wish I could remember exactly like the way it was explained to me, but it was,

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,320
there was this, what was it, like financial something blog that I read.

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm stupid. I can't remember it.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,880
I think that's us, honestly. I mean, do I trust?

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,840
Well, it was quite well written. Like it acknowledged that the, you know, it's definitely

33
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,040
hurting some people, but like ultimately the people who, you know, the game of chicken

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:25,360
sort of thing, like the last people are more hurt by buying in when it's at the top.

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,280
And then I know it's just sort of, I don't know, I feel a little differently about like

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,320
how it's because it's gone down now. It's it's less doing anything and people who got

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,200
into it at the peak of the hype, maybe just ended up losing a lot of money and not doing

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,920
a lot of damage to the billionaires that they were trying to do.

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,680
And it sucks for them. That's this is, this is, this is a terrible argument.

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,040
This is a terrible argument. Like, yes, obviously, obviously, if you bought at the peak and it's

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,560
gone down, you've lost money. No shit. No. This is why I shouldn't have brought it up,

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,200
because I can't remember the argument, because it was quite compelling. I was like, I guess, I guess,

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,200
yeah, fuck it, whatever. I was just trying to make conversation because I'm on the Procrastinators

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,120
podcast. Why would you, why would you try and make conversation with me? Why would you do that?

45
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Why would you try and be on the Procrastinators podcast? I don't know, Ben, maybe it's because

46
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,840
I like you, maybe it's because I like talking to you. Shut up.

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Okay. I think there are two ways to look at it. You could say like, oh, okay, the Wall Street

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,760
Bets people pushed the narrative that, oh, we're going to stick it to the billionaires.

49
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,560
And it was just a, you know, that was just their angle. But I mean, you could just as easily say,

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,320
oh, you know, some financial blog or whatever, or some like some other, some other investor,

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,200
who knows what their motives are. I mean, maybe they want to do that because they want to throw

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,840
these, you know, the retail investor under the bus. They want to make like a pro-capital argument.

53
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,360
I feel like those two things are like both entirely possible.

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:16,160
I just think that it was sold as a lot more simplistic for like to get people interested in

55
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,920
investing to the detriment of a lot of people who put too much money into it and have lost

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
quite a lot. There's the thing that was going around like Wall Street Bets have been like

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,840
suppressing posts that are talking about people like losing all of their money.

58
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,480
It's not Wall Street Bets fault. If somebody bet everything, if somebody invested more than

59
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,520
they were willing to lose and then they lost it. I mean, I don't know. Is there no culpability

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,960
at all? Yes. Like even slightly for exaggerating the harm that is being done to the billionaires

61
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,400
and because like none of these, well, not none of them, I guess.

62
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Nobody knew how it was going to shake out. In fact, nobody even really knows how it's

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,840
shaken up because it's still an open question whether they've covered their shorts or not.

64
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:22,080
I think my issue is I'm quite a cautious person. I took my time. I didn't want to jump in straight

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,200
away and I kind of waited too long for it for me to even jump in at all. Then it turns out I can't

66
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,760
even do Robin Hood and other things are not as good. So it's like, well, whatever, fuck it.

67
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
It's like a fidelity account like me. Yeah, but a lot of people who got into this

68
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,680
obviously, they didn't know how the stock market worked exactly and they were going

69
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,040
off of what other people were telling them and a lot of people went into all of this

70
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,280
quite uninformed as to the repercussions. I don't understand your argument. Yeah,

71
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,560
they shouldn't have done that. I think I just dislike hype a lot in general and this is one

72
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,600
of those instances where maybe the hype caused more damage than was necessary.

73
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,080
Speaking as someone who literally lost money because of the hype, it's my fault. It's my fucking

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:28,880
problem. Yeah, I just feel like there's trying to be like, it's difficult to say, oh, morally you

75
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,880
should, I don't know, put a warning. I don't know what the solution would be.

76
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,400
It just sucks that if not all the information is given and there's hype, people are going to

77
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:50,480
do things emotionally and I don't know. I don't know enough to make a really strong argument here,

78
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,240
but I'm just saying. I just think people are responsible for themselves.

79
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:07,520
Who's fault? I mean, this was not like, there was that one guy, a deep fucking value, but

80
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,520
he wasn't the one running the whole hype machine. He was kind of behind the whole plan,

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
but it's not like he was out there. None of them knew that it was going to blow up like that.

82
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah, that's true. It's not like I'm trying to blame somebody for other people losing money.

83
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,520
That's not the way I'm thinking about it. Here's my issue. Let's assume that as an

84
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,880
actually the shorts have been covered, like the whole thing is done, it is down and it is

85
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,040
going to stay down and continue to go down. There is no more gasoline left in the GME machine.

86
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,360
It is a lost cause. It was a failed attempt and it didn't work. It spiked for a minute and that's

87
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,120
it. I mean, that could be the case. It's pretty likely, it's fairly likely the case, but nobody

88
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,040
knew how it was going to shake out. It was not known that that would be the result.

89
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,200
So it can be true, both things can be true, that the stick it to the billionaire sentiment

90
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,400
was sincerely meant and that did not occur. I know, I absolutely believe that it was

91
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,320
sincerely meant at first or at least majority of people were like, I'm not saying the narrative

92
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,760
is completely false. I'm just saying that there was an invested interest in certain people who

93
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,640
got into it early to keep the narrative going. And I was saying like the on Wall Street bets,

94
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,360
the Reddit thread, people's posts about how they got into it because of the hype and they've lost

95
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,480
their life savings. Stupid, obviously they're at fault for that. But those posts were being like

96
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,040
suppressed to give the impression that it was a lot more successful for everyone than it was.

97
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,760
When you say suppressed, when you say suppressed, I mean, I mean, the like the front page of

98
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,160
Wall Street bets was covered in people like, and it was the same thing on like on like the

99
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,400
when I was in Bitcoin, I would sometimes look at the Bitcoin subreddit, and it was the same thing

100
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,160
then it like the front pages is covered in posts that are super fucking bullish that are all like

101
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
this shit's going to the moon, the shit's gonna go as high as this is gonna go infinitely high,

102
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,960
we're all gonna make a million dollars because that's what people want to see. And that's what

103
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,960
gets upvoted. And that's what, you know, that's what ends up getting most visibility. That's

104
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,720
just how red it works. I guess, sure, I heard that people's posts were being deleted, not that

105
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,200
they were just not getting upvotes. But I, I haven't looked into it myself. I just heard that it was

106
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:43,840
on a Wall stream. Well, here's okay. Okay. Aside from the the GME thing, right? That's that's the

107
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,080
thing. I'm very annoyed. I'm very annoyed about Dogecoin. I don't like it. Yeah, I don't know

108
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,400
what's been going on with that. Exactly. Well, basically, while the GME thing was going on,

109
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,520
I don't know if it was all Elon, but like Elon was in part of it. And every time Elon tweets

110
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:12,400
about anything, like, the market does weird shit. So Elon et al, while the GME thing was going on,

111
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,920
he was like, Oh, dogecoin to the moon. And then it did. And it's like, it went up pretty high. And

112
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,080
I like saw it shooting up. And I tried to get a Robinhood account to get some. And they didn't

113
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,880
approve. They only approved me like, like two days ago, like my and I don't need I don't even know

114
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,000
if I want to use it anymore. And I don't know, I thought it was just going to spike momentarily,

115
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
but like, it's still going up, it's it's gone up even more today, it's almost back up to like

116
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,320
where it peaked at the time. So like, it's still rising. And that's fine. That's fine and everything.

117
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,760
But I'm it really pisses me off that like the GME thing was like, okay, we can be skeptical of a

118
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,360
one, but supposedly it was like about something. It was like, Oh, let's like, you know, little guy

119
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,880
beat the hedge fund managers, it was about something. And then Elon et al, just make just do like,

120
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,640
hey, guys, look at this other thing, haha, funny dogecoin meme currency, crypto of the people.

121
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,000
And like, that's fine. It's fine that people made money on that. But it's really, I think it's

122
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,080
really despicable of Elon to like, do that at that moment, like what, why did the why what was

123
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,640
the need for it? It didn't even have anything to do with it. It's just like, at a moment,

124
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,680
people were thinking about stocks, he was like, Hey, look at this other stock.

125
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:43,280
And it worked. I mean, yeah, people love Elon, but like, what's despicable about mentioning it,

126
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,320
even knowing that it would like spike dogecoin? Well, I don't know. I mean, for one thing,

127
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,680
maybe people who might have been considering the GME thing might have been diverted to doge.

128
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,920
Right. Okay. I mean, the fervor was about GME and AMC and Nokia and all that.

129
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,680
And dogecoin didn't have anything to do with it. But I don't know,

130
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,400
because it's funny and because it's Elon. I mean, it's, there's a lot of reddit energy

131
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,040
in the entire thing. It's, it's just sort of like, haha, like, I don't know anything about this stuff.

132
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
But it's like, what everyone else is doing. Oh, cool. Elon's also tweeting about this other

133
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,920
thing that's also money related. Haha, that's really funny doge. Very currency much. Wow.

134
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,240
Yes, I know. That's, that's what I said, and it makes me really mad. Yeah, I mean, I suppose.

135
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know. I mean, it's not, it's not just sour grapes, because like, I'm fine. I'm fine with

136
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,480
the fact. Okay, on the one hand, on the one hand, like, I, yeah, I do, it's not, it's not about the

137
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
fact that like people made money. It's about the fact that Elon got his way. That's what makes me mad.

138
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,720
Yeah. Also, yeah, if you, if Elon owns dogecoin, this is like, wait, does he?

139
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
I don't, I don't know. I mean, he might or he might or he might not.

140
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,080
I thought I've heard that it was made by some of, I guess, whoever made it doesn't necessarily have

141
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,000
most of it. Not necessarily. Um, that's the thing that like, fucking, that McAfee, I saw

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,520
like a little YouTube documentary about John McAfee, and apparently he would do a thing where he

143
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,400
would invest in crypto and then he would do like a public circuit, appearance circuit, talking about

144
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:33,360
the crypto, pump up its value by getting it exposure, and then just sell it, right? So I don't

145
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,640
know if Elon's doing that, but like, if he owns, if he owns dogecoin, or anything that he tweets

146
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:48,320
about. It probably, I mean, like if he sees like, oh, all of these Reddit bros are getting interested

147
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:56,240
in stocks and shares and investing, maybe if I get some dogecoin, I can get them to pivot over

148
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,640
to investing in the thing that makes me more money. Maybe. It would, it would be uncharacteristically

149
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,360
intelligent for Elon Musk. So I don't know. I mean, he knows how to make money.

150
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,520
Uh, and I'm sure he, he understands, I'm sure he understands like what his, what his tweets

151
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,280
tend to do to the market. Like that time that he tweeted that like his, the Tesla stock was too high,

152
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:34,720
and then it went down. I just hate him. I just really hate him. And I am upset that he, that's

153
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,400
something that he likes happened. That's pretty much the long and short of it.

154
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:49,920
Preach. Yeah. I feel like that, like generally speaking, all of this stuff is just made,

155
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,080
like the major good, I think, is just letting a lot of people understand how fucking fake everything

156
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,960
is in terms of like finances. A lot of people become disillusioned to it. And that's,

157
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,440
you know, good because it's true. And now they know, but yeah, there's not much that can be done

158
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,440
about it immediately. But I think, I mean, yeah, I think, I mean, everyone already knew.

159
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,840
Well, I don't think everyone knew quite to the extent because everyone's just heard of stocks.

160
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,800
And they don't really, like the layman, the layman doesn't know quite how like

161
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,600
manipulative stock people are. They just assume, well, they're just doing things. I don't know.

162
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:44,800
They make money by, like they have no idea that it's all based on, I don't know,

163
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,800
deliberately fucking with real people. It is a good example of like the economy being

164
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,040
imaginary. I mean, I don't think it's gonna, I mean, I don't think it's gonna have like

165
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,360
convinced that many people that like didn't already have that opinion, you know.

166
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,440
I guess not. Well, I guess that's the case of like everything. I guess it's all just like

167
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,960
death by a thousand cuts, you know, like in terms of like showing like people understanding that

168
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,080
like, oh, the system is rigged. I mean, I think you're right. And that a lot of people know that

169
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,840
things are rigged and, and like, it's not fair. And there's like a class of people at the top

170
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:33,680
that are too powerful. And it sucks. There's just different difference in opinion of like,

171
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,160
why, whether that's a problem. And if there is someone at the top, who is it? And what should

172
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,560
we do about it? Some people would think it's the Jews that are at the top, which is dumb.

173
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,120
Laws, right? That's good. Yeah. And then other people would think that it's not a problem

174
00:17:51,120 --> 00:18:01,280
because they want to be at the top. Yeah. So it's like, yeah. Man, the mindset of like,

175
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:10,960
the mindset of like, imagine believing that like, whoever is at the top, like,

176
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,160
obviously deserves to be there because they are there. And if they didn't deserve to be there,

177
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
they wouldn't be there. They must have, they must have earned it somehow, right? Like,

178
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,880
like, like things must be fair. Like the world must be a fair place where merit is rewarded.

179
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,520
Therefore, whoever is at the top must deserve it and must also be the best person in addition to

180
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,880
being the most successful because how because it would just be fucked up if it were any other way.

181
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,560
So yeah, it can't be. Well, feel a lot of that, feel a lot of that attitude.

182
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,720
When I go to fucking Twitter, and I see these fucking liberals replying to Brooklyn dad Defiant,

183
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:06,000
that filthy weenie piece of shit about that lady smashing her guitar and saying it's racist that

184
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,960
she did that. Yeah, what the hell was that? I didn't catch all of it. I only recently. I don't

185
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,040
know. I don't know. It was, I guess, I guess some band performed on SNL and like the woman

186
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,880
guitarist smashed her guitar and Brooklyn dad Defiant is like, um, what's up with that?

187
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,080
And all these filthy, these filthy goblins in the reply is like, um, a real display

188
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,520
of unwarranted white privilege. Oh, do you know that starving Africans would love to eat that

189
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:47,120
guitar? And just, just as opposed to warranted white privilege as opposed to warranted white

190
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,400
privilege, um, I don't know, just like a, just like a bunch of liberal hand rigging over shit that

191
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,960
doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Literally just like rock, literally just like rock and roll

192
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,840
is dangerous and gonna end up corrupt our kids like so uncouth. I don't know how these people

193
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,160
take them so seriously. Like in a in an abstract sort of way, you could say, oh, she has the money

194
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,200
to smash guitar because she knows she can buy another one. But like that's so like irrelevant

195
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
to everything. Okay. Okay. The thing, the thing about that, the thing about that is how, how

196
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,840
fucking dog brain we do you have to be to like, okay, there's the guitar that she's smashing

197
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,760
couple hundred dollars versus like this woman is appearing on SNL, right? Like that is like,

198
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,800
oh, this woman who's appearing on SNL, you know, that's fine. But like smashing a guitar is just

199
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,280
an unwarranted display of privilege. Are you fucking kidding me? Like that's like the guitar is

200
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,520
nothing. Right. If you're trying to like criticize power should be like, oh, this is like the, you

201
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,080
know, here's here's a person who's getting this like huge, this huge platform to like promote

202
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,760
themselves, you know, this is this is like, this is a huge, a huge opportunity that represents

203
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,880
like a massive, you know, potential future earnings for this person. It's so much more than the guitar,

204
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,640
right? The guitar is like, is like a, a mode of dust in the, in the, in the avalanche of what this

205
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,120
event that you are witnessing is. It could be that being, being on SNL means that she has the

206
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
money potential to smash that guitar, whereas before she didn't. And it's like, I mean, I,

207
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean, I would, I mean, I would think it was stupid and dumb to be like, um, no one should be

208
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
on SNL because that means they have too much privilege. Like, I, like, I would think that's

209
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
stupid too, but at least you would be like, you know, you wouldn't be missing the forest

210
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,440
for the trees quite so much, right? If you want to hyper focus on something stupid.

211
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,920
Surface level, woke brigade stuff. Yeah. Right. Right.

212
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
That's what that's what was making me mad today.

213
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,280
Did you see, did you see Chris Chan tweeting the, the slime coin and the pins?

214
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,000
That's so fucking cool. So fucking cool. She's got the red man pin and the red man pin.

215
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,640
She's got it all. And, uh, and then a predict, predictably a bunch of like, a bunch of like,

216
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,320
very obviously mentally ill people, just like swarming in the replies to be like, um, Chris is

217
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,240
bad. Um, Chris, you are. Yeah, I got one of those. I muted the conversation. Posting an ugly picture

218
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,560
of you, posting an ugly picture of you, like screaming at a web camera to, to own you, followed

219
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,640
by, followed by a gift, a funny gift of a dog going, what? To make you look foolish. Haha.

220
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,920
I, I don't get it. I mean, I guess I understand, um, like if you're so like frothing at the

221
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,600
mouth, like raging that you would do that to every tweet they post. It just sort of,

222
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,800
it's the same people. It's got nothing to do with anything. It's just, it's the same people.

223
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,440
Christian is, is showing that she got a box with stuff in it. Look at this. Oh yeah. Well,

224
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,960
you're Chris Chan. So. Oh yeah. Well, look at this, like ugly drawing someone did of you, stupid.

225
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,000
It's, it's the same people too. Like I've seen some of these like accounts. I mean,

226
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,280
some of these accounts are just explicitly called like, you know, Son of Choo fucker 666 or whatever.

227
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,400
So like this is a dedicated account for this purpose. And others just seem to be like, others

228
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,840
just seem to be like, otherwise kind of normal looking people, but who like just are following

229
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,440
Chris just to do this stuff. And it's people with like, it's people with like six followers who,

230
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,400
I don't know, other than that, like they just like, I don't know, retweet like announcements

231
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:58,000
about Marvel movies or whatever. It's like, like a crossed arm reaction channels, you know,

232
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,800
those, those sort of things where they're just, it's got that sort of vibe to it where it's like

233
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,680
they're, they're very angry and very insistent on things that are really unimportant all the time.

234
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,320
And they all tend to have their arms crossed with their angry furry avatars, nothing against

235
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:25,040
furries, but it is funny. Okay, there is one, there is one person though. Okay, there, there are

236
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,840
a few people who are the same, except instead of posting like, I hate you, they post like,

237
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,240
looks nice Chris or whatever. And these are some of these people also have like, Son of Choo and

238
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:44,880
Rose. These are like, young or young or like, either young or mentally handicapped artists

239
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,080
who draw, you know, Son of Choo fan art, and they, you know, they have their own little click in this,

240
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,120
in this weird. I would tend to assume it's more that they're, they're like mentally handicapped,

241
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,920
because I don't know if Son of Choo is like a hot thing that the kids are into at all.

242
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,840
Well, no, but I mean, there could be some. If there's, if there's any kids around, it's the

243
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,840
people making the, the, I hate you, Chris Chan accounts, the 14 year olds who like go to cringe

244
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:22,240
compilations. That's probably true. But, but there's this one person who honestly, like,

245
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,360
gives me a very uncomfortable vibe. And it's not for any reason you might think this person,

246
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:40,640
this, this girl, she, she replies to things. And everything she says is a reply that's like,

247
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,960
do your best. It might not be much, but I know you're doing the best you can.

248
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,960
Heart, heart, heart, heart, heart, heart. And like all her posts on Twitter are like

249
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,640
comics that she's drew, she's drawn, she's not very good at drawing, but whatever,

250
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,600
she'll post like a page of her comic and be like, I know it's not much, but I'm doing the best I can.

251
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,440
And it's so creepy. I do not like it at all.

252
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
But they're doing the best they can, Ben.

253
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,360
I don't know what's going on there. It was like, no, she, she posted this

254
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,440
in response, like I posted the crystal, the crystal Chris sent me and she replies,

255
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,240
it's not much, but I know whatever it is, I'm sure it's wonderful. And then a bunch of like

256
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,480
heart, gift boxes, emojis. I, what's the, what, why say it's not, I don't know, doesn't look like

257
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,800
much. I don't know. I know that I'm, I know that I am like seeing mental illness here and I probably

258
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,000
like should just, I don't know. I probably shouldn't worry about it, but it's, it's, it's

259
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,400
sad. Like it's, it's like, it's stressing me. It's distressing me. This person seems to be in a,

260
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,080
in a bad way. This is like their mode of operation. And I'm strained optimism at all times.

261
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
I mean, she sounds, I mean, all of her tweets sound like she's trying to make the best of a

262
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,840
situ, of a situation that she is on the verge of tears over. And that's regardless of like,

263
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,920
whether it's like she's, she made something and wants people to see it, or just other people

264
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,800
are having a completely unrelated conversation. Oh boy. I mean, it could be sad. It could just

265
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,440
be learned behavior from hearing, like if it's a, if it's a mental thing, like an autism thing.

266
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:31,520
There's a lot of, when you're talking to someone, I don't know, I don't know, like specific scientific

267
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,440
like things of, of this is this mental illnesses. This is that one. But sometimes like you'll hear

268
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,600
them repeat phrases that the parents have obviously said to them and things they've heard on TV.

269
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,360
And, and so little of like their actual thoughts on things. Oh yeah. Gotta make the best of the

270
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,160
situation. I may be that a parent who was upset that they were handicapped and they

271
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,040
tried to make the best of the situation where it's like, I don't know, I could see that happening.

272
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:11,200
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I could see that. Sometimes I, there are some, some tweets I see and some

273
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,400
like accounts that I see tweeting over and over again, give me a vibe that is like weird in some way.

274
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,680
And I'm like, sometimes I get a little like weirded out and like kind of fucked up about it, like,

275
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,200
God, this person, this person seems like really fucked up. This person is like, kind of scarier,

276
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
like it's depressing to contemplate what this person is like. But like, I don't know, a lot of

277
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,440
the time, I don't remember like how many times have I like known someone online who's weird and

278
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,800
then I meet them in person and like they're not as like bizarre as they seem on the internet.

279
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,600
I try to tell myself like probably most of the time that's, that's what, that's the case. Disabled

280
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,200
people are not that strange unless they're like an extreme case. Like you can, you can hold a

281
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,600
conversation with them. They may not have like much like interesting things to say, but like

282
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,200
it's, they're generally normal. They just have like weird fascinations with specific things.

283
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah. Yeah. And, and repeat phrases that they've heard rather than learning how to, I don't know,

284
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,240
come up with a run. You know what? Like honestly, the, like the, the fact that this, this account is

285
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,680
like so, it's so consistent, which makes me think maybe you're right. Maybe they just, they learned

286
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,920
this, this, this behavior or this, these phrases and I'll just kind of like, I'll just say that.

287
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Yeah. That makes sense. I don't know. It's a whole, it's a whole, it's a whole milieu. It's a whole,

288
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,840
like, it's a whole cadre of people that just start around to respond in whatever preset way

289
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,600
they have decided on doing whenever Chris says anything. Oh, yeah. Oh, never,

290
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
whenever Chris says anything. No, no, I'm just thinking about disabled people in general.

291
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,840
Oh, okay. They feel to me, because I've, I've worked like, like volunteered. I've told that before,

292
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:12,800
like volunteer work for helping disabled people in like summer camp stuff. And they seem so much

293
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:20,320
easier to just be around because they're so lacking in judgment. They're like a normal person.

294
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,720
That makes them easier to be around? Well, huh? That makes them easier to be around?

295
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,600
Yeah. Cause they're just, I don't know, like for lack of a better term, I can think of,

296
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,640
they're simpler. They, they have what they like and they don't assume a lot because they find it

297
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:44,080
difficult to understand a lot of things. Obviously, things will set them set them off, make them

298
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,120
upset, like they have emotions and stuff. But like, if you're, you know, amenable to them and

299
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,800
it's, you're not like doing anything that annoys them. They're just, they're a lot less, I don't

300
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:06,320
know, I feel less at ease when I'm among teenage normal people, like non-disabled teenagers than

301
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,640
I am disabled people. Well, yeah. Cause who knows what like regular teenagers are scheming?

302
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,080
Like who knows what they're plotting behind your back? They're laughing at you. They're laughing at

303
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,040
you when you're not, when you're not looking. They're laughing at me because I don't know something.

304
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,600
But when it's disabled people, you're laughing at them behind their back. So it's much, much more

305
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:38,800
comfortable. No, it's not true. It's true. I know. I walk to, I see a disabled person,

306
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,320
I chuckle to myself, but I know they won't mind because they didn't hear it. I go,

307
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:50,160
you go, what a, what a rube. And then they show me their Thomas the Tank engine

308
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,400
sticker book and I'm like, oh yeah, cool. Nice. You got, oh yeah, cool, but on the inside you're

309
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:08,320
like loser. Who the fuck has stickers these days? Chris told me that I should make decal sheets

310
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,840
of the pin designs. That's the thing where like you, that's the thing where like it's on like the

311
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,880
back of plastic and like you rub it onto something, right? I've heard of decals for like cars. I assume

312
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,000
yeah, you could do that on phones and other things. Yeah, I'm not sure what that is. Yeah,

313
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,800
it's like a sticker, but it's like, it's like a sticker, but instead of like sticking the material

314
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,000
onto it, it has like the image is like on the back of the plastic and you put the plastic on a thing

315
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,400
and you like scrape the front and it like transfers the image directly onto the thing, right? So it's

316
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,960
like a permanent sticker with no like plastic layer that it's printed on, which I mean, I could do

317
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,640
that, I guess. I could do that, I guess. Oh, the profit margins wouldn't be there. It's all about

318
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:06,720
that profit margin. The thing I would equate it to, by the way, is not like, they have less of a

319
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,640
judgmental side mostly because their mental faculties are like kind of young compared to the

320
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,320
physical age of their body. So they'll have like, you know, a brain of a 10 year old or whatever.

321
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:29,440
And children, you don't laugh at them for being into whatever. I do. Well, yeah, sure. Stomping

322
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,000
on kids all day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kick them when they're down and they're always down because

323
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,360
they're short. Yeah, but it's just like working with kids that they're very like simple and easy

324
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,480
to understand and they don't judge you too much. Anyone too old is like, ah, this is like, there

325
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:53,520
could be drama with this person if they might have ideas that I disagree with. Ah, fuck. Why can't

326
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:00,400
people just be into weird things? They might be a Pete Buttigieg supporter. If somebody has

327
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:09,520
that Pete Buttigieg sticker book, I'm not going to. Hey, watch this. Look at my Pete Buttigieg

328
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,240
doodles. It's like, no, I'm not going to. That's not cute. That's not nice.

329
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,640
Did you see that? Did you see that drawing of Ronald Reagan? The one that like, it was like a

330
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,080
Congresswoman did, right? Like a 30 something Congresswoman did like a child's fucking like

331
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,960
pencil sketch of Ronald Reagan and she has it hanging in her office. Yeah. What is it with

332
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,320
Congresswoman these days? I don't get it. What's going on? Well, I mean, I'll tell you is that the

333
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:50,160
GOP doesn't have any standards. The GOP will just elect any fucking person who it says that they,

334
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:57,840
I don't know, will continue austerity politics. I can't, I mean, I didn't pay attention to the

335
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,880
politicians and senators and whatever or MPs. I didn't pay attention to all that when I was

336
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:12,720
young. So I maybe people this insane have been being voted in for decades and I never noticed,

337
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,960
but now that I'm more like, like, like, it's just so bizarre to think someone could be that

338
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:27,360
brazenly stupid and then get elected. I mean, most people don't pay that much attention to like,

339
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,360
you know, they're like district representatives. Sure. Yeah. Like that's below a lot of people's

340
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,040
radar. So like in some counties, you can get elected for that kind of thing with like relatively

341
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,760
fewer votes than you might think. And nevertheless, you fucking work in the Capitol building after

342
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,640
that because I don't know. Yeah. Not to say that a badly drawn picture of Ronald Reagan is stupid,

343
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,120
it's just very cringe. I don't know why you would be proud of that drawing. I mean, it,

344
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,720
I mean, it is stupid. I mean, because it's, I mean, it's, I mean, imagine you're an adult,

345
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,640
you're an adult and you're like, look, I drew this. First of all, it's terrible. Some people cannot see

346
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,280
their inability to do artistic things. I don't know whether that's necessarily a sign of lack of

347
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,640
intelligence. Maybe it is. It is. Of course it is. Well, I don't know. I don't know whether I sound

348
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,440
good when I'm singing. When you, when you, when you, okay. I mean, it's cringe because it's a bad

349
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,400
drawing and she like didn't recognize that too. It's, it's bad to like, look, I, I, it's just a

350
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,200
bad thing that like I do, I like this, this politician so much that I like drew them and I

351
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,680
hung it in my office. Like that is quite childish. Like, no, like that would be true even if it was

352
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,720
a good drawing. And the third and most importantly, it's Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan is a, is a

353
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,160
fucking a dogfucker who is in hell. So nobody should, nobody should like him.

354
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,280
Dude. So that's, it's a three pronged cringe attack.

355
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,400
Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump.

356
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,320
You need I say more?

357
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,200
No, please don't.

358
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,680
Uh, um.

359
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,960
There are new candidate, John Old Jefferson.

360
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
John Old, John Old MacDonald.

361
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,080
John Old Tron.

362
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,800
John Old Tron 2024.

363
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
How, how long is it going to be until a streamer is like running for office

364
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,040
or a video maker, a content creator? Because there's a lot of them now.

365
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,840
Oh, I mean, I, I, well, I guess, I mean, no, the Sargon,

366
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,720
Akata, when he fucking became the, did he, no, he ran for MP.

367
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,960
I think he ran for MP. I don't think he became one.

368
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,720
Let me check. I don't know. I honestly don't ever think I found out.

369
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,280
All right, let's find out.

370
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,160
Yeah.

371
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,280
Carl Benjamin is a British anti-feminist YouTuber.

372
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,280
A former member of the year. Yeah. So he's a member.

373
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,560
What way? I guess I don't know what member of the party means.

374
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,480
Member of the party doesn't mean much of anything.

375
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,920
He was one of his unsuccessful candidates for Southwest England constituency.

376
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,520
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,440
Um, so basically it hasn't happened yet. What a fucking bitch.

378
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,200
Yeah. Well, well, I mean, you said run and like he did run.

379
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,120
I mean, be elected. That's what I meant.

380
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,360
Oh, could you imagine like, I don't know, destiny running and then getting elected?

381
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah, imagine that on a podium. It'd be pretty funny.

382
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,320
I don't think, I don't think destiny would though.

383
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,240
I think that I think that would be more work for less reward than what destiny does now.

384
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,280
So I don't think he would do it.

385
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,480
True, but he might be like swayed by the potential political power that could enact more change.

386
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,560
He would run, he would run as a spoiler to AOC when she runs in next in 2024.

387
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,160
He runs just for that. And then accidentally wins.

388
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,080
Um, maybe. Oh my God. Oh, this is so good.

389
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,400
This is so good. The first, the intro, the intro of Sargon's Wikipedia page

390
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,440
includes the thing that he said I wouldn't even rape you.

391
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,960
What a fucking jackass. What a fucking joke. I fucking hate this guy more than,

392
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,400
he's like in my top five. He's like in my top five, like people I hate the most.

393
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,280
Oh my God, he's 41, 42, he says.

394
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,520
How old do you think he was?

395
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,280
I don't know. I guess I thought he was in his 30s, a little younger than that.

396
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,240
Nah, nah, he's an old, he's an old fuck. He's a relic.

397
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,000
And when I'm 41, I too will be a relic and I hope someone will throw me in the fucking gutter

398
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,120
and forget about me.

399
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,320
Um, oh man. Oh man.

400
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,400
Um, damn, I'm going to be old soon.

401
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,560
Soon, haha.

402
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,200
And then, and then what? Can I, I mean, I don't know.

403
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,760
I don't know.

404
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,640
Then you can buy a cane and you can actually use it and it'll be like a cool thing to have.

405
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,040
I don't even know.

406
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,360
You can get like a cane with a podron at the end.

407
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,280
I don't even know like what I want to do with myself like this year.

408
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,520
So I don't, I definitely don't know what I want to do when I'm like 40.

409
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,360
Like, I don't know, I know I want to finish that thing I've been working on.

410
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,400
And I guess I want to finish a bunch of the comics that I left unfinished.

411
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,080
And then I, I don't know.

412
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,520
I don't know. I've been, I've been, I've been like, I've been thinking like, I don't know.

413
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,480
Maybe this, uh, maybe this whole comics, maybe this whole art thing is like just not

414
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,320
doing it for me.

415
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,680
Maybe I've just like, maybe I should consider myself a failure at this point,

416
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,240
having like been doing it for this many years and having only produced as much as I have.

417
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,440
You know?

418
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,320
Uh, sure. Yes.

419
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,600
I'm fatically agreed.

420
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,800
I thought so.

421
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
Me too. Good. Okay, cool.

422
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,760
I mean, there's, there's no such thing as like starting too late.

423
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,040
So like, that's, that's, that's not what I mean.

424
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,720
That's not really what I mean.

425
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,680
Like if, if you had never done comics before and then you started at 40, you could still get somewhere.

426
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:43,920
Yeah.

427
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,440
The fact that you've done anything before this point means that you're a leg up on anyone who

428
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,400
does start at 40.

429
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,040
I, I, I, that's not what I mean.

430
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,600
What I, what I mean is not that like, oh, it's too late. I haven't made it yet. I'll never make it.

431
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,680
It's that like, I, I've been doing it for a while.

432
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,400
And I have, you know, only accomplished this much.

433
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
Should I have been doing something else?

434
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,800
Like, should I start doing something?

435
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
Well, that's the, oh, I have no, I have no fucking idea.

436
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,960
I have abs, I have absolutely no other idea for what to be doing.

437
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,040
I mean, like, I guess at that point you're getting into it.

438
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,000
Like, what is the meaning of existence sort of talk?

439
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,040
Like if, if you're not exactly,

440
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,960
you want to live because that seems like it works so far.

441
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,960
And then beyond that, I don't know.

442
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,720
You need money to live, so you need to do something.

443
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,240
So you can pay.

444
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,480
But aside from that, I don't know, like nobody really knows.

445
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,880
And it's hard to like put a, put a real hard label on what you need to do.

446
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,280
I guess I just see, I guess I just see,

447
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I see fucking like artists on Twitter or whatever who are like, oh, you know,

448
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,680
I, I'm, I'm, uh, I have too many ideas and I can't draw them all.

449
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,080
Like I'm over, like there's so many things I want to do.

450
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,560
There's so many like, you know, story ideas in my head that like I have to get down

451
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,240
and there's not enough time in the day.

452
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,760
And like, I'm not like that.

453
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,480
I, I'm not overflowing with like ideas.

454
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,560
I have like one idea.

455
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,040
I have like one thing that I want to work on right now.

456
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,320
I have a bunch of old ideas that I never completed that I could finish if I want.

457
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,040
I'm not, I'm not bursting with like, oh, I know, I know, you know,

458
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,160
all these things I want to do.

459
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,200
I don't know if anything is even worth doing.

460
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,040
So, so I am like, am I doing something wrong?

461
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,880
They seem to have a clue that I don't have.

462
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,120
I mean, surely you had a moment before where you were like,

463
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,240
I want to do this comic and that comic or even earlier than that in your life.

464
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,760
Like everybody has moments of like passion and they,

465
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,440
they feel like they need to exist so that they can do something specific.

466
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,880
And at the moment you just are not feeling it in, in, in the way that maybe you used to.

467
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,880
Yeah.

468
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, I'm, I'm not, I'm not.

469
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,920
Not feeling it lately.

470
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Maybe that's, maybe that's to be expected.

471
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,080
I don't know.

472
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,880
I mean, I mean, I'm like, I'm like, I'm, I'm feeling the thing that I have,

473
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,120
like, you know, that I'm working on right now.

474
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:43,440
And then, but aside from that, I'm like, even it's, it's hard to like even,

475
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,040
even that I'm starting to get frustrated with because it's taken longer than I wanted it to.

476
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,920
Which is just like construction.

477
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,360
Yes, which like, of course it did.

478
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,800
Everything, everything always does.

479
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,560
It's just another, it's just another thing that

480
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,200
it's like, oh, it was supposed to be done by now.

481
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,800
It's, it's, it's supposed to be done by now.

482
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,960
Just like all that other stuff that I never finished.

483
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,080
Well, hang on.

484
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,800
If it's supposed to be done, like it's taking a while, but you also feel like,

485
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,720
wow, when everything's done, what am I going to do?

486
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,240
Gee, nothing, I guess.

487
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,440
Like the, the, the, the feel like conflicting thoughts.

488
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,360
Like you feel like you don't have enough, you're, you're wasting time,

489
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,240
but the time you, you, you have left, you feel like you would waste anyway,

490
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,400
or like you, you don't know what to fill it with.

491
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,400
Yes.

492
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,720
So what, what the fuck?

493
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,840
I don't know.

494
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,760
I mean, I guess, like, it's easy to like,

495
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,760
to know that something could have been done quicker

496
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,360
if you had been working harder.

497
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,280
I don't know.

498
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,320
Would, would you feel like it would be, you would be more into it?

499
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,520
Had you already been working harder and therefore more have, of it had been created?

500
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,720
Yeah.

501
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,440
If, if I, if I was where I expected to be with it now, which is like done or almost done,

502
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,640
like if I was almost done with it right now, I would be like, fuck yeah, this shit is like,

503
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,000
we just got to, we just got to put the finishing touches on this and then it's go time.

504
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,040
Like I would be excited about like, you know, putting it out soon.

505
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,880
At the moment, it's like maybe, maybe a little less than half.

506
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,240
And I'm like, oh, I still have that much left to do with it.

507
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,040
And I'm like afraid.

508
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,760
I'm like trepidatious that like, will I, like, I'm like, oh God,

509
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
am I, am I not going to finish this too?

510
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,600
I mean, I am going to do it.

511
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,240
I have to.

512
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,440
I'm not going to like do anything else until it's done.

513
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,520
But it feels like, I don't know, you ever, you know, when you start a new thing,

514
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,960
when you start a new project and you feel like that sense of like,

515
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,440
I don't know if I can do this.

516
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,560
Yeah, I've had that recently.

517
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:10,000
And I know from experience that like, if you just keep going, you can always do it.

518
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,160
Even if it ends up being a little different than you thought it would look, right?

519
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:23,600
If you are flexible and, you know, if you just keep, if you just keep trying,

520
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,800
if you just keep chipping away at it, it will eventually be done.

521
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,360
You can, you can do anything you put your mind to.

522
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:29,920
It's true.

523
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,480
So like, but I still, I'm, but I'm, so like in my mind,

524
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,920
I know that I can do it, but in my heart, I am deeply, I am feeling very strongly

525
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,680
that irrational feeling of perhaps I can't do it.

526
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,400
Right, sure.

527
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:00,640
I feel like that quite a lot with a lot of my work where it's like, I drew the Clarissa

528
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:07,680
comic and I'm like, I look at it and it's like, I know that if I was, maybe it took a little

529
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,920
longer on it or I worked, I did work very hard, but it was like a, like a quite a

530
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,320
sharp deadline.

531
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,560
Like it was only a month I could do all that work in.

532
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,320
If I had done it a little slower, it would have been better and I know I can draw better

533
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,200
and I know I can improve and it's all of this like potential.

534
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:35,200
But like, I envision that and then I see that the work I've done is not as good as I imagine

535
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:44,400
I can do and at some point I start to doubt whether my image of potential success even

536
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,920
exists and maybe I was overestimating myself, my abilities.

537
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,200
Maybe I am as, as like shit at things that as people assume.

538
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,280
Absolutely you are, for sure, 100%.

539
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:06,400
Yeah, like sometimes I, I like, I don't know, there's a few moments.

540
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,760
All that bad stuff I say about you all the time, 100% true, I'm conferred.

541
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,640
It's like, occasionally people will leave a comment on something saying, wow, I had no

542
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,880
idea you could do stuff like this when I said something smart or I made some good drawing.

543
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,080
And it's like,

544
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,120
You said something smart, it's like, wait a minute, you said that?

545
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,880
I didn't realize Gibb was smart, I didn't realize Gibb could draw, I didn't realize Gibb could

546
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,560
animate, it's like, I knew I could, but I just never did it yet.

547
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,440
And it, it, it frustrates me because I can't, I can't like point to them and say,

548
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,520
you should have known because they could, they couldn't have known.

549
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Well, that, well, that just means they, they hadn't seen that stuff before.

550
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,560
That means like people are finding your stuff fresh that they hadn't seen before.

551
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,040
No, but like, like everyone, at some point, everyone who's ever seen anything you've ever

552
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,880
done didn't know that you could do that, right?

553
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,600
True, true.

554
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,520
But I guess what it, it makes me feel of is that I give off an air of being low skilled

555
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,400
because the things I do end up showing people are like sketches and rough things.

556
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,800
And I'm like, ah, fuck, I could like spend two hours drawing this better, but whatever,

557
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,400
I'll put it up, I'll put something up.

558
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,720
And then people get an impression of me that I feel is not representative of my skill level.

559
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
And it's entirely my doing.

560
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,280
It's just, it sucks because I get, I get impatient and I want to post things before

561
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,000
they're finished.

562
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,760
But look at it the other way around.

563
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,640
Every time someone says, wow, I didn't know Gibb could do this.

564
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,160
That's one more person who no longer has that impression, right?

565
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,800
Yeah, but I shouldn't have built the impression that I was shit at so many things.

566
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,840
Well, I should have, I should have stayed, I should have stayed completely silent and

567
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,240
hidden in, in, in caves under the ground.

568
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,440
And then I should have appeared only when I was already a genius.

569
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,560
But that's like impossible.

570
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,840
It doesn't work like that.

571
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,160
Yeah.

572
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,360
You gotta suffer.

573
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,840
That's just the way it is.

574
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,560
You have to be upset and there, that's all.

575
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,280
Yes.

576
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,240
And I am.

577
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,480
And that means I'm doing, that means I'm going, I'm going to the moon.

578
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,480
I've got the, I've got the, I've got the killer mindset.

579
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,960
The shit mindset that makes me sad.

580
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,320
And that's going to, that's going to carry me to the top.

581
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,480
I need to maximize my tears so I can lubricate my way to success.

582
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:34,640
Water slides to the, it's a race, it's a race, it's a race to the bottom.

583
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,640
It's a race to the bottom and you gotta, you gotta lubricate your slide down.

584
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,360
It's, it's like, it's like Sonic.

585
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,960
If you, if you get a really fast, if you go down as fast as possible

586
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,560
on the way back up on the other side, you'll be like, zoom in up to the top.

587
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:56,560
It's like, okay, we gotta go as low as we can as fast as possible to get that momentum to shoot to the moon.

588
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,040
Trust us, trust us.

589
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,320
We'll come out the other side.

590
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,920
We'll come out the other side like a rocket.

591
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,720
We'll all be through the center of the earth and out the other side, like pew to the sun

592
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,920
to Jupiter.

593
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,040
We're going to Mars.

594
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,560
We're going to Mars with daddy Elon.

595
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,560
That's all a rich tapestry.

596
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,320
A rich, a rich laver, a rich, uh, a juicy, um.

597
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,440
Yes.

598
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,880
Yeah, okay.

599
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,960
I have to pee.

600
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,560
Give me a minute.

601
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,840
Oh no.

602
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,320
Eleazar, cut it, cut it all, cut it all, cut this.

603
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,720
Right, Eleazar, don't cut this.

604
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,680
I'm going to say, uh, Ben is peeing right now and I can hear him peeing and it sounds disgusting.

605
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,880
It's like, oh, gross.

606
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,400
Listen to that pee.

607
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,320
Put in a sound effect of, of, of water, like splashing and then, and me saying, oh, you Ben,

608
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,720
stop peeing on the pee CP.

609
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:09,760
Now use that clip and then cut back to whenever Ben is back and he'll be none the wiser.

610
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,960
Oh no, Ben, stop piercing.

611
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,280
There's piss everywhere.

612
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,280
You can use that clip as well.

613
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,680
Lay them on top of each other.

614
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,680
So it sounds like I'm, that there's two of me.

615
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,280
So that this is very obvious that this is an edit and it's not truly happening.

616
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,720
Oh no, Ben, stop, Ben, stop peeing on the pee CP.

617
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,920
There's piss everywhere.

618
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,440
All right, Gib.

619
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,280
Yeah?

620
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,200
I think, I think you should have a seat before I tell you what I'm about to tell you.

621
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,320
I'm sitting already.

622
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,960
That was a test to see if you would betray me and you failed.

623
00:53:59,520 --> 00:53:59,600
What?

624
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,080
If you would tell Eleazar to put pee sound effects over the pee CP to embarrass me.

625
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,120
You failed the test.

626
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,160
Gib, I'm sorry.

627
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,160
So it wasn't actually, you didn't actually pee.

628
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,160
No, I did, no, I did, but it was also a test.

629
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,560
Impromptu test, impromptu quiz.

630
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,680
That's the thing about me is like, I'm, I'm, I'm exhausting.

631
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,760
I'm just an exhausting person to be around because I'm constantly like setting up like,

632
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,960
like little like, like tests and hurdles to jump over and like,

633
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,160
and fanciful riddles to be solved if progress is to be made.

634
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,960
You have like a nightmare.

635
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,840
Like a zip file of every DM.

636
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,680
I've ever given you so that you could use them to the greatest extents.

637
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:52,800
Didn't, didn't Jesse say that he had that on all of us at Redcon, at Redcon 2?

638
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,720
I feel like he did.

639
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:54,880
He did.

640
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,080
He was facetious, but I don't know.

641
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,880
He, I don't think he was ever going to use it.

642
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,200
Okay.

643
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,480
I thought it was, I thought it was facetious.

644
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,880
I, well, I couldn't, I couldn't tell if it was facetious or not.

645
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,360
And I, I assumed it was somebody else.

646
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,160
I won't say who.

647
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,720
I don't want to embarrass them in case I'm wrong, in case they were wrong.

648
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,120
But somebody else told me that they were like,

649
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,720
I don't know if he's joking about that.

650
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:20,400
And I was like, huh, um, he was probably joking.

651
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,400
There's no way, like, there's no way that he would actually do a thing where he's like

652
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,840
expose on the PCP.

653
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,160
They said, I don't know, what would they like?

654
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,000
No, you're right.

655
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,680
Like what even could there be anyway?

656
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,080
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

657
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,760
Also, I've never said anything bad.

658
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,360
True.

659
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,000
Me neither.

660
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,080
Don't listen to the early episodes of the PCP.

661
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:49,840
No, those were all, those were all cool.

662
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,800
You know, we all, we all, we were all laughing maniacally.

663
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,680
We were just being cool.

664
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,920
Do we know what I'm saying?

665
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,520
We were though.

666
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,560
We were being wicked cool.

667
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,320
We were unironically being based.

668
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,560
Most of the time.

669
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,280
Most of the time.

670
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,240
I don't know.

671
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,640
What are, what are we, what are we doing?

672
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,080
What are we doing here, Gib?

673
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,640
What's, what's, where's, where's this all going?

674
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,760
Like in the universe?

675
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,400
Like, what do we do?

676
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:20,560
Yeah.

677
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,600
Yeah.

678
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,320
We're here to.

679
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,040
Where's this headed?

680
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,000
Where, where, where, what's the, let's see where this is going.

681
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,520
Where's this all going exactly?

682
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,920
Well, it's the heat death of the universe,

683
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,200
which I'm very excited for.

684
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,560
I'm going to stream that.

685
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,920
That's going to be some great content.

686
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,360
That's going to be some great content right there.

687
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:41,760
I'm going to post it to my, to the future,

688
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,080
to whatever future thing still exists that you can stream on.

689
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,080
Dude, imagine like streaming like across like galaxies

690
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,080
and aliens responding in, in super chat,

691
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,240
but like 10,000 years after you finished.

692
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,720
Oh, like they're getting, they're getting the Twitch stream.

693
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah, they get the, like millions of years from now

694
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,200
and millions of light years away.

695
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,160
Yeah. And like, like thousands, like millions of years later,

696
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,520
like people will start getting super chats that have long since died

697
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,880
of old age.

698
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,520
And the aliens are like all based.

699
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,160
The aliens are like, the aliens are like,

700
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:22,640
they're sending the super chats to, to Twitch in the, yeah, I see.

701
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,040
I see.

702
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,480
Like all of the, all of the messages.

703
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,440
God, I hope the Twitch servers is still running then.

704
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,560
Oh yeah.

705
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,200
I hope Amazon still owns everything.

706
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,400
Otherwise they will never get those fucking alien bucks.

707
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,600
It was alien crypto.

708
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,080
That's kind of funny, the idea that like all of the,

709
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,320
all of the, the things that are being sent out will be returned.

710
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,680
And like if the aliens like pick up on a meme, for example,

711
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,120
they will come a thousand years too late to the party,

712
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,200
saying that meme in chat over and over and gets like,

713
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,600
what the fuck is this ancient fucking shit?

714
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,360
The cake is a lie?

715
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,240
What?

716
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,640
They're like, they're like,

717
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,720
they're only just learning about Reddit.

718
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,840
Super boomers.

719
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,720
In a hundred years.

720
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,520
Ten thousand years from now, they'll still think that like

721
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,480
minions memes on Facebook are so funny.

722
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,720
That's a pretty good idea for a, for a story.

723
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,560
I guess it is.

724
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,360
That's homestuck.

725
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,640
I guess that's homestuck.

726
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,840
I guess it, but different.

727
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,880
It did, fuck.

728
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,840
It is homestuck.

729
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,240
Aliens and memes is homestuck.

730
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,560
It's like a, what's that one?

731
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,600
It's a little bit like, is it your name?

732
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,120
Or no, what's the early one?

733
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,680
The one about the, the girl who,

734
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,360
or guy who goes into space or whatever,

735
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,480
and they have to text each other and it's like light speed.

736
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,840
So there's like time dilation.

737
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,080
Did you made that video about it a million years ago?

738
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,520
Is that interstellar?

739
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,080
Or I don't know what you're talking about.

740
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,360
Is that a game or a film?

741
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,320
No, it's a film.

742
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,680
You remember, did you did that video

743
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,840
that was the overview of all the movies

744
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,320
that that guy who made your name made?

745
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,320
And one of his early ones that he made all by himself was about.

746
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,600
Was it an anime movie?

747
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,560
I guess it must be.

748
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,040
Your name, I thought was like a book that was turned into a thing.

750
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,840
Well, it became a movie.

751
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,360
It became a, it became an anime movie.

752
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,680
I'm thinking of like, um, something.

753
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,840
Okay, Makoto, no, I gotta get it.

754
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,680
Makoto Shin Kai, one man anime.

755
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,280
What is this one?

756
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,840
No, okay, she and her cat.

757
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,200
She and her cat was the cat movie that he made.

758
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,200
And then, fuck, what was the one about fucking time dilation?

759
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,920
Now that you're talking about anime,

760
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,040
I kind of vaguely remember those phone involved.

761
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,360
Okay, Makoto Shin Kai, voices of a distant star.

762
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,680
Voices of a distant star.

763
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,360
There we go.

764
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,920
What was the point you was bringing with that?

765
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,360
Oh God, the plot of it.

766
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,600
The plot of it is that like a girl,

767
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,520
I think a girl and her boyfriend,

768
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,280
he goes into like space to be a spaceman,

769
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,920
but they want to like keep in touch and like they text each other.

770
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,120
But because of like time dilation and interstellar distances,

771
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,400
the texts are like further and further removed in time.

772
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,880
So they're like getting texts from each other

773
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,400
when they were like teenagers,

774
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,600
like when they're fucking old and shit or something.

775
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,280
And they, I don't know.

776
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,880
They don't just break up and fuck other people

777
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,400
because who gives a shit?

778
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,720
I don't know because it's very romantic.

779
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,440
They'd never know.

780
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,640
They'd never know.

781
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,680
They'd never know.

782
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,480
They'd never know.

783
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,440
They just could have been talking to an AI.

784
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,600
It's like he joins the army to go into space

785
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,040
and the AI, the AI programs him an AI

786
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,520
that will pretend to be his earth girlfriend,

787
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,080
sending him time dilated texts for the rest of his life.

788
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,960
Yeah, every so often she'll like the AI

789
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,120
will slip in a little like pro military,

790
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,840
like stay, you know, like it's really cool

791
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,880
that you're like in the military and fighting for, you know.

792
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,760
This is really helping,

793
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,080
hey, this is really helping the GDP back home.

794
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,720
Yeah, keep up the good work.

795
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,480
Like all like, oh, he's still, he's like, he's like 80.

796
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,600
He's like 80.

797
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,160
He's on like a distant galaxy or whatever.

798
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,120
And he's still, he still thinks he's getting texts

799
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,560
from his 18 year old girlfriend who is now 19,

800
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,440
you know, in his frame of reference.

801
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,960
So, you know, getting up there, but, you know, still hot.

802
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,680
And then he dies.

803
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,120
Wait, wait a minute.

804
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,400
So if the time, wait, if the time, like she's only aged one year

805
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,120
and he's aged, you know, so many years,

806
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,840
but like how have they been communicating?

807
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,280
Surely he would be like sending her a message every microsecond

808
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,040
from her perspective.

809
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,640
Like, like 80 years worth of texts come like within a week.

810
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:25,680
I don't know.

811
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,360
I haven't fucking watched this shit.

812
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,320
I don't give a fuck.

813
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,520
Maybe the movie explains it.

814
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,080
I don't know.

815
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,680
When he's on his death bed, he says, he's like, I guess,

816
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,560
I think, can I send nudes, please?

817
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,200
Just one.

818
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,280
He's on his, he's on his death bed and he's like,

819
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,120
wait a minute, there's a fucking plot hole.

820
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,120
This doesn't make any sense.

821
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,080
This movie sucks.

822
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,240
Licks of the camera.

823
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,640
He was the reviewer the whole time.

824
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,240
Oh, that's, that's another thing.

825
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,840
A movie where the reviewer is the main character.

826
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,480
It was called, what's his name?

827
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,640
Doug Walker's already made like 14 movies.

828
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,560
So it's too late.

829
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,120
It's too late.

830
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,960
No, no, no, those are movies made by people who review media,

831
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,400
but I'm talking like a meta movie where the reviewer of the movie

832
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,840
is the protagonist and he's like, this sucks.

833
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,800
I hate this character, meaning myself.

834
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,640
That's, I mean, didn't M. Night Shyamalan make the movie critic,

835
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,640
like the villain of Lady in the Water?

836
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,200
I guess he wasn't reviewing the movie he was in specifically.

837
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,240
It's like, wait a minute, that's a plot hole.

838
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,680
Okay.

839
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,760
The plot of the movie, it's the, there's two reviewers.

840
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,640
There's a good guy reviewer and the bad guy reviewer and the good guy reviewer.

841
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:01,360
His quest, his hero's journey is to convince people that the movie he is in

842
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,600
that you are watching is right now is good and the villain is to convince you

843
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,080
that it is bad, convince everyone that it is bad.

844
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,520
And it's a battle of attrition.

845
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,880
It's like a Sherlock Holmes thing where one of them is trying to like

846
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,280
point out plot holes and the other guy is like, no, actually it makes total sense because

847
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,520
yeah, it's like, it's like, um,

848
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,080
and the villain goes, ding, every sort of thing.

849
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,200
It's like, it's like Death Note, right?

850
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,560
It's like an incredible like battle of wits and they're like constantly outsmarting.

851
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,720
It's like, aha, a death of the author though.

852
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,520
And you're like, oh no, my entire argument is crumbled.

853
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,200
And, you know, just make a whole series about it.

854
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,160
Yeah, six seasons in a movie.

855
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,200
That's content rich.

856
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,360
That's content rich IP right there.

857
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,400
It's like the sequel is him grappling with the idea of sequels.

858
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,520
The movie is called Re-Colon Viewer.

859
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,920
Or Re-Viewers, I don't know.

860
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,920
Fuck yeah, this is, this shit, you know what?

861
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,520
I take back everything I said about not, now I know what I'm doing.

862
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,760
I'm making this shit for the rest of my life as soon as the secret project is done.

863
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,440
Fuck all that other shit.

864
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,880
Fuck, uh, fuck Biscopades.

865
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,680
Fuck the champion.

866
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,040
It's on to Re-Viewer.

867
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,640
I mean, it's just a winning formula.

868
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:32,080
Really, the best ideas are the ones that make you laugh regardless of whether they're good.

869
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,040
Yeah.

870
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,160
Because the stuff that makes me happy is like thinking of, I had this,

871
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,240
this is, I didn't end up doing it because it was so stupid.

872
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,640
But it was just like, I was thinking of getting a random YouTube video and then

873
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,880
just occasionally replacing one of the nouns with

874
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,960
dinner from like Zelda, CDI, cutscene, YouTube poop quote.

875
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:02,960
Where the king says, I wonder what's for dinner, getting that clip and just saying,

876
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,840
like Marques Brownlee with the new dinner phone.

877
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:10,640
And I was laughing so much at the idea that I could just do that at any moment.

878
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,960
I could edit that and it would be so easy.

879
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,680
So easy.

880
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,280
It would be nothing could be simpler.

881
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,880
It was just the funniest idea and I'd laugh myself to sleep.

882
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,360
It was great.

883
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:20,880
Fascinating.

884
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,640
I didn't do it though because it was so pointless.

885
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,400
I had other things to do with my life.

886
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,280
Yeah.

887
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,160
Yeah, that's true.

888
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,160
Life's the little things though, you know?

889
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,640
It is.

890
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:32,960
Yeah.

891
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,560
One day, if you don't stop to make a YouTube poop once in a while, you might miss it.

892
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,640
True.

893
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,920
Yeah, life comes at you fast.

894
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,760
What the fuck are we talking about?

895
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,920
Nothing.

896
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,880
Anime?

897
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,600
Fuck that.

898
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:52,880
Fuck that shit.

899
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,160
What is your favorite anime?

900
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,800
Dark Souls.

901
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,360
Oh, it is made by Amiyazaki.

902
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

903
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,480
My favorite Amiyazaki movie.

904
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,200
Yeah, I'm sure.

905
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
Someone's made that fucking joke before.

906
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,160
No, nobody's made that joke because it's so stupid.

907
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,040
It's so obvious.

908
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,440
It's awful.

909
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,920
Everyone else was too ashamed.

910
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,600
But it's a race to the bottom and I won.

911
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,240
My tears are lubricating.

912
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,360
I made it.

913
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:27,760
I got there so fast, I'm going to shoo up the opposite slope up the mountain.

914
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,240
Speedrun being so depressed that you become God.

915
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:40,000
Oh, God, speaking of becoming God, I beat Noida.

916
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,040
I beat Noida.

917
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,280
I was playing Noida again right before we started.

918
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,720
I had to stop playing Noida to record this stupid podcast.

919
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,640
Noida is so fucking cool.

920
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,000
I can't even stand it.

921
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,680
You beat it?

922
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,640
I beat it.

923
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,360
What's at the bottom?

924
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,080
A boss.

925
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,960
Well, I will know.

926
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,360
Okay.

927
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,720
I mean, should I spoil Noida?

928
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,840
Do you want me to spoil Noida?

929
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,000
I haven't even looked at the game, well, except for that one time.

930
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,720
So I don't know.

931
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,400
I don't really like rogue-like things.

932
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:12,960
I mean, it's not.

933
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,120
Random chance for upgrades annoys me.

934
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,120
Oh, it's so fucking good.

935
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,880
I mean, okay, I'll just approve that I'm a badass.

936
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,240
I'm going to spoil Noida.

937
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,440
Cover your ears for a second.

938
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,000
You get to the bottom.

939
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,440
You get to the last level, and you fight a boss.

940
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:36,160
You fight a boss, and you kill him, and you pick up this thing.

941
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,120
You pick up this mysterious thing called...

942
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,080
The place you go is called the work, and you pick up this thing called the salt,

943
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,040
and you put the salt in this machine, and the machine activates,

944
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,800
and the entire world...

945
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,080
There's a shockwave, and the entire world turns to gold,

946
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,400
and you also turn to gold, and you die.

947
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,040
And it's fucking cool.

948
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,560
But apparently that's like the bad ending for babies, and there are like...

949
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,240
If you do other things along your way to winning,

950
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,040
you can get other endings where you don't die or other things happen.

951
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,800
And also the salt is apparently called other things in other circumstances,

952
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,160
and there is a whole bunch of like...

953
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,800
Okay, this is fucking crazy.

954
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,600
You can...

955
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,120
There are all these orbs scattered around the places,

956
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,920
and you've got to get orbs, and you've got to get orbs,

957
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,840
and more orbs means you get different endings.

958
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,680
And there are secret places, like to the left of the starting area,

959
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,120
there's this giant tree, and if you climb this giant tree and go over it,

960
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,600
there's like a whole other section over there.

961
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,880
And if you go to the right, and instead of going under the mountain

962
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,560
to start delving down into the mines and get to the real ending,

963
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,680
if you can climb over the mountain or like burrow your way through it,

964
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,800
you come out the other side, and there's like a whole desert over there,

965
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,960
and the desert leads to some other weird shit.

966
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,360
And if you go into the sky, there's like a secret altar there,

967
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,480
and if you place emerald tablets on the altar, you get stuff for it.

968
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,840
And if you go even above that altar,

969
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,880
you can get to an infinite zone that is also called the work,

970
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,680
but it's in the sky, and if you go above the sky work,

971
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,520
you can go to the moon.

972
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,520
You can literally go to the moon.

973
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,520
So it's like terraria, but they actually have where you can jump to space.

974
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,160
A little bit, I guess.

975
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,040
I mean, you go to the moon, and apparently the moon is made

976
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,920
of a unique material that is found nowhere else in the game,

977
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,200
and it is called cheese.

978
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,400
And if you bring these like secret essences to the moon

979
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,120
and give it to the moon, the moon will crack open,

980
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,640
and these like secret fluids that are like nowhere else,

981
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,840
that are secret rare fluids will like explode out of the moon.

982
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,280
I mean, it's obviously awesome.

983
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,320
I haven't done any of this.

984
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,160
I've just been reading the Wiki about all this.

985
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,600
It's fucked up, man.

986
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,280
So does that mean the the player character is Wallace or Gromit?

987
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,840
The player character is an alchemist.

988
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,200
This is something that is not, it's not really,

989
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,560
it's not really stated anywhere.

990
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,080
The name of the game, Noida, it means witch in Finnish.

991
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,840
So you think you were a witch, but I think you are actually an alchemist

992
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,520
because like the end of the game is about turning things to gold,

993
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,680
and there are other monsters in the game that kind of look like you,

994
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,080
that are called things that are like alchemist name,

995
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,240
and everything in the game is named in Finnish,

996
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,120
and I guess the whole thing is based in Finnish folklore, apparently.

997
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,160
So fucking cool. Oh my god.

998
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,600
I do like the whole cheese moon thing,

999
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,280
but more importantly, the fact that you can go up and up and even up her,

1000
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,720
I like secrets behind secrets.

1001
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,440
I'm not exactly sure how you get there.

1002
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,440
If it's just a matter of finding a way to go high enough,

1003
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,400
or if there's some other thing you have to do,

1004
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,200
but the moon is there, you can go to it.

1005
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,360
I didn't know that the entire map is connected,

1006
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,240
because like you finish a level, you go through a portal,

1007
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,400
and it brings you to like a temple,

1008
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,120
where you can fuck around with your wands and change your wands up,

1009
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,600
and then you go down to the next level and you do it all over again,

1010
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,760
find a new portal, down to the next temple.

1011
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,960
I didn't realize this, but apparently the entire world is connected,

1012
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,440
and I found this out when I went down to like the third level, the snow area,

1013
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,240
and I just went over to the right, and I went really far to the right,

1014
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,520
and I found a rock wall that just went up and up and up,

1015
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,720
and I was like, okay.

1016
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,200
So I climbed this rock wall for a long time,

1017
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,120
and I eventually found that it was the opening under a rope bridge

1018
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,680
that I had found earlier for another secret area in the first area of the game.

1019
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,240
The rope bridge goes over a gap, there's a lava sea,

1020
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,760
and then there's a rope bridge,

1021
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,280
and then there's this other temple where you can find an orb,

1022
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,800
and a secret boss appears if you take the orb and you got to kill it.

1023
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,080
So I climbed up from the third level all the way up to the first one,

1024
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,720
and I didn't even know that was a thing you could do, but I did it.

1025
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:31,840
Cool.

1026
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,000
Cool, cool fucking game.

1027
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,520
Super, I love it more and more every single day.

1028
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:43,920
Have to got to recommend, hey, post in the comment if you fucking beat Noida,

1029
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,480
bet you fucking won't, cowards.

1030
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:59,760
I had, I don't know, I was, no, I'm going to resist the urge to go on a whole tear about

1031
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,360
all the cool ones that I built.

1032
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,400
The one that I won with was essentially just a machine gun.

1033
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,280
It just like, that was it.

1034
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,440
Simple, effective.

1035
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,840
I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.

1036
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:17,600
Recently.

1037
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,120
I listened to the Money Spenders podcast at patreon.com slash give and take,

1038
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:30,640
so I know that you've been paying, and if you listen to the other podcast

1039
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,920
at patreon.com slash Ben St, you would know about Noida.

1040
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,360
Then you can hear me talk about my wands, if you want to know how I did it,

1041
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,040
if you want to know how I achieved the ultimate high level gamer achievement

1042
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,960
and beat Noida, you can listen to that over there, and I will explain everything.

1043
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:48,880
Yeah.

1044
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,840
Dab, dab, dab.

1045
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,440
Okay, but anyway, Minecraft.

1046
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,240
Yeah, Minecraft.

1047
01:14:52,240 --> 01:15:02,800
I've been furiously getting the big upgrades in this one server, and I have now the drip.

1048
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,920
I've got a full set of Netherite armor.

1049
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,440
And-

1050
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,880
Is that better than Diamond?

1051
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,720
Yes, it's the one that's slightly better than Diamond Armor, and it doesn't burn,

1052
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:17,200
and it floats in lava, and it's very cool.

1053
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,960
And let me just check.

1054
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,760
I'm just going to log on to the server so I can see, because I've been getting so many

1055
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,920
enchantments, like enchantment books.

1056
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,480
I'm just going to list all the enchantments I have, because I think I have every possible

1057
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:41,920
good enchantment on all of this armor, and I'm just proud of my gamer breaking blocks and jumping.

1058
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,680
It's not very difficult.

1059
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,840
Actually, there's taken a while to load whatever.

1060
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,960
How do you get Netherite?

1061
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:55,440
In Netherite, you have to, in the Nether, with the updates, there's a new block called

1062
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,240
Netherite scraps or something.

1063
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,240
You break a block, and it's really hard to find.

1064
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,600
There's only like one, maybe three in a cluster.

1065
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,000
You get it, and then you smelt it into Netherite scraps.

1066
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,600
Oh, yeah.

1067
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,320
Ancient debris.

1068
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,560
It's a block called Ancient Debris.

1069
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,200
You turn it into Netherite scraps.

1070
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:22,640
You combine those scraps, four of those scraps, with four gold ingots, and you get one Netherite

1071
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:29,920
ingot, and then you take a diamond thing, and you get a smithing table, and you combine

1072
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,920
the Netherite ingot with the diamond thing to turn it into a Netherite thing.

1073
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,720
I see, I see.

1074
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,440
So, yeah, it's pretty cool.

1075
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,600
Yeah, the moment I've got on my Netherite helmet, protection for aqua affinity,

1076
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,680
which means I can breathe underwater, I think.

1077
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:53,520
No, that means I can mine things underwater, as if I were on land.

1078
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,920
Unbreaking three, respiration three, which means I can breathe underwater, and mending,

1079
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,040
which means every time I get experience orbs, it mends the armor.

1080
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,640
Oh, that's cool.

1081
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,280
That's pretty good.

1082
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,760
Yeah, I've got mending on all four of my things.

1083
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,440
My boots are the coolest.

1084
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,840
They've got blast protection four, feather falling four, which means I don't take damage

1085
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,120
from falling that much.

1086
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,040
It's got mending, it's got depth strider three, which means I walk and move really fast in water.

1087
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:27,040
I can walk upper waterfall, I can walk against the current easily, and soul speed three,

1088
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,200
which means I can walk super hyper first on soul sand.

1089
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,400
Only on soul sand though, so in the Nether, right?

1090
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:42,720
In the Nether, yeah, but I can build a road with soul sand and then zoom across faster than

1091
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,160
normal running, and then I can also run on top of that.

1092
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:53,120
So yeah, really, I've been doing work on my secret project,

1093
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,000
and I've been playing Minecraft on the off hours, and I love Minecraft.

1094
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:08,480
It's just so nice, I don't think it's a nine to five I'm working right now,

1095
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:13,120
but on my secret project, my thing that I did talk about on my Money Spenders podcast,

1096
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:22,160
Go Listen, it has taken up a lot of my normal working hours time, and on the weekends,

1097
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,960
I'm basically doing nothing but Minecraft and podcasts and streams and stuff,

1098
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,000
listening to vowsh vowsh.

1099
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,080
That reminds me that we have, it's been a little while since we did a Shekels for Hackles,

1100
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,600
maybe we should do another one soon.

1101
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,680
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

1102
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,680
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

1103
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:53,840
I have not been watching any Vosh, or any, I don't know if Vosh is considered bread tube,

1104
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,400
but I have not been watching any like bread tube lately.

1105
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,200
It pretty clearly is, why do you think so?

1106
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,080
Yeah, why would you, what do you know about it?

1107
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,680
I don't know, when I, I mean I know all about Vosh, like I've seen a bunch of his stuff,

1108
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:12,400
I was watching it a bunch for a while there, I don't know, I guess when I think of bread tube,

1109
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,400
I think of like essayists more than streamers.

1110
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:19,760
Oh yeah, okay, he's a person on YouTube who is bread flavored.

1111
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:26,080
Yeah, yeah sure, I have not, I have not been, I mean I haven't been watching,

1112
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,640
I haven't been watching Thought Slime, who I was watching religiously for a while there,

1113
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,720
I haven't seen the new ContraPoints, the last two ContraPoints actually,

1114
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:42,960
I haven't watched the new Philosophy Tube yet, I am just like, I don't know,

1115
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:51,680
I am just not feeling very motivated to think about, or I, I don't know,

1116
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,040
feel like I kind of like get it already, you know?

1117
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:00,160
Yeah, I find them to be generally entertaining, especially Philosophy Tube and ContraPoints,

1118
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,600
just video wise, they're very like good.

1119
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,400
They are.

1120
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,240
And so I've been re-watching a lot of those.

1121
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:13,120
I mean, I, I mean, I really like, I really like Sean, what was the last one he did?

1122
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,400
What was the last Sean film that came out?

1123
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,680
Didn't he, didn't he, I don't know if it was recent, but I saw he was,

1124
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,240
made a huge long video about World War II and how stuff happened.

1125
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:26,560
Yeah, that was it, that was it, it was, that was, oh, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1126
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,320
Yeah, yeah, why did the nukes, I got like 10 minutes into that,

1127
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,800
but then I got distracted by something else and I haven't gone back to it.

1128
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,080
That's a good one, that's, that's a pretty good one.

1129
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,520
Um, it's, I mean, it's more about history than like him making,

1130
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,880
I mean, he does make the case for why the bombing was bad,

1131
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,000
but it's, although a lot of it is like explaining the history

1132
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,400
of it and like what was going on with like Japanese politics

1133
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,640
and American politics and et cetera, et cetera.

1134
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,480
Um, that's, that one felt more history-ish and less bread-to-be, although I mean, it's both.

1135
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,920
Uh, lol.

1136
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:11,120
Um, I watched a video about Quentin Reviews.

1137
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,720
I saw this video recommended to me and this guy was explained,

1138
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,120
he was like, he had made a previous video called like the fall of Quentin Reviews

1139
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,080
and he had made like another update video to that,

1140
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,520
specifically about the DMs thing with Sarah Z and Lindsay Ellis.

1141
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:37,760
And this guy, I mean, I agreed with some of the things he said and he, he wasn't,

1142
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,160
he wasn't even like, he wasn't that harsh.

1143
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,160
Like he was very critical of Quentin, but it wasn't,

1144
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,280
he wasn't like unbelievably so and he was very, he says like,

1145
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,760
you know, Quentin isn't like a complete lol cow.

1146
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,400
He's not like a, a, a complete train wreck.

1147
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:57,280
I just find him very fascinating because he has his like very like pathetic personality

1148
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,800
and he makes, and he gives some examples of like how Quentin is very like,

1149
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,640
very approval-seeking in general and very like, you know,

1150
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,640
whinging and stuff.

1151
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:12,000
Um, but like a bunch, a bunch of the time it slips through,

1152
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,080
it slips through that like what this person, what this person considers to be a fall of a Titan,

1153
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:24,320
so to speak, is like that he, you know, decided that like, uh, uh, you know,

1154
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,720
actually like right-wingers are bad, right?

1155
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,280
Like it slips through that like this person has,

1156
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,240
so there'd be, there'd like, there'd be an like quote unquote objective,

1157
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,920
but once in a while you're like, this person has an opinion and I can, and I can tell.

1158
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,960
Oh wait, his, his angle is Quentin reviews doesn't like right-wingers

1159
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,240
and that's why he's a Fallen Titan.

1160
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,880
Well, that's not really his argument.

1161
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,360
That's his argument is that Quentin is like,

1162
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,480
bad, he behaves badly and he's cringe for all these reasons and he gives it,

1163
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:59,280
you know, pretty reasonable examples of like, yeah, of like, yeah, that is pretty cringe

1164
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,760
that he did, that he did and he said those things true.

1165
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,880
But then they're saying like,

1166
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,800
as he, as he's talking about it, he will, he will touch on like, oh, and then,

1167
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,880
and when, you know, Quentin changed his politics and when he talks about that,

1168
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,440
he, it's like, uh, this person is not neutral.

1169
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,360
No, that's, yeah.

1170
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,160
It, it really, oh whatever.

1171
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,720
But I mean, I guess, I guess.

1172
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,640
Like, I don't know much too much about him.

1173
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:27,200
I watched a few of his videos once and he seems, he, I think he was like,

1174
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:34,480
one of the first YouTubers I had clicked on a video on that had a more reasonable

1175
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,360
view of, of things like, like Anita Sarkeesian or something, like he was criticism,

1176
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,400
like it was the first left E thing I'd ever looked at.

1177
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,280
Okay, okay.

1178
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,200
And I was like, huh, that's interesting.

1179
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,080
But then he's got,

1180
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:52,800
since then he's like, he's like quite normal, not that interesting, not, I don't know.

1181
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,400
Okay, well, I mean, famously he had that bit where he like,

1182
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,360
in the middle of an unrelated review, he went on the rant about how much he hates Trump.

1183
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,600
That was, yeah, I, I heard about that.

1184
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,200
And it's like, okay, that's a little cringe.

1185
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,080
That's a little cringe.

1186
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,280
And I think we can all agree.

1187
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,960
We can all, you know, left or right, you know, like black people, hate black people,

1188
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,280
we can all agree that that's kind of cringe.

1189
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,400
I kind of remember it being relevant, but I don't know.

1190
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,240
I thought it was at the beginning, like if something, something, something,

1191
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,520
okay, here's the thing.

1192
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,200
I kind of hate Donald Trump, blah, blah, blah, obvious things.

1193
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,720
And then he went on to talk about a cartoon or something.

1194
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,080
I can't, I can't remember really.

1195
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,880
But like, I don't feel like that was super cringe.

1196
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,400
Had Trump in it or something?

1197
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,400
Or was it, I don't know, I don't know.

1198
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,400
But the, but the, but the point is like, you know, some, some people,

1199
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:52,640
like, like when this guy was talking about that event, he doesn't, he says that it's cringe,

1200
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,720
but then he talks about like the fallout.

1201
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,000
He talks about, he specifically mentions monkey.

1202
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,760
He talks about like the fallout that it led to with people like monkey

1203
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,800
over Quinton's quote unquote divisive politics.

1204
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,240
He specifically calls these divisive politics saying orange man bad and how like it cost

1205
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,000
him friends that he said stuff like this.

1206
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,960
And, and like that's when it's like, it's not just, it's not just about the cringe

1207
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,760
for you though, is it?

1208
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,160
It's not, there's more to it there.

1209
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,200
Just, just say it, just fucking come out and say it.

1210
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:29,520
Didn't Quinton go on that podcast with monkey, monkey and, and plemin and rusty cage?

1211
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,160
What was it called?

1212
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,560
State of the YouTube?

1213
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,480
Yeah, I think he was on that.

1214
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,120
I don't know, maybe he was.

1215
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,080
I know they had, I know they had the thing where like when monkey got banned,

1216
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,560
Quinton like said, ha ha, fuck you.

1217
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,920
And then everyone was like, and then everyone was like,

1218
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,480
no, Quinton, that's not cool.

1219
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,000
He's been banned from YouTube.

1220
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,800
You can't say that.

1221
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,320
And Quinton was like, oh, I'm sorry.

1222
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,400
I didn't know that being mean, I didn't know that being mean was mean.

1223
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,160
And like, that's very cringy, that's very, that's very, that's very cringe.

1224
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,840
That's very cringe because if you think that like, oh, you know, this is serious.

1225
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,560
I shouldn't, you know, gloat over the, I, okay.

1226
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,840
Why would you do it in the first place?

1227
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,000
People said, yeah, then why would you do it in the first place?

1228
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,520
People said, like this, this guy argued that like, oh, Quinton said that people

1229
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,200
shouldn't be censored, but then he was happy when monkey was censored.

1230
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,400
That hypocrisy.

1231
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,440
If you think that monkey is bad, if you really think he's terrible,

1232
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,560
then just, yeah, just, just be happy that he got banned.

1233
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,560
Like, what's the problem?

1234
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,360
Who cares if people, if like idiots call you a hypocrite for it.

1235
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,200
You're not one unless, I mean, unless you are, unless you said like,

1236
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,880
no one should ever be banned from YouTube.

1237
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,320
And then someone gets banned from YouTube and you're like, haha, you know.

1238
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,840
But I don't think that's the case.

1239
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,480
Yeah.

1240
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,960
People apologize a little too easily.

1241
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,600
Quinton, Quinton is the kind of person who was like, yeah.

1242
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,520
Yeah, like I, I would much rather he like make a statement and stick with it.

1243
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,120
Like if he doesn't like monkey and he thinks monkey's bad to say it.

1244
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:57,360
Sure.

1245
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,120
Then just, then just own it.

1246
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,240
Then just own it.

1247
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,120
The fact that he took it back is like, well, why did you,

1248
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,120
did you want to score points by saying that?

1249
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,400
Which one do you actually believe?

1250
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:07,680
Yeah.

1251
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,000
Yeah.

1252
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,240
True.

1253
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:08,880
True.

1254
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:18,080
You gotta take a stand, it's all in your hand.

1255
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:18,800
You know what that is?

1256
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,280
It's a song, probably.

1257
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:28,640
That's the opening theme song to the Animorphs Live Action Nickelodeon television series.

1258
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:29,840
Oh.

1259
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,440
Oh.

1260
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:36,000
I wonder if there's any more Animorphing Time.

1261
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,360
I listen to every episode of Animorphing Time, the leftist Animorphs podcast.

1262
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,360
And I ran out.

1263
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,560
There was no more to listen to.

1264
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,880
They only released like once or twice a month.

1265
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:48,720
Sad.

1266
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,360
Sad but true.

1267
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,440
I crave more.

1268
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:59,280
I could probably, I could probably read through the rest of Animorphs in less time

1269
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,840
than it would take me to

1270
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,320
listen to the rest of that podcast that will go through the whole series.

1271
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,400
Because you can read these books in like an hour or two and each episode is like that long or more.

1272
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,440
So, you know, is it efficient?

1273
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:15,680
No.

1274
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:17,680
But it's funny.

1275
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:20,800
Brrr.

1276
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,240
Brrr.

1277
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:22,640
Yeah.

1278
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,120
Okay.

1279
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:23,360
Sorry.

1280
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,720
That's my Animorph impression.

1281
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,520
Brrr.

1282
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,000
Brrr.

1283
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,480
Should we go to VoiceMails?

1284
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,720
You said that we had a lot to get through, or at least a lot of them.

1285
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,360
We may skip all of them.

1286
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:33,520
Why?

1287
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,120
Am I floundering?

1288
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:35,920
Are we floundering?

1289
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,320
No, but we've been going for an hour and a half.

1290
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:39,600
You're right.

1291
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,480
We have.

1292
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:40,800
Yeah.

1293
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,280
Okay.

1294
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,240
We do have, yeah, we have a shit ton of VoiceMails this time.

1295
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,040
I don't know why.

1296
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:48,320
Okay.

1297
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:49,680
You have it?

1298
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:50,160
You have it up?

1299
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:50,560
You're ready?

1300
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,080
Uh, yes.

1301
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:53,680
Okay.

1302
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,080
The first one is called My Fence.

1303
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,640
Three, two, one, go.

1304
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:01,920
Oh my god.

1305
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,880
Fuck are you?

1306
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:04,480
Okay.

1307
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,160
Until next time, sayonara.

1308
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,240
Oh, hey, you know what?

1309
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,040
Always nice to hear a friendly voice.

1310
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,960
In the, you know what?

1311
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,320
We're off to a riotously good start, I would say.

1312
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:19,920
Okay.

1313
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,000
Polite, polite Japanese clapping.

1314
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,680
Okay.

1315
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,840
Next one is called Less Child Abuse, Please.

1316
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,600
Parentheses.

1317
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,600
Site is spelled verped.

1318
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,240
Three, two, one, go.

1319
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,080
Discourse around pedophilia and maps is so dangerously fucked.

1320
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,720
Like the way it is now is what you'd imagine if you wanted to maximize instances of abuse.

1321
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,840
As a society, the terms pedophile and sexual predator

1322
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,680
are often treated as interchangeable.

1323
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,360
We imply that anybody who is attracted to children must be abusing them.

1324
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,640
But that isn't true.

1325
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,240
Actual cases of abuse are more often to do with children being easy targets

1326
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,240
for people in positions of authority.

1327
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:04,160
When it comes to actual pedophiles or maps, it's a totally different story.

1328
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,920
By and large, they know it's fucked up and intentionally deny their sexual impulses.

1329
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,000
They don't choose to be that way and usually actively wish they were not.

1330
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,400
But if society constantly tells who you're a monster, you often start to believe it.

1331
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,760
These people bear the weight of sexual deprivation under society that tells them

1332
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,080
they're basically as good as an abuser already.

1333
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,600
They can't tell anyone about it for fear of repercussion, so they have to bottle it up.

1334
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,720
They grow to hate themselves and are under perpetual mental duress.

1335
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,680
This is not how you get someone to live a healthy lifestyle.

1336
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,800
This is how you get someone to give in to their vices and or kill themselves.

1337
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,240
People don't realize how many are secretly struggling with this.

1338
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,720
Pedophiles are among us whether we like it or not,

1339
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,760
and our goal should be to support their efforts to not give in.

1340
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,400
Virpend.org has a bunch of testimonials and resources to help understand the issue.

1341
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,040
The branding of virtuous pedophiles is really bad,

1342
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,120
but I suppose that's inevitable in this realm.

1343
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,360
I guess I agree with all that.

1344
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:05,280
Yeah, I guess I'd have to look at the Virpend, V-I-R-P-E-D.

1345
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:11,600
There is something really off putting about the name virtuous pedophiles, though.

1346
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,400
That is, I don't like saying it.

1347
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,920
Like, yeah.

1348
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,880
Oh my god, that is just what it's called.

1349
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,800
That's just what it's called.

1350
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:25,200
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's true.

1351
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,440
Welcome to virtuous pedophiles.

1352
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:34,160
Oh god, I have heard that before, and it makes sense, and I believe it,

1353
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:41,760
that actual abuse often is just a case of a person can do it.

1354
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,360
They're in a position where they can do it.

1355
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,200
That's why it happens so much in the church historically,

1356
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:55,600
is because that was very much a situation that these people were empowered to do it, so they did it.

1357
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,840
They were empowered not because it was a sexual attraction thing necessarily,

1358
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,640
or is that also part of it?

1359
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:18,240
I don't know, but yeah, it's more about can you than about, oh, you have a mental condition.

1360
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:26,320
Yeah, I definitely agree with the idea that you can't necessarily help your vice,

1361
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:35,760
not your vice, it's your predilections, what turns you on is sometimes out of your control,

1362
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,080
it's your actions that you can control.

1363
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,400
Sure, and I mean, I totally agree.

1364
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:47,280
So people, if they end up having an attraction to children, obviously they should never do that,

1365
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,880
and the way we treat the conversation around pedophilia is very,

1366
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,840
like, no discussion necessary.

1367
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:00,960
If it's even slightly potentially the case, then we should just scorch the earth, burn,

1368
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,560
and just destroy them.

1369
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:09,520
No room for any discussion at all because children are involved, and I get people's

1370
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:20,080
wariness, because it feels very weird to even think of the phrase virtuous pedophiles these days.

1371
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:32,000
I think if it is the case that people have these things and they don't wish to act on them,

1372
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,720
that is at least evidence that not everyone who is attracted to children

1373
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,200
is necessarily an abuser.

1374
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,440
So yeah, I guess there's a discussion to have.

1375
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:52,000
Yeah, I mean, I am for whatever, this is the tough questions, we're dealing with the PQ

1376
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
right now, the pedophile question.

1377
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:01,920
And the answer that I prefer is, in it first, a solution that results in the fewest children

1378
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:10,880
being abused, which yeah, it's probably the case that letting people that are like this,

1379
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,240
and like you said, they are going to exist no matter what.

1380
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:20,400
So letting people like that get help or whatever that looks like,

1381
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:29,360
and not be shamed just for existing, as long as they're not hurting anyone.

1382
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,600
And then secondary to not abusing children is, in addition to that, also dealing with these

1383
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:41,280
people who are making their doing what they need to do not to hurt anyone, dealing with them

1384
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:46,640
humanely is also good, so I agree.

1385
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,280
Controversial statement there maybe, but yeah, sure.

1386
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,720
No, this guy's right.

1387
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,800
Yeah, I agree as well.

1388
01:34:52,800 --> 01:35:05,520
It's just frustrating, because I know the issue is so much about anybody who would want to have

1389
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:13,600
the conversation, runs the risk of being just shit-talked and thought of as a pedophile online.

1390
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:21,360
Like, oh, you even think about defending, like the rehabilitation, that's just major cringe.

1391
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:25,920
You're probably a pedophile yourself, actually, and then it's all like-

1392
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:34,480
As a registered Democrat, I want us to be as open and generous with pedophiles as possible,

1393
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:41,120
because I stan all of them, they are all my gods, they are my kings and queens,

1394
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,120
and I won't let anyone besmirch them.

1395
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:52,400
Yeah, I don't know how to go about this sort of thing, but I guess verped, verped.

1396
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,960
Who we are, FAQ.

1397
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,520
I'm not going to read the website, I don't care that much.

1398
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,680
I'll at least skip it, I mean, I don't know.

1399
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:02,960
I guess.

1400
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,040
Next one?

1401
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:06,720
Yeah.

1402
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,960
Okay, okay, next one is called cringe or based, episode one, three, two, one, go.

1403
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:16,400
Based.

1404
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:17,760
Nice.

1405
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:25,680
Oh, clever, clever new show on the voicemails.

1406
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,640
We have to guess if it is going to be cringe or based each episode.

1407
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,760
Well, what an exciting new chapter in the PCP.

1408
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,120
I'm so excited to see the next one and to be correct when I flip that coin.

1409
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:49,920
Okay, next one, don't forget to eat your greens, three, two, one, go.

1410
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,480
Don't forget to eat your greens.

1411
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:53,680
Nice.

1412
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:54,720
Sure.

1413
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,360
Hey, this is apropos of nothing.

1414
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,520
We've talked about this a little bit.

1415
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:06,560
I've mentioned it and we have kind of like skirted around the idea and it's but it's been

1416
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,920
floating around like maybe I don't know how I feel about it anymore.

1417
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,400
I mean, should we rebrand the PCP a little bit?

1418
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,640
Because we're like things are clearly different now.

1419
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,160
Should we do that?

1420
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:23,920
I keep, I have thought for a while that we should, but it almost feels like it's too late,

1421
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,400
but like that's stupid, right?

1422
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,480
I guess it's not too late.

1423
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:34,880
We could change branding and it'd be like the Ben and Gibb and sometimes Tom show.

1424
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:36,640
Yeah.

1425
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,440
What would we, what would change though about like the show itself?

1426
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,240
What would, would we talk about specific things or?

1427
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:49,600
What if we got, I mean, just if I'm, if I'm spitballing here, what if we got like a new theme song,

1428
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,600
maybe a new intro?

1429
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,440
We don't really do like, wait, I don't, I don't watch this garbage.

1430
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:02,640
Does it still do the, the oblivion fall like animated, like spinning intro?

1431
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:02,960
Yeah, yeah.

1432
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:12,080
Well, I mean, maybe we could change that or, or, or get a new one, get a new theme, new song,

1433
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,840
new thing, new, new banner.

1434
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,360
I mean, we wouldn't have to change like the thumbnails or anything.

1435
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,240
The thumbnails are fine.

1436
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,440
I don't know.

1437
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,520
I just feel like it would be appropriate.

1438
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,280
I guess you're right.

1439
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,120
I just don't know how to go about it.

1440
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,000
I don't, I don't know.

1441
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,880
Would we change the title of the podcast?

1442
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,800
Would we like new podcast, episode one, or would it just be?

1443
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,160
No, no.

1444
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,160
Procrastinators.

1445
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,360
Hey, I mean, it would be fun.

1446
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:43,520
I mean, okay, imagine, imagine that the PCP goes on for another five years, right?

1447
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:51,840
It would be kind of a, it would be sort of weird to have like a period of the PCP where like,

1448
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,400
okay, this was the period where it was mostly Ben and Gibb, right?

1449
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:02,160
And, but only like the latter like portion of it has like the different theme song.

1450
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:06,880
Like most of it just sounds like any other is like branded the same as any other part of it.

1451
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,880
But like the latter piece of it is like branded differently.

1452
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,680
I guess the, when I say it out loud, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound like that.

1453
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,480
Who cares?

1454
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,720
They'll just be like, all right, who cares?

1455
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,840
Who gives a fuck?

1456
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:20,800
We should change it.

1457
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,440
I think we should.

1458
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,240
We should change it.

1459
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:22,960
We should change it.

1460
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:30,320
Maybe we could change the name to be instead of PCP, we could just have the Procrastinators

1461
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,880
or like the Procrastinators podcast, like a, instead of PCP, I've never really,

1462
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,120
I don't know, I just feel like PCP is like, it's a drug thing.

1463
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:45,440
And like anyone new will be like, where, where are they going to do the drugs?

1464
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,400
When are they going to do it?

1465
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,160
Maybe, maybe.

1466
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,960
I mean, it's like a pun that has never been relevant at all.

1467
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,560
It's true.

1468
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,120
It's true.

1469
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,840
I think, can we, can we put out a call for like a new theme song?

1470
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,160
Can we have another contest?

1471
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,360
We can have a little, yeah, another little contest.

1472
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:14,480
And then any suggestions for like, you know, ways to change the way the show looks.

1473
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,040
And here's, here's, here's what I think.

1474
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,960
Here's what, okay, you know what, you know what?

1475
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:25,040
Let's just say that like, hey, anyone who wants to, anyone who's interested, who thinks it would

1476
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,320
be cool, can like contact us, maybe add us on Twitter or whatever.

1477
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:37,120
And shiv is like, if you want to try and like write a new theme song or make a new like banner

1478
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,680
image or anything like that.

1479
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,600
I don't think I would change the logo, like the channel icon.

1480
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,960
TPC, CD thing?

1481
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,520
Yeah, yeah, that seems like going, that seems like going a little, a little far.

1482
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,920
But yeah, I don't know.

1483
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,160
We're looking to rebrand.

1484
01:40:56,160 --> 01:41:02,960
And if you think you would be funny to do something and you can show it to us.

1485
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,120
And if we use it, we will say thank you.

1486
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,120
We will say thank you.

1487
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,560
We will say thank you.

1488
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,280
We will shout out your thing if you have one.

1489
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:11,600
Yes.

1490
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,840
Yes, yes, yes.

1491
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,720
Um, okay, okay.

1492
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,720
Next voicemail is Kringus Bingus, episode four.

1493
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,640
Are you ready?

1494
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,400
Three, two, one, go.

1495
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,960
Hey, dear PCP, it's me, Kringus Bingus.

1496
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,480
I'm going to get right into it.

1497
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:39,840
What I creamed that was the fact that over the weekend, somebody got my credit card information

1498
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:45,840
and used it to pay for some OnlyFans, somebody's OnlyFans.

1499
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:46,560
Sorry, that was me.

1500
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:46,880
Sorry, that was me.

1501
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,320
Only like $35 of OnlyFans transactions.

1502
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,280
And it was really silly.

1503
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,560
So I had to cancel my card and I was driving to the bank to get a new one.

1504
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,440
So that's silly.

1505
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,400
That's very Kring.

1506
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,840
What I binged was some anime.

1507
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:06,080
There's some good seasonal shows that have a few episodes out that I enjoyed.

1508
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,320
No.

1509
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,600
There's also an older show.

1510
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,480
From 2017 called Aka 13.

1511
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,280
It's okay.

1512
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:13,920
It's pretty good.

1513
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,200
It's like a political drama type of thing.

1514
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,320
I enjoyed my time with it.

1515
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,280
Aka 13 never heard of it.

1516
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:28,640
A follow up from last time, I said my mom had COVID.

1517
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,040
I did not have COVID and she's doing okay.

1518
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,720
I just wanted to get a check in about that.

1519
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,000
This is Kringus Bingus signing off.

1520
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,040
Thank you, favorite PCP voicemail caller.

1521
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,640
Thank you, Kringus Bingus.

1522
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,520
We love you.

1523
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,120
Always nice to get an update from Kringus Bingus.

1524
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,960
I like to bing at Kringus Bingus instead of bing.

1525
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:56,320
I never kring at Kringus Bingus and I always bing Kringus Bingus.

1526
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,520
Very good.

1527
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,080
Wait a minute.

1528
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:08,320
Before we go on, I just remembered something that I want to shout out.

1529
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:16,800
I have not shouted out enough of Krugsmash on this channel.

1530
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,800
Is that the Digimon or the Dwarf Fortress?

1531
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,600
The Digimon person.

1532
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,320
No, it's the Dwarf Fortress guy.

1533
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,000
Yes.

1534
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:40,720
Someone, okay, it was a lemon tart from who worked on the PCP dating sim.

1535
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,600
He was part of that.

1536
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:48,320
Messaged me to be like, Ben, I gave Krugsmash a try.

1537
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:52,800
I watched the splatter face, like you said, and he was like, thank you.

1538
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:53,440
It was great.

1539
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,400
It was a masterpiece.

1540
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:54,960
I loved it.

1541
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,880
I'm going to go and watch Monster Killer the Fortress series next because it was so great.

1542
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,560
And I was like, yes, fuck, yes, excellent.

1543
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,120
Love it.

1544
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,000
That made my day.

1545
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:11,040
I hope more, I hope other people discover Krugsmash through my recommendations.

1546
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,040
He is back, splatter face is over.

1547
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:19,040
He has gone back to a new quote unquote fortress called the watchful eyes.

1548
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,640
And the watchful eyes is sick.

1549
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,160
It is nothing.

1550
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:25,680
It is completely different from all the other fortresses he has done.

1551
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:26,480
It rules.

1552
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,040
It's great.

1553
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,160
But don't go right into watchful eyes because it is a direct continuation

1554
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:37,200
from scorched fountains, which I think was a direct continuation from Honey Stoker,

1555
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:41,360
which I think was a direct continuation from Monster Killer.

1556
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:46,080
So you could jump in anywhere, but it's better if you go back and watch the older fortress,

1557
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,600
at least as far back as Monster Killer, maybe even further.

1558
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,320
I don't remember.

1559
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:56,480
So I was just very fucking excited.

1560
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:00,880
Just very fucking excited that Krugsmash is back to back to watchful eyes.

1561
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,080
Cool.

1562
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:03,680
Okay.

1563
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,360
Yes.

1564
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,000
Very cool.

1565
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:07,760
Okay.

1566
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:14,400
Next voicemail is called Tomgtomg how to resurrect the podcast.

1567
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,680
Ah, thank God.

1568
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,840
Three, two, one, go.

1569
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:23,680
So first of all, the way the podcast is right now, it's not dead, of course.

1570
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,120
There's still people watching it.

1571
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:31,280
They call the volcano dormant when it's like low activity is to sleep for a while.

1572
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:34,240
So I think that's why we should call the state the podcast is in.

1573
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,440
Currently, it's dormant.

1574
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:43,120
So the way that we fix this is to have another rag con because that always brings the spirits

1575
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,560
up as a good rag con.

1576
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:52,240
Like in the past, rag con has brought people who supposedly left the podcast back into the

1577
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:52,560
fold.

1578
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,440
Maybe not immediately, but like slowly.

1579
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,280
You know, there was another rag con.

1580
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:03,440
Plenty of people who have supposedly left the podcast would probably go to it anyways.

1581
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,400
Right?

1582
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,080
Yeah, like that's true.

1583
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,840
I stopped the voicemail.

1584
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:13,440
That's true, but we can't do it because we have things that must be

1585
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,600
delivered on from the last one, which are actually being, believe it or not,

1586
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,200
they are actually being produced.

1587
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,280
It's definitely slower than we would have liked.

1588
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:28,000
But yes, nothing has been like, aside from the stuff that we haven't started yet,

1589
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,160
like the dojin.

1590
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:34,640
Well, the stuff that we haven't started yet is not started because the other things that

1591
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,640
have not been finished yet must be done first.

1592
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,560
Does the dojin need anything to get done?

1593
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:52,400
Well, we never really settled what exactly the dojin would be.

1594
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,640
I had some ideas about what it would be.

1595
01:46:54,640 --> 01:47:02,320
My ideas, though, were that it should tie into the OVA and Road to Radcon.

1596
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:07,840
And Digi has still not finished the final chapter of Road to Radcon,

1597
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,360
despite me asking her several times to do so, despite you asking her several times to do so,

1598
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,240
and her saying, yes, she'll do it, but she still hasn't done it yet.

1599
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:24,320
So we can't do that because I think it should be a tie-in.

1600
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,760
So there's that.

1601
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:33,600
My idea is that it should be, well, whatever.

1602
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,440
I've explained that enough.

1603
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:44,480
At some point, there's only so many times you can just ask her to do it and wait.

1604
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,320
Should I write it?

1605
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,000
Should you write it at this point?

1606
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,360
I don't know.

1607
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:55,360
It feels wrong because I don't know what it was supposed to be.

1608
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,160
It does feel wrong.

1609
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,560
Well, okay, I have a few thoughts about this.

1610
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:10,240
It does feel wrong because the Road to Radcon was like absolutely a Digi creation.

1611
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:14,800
It would not have been, you know, I don't think anyone else could, like,

1612
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,560
it wouldn't be the same if anyone else made it.

1613
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,440
On the other hand, slightly mitigating that is the fact that now, like, two years later,

1614
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,600
if, like, everything, is it two years?

1615
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,920
I don't think it's two full years.

1616
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,760
Almost a year later, almost a year.

1617
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:30,980
Yeah.

1618
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:32,000
Almost a year later.

1619
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,840
I mean, after everything has happened, a lot has changed and, like, Road to Radcon 5

1620
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:45,840
now will not be what it would have been, but I still think Digi should write it because,

1621
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,800
I mean, I still think it's, it should be Digi that makes it.

1622
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:56,480
If she won't do it, then I guess someone else will have to, even though that does seem completely wrong.

1623
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:57,600
Right.

1624
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,360
I mean, we should definitely make sure if we're going to do it that we tell her beforehand.

1625
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:03,840
Sure.

1626
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,560
Just in case she was gonna get around to it.

1627
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,040
I don't know.

1628
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:13,760
I have no doubt that she has every intention of eventually getting around to it, but, like,

1629
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:18,960
eventually must be on a reasonable time frame.

1630
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,720
And I know that sounds hypocritical considering how long it's been that, like,

1631
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,800
the other stuff is still getting made, but I was saying, I was saying before that, like,

1632
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:31,600
the OVA will not be an infinite amount of time away.

1633
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:40,560
The OVA will be, like, coming, you know, probably in the medium to short, not short,

1634
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:45,600
in the slightly longer than short, low, medium range future.

1635
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:48,480
If you understand, that makes perfect sense.

1636
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:54,880
And therefore, if we want, I would like to just have everything done before the OVA is done.

1637
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,520
I would like the OVA to be, like, basically the last thing that comes out.

1638
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,360
Yeah, yeah.

1639
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,960
And with it, everything else that is associated.

1640
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,800
And have that be, like, okay, it's done.

1641
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,720
We deliver it on everything it's done.

1642
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:10,560
And only then could we even consider a Radcon five?

1643
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,920
Five, yeah.

1644
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:17,600
Radcon five, I mean, even if we wanted to just do one right now, there is a pandemic still.

1645
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,360
I would want to wait for that to, like, ease up a little bit more.

1646
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:22,640
For sure.

1647
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,880
I mean, I would prefer it if, like, we were all vaccinated by then.

1648
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:29,600
Yes, that's going to take a while.

1649
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:34,880
Because it's all like, well, for, it'll be a few, it'll be a few months at least.

1650
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,120
Sure.

1651
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:40,080
All the people that prioritize people with conditions are prioritized and they still

1652
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,920
got to build, they still got to, like, create millions and millions of them.

1653
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:49,280
The rollout plan in my area estimates that, like, the vaccination will be

1654
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:56,240
available for the general public around April or May, which probably is an optimistic guess.

1655
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,800
And I would assume that that's the earliest it would possibly be.

1656
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,360
When you say general public, do you mean?

1657
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,800
I mean, anyone.

1658
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:07,360
You mean, like, no bees getting vaccinated yet?

1659
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,640
No, I mean, I mean, they are being that, they're rolling it out, but it's for, like, only, like,

1660
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:16,880
you know, right now, like, frontline workers and then, you know, like, be at risk and stuff.

1661
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,800
And then eventually around April or May, it becomes, like, anyone can get it.

1662
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,040
Sure.

1663
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,720
Is the plan anyway.

1664
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,640
So yeah, that's true.

1665
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,040
Lol, I forgot about the pandemic.

1666
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:30,160
Okay.

1667
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:37,120
So about, yeah, the Rotoradcom thing is a little bit of a, of a bottleneck.

1668
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:45,840
And we should, I fucking posted in the chat about it yesterday,

1669
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,840
but whatever, we gotta, we gotta figure something out.

1670
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,960
I really do think we should get, we should get cracking.

1671
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:53,760
Yeah.

1672
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,600
Okay.

1673
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,760
Anyway, next voicemail.

1674
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,160
Yep.

1675
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,600
Is all right.

1676
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,640
Next, next one.

1677
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:03,680
Timmy Jimmy, Powder Game Pixel Limit.

1678
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,360
Three, two, one, go.

1679
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:12,240
I don't know if anybody still cares about this, but the guy who made Powder Game is like Japanese.

1680
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:15,760
So his English interfaces are kind of terrible.

1681
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:21,760
If you go open Powder Game and look down at the bottom right, there's a button that says Dot S,

1682
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,280
and that is the Dot Limit of the simulator.

1683
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,480
So if you click it, it cycles through so you can increase it.

1684
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,080
There still is one, but like-

1685
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,800
This must be why when I was playing Powder Game.

1686
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,960
It's a lot more than, than the small one.

1687
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,440
Stuff would just like stop appearing.

1688
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:42,320
It can do even more crazy stuff with more, more, more pixels on the screen.

1689
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:48,000
So, so now go play the game again in the middle of the podcast.

1690
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,320
Now there's 20 more seconds of your voicemail left for you.

1691
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,760
Genuinely, yes.

1692
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:57,600
I love, love hearing about people just hear, hear them experiencing something,

1693
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,720
being like, oh, that's cool, because I know it's cool.

1694
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,320
And that's me, I did that.

1695
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,200
I, I told you about the cool thing and that feels good.

1696
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:07,760
So play the game again in the middle of the podcast.

1697
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,240
Thank you.

1698
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,760
Okay, nothing.

1699
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:10,240
Cool.

1700
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:11,520
Well, what was it?

1701
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,320
Is the Dot S Dot L, does that mean large amount of dots?

1702
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,560
He said Dot S.

1703
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:18,960
Okay.

1704
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:19,360
I clicked on it.

1705
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,200
Oh, maybe yeah, it means dots.

1706
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:21,840
Well, that's funny.

1707
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,480
Well, you should put stuff in the game until you can't put any more

1708
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:33,040
and then click that to change the limit and see if you can then put more stuff in.

1709
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:40,400
Uh, I'm, I'm playing the game.

1710
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Hey, um, I'm, I, I'm, I gotta say, I gotta say, uh, so like these are all definitely, uh, Tommy

1711
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,520
J. Again, these are, you know, Tom G, Timmy Jimmy.

1712
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:59,600
The next one is terminal, germinal, then Thimble D, Jimble D, then Thinky Jinky,

1713
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:02,080
to Bajuba, Thongjong, Tom Jump.

1714
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,520
Oh, oh, I hadn't noticed.

1715
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,560
So, yeah.

1716
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:09,920
So, um, I mean, we literally told him not to do this in the last episode

1717
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,520
and it's like he didn't listen.

1718
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:19,120
So I'm, I mean, these aren't the worst, these aren't the worst voicemails,

1719
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:20,480
but they're not great either.

1720
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,440
And like, I don't know.

1721
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,000
I don't know.

1722
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,840
I'm gonna, I'm gonna start the next one.

1723
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,680
I'll start the next one.

1724
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,520
It's called FTL is Good.

1725
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,200
Three, two, one, go.

1726
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,760
Ben, you like roguelikes and roguelites, such as Stone Soup.

1727
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,000
Uh, have you ever played FTL?

1728
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,400
I know about FTL.

1729
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,200
Faster than life.

1730
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:42,480
I have not played FTL.

1731
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,080
It's really fucking good.

1732
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,920
It's like endless entertainment.

1733
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:46,640
I heard it's good.

1734
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:52,000
I can like, it's just simple enough that I could actually like play it in class because of this.

1735
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:52,720
Okay, that's it.

1736
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,600
No more.

1737
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,760
Next one is called Thimble D, Jim, yep.

1738
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,040
I've heard FTL is good.

1739
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,000
I never played it.

1740
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,960
Next one, Thimble D, Jimble, College Solutions.

1741
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,240
Three, two, one, go.

1742
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:09,760
I just want to add on an addendum to the college discussion as like a thing that you,

1743
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,920
if you're in high school, or preferably about to start high school,

1744
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:18,720
something you can do to fix this, like in your own life, you know,

1745
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,520
avoid a lot of the averse effects.

1746
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:31,520
Because so I only had to take about three, three gen ed courses in college.

1747
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:38,960
And the reason why is because I took 10, 10 AP courses in high school.

1748
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,960
And I got college credit.

1749
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,000
Okay, that's it.

1750
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,400
No more.

1751
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,240
Yeah, what he's saying.

1752
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,600
Yeah, you can take things.

1753
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:46,480
You can take AP.

1754
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,680
This is an American high school thing.

1755
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,640
You can take AP classes in high school and they can,

1756
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:57,280
you're, they can sometimes count for like college credit or you can,

1757
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:02,320
you can, you can, um, what's the word like, um, qualify out of taking like certain gen ed

1758
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:07,440
requirements, uh, because, you know, they'll count you have being like taken like,

1759
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:10,640
you know, elementary, uh, you know, chemistry or physics or whatever.

1760
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:14,400
If you do the AP class, uh, yep, it's a good idea.

1761
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,560
Next one is called.

1762
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,760
Thank you, Jinky.

1763
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:18,960
More college shit.

1764
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,480
They're all a minute 30, three, two, one go.

1765
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,240
So I have some more clarifications about the school shit.

1766
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,160
So Ben or whoever, uh, you've seen my resume.

1767
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,120
No, perhaps you remember computer science.

1768
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,480
No, I didn't read your resume.

1769
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:40,880
Computer science is a very strange field because it's the sort of thing where, uh, where,

1770
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:49,760
where theory is like constantly relevant to the actual practice of the, the, the field.

1771
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:55,520
Like, you know, of course, theoretical physics, like modern cutting edge stuff.

1772
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,040
I have stopped only occasionally.

1773
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:57,520
Okay.

1774
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,240
That's cool.

1775
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,040
Uh, computer science sure is fascinating.

1776
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:02,960
Uh, next one.

1777
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,960
Tuba juba equal line B carrot parentheses.

1778
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,360
This is me three, two, one go.

1779
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:15,440
As I record this voicemail, I'm going to do it.

1780
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,600
I finally, I think I've finally entered into the class of person that can afford to patron

1781
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:28,640
other people because like I made money off of that fucking, well, not off of the game

1782
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,040
stopping.

1783
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:32,560
I made money off the doge coin thing that happened a little bit after that.

1784
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,240
I sold it just the right time.

1785
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:34,960
It was perfect.

1786
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,040
I think I was supposed to like hold and ride the wave, but I would have not made as much

1787
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,320
money if I did that.

1788
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:48,000
And I don't think the Wall Street people, like how come Tommy J gets to make money off

1789
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,760
doge, shorting the coin?

1790
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:56,320
So I don't think I like, I was on the side of the bad people.

1791
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,800
You know, I don't think I stopped them.

1792
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,000
Doge coin is not bad.

1793
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,480
Other people from fucking them like they deserve.

1794
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:05,680
You know, anyways, I have money now.

1795
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:06,480
I made a lot.

1796
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:13,040
I think like I've finally entered into the class of person that can patron other people.

1797
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,400
So of course I'm not going to patron the procrastinator podcast.

1798
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:21,280
I'm going to patron Jeff so that I can see all of this hidden Jeff's content that people have

1799
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:24,000
been fucking yapping their mouths about.

1800
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,760
And I can't see any of it because I don't have any money, but I do have money now.

1801
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,320
So I'm going to do it and I'll report back whether it was worth it or not.

1802
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,360
You should patron me.

1803
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:38,320
Gibb.

1804
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,320
You might spend this podcast.

1805
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,320
What Gibb, what?

1806
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,200
I don't know if we're going to have to cut this or not.

1807
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,680
I'm, I'm actually upset.

1808
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,520
I'm, I'm honestly upset.

1809
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,920
I'm genuinely offended and angry.

1810
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,400
And I hate this person so much.

1811
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,040
I hate Tommy J so fucking much.

1812
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,840
I cannot fucking stand him.

1813
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,800
Jesus Christ.

1814
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,560
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm seething.

1815
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:03,600
I'm seething.

1816
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,400
Do you want to let him know?

1817
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,360
Do you want to keep this in?

1818
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,000
What do you think?

1819
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,480
I don't know.

1820
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,600
What do you think we should do?

1821
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,000
I don't know.

1822
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,720
I don't know what to do.

1823
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:19,360
I'm at a loss.

1824
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,480
I'm at a complete loss.

1825
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:24,000
Okay.

1826
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,760
Next, next voicemail from Thong Jong.

1827
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,880
Three, two, one, go.

1828
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:30,880
Oh my God.

1829
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,320
Everybody has always been saying,

1830
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,640
oh, if you want to know what's going on with Jess,

1831
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:35,680
just patron her.

1832
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,080
But you can see the patron videos.

1833
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,800
Uh, no, stop.

1834
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,680
Nobody says that.

1835
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,120
Nobody says that.

1836
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,120
Nobody fucking gives a shit.

1837
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:47,120
Nobody fucking gives a shit what Jess is doing.

1838
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,400
Who fucking cares?

1839
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,360
Fuck you.

1840
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:49,920
Fuck you.

1841
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,360
Oh my God.

1842
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:54,240
Uh, that, I'm skipping the rest.

1843
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:54,720
That's it.

1844
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,080
We're going out on a sour note.

1845
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,680
I don't want to give this person.

1846
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:59,040
No, no more.

1847
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,440
Tommy J.

1848
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:05,360
I will never, ever, ever play another voicemail of yours.

1849
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:05,840
Fuck you.

1850
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,000
Go to hell.

1851
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:08,880
All right.

1852
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:09,440
Fuck off.

1853
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,720
Fuck off.

1854
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,360
I'm, I'm, I know I'm taking,

1855
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,600
I know I'm taking this too seriously.

1856
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:18,240
But you know what?

1857
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,640
I'm, I'm valid.

1858
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:21,440
I'm valid.

1859
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:23,840
No, I'm with you.

1860
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,560
He was just going on about whatever he wanted to talk about.

1861
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,440
It wasn't a question.

1862
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,400
It wasn't like, I have something to talk about on the

1863
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,840
parochrasmators podcast.

1864
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,920
It's just like, here's something I think about and want people to listen to.

1865
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,600
Here is, here is the rub.

1866
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:40,240
He's lapping as, as a member of, of the show.

1867
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,000
Here is the rub, Tommy J.

1868
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,560
I will never play another voicemail that has your name on it.

1869
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:52,080
And if I recognize your voice, which I will, because I know what you sound like,

1870
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,360
I will not play it.

1871
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,440
And I will tell Ellie Azar to edit it out.

1872
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:58,320
You will never hear yourself on the PCP ever again.

1873
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,000
Do not make another voicemail.

1874
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,840
If you do, you'll be wasting your time.

1875
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:02,320
Fuck you.

1876
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,520
All right.

1877
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:04,560
That's it.

1878
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,680
Next voicemail is called Homestuck Preservation Final.

1879
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:12,480
Hopefully three, two, one, go.

1880
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:13,760
Okay.

1881
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:17,120
This is an addendum to the whole Homestuck Preservation problem.

1882
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:20,400
The offline archive I previously mentioned does not fucking work.

1883
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,920
Flash is dead and so is that archive.

1884
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,360
Sorry for the confusion.

1885
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:29,280
What you need to do is you need to go, you need to Google the unofficial Homestuck

1886
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,480
Collection on Google.

1887
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:35,120
And the first result should be bambosh.github.io.

1888
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:37,360
And it's the unofficial Homestuck Collection.

1889
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,960
Follow the fucking instructions.

1890
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,960
You have to download an asset pack.

1891
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,200
It is, in fact, the entire thing.

1892
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:46,320
Now, when you start it up, it's, you go to the map because you're like,

1893
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,080
oh man, I want to skip to my favorite part.

1894
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,280
There's nothing there.

1895
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,320
The reason that that is, is that there's a settings page

1896
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,040
that enables a new reader function.

1897
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:55,760
Okay.

1898
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,600
You can disable that in the settings.

1899
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,480
So you can have the entire thing, but like for new readers,

1900
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,680
it like doesn't let you skip to later parts and spoil yourself,

1901
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:09,440
which I think is interesting, but also shitty considering I've read the entire

1902
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,920
thing and I just want to fucking see spades slick.

1903
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:13,360
Anyway, have a good day.

1904
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:16,960
Fuck that Homestuck archive I talked about earlier.

1905
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:18,320
True.

1906
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,600
I'm not having a good day, but thanks anyway.

1907
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:22,320
Okay.

1908
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:25,680
Okay.

1909
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,720
I guess I have nothing else to say about that.

1910
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:29,200
Yes.

1911
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,520
It is just good that there is a Homestuck.

1912
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:32,880
Yes.

1913
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,880
It's good, it's good that there's a Homestuck.

1914
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,880
Man, can you believe that we share a planet,

1915
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,600
we share a planet with Homestuck.

1916
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:42,080
Oh wait.

1917
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,840
We live on the same earth.

1918
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,480
The Hussie project came out.

1919
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,760
Did you play it?

1920
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:48,800
I bought it.

1921
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:49,840
I haven't played it yet.

1922
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:50,720
I meant to.

1923
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:52,160
Okay.

1924
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,840
Yeah, I haven't played it yet.

1925
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,000
You can talk about that when we both played it.

1926
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,880
I was, I'm so stupid.

1927
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:01,760
I literally was gonna, but then it was like, oh, but noida though.

1928
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,200
I could beat it again.

1929
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,480
Okay.

1930
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,120
Next one is called a plus one.

1931
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:10,720
Three, two, one, go.

1932
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:14,720
Also, it seems that I have something to show now, so I will.

1933
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:18,480
Ilzon.me, that's my new website.

1934
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,560
Please go check it out.

1935
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:25,440
That's I-L-U-Z-O-N.me.

1936
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:27,360
Yeah, that's it.

1937
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,920
Wait, maybe he had a voicemail last week and he has posted this.

1938
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:37,280
I don't know.

1939
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:40,400
Before that episode came out or something.

1940
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,560
It says five days ago.

1941
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:49,200
Oh, I mean, I don't remember playing.

1942
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:52,240
I don't remember whether we played a voicemail from him or not.

1943
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:57,840
This, this is not like, why would he think that we would know

1944
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,600
what the also is in regards to?

1945
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:03,920
Maybe he, he probably can't see everything that happened in between.

1946
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:04,960
I don't know.

1947
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:11,360
But we've, but we've played all the, he would have had to,

1948
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,400
if he left a voicemail about something,

1949
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:17,040
it would have been more than five days ago.

1950
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:21,360
So he would have said whatever he said and then at least five days,

1951
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,800
probably more later, he called up the voicemail and said,

1952
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,640
also, I have a website and here's what it is.

1953
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,440
No.

1954
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:29,840
Okay.

1955
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,120
Next one is called plus two, three, two, one, go.

1956
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,720
And what is going on on that website?

1957
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:45,680
You ask why it's ego month thing done by me every day, all January,

1958
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:48,720
all black history month, the shortest month.

1959
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:52,480
Who is this?

1960
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:53,280
Who is this person?

1961
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:58,960
I think he may have been the guy giving comic recommendations at one point.

1962
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:05,920
No, that guy's accent was like fucking un unbearably thick.

1963
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,440
Uh, well, this is not, this is not that guy.

1964
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:12,080
Maybe we'll see the guy who called us out.

1965
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,600
It was on who, who are you?

1966
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,640
Who the fuck are you?

1967
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:15,920
Why are you?

1968
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,520
What, what is this in regards to?

1969
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:19,440
Fuck off.

1970
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,000
Christ.

1971
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,160
Next one is another Tommy J.

1972
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:22,880
No.

1973
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:29,680
Next one is after that is thousand lung man from Nate fuckers at michelkillers.com.

1974
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:32,080
Three, two, one, go.

1975
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:41,120
Oh, how I've waited for this moment.

1976
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:45,360
Nice production value to see him here.

1977
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,480
Wait, where is he?

1978
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,600
Where is Nate?

1979
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,680
I wanted to see him.

1980
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:58,400
He was meant to be here.

1981
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,920
Oh, true.

1982
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,880
Here, we live in a doom timeline.

1983
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:14,080
I really like this idea of a man with a thousand miles.

1984
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,080
How much he means to me.

1985
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:19,360
How much I want to fuck him.

1986
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:22,880
I wish to fuck Nate.

1987
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:26,480
I am with the league of Nate fuckers.

1988
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:39,520
I like leaves me breathless.

1989
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:47,840
The idea of like a like a weird creepy like lung based monstrosity is pretty cool.

1990
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,040
I don't know why he has so many lungs.

1991
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:53,680
Never.

1992
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:56,080
Oh God, I'm going to say it wrong.

1993
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:58,800
You ever heard of a Hecaton Kyrie's?

1994
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,160
Nope.

1995
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,080
It is a Greek monster.

1996
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:07,040
It's from like mythology, I guess.

1997
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:11,280
I think they like were like from around like the time of the Titans,

1998
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,440
like before the gods took over.

1999
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:16,960
They were like the name means hundred handed ones.

2000
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:24,080
And they are just like giant fucking clusters of a hundred arms that will grab you.

2001
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:28,640
Do you like the cluster from Steven Universe?

2002
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:33,600
Yeah, yeah, actually.

2003
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,320
Yeah, pretty much.

2004
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:37,680
They're not that big, though.

2005
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:38,800
I mean, it's only a hundred.

2006
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,400
It's only a hundred.

2007
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:43,600
Give that's that's just ridiculous.

2008
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:45,680
It's just ridiculous.

2009
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:49,360
All right, pretty good.

2010
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,760
Next one is called Seeking Goss.

2011
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,400
Three, two, one, go.

2012
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:58,560
Hey, I just want to be real quick.

2013
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,880
I don't need, you know, any torque and hog off or anything.

2014
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:06,400
I was just wondering, where do I find what happened between Digi and May?

2015
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,000
I don't need you guys to talk about it on the show.

2016
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,720
I just want to know where to go to hear her talk about it.

2017
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:14,880
I mean, she she made a video.

2018
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,680
May made a video, I think.

2019
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:20,160
I don't know if Digi ever talked about it, probably not.

2020
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:22,880
I don't think so.

2021
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,120
I mean, if you're seeking goss, there are places to go.

2022
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:30,800
He specifically said, I want to hear her talk about it.

2023
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,320
And she made a video.

2024
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,880
Oh, that's right.

2025
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:37,680
Yeah, I guess he could have met either of them.

2026
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:45,200
Well, Digi, yeah, I don't think Digi ever did talk anywhere.

2027
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:47,600
So I don't know.

2028
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:50,480
Honestly, it's been a while.

2029
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,240
I forgot the specifics.

2030
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,920
They broke up.

2031
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,000
It's as much as I can remember, really.

2032
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:58,240
There was definitely stuff that happened.

2033
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:03,680
There is, I mean, yeah, sites.

2034
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:07,600
I wouldn't recommend going to like, what was it called?

2035
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,680
The stupid place where the idiots go.

2036
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,280
Kiwi farms?

2037
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:13,520
Yeah.

2038
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,800
I think a lot of people there would have been talking about it.

2039
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:18,560
If you really want to know.

2040
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,360
But I don't know whether any of that is true.

2041
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:25,040
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of speculation there.

2042
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:29,120
A lot of speculation and a lot of like, oh, I bet I know what happened.

2043
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:30,080
Yeah, I love that.

2044
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,240
If you want, yeah, I don't think Digi ever really made a thing out of it.

2045
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:37,440
So I don't know.

2046
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:37,840
Sorry.

2047
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:39,920
Sorry.

2048
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,680
Unless she did and I'm forgetting, but I don't think I am.

2049
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:45,280
Okay.

2050
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,880
Good question, lol.

2051
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:51,920
But if you want, I mean, if you want the short, I mean, I don't know.

2052
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,000
I mean, I could just say what happened, but like, is it worth it?

2053
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,320
I mean, I honestly forget.

2054
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:07,840
Well, I mean, they, there was the, you know, there's a little publicly available information,

2055
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:16,080
you know, they said they had the break in that someone broke into their house or something or

2056
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:16,640
something.

2057
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:20,880
That one's got a big asterisk and that one's got to get big asterisk and an or something on it,

2058
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:23,120
because I actually don't know what the fuck that was.

2059
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:32,720
And then, and then they broke up and then May went to go be a fucking right wing shithead

2060
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,640
with Ethan Ralph Lamal.

2061
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:39,200
And now she's a, you know, now she's insane.

2062
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:39,440
Yeah.

2063
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,520
She was always insane.

2064
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:42,240
True.

2065
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:42,720
She was always.

2066
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:45,440
Well, I mean, I didn't know I had no idea.

2067
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:47,440
She was always dumb as fuck, but now she's free.

2068
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:55,440
Now she's free to be as dumb as she likes and embarrass herself in whatever way she chooses.

2069
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:56,640
Lamal.

2070
02:10:58,800 --> 02:10:59,120
Cool.

2071
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,760
And I think that's basically it.

2072
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,640
That's the gist of it.

2073
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:10,640
Next one is called Alaskan Weeb 321 Go.

2074
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:16,960
So I'm going through things, not a little bit behind, but I just know some got to the episode

2075
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:20,560
where you guys were answering the voicemail about accidents and everyone thinks it's about

2076
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:21,200
southern accidents.

2077
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:25,920
So I haven't been down here in the south too long, but I've noticed that there are

2078
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,560
roughly speaking about three kinds of accidents that you run into.

2079
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:33,600
You kind of run into the Morpheus Accent, which is very long, slow and raw.

2080
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:40,400
You can, uh, it's more common among men than among women, but it's very slow and raw.

2081
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:45,280
Then you got more of your, uh, your Bible Belt Accent.

2082
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:50,560
Those ones are a lot more nasal, uh, which my anger is often used to refer to it.

2083
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:51,520
Pretty common.

2084
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:55,040
Then of course you got shield, Bailey Accent, which ain't really from the, uh,

2085
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:55,840
from the south.

2086
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:01,200
It's a lot more from like the Appalachian, Gold Belt, but it was loved in with them anyways.

2087
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,640
And second of all, Palin's not from Alaska.

2088
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:05,840
She's from fucking Idaho.

2089
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,440
Everyone up here fucking hates her.

2090
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:09,200
Fuck Sarah Palin.

2091
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:10,640
Sarah Palin.

2092
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,720
Uh, uh, oh yeah.

2093
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,800
I didn't know she was from Idaho.

2094
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:20,560
I know her as the Alaskan, so that's, that's new.

2095
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:25,680
Um, there's, yeah, there's, there's different, I know there are a bunch of different kinds

2096
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:30,400
of southern accents, um, and I've heard people do a bunch of different ones.

2097
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:34,480
And when I hear them, I can be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, they're totally different.

2098
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:40,720
But like, I couldn't actually identify for you which one is which in, in the wild.

2099
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,600
Uh, yeah, it's true.

2100
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:45,280
It's true.

2101
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:46,480
It's all true.

2102
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:49,360
It's true that people do be talking different sometimes.

2103
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:52,400
People do be talking different sometimes.

2104
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:55,920
That, and that's no joke, lol.

2105
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:59,920
Uh, speaking of which, the next one is called Funny Joke.

2106
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:02,320
Warning, not a funny joke.

2107
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,040
Three, two, one, go.

2108
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,880
Hey gamers, no more funny jokes for me.

2109
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:12,080
I'm all out of them, but that did get me thinking.

2110
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:15,360
What's the funniest thing that you think you've ever done?

2111
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:17,600
That I've ever done.

2112
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:19,920
Be born.

2113
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:27,680
The funniest, I mean funny in like deliberately funny or funny in like a laugh at me kind of way.

2114
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:32,480
Um, I don't know.

2115
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,120
I mean, I dress like a freaking freak in high school.

2116
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:42,720
I wore, I wore suits all the time and I had this like weird, like this giant like creaky

2117
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,720
red leather coat that I would wear all the time.

2118
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:48,480
Uh, just the way that I, just the way that I looked in high school was probably the

2119
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,680
funniest thing I ever did.

2120
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:53,840
Honestly, if I'm, if I'm being honest, um, anything else?

2121
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:57,440
I, I can't think of like, when I was young,

2122
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,040
I was becoming a pony, becoming a pony tuber was a pretty funny thing to do.

2123
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,440
Actually, I guess that is funny.

2124
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:04,320
That might be it.

2125
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,720
Actually, an ironic pony analyst.

2126
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:10,320
Yeah, I was a little, I was a little ironic.

2127
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,360
Uh, I was less ironic, I think.

2128
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:17,200
I just liked, I just liked thinking about it and it was like a big thing at the time.

2129
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:24,560
Um, when I was young, I wasn't like into a, like a goth or or emo or any sort of

2130
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:28,320
weird thing that you look at it back in cringe,

2131
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,320
which is also almost more cringy because it's not funny.

2132
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:36,000
It's just like you were just quiet and did as you were told.

2133
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,040
And that's the cringiest possible thing, but it's not a funny cringy thing.

2134
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,200
So yeah, I guess brony analysis is probably the best thing I've done.

2135
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,760
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's a winner.

2136
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,480
That's the winner.

2137
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:49,280
Uh, um, okay.

2138
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:49,920
Next one.

2139
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:50,640
Oh my God.

2140
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:53,440
Cringus bingus bonus episode.

2141
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:56,720
Three, two, one, go.

2142
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:59,600
Hey guys, it's Kingie's penis.

2143
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,160
Here we go.

2144
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:06,960
I'm just calling because you wanted me, I listened to the last episode and you wanted

2145
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:10,560
me to talk about my feelings on pain pizza's art style.

2146
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:11,920
Yes, please.

2147
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:15,440
I remember watching some pain pizza videos back when I was in high school.

2148
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:17,760
And I liked those videos.

2149
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,240
They were fun.

2150
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,320
I watched the pain in stocking video.

2151
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:24,240
I watched, uh, that's really the only one I remember off the top of my head.

2152
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:29,120
But, um, he did a bunch of cool videos about cartoons and I liked them.

2153
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:29,760
They were good.

2154
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,280
I think his art style is okay.

2155
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:34,800
It's like very 2000s, like mid 2000s.

2156
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:37,520
It's like 2000s, but like a shitty version of it.

2157
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:38,320
It's not really my thing.

2158
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:41,680
But if you like it, then, uh, then I guess that's okay.

2159
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,920
What I hate about it is like, I see what he's going for.

2160
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:49,680
I think that I can get a bonus cring this week.

2161
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:56,080
A thing that I cringed that was, uh, was, uh, Tommy Jay, uh, that Tommy Jay guy.

2162
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:02,640
If you're listening to this, um, you don't need to send in like a billion voicemails.

2163
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:05,520
Just, they just think of one really good one every week.

2164
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:05,840
Yeah.

2165
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:07,200
Like Kringus Fingusy.

2166
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:09,280
Tommy Jay needs to be more like Kringus Fingus.

2167
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,000
We all do.

2168
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,040
That's my advice.

2169
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,960
Kringus Fingus signing off.

2170
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:13,600
Thank you.

2171
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:14,720
Kringus Fingus.

2172
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,000
Voice mail?

2173
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,920
Voice mail.

2174
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,040
Pizza Party Podcast.

2175
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,920
I think he's already in the voice mail.

2176
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:26,640
Well I wish, I wish I could put, if I could put him in there again, I would.

2177
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:33,520
Um, Um, Ben, uh, I think you missed, uh, Cluster Punk Kitchen right here.

2178
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:35,440
Oh, I did.

2179
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,160
I skipped it.

2180
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:40,080
Cause it was, it was, it had the, it was just color different cause it was played.

2181
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:40,320
Okay.

2182
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:41,680
I'll play it, I'll play it in a sec.

2183
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:43,280
But, um, okay.

2184
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:46,880
I was a little harsh before when I said I can see what he's doing. He's failing

2185
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:53,260
He doesn't always fail like I said last time. I think sometimes his art is like a passable

2186
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:57,880
Like okay. Yeah, it's that like cartoon network like, you know

2187
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:00,000
Super flat

2188
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:07,640
Style sometimes it's like it's that and I get it and it's okay and sometimes it's that but like bad and ugly and it looks terrible

2189
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:11,300
So it's not like I don't get

2190
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:18,000
It's not like I don't get what he thinks the appeal of his art is I just think that it fails to be

2191
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:25,420
Appealing in that way a lot of the time. Do you think it like it comes across as half finished like a first draft

2192
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:31,060
Something sloppy. Yeah. Yeah sloppy some a lot of the time

2193
02:17:32,780 --> 02:17:34,580
Actually, I actually to be fair

2194
02:17:34,580 --> 02:17:40,820
I actually really like the drawing of me that he did when I was on their show like that's an example

2195
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:43,340
I think when his style works and it's fine

2196
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:50,780
Because I was in it. Well, I mean, yeah, but it's a good drawing in my party

2197
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:53,780
cast Ben St

2198
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:58,440
With yeah PCP's Ben St. Oh

2199
02:18:00,180 --> 02:18:03,060
Yeah, yeah, I remember that that was a pretty good

2200
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:07,360
Yeah, it looks about like it feels good, but then I don't know

2201
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:14,920
He's a bunch of those images in his pitch. We're just like this is this is garbage. This dog shit. This is like

2202
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,160
I

2203
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:23,100
Can see what you're trying to do and it's like half working

2204
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:29,480
Okay, yeah, next one is called a cluster punk kitchen

2205
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:32,560

Am I crazy?

2225
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:11,320
Like the Nate heads the Nate heads have been radicalized it's like when Q it's like when Q got proven wrong

2226
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:15,840
It's like people were like, oh no Q was wrong. Oh, no the storm didn't happen

2227
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:20,960
Oh, no, we didn't get the day of the rope. Wait a minute. It's I've been I was already radicalized

2228
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:27,440
But now I'm super radicalized now. I've become like a mutant strain like an offspring and off growth of this movement

2229
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:30,400
I've become like a freak. I'm gonna take matters into my own hands

2230
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:38,100
So, you know pretty good pretty exciting pretty exciting developments

2231
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:44,300
They're gonna be knocking on our door again, I'm sure. Oh, yeah, so I don't think we've seen the last of

of

2245
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:15,540
The word you that you guys were discussing it is literally people mispronouncing exactly the same word

2246
02:22:15,560 --> 02:22:21,240
They were saying the same word. They just couldn't they just had an accent that made it sound different

2247
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:23,480
And that's where that word comes wrong

2248
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:29,640
You're that's not true. That's not true. What is that first of all? That's what first of all

02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,560
Yeah, it was

2251
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:40,040
Yeah, it was maybe started as that's what a bastardization is that you started as a mispronunciation and it became its own word

2252
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:42,680
Jesus that is what a

2253
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:45,160

02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:24,640
He's so close

2261
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:29,040
You thought you could hide him from us

Forgive my absence. I have news to share

2279
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:52,640
Word finally reached us that the time of revolution was at hand

2280
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:59,280
The triumvirate of jack's jesters and jokers was somewhat caught on a wares. Thus. I was all they could sin

2281
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:04,640
I was airdropped onto the capital building in the fires of uprising and my goal was

2282
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,080
Simba's

2283
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:14,640
Placing a dude live iris into the u.s. Network that would disrupt all the attempts at policy making with mark hamill as the joker

2284
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:17,120
laughing highly base-boosted

2285
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,440
Unfortunately, the plan hit a snag near immediately as I was

2286
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:28,880
Shorten the face and then rushed to a hospital where I was later arrested with a previously existing warrant out for my arrest

2287
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:34,000
I've been busy essentially clawing my way out of the intense minimum security prison

2288
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,640
They left me to rot in after all this time

2289
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:40,160
I've finally been able to check in with my base to report my failure

2290
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:46,080
But I look forward to catching up on all the news and seeing how my comrades have overthrown the oppressive

2291
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:48,880
percoise

He said that he's gonna make the server free to all rfck people

2375
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:03,920

2376
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:08,480
Uh, it is what it is and he said he's gonna do it. So he's probably gonna do it

Uh, so if you're an rfck person and you want to see the full scale, uh, mlaca calm that's being built

Like small partnerships between a couple people to uh, you know have a separate kind of uh

2406
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:17,600
Safe area for their assets of the company and their own personal assets

2407
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:22,080
So that if some asshole decides to sue them or they make a mistake

2408
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:28,400
They they're not going to get completely blown out of the fucking water with a single lawsuit and die horribly in the gutter

2409
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:37,840
Uh, I mean thanks and whoever the guy is go fuck yourself. You're an idiot. That's that's tommy j and I completely agree. Um the uh

2410
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:41,200
Yeah, I don't really understand a lot about it

2411
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:47,440
But I know yeah llcs are not big corporations and I know just because like yeah, if you're a nobody or you're just like

2412
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:51,200
Starting up a little fucking like rinky dink operation

2413
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:56,080
The thing you would apply for is is like to be an llc. That's like

2414
02:34:56,880 --> 02:35:02,960
Little shit stain companies. I think I don't know. I don't actually know how it works

2415
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:08,080
Next one is called Ben goes to Aldi three two one go

2416
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:11,440
Hey everybody, it's me Ben saying

2417
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:16,560
I'm recording this audiologue of me going to Aldi to pick up some keto bullshit

2418
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,640
And I don't go there. I order it right now. I see a black woman in the bath

2419
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:22,960
I should greet him the only way that I know how

2420
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:28,480
Shut up. Hello my negro. How are you doing today? Uh, wait, what?

2421
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:30,880
What am I saying?

2422
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:37,520
No, you'd understand. It's the formal greeting. I fuck you back me up on this. But please put the gun away

2423
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:41,920
It's um

2424
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:43,920
remember that movie um

2425
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:47,760
Fuck is it called blast from the past the the brendan frazier movie

2426
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:53,520
I don't know the one the one where he's been in like a bomb bunker since like the fifth the cold war

2427
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:58,320
And then he comes out and is like, oh, wow the world didn't end

2428
02:35:58,960 --> 02:36:00,480
and he's like

2429
02:36:00,480 --> 02:36:04,160
He's like, you know, he's got an old mindset and he's like walking down the street

2430
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:07,040
This is like when he right when he comes out of the of the bunker

2431
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:13,600
This is like the very beginning of the movie and he walks by like a black male lady and he's like well bless my stars

2432
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:15,920
a negro and she's like

2433
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Uh, huh? And um

2434
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:20,560
That's me

2435
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:22,160
That's me

2436
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:27,120
Living under a rock since world war two exactly exactly

2437
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:29,760
okay

2438
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:31,200
next one

2439
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:32,720
is uh

2440
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:34,720
Them snakes could it be?

2441
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:37,040
Could it truly be?

2442
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,760
Let's find out three two one go

2443
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:45,440
I can't it's him they suspended me on twitter

2444
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:54,080
How dare they do this to me all I wanted to do was simp for the cute snake woman

2445
02:36:54,560 --> 02:37:00,400
But I guess I can't do it anymore. I will have to simp for someone else

2446
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:04,880
That's why for the last few weeks. I have been fucking

2447
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:06,560
Nate

2448
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:08,560
That's right

2449
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:15,120
Not then snakes as well having his halls penetrated by my many snake bodies and

2450
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:17,840
Super fetuses

2451
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:26,480
It didn't even take much convincing like an eel slipped into a japanese pussy. There was very little resistance

2452
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:30,400
I hope michelle is listening to this

2453
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:35,760
Everyone doubted me but none of them thought to ask her word when

2454
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:42,720
One michelle or 28,980 snakes

2455
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:45,360
That's a lot of snakes

2456
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:51,840
The answer is queer the league of night fuckers is real and we are coming

2457
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,400
Oh, we are coming

2458
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:57,920
Nice

2459
02:37:58,480 --> 02:38:02,320
So the league of night fuckers is is a is like a group of

2460
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:04,560
voice modulated

2461
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:11,920
Villain super villains that all want to fuck Nate. I would I would describe them snakes as a sympathetic anti-hero personally

2462
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:13,760
Er true

2463
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:18,400
But I'm sure they would appreciate the villain like label it would be like epic and stuff

2464
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:20,560
um

2465
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,560
They'd be in super villain weekly

2466
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:27,760
It's just a bunch of fucking monsters. I was just a bunch of fucking monsters

2467
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:30,160

All of the high high production value all of the high production value voicemails are just nate fuckers

2469
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:40,320

Next one is from lost tapes archive number six my own tape

02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:09,760
This next tape is from myself

02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:16,400
I will clay it with my bum

2479
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:19,280

2480
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:22,240

That's quite the big package you have though. Are you sure you don't need help

2482
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:30,400

Oh, it's okay. Michelle never has to know

2484
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,600

02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:42,880

2487
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:53,600
This tape was brought to you by the league of nate fuckers as far as I like to call them the league of michelle cookers

2488
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:59,360

2489
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:03,200
Audio jungle audio jungle

2490
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:11,200

Nate is grateful for your hard proteins. The more you fuck the more he screams. This is your last chance today

2499
02:40:52,400 --> 02:40:54,400

02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:01,840

Wait what was that uh, was that uh, rule my ass batman? Yeah, I'm gonna listen again

2531
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:20,720
It sounded like him, but I am not sure

02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:29,360
A little bit. Yeah, it might be is maybe lull. Uh, well, he's not thank thank god

2533
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:34,560
He's he hasn't joined the league yet. We oh god, if rule my ass batman joins the league of nate fuckers

2534
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:36,880
It's over. It's over nate's gonna get fucked

2535
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:41,920
He can't defend him and michelle can't defend against all that power

2536
02:43:42,560 --> 02:43:43,600
um

2537
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:50,720
Okay, next one is cross emplemon new bad old good three two one go

2538
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:56,720
Someone touched on how they're phasing out of being a fan of emplemon and I couldn't agree more

2539
02:43:56,880 --> 02:44:02,640
What emplemon used to do particularly well and what I think most people came to his channel for was his ability to create a

2540
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,960
Long-form narrative about an obscure topic

2541
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:12,000
Basically, he used to tell stories and what made him so good at this was his dedication to finding every relevant detail and skill

2542
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:15,680
In creating a coherent theme out of the puzzle pieces that he digs up

2543
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:22,000
This is apparent in his connection to crab mentality in the hungry box video the supposed curse that dale urnhart had on the

2544
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:26,320
Daytona 500 track and the connection he draws between himself and leafy is here

2545
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:33,280
On the other hand his recent videos completely lack a long-form story and or details that come together to make the whole package

2546
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:37,600
Feel cohesive his video about the thing did have all those themes and messages

2547
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:42,960
But it was really more so picking apart this one movie and so it felt more like a standard video essay

2548
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:50,320
His fruit of the loom video was literally just him describing the mandela effect and acting like he was breaking new unexplored ground in

2549
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:54,720
Philosophy and sympathy for the villain has nothing connecting the media properties

2550
02:44:54,720 --> 02:45:00,240
He discusses except they have good antagonists making the whole video feel painfully surface level

2551
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:03,920
It did at least get me to watch whiplash though, which was amazing

2552
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:09,760
Yeah, I feel that analysis. That was that was a pretty good. That was a pretty good

2553
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:13,360
I feel like I completely understand now

2554
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,680
Yeah, definitely the story aspect is is lacking at least

2555
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:19,760
I I have never

2556
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:25,280
I have never watched any emp lemon. I mean if that sounds like really cool content

2557
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:28,640
um, it sounds kind of like what wang does I guess but like

2558
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,680
Better, I don't know

2559
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:33,760
Do you know wang that I

2560
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,520
Oh, wang is another guy. He makes um, you know, he'll make like a

2561
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:39,920
Sort of like a down the rabbit hole kind of thing

2562
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:46,960
But like shorter and he'll just like explain like, you know, some weird story about like, you know, some guy who

2563
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:52,080
Was misunderstood on the internet or some like artifact that was lost and what what happened to it or whatever

2564
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:54,880
Or um, you know stuff like that. Um

2565
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,200
Yeah

2566
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:58,560
yeah, the

2567
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:00,560
it's like, um, the

2568
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:03,440
The jump between talking about

2569
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:06,160
Like things that you have a

2570
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:10,320
Like a passion for and then just making videos because you are a youtuber now

2571
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:13,520
I feel like that's the stage employment is at the is at the moment

2572
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:19,040
All these things that you talked about before were like he already was into them and like

2573
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:24,000
The villain is like everyone knows what a villain is and it's it wasn't very

2574
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,680
Interesting it was just sort of like here's some I don't know

2575
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:35,120
Yeah, good and good voice mail. Good voicemail. Thanks cross. Thanks for thanks for breaking it down for me

2576
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:36,800
Uh

2577
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:42,240
Next voicemail is called one weird trick to learn Japanese quick not clickbait

2578
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:44,880
Three two one go

2579
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:48,000
Hey guys, I'm many weeks behind on the podcast

2580
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,960
But when tom was talking about learning Japanese, I thought I could give some advice

2581
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:56,800
So the best way to learn Japanese on your own is using this method on the site called refold.la

2582
02:46:57,360 --> 02:47:01,920
The gist is that the best way to learn a language is not by studying textbooks or trying to become conversational quick

2583
02:47:02,160 --> 02:47:07,840
But instead by immersion in the language. That's right. I'm talking watching anime dramas reading manga

2584
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:11,840
All those people who say you can't learn Japanese by watching anime are dead fucking wrong

2585
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:15,040
I've been learning kanji reading manga and watching anime

2586
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:20,560
I'll be it with Japanese subtitles for like six months now and I can actually understand quite a bit of the dialogue

2587
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:24,720
You could totally do the same thing for watching tokusatsu and kaiju movies and shows

2588
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:30,880
The best part is that it's free wanikani costs like 200 dollars for lifetime membership and honestly

2589
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:34,080
I don't think it works very well ganky textbooks fucking waste of your time

2590
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:39,600
You're not gonna learn Japanese by reading a textbook and Japanese classes like during kovid fucking forget about it did

2591
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:43,760
So unfortunately, it's not one weird tip to learn the language instantly

2592
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:44,960
It does take some time

2593
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:50,080
But it's worked pretty well for me and it's designed to get you experiencing content in the native language very early on

2594
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:56,240
Give it a try and uh, let me know guys. Love the podcast. Thanks. Thank you. Um wait, so

2595
02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:02,000
Is there like some more to it or is the advice just like just watch anime and you'll learn Japanese

2596
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:04,240
He said a website and

2597
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:06,400
Yeah

2598
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:08,960
I

2599
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:13,120
Might have I might have misheard

2600
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:21,440
Refold no, yeah refold dot la the roadmap to true fluency. What is this?

2601
02:48:22,880 --> 02:48:25,360
It's a step-by-step guide for learning any language from scratch

2602
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:32,960
We explain exactly how to combine media strategic study and educational technologies to achieve high level language fluency faster than any other method in the world

2603
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:39,520
Well, okay, so it's more than just it's more than just watching anime or reading. Okay, so yeah

2604
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:45,280
I guess this is like instead of just like blindly watching anime you can have like a more of a

2605
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,800
Uh a goal oriented approach to it

2606
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:51,280
Okay

2607
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:54,960
Okay, uh, I mean I I would believe that it does

2608
02:48:56,320 --> 02:49:01,600
Without knowing like exactly what the methodology of this place is I could believe that it would work

2609
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,760
but like as long as you are like

2610
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:07,520
You would need like a certain basic understanding

2611
02:49:07,840 --> 02:49:13,280
You would need to understand some a little bit of basic Japanese and like sentence structure and stuff

2612
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:18,480
And then, you know, if you're watching it and it you know, it would probably be really tedious at first

2613
02:49:18,720 --> 02:49:21,200
You you would have to be looking up words, right? Like as you

2614
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:28,000
Like as you watch and like you encounter stuff you've never seen before like you're not just gonna learn it just from seeing it

2615
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:31,520
You'd have to like stop it and be like, okay, what does that mean?

2616
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:33,280
You go look it up

2617
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:37,280
And then you're like, okay now I know and then you come back to it and now you know and and you

2618
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,920
Go like that, right?

2619
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:41,920
Like it's not just watch it

2620
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,640
uh

2621
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:51,040
Develop basic established skills tools and habits for immersion learning and then you develop basic comprehension in a narrow

2622
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:56,000
Slice and then you convert your required language to speaking ability stage four coming soon

2623
02:49:56,240 --> 02:50:03,920
Stage state the stage is stage zero refold philosophy stage one lay the foundation stage two build comprehension stage three

2624
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:06,640
Learn to speak stage four coming soon

2625
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:09,840
What could it be

2626
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:13,200
Learn to read. I don't know but yeah, that sounds interesting

2627
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:19,120
I'm not neat. Maybe I could do it with something but it's is it just about japan? No, it's a language any language

2628
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:21,200
Did you did you quit learning arabic?

2629
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:26,160
No, I I well I did quit as in that. I'm not currently doing anything about it

2630
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:32,000
Um, but yeah, I could I kind of want to continue

2631
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:35,120
Yeah, because it's it's a very cool

2632
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:40,720
Script to to like to be able to write in that would be cool. I think

2633
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:44,960
I mean it looks pretty cool. It does

2634
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,440
truly

2635
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:48,880

2638
02:50:58,480 --> 02:51:00,480
