1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So Finn and Jake set out to find a new home. It's gonna be tough for a kid and a dog on their own.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Here's a little house, off and sticking his foot in. Well, that's a bad idea, dude, cause now that bird thinks you're a chirpin.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm the best guy ever. Yeah, you said it, buddy. Hey, what's up, Davoo? You're here.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Shippadoop boop poop.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Allegedly. Munchy is here.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Hey yo, my fucking shitty ex-wife reposed my entire house besides this tub I bought in 1999.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:43,500
So now I'm recording this entire episode for my fucking tub cause my shitty ass bitch ass ex-wife took out all my fucking eyeballs.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
It's the challenge of our generation. Ben Saint is here.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
That's my name.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Oh god, no shit. No, I'm good, I'm good. Let's keep going, let's keep going.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Good, and digi bros here.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Hell yeah, nigga, reppin' that well laid and well paid. Maslow get blown the fuck out.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Before we get into the episode itself, so at the end of the last episode, as you probably heard, it's been a week since then as it happens.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,500
And so at the very end of the last episode, we talked about the new PCP merch that is available right now on two locations.

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,500
We didn't give any URLs, we didn't say what websites it was, cause that was still up for debate at the time, sort of.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,500
But it's all settled now, people, so I'm going to give you two links you can go to to buy official PCP merchandise, okay?

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Here's the first one, redbubble.com slash people slash procrastinators.

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
This is all going to be in the description, but it's there.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,500
There you can buy, it's going to be, there's the main PCP logo, you can get that on everything, shirts, mugs, whatever the fuck you want, it's all there.

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
They got a million things on Redbubble. Go buy that shit.

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,500
And the other thing is on, we've got a print all over me thing, which are the shirts that Ben had made previously.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Those are hosted there, they're a little fancier, they're more expensive, but they're better quality.

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
They're real fancy, they're there, they're all over prints, they're like, they're like luxury, they're like deluxe.

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,500
You can just be, you can just be swaddled in, in us, swaddled in PCP everywhere you go.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Basically you won't look like you have a shirt that was obviously run through a website, you know, that's an, like it's most of those shirts,

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,500
you can tell where the rectangle begins and ends, and it makes you think about the fact that it was obviously through a third party fuck shit.

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
So the print all over me thing is obviously supposed to make it not look like that, it's supposed to be like a real shirt.

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Print all over me shirts are real fucking swank and choice.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
They're great, they really are great.

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
These shirts are basically for fucking sultans only, and if you're not a sultan, then you don't get it.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Exactly, and the Redbubble, there's a more impressing announcement here about this folks.

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
On the Redbubble site, in addition to the procrastiners logo, it's not right now, but I'm going to put this up like as soon as we're recording.

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:58,500
There will be a PCP, Patreon thing, the Paceron PCP meme, that's going to be a shirt on Redbubble, and you know, you buy all the fucking items.

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
That's going up people.

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,500
We need more designs on the Redbubble, we'll make more in the future, but these, these are good.

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,500
We're going to expand this, but here's the thing, that's going up for exactly one month, and then it's going away forever,

38
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
and you will never have it ever again.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,500
It's your only chance for the history of history to get this fucking shit.

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
So you need to buy it right fucking now, there's no time to wait.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
You've only got one month.

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
You literally can't afford not to buy it.

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Exactly.

44
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:35,500
This shirt, or mug, or fanny pack, or bikini top, will pay for itself ten times over.

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,500
It's so true, and just as the old Patreon logo is going away,

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,500
that's why this is going away, and it will be replaced with a vastly shittier new PCP Patreon logo

47
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,500
that will be the only thing you can buy, so you'll be condemned to that fate if you don't act fast.

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It will truly capture the shittiness that is the new Patreon logo.

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,500
We'll just distill it down to its shitty essence for you.

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,500
We're going to pay them extra to spit on every piece of merchandise that that comes with, so, you know, just gear up for that.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Guys, I'm going to level with you, if you don't get this, the classic PCP Patreon shirt,

52
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm going to make your wife bear it.

53
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm going to take out her new shirt, and she's not going to be able to bear your children.

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm just going to level with you, I'm just going to level with you right now.

55
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Redbubble's a pretty, it's a good website.

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
The shirts are actually pretty good at you, but there you go.

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Okay, folks, when we open the store, you can stop asking, you now have PCP merch, it's real, it's official, go buy it all.

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Now let's get into the actual episode.

59
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Yeah.

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Homes and Homelessness.

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Homes and Homestuck.

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Yeah.

63
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh my God.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
What do you mean this isn't the Homestuck podcast?

65
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Fuck it, I'm out of here.

66
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I didn't even think of that connection, it's just going to be homestucked the entire time.

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
You crushed your mind.

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
So here's the urban dictionary definition of homes, plural.

69
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh wait, no, this is terrible, let's go, okay, home, here we go, home.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
A place where I can poop for however long I desire.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah.

72
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,500
In the description, I had dinner at Taco Bell and then I went home and spent the rest of the night on the crapper.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Well, all right, that's fine.

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Very descriptive.

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Let's see what we've got for Homeless.

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Okay, Homeless.

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,500
When one has exhausted all resources and reduced to the insane condition of toting a small travel bag,

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:33,500
aimlessly riding buses, selling plasma, knotting out in public libraries, standing in welfare lines, eating in soup kitchens,

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,500
walking in a dream, sleeping in shelters and parks, worrying about the next fix,

80
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,500
and knowing that going to jail is a step up in the social ladder.

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Jesus Christ, that was descriptive and accurate.

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
It was pretty accurate.

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I appreciate the thoroughness.

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
All right, let's get into it.

85
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
So who's got a home?

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Me.

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Not not.

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Ben's?

89
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Why is Ben here?

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
It's me.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
No, I live in a house now.

92
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I live in a house.

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
It's amazing.

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Jesus Christ.

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
He's moving up in the world.

96
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:10,500
I've lived in a house and it's really nice and you should all move to my city and be my real life buddy friends.

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Before we go into this, first we should have a show of hands or say I.

98
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Who all has lived in a house?

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I?

100
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
I?

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Yeah, okay.

102
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
So that's literally everyone?

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I have not.

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Wait, what?

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Only ever lived in an apartment.

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Who has been homeless before in here?

107
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
What?

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
No one?

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Not us.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Has been what?

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Homeless?

112
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Yeah.

113
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Have you ever been homeless, Ben?

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
No, no.

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
That was a vagabond for a while.

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I wasn't a couch surfer or something.

117
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:47,500
No, I did like travel across Europe for a couple months, but I did technically have a home in Poland.

118
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:59,500
The room that I was staying at in Poland, I kept renting it for that time, but it was such a shit pile that it cost me five bucks a day to keep it technically owning it.

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
So I did technically have a home to go back to.

120
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I just was like staying in hostels for several months there.

121
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, you know, a home is where the heart is.

122
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,500
So I would say that Ben is sort of an internal homeless man, just for the lack of substance within him.

123
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
This is for the lack of soul in general.

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Yeah, because I have no heart to put anywhere, therefore I cannot have a home by definition.

125
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,500
But similar to that, my mother called me brutal the other day and I just won.

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
How is that related at all?

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
A lot.

128
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
He's talking about how you had no heart.

129
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I just wanted to say it.

130
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
That's right.

131
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
That's it is important, though.

132
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Yeah, Jesse is the one who has been homeless for some period of time, living in his car, I think.

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
So it would have been nice to hear from him, but he's dead, so what can we do?

134
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
He's off celebrating his birthday.

135
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Everybody wish Jesse a happy birthday.

136
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
A happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday.

137
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Okay, fucking homes.

138
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I hate not being alive.

139
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I think you can all agree I want to continue being alive and homes are a great way to do that.

140
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,500
You do still have a unique perspective here, so you grew up in like an apartment or something?

141
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Yeah, I've never been in a house ever.

142
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Well, I mean, I've been inside of one.

143
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
But I've never lived inside of one ever.

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Okay, are we making a distinction between home and house here?

145
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
No.

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
We all have homes.

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Well, yeah, but what I'm saying is house is different than apartment, and those are both homes.

148
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
It's like an umbrella term.

149
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
It's not like sandwich in that way.

150
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah, it's vague.

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
You don't know it.

152
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
You can't define it, but you know it when you see it.

153
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Exactly.

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,500
But it is different because I'm not a houseboy, so I don't know the luxuries that come with owning a house.

155
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,500
How have you gotten away with being as loud as you are in an apartment?

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I know what you made, did you?

157
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I was quiet as they come, bro.

159
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I moved into an apartment, you know, like two years ago or whatever when I moved out to Cincinnati.

160
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
And yeah, like it's always been an issue having to be quiet when I'm recording shit.

161
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Now granted, it's not just that you live in an apartment, but you also live in a shitty run down shack of an apartment.

162
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Oh, mine?

163
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh yeah, that's true.

164
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Who are you talking to?

165
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
That's true for mine as well.

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
In this case, it's me.

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I would bet money that mine is significantly worse than wherever you currently reside.

168
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Probably.

169
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
I make it nice.

170
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Do you get noise complaints, Monty, at all?

171
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Well, no.

172
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,500
There was one time where someone threatened to call the cops just because they thought that I was literally dying.

173
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Okay.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
You better stop dying or I'm going to call the cops.

175
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
How is that a threat?

176
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Well, you know how it is.

177
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
You never want the cops involved because they've got guns.

178
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
They will kill you with the slays.

179
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Just stop all your health problems.

180
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Monty's not quite white enough to be safe from that shit.

181
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,500
The thing about my neighbors is that I'm fairly certain that literally every single one is a drug dealer.

182
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I'm fairly certain about this.

183
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
They're all up at weird hours of the night.

184
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,500
And the way in my apartment setup, there's like a window to my left here and I can see into like a house that's next to the apartment complex.

185
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
And that person always mows their lawn at exactly around 3 a.m.

186
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
And also they look like they're stumbling over.

187
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
What the fuck?

188
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
How did they get away with that?

189
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
That's literally dark out.

190
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
You cannot see what you're doing.

191
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Yeah.

192
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Yes, I know.

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Not to mention literally waking up everyone.

194
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Yeah.

195
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Yeah.

196
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
I guess that's why Monty doesn't get complaints because he just planes right in.

197
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Yeah.

198
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
That's very true.

199
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
I know I've talked about it.

200
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
That's like the most...

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,500
It would literally have to be entirely full of psychopaths for this to be able to happen.

202
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Yeah.

203
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,500
For not one person in the apartment to put a stop to it, that would be insanity.

204
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I live in an apartment where it's like this.

205
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,500
If I pay my rent on time, I'm like an exemplary tenant.

206
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm like way ahead of the curve here.

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,500
So when I get noise complaints, what they usually amount to, it's not like they talk to the manager or anything,

208
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,500
I just get an intense pounding on one of my walls and then I know it's time to be quiet.

209
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,500
There are shitloads of studies that show that living in an apartment basically deprives you of humanity and dignity.

210
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Studies show that people who live in apartments are 72% more gullible.

211
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Gullible?

212
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
What are you trying to say about me, dude?

213
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Well, I grew up in a house, so I'm bringing class to this joint.

214
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
That's what I'm doing.

215
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Yeah.

216
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I was trying to hit us with a fake stat and that was the joke is that it's gullible.

217
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Yeah, it's one of those gullible results.

218
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Well, I didn't call for it.

219
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I didn't call for it.

220
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Shit.

221
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Only munchy fell for it.

222
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Yeah, I looked up on the ceiling and said, you're adopted.

223
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Okay, let's talk about this.

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Who aspires to be a homeless vagabond?

225
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Me.

226
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Oh, me.

227
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Me.

228
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I personally was always, see, having grown up in a house and having only known people that lived in houses,

229
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,500
you know, like a bunch of cucks, I always just assumed it was the thing that you do, you know, like going to college.

230
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Of course, it's just the thing that you do.

231
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,500
But like going to college later on in life, I like, I came, I saw what it's like.

232
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I saw what apartments are like and I think I always was like, wow, why does anyone fucking bother with a house?

233
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,500
It seems like such a hassle when you can just pay some money and live in a place and not have to buy it.

234
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
You know what I'm saying?

235
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I don't know.

236
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
It's like that.

237
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:40,500
When I understood that I could just go out and just like get an apartment, I thought it was nice.

238
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
And I was like, I'd be fine with this.

239
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I would be okay with this.

240
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Well, the funny thing about it is I think that the attachment to houses and everything is very much a good old American dream thing.

241
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Like it's very much our fathers and their fathers' generations desire to like own their own land and be like, oh, I am my own man with my own land

242
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
and I can do whatever I want and I build this super beautiful house.

243
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,500
But then the funny thing is they all follow like the same blueprint of what they want it to be.

244
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Like the idea is, oh, I get my own place.

245
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I do whatever I want with and then you just make it look exactly like any other house that you saw in a fucking catalog on HGTV.

246
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I mean, ultimately home ownership, it is like a better deal in the long run.

247
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,500
So like I guess ideally, no, you don't want to live in an apartment forever.

248
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
If you buy a house, you save more money in the long run.

249
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:42,500
But if it would be, if all else being equal, I don't mind the idea of living in an apartment, I think it's fine.

250
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Let me sell you on this right now because I don't really care about living in an apartment right now.

251
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Economically, it is fine with me to live in an apartment.

252
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:00,500
But like the recording thing is an issue and I need a place to build a studio where I can record at any time I want to

253
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
and I know exactly what I'm going to get.

254
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
There will be no disturbances.

255
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I need that.

256
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
So like if you could like live in an apartment and like rent a studio, that's fine.

257
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
But then you're just renting two things.

258
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,500
So like Ben was saying, if you can get yourself a house and get yourself the exact kind of setup you want

259
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
with just what you need there and nothing extra.

260
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You're not wasting your money on a billion dollar mansion or something.

261
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Just something with the essentials.

262
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
That to me seems like really good.

263
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Plus the fact that you have your own space.

264
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
If you can get a little distance away from other people, that seems nice.

265
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,500
But I just want the ability to do shit in my own place and not have to be concerned that I'm bothering other people.

266
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Like throw a party with a lawn or something.

267
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
You know, just that seems like a nice thing to do sometimes.

268
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I want to talk about that all American in parentheses dad dream of having a house, having your own land and stuff is that

269
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,500
statistically speaking, there's going to be a conflict of interest within yourself regarding time management.

270
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Because if you're that kind of guy, you're probably also a guy who works a lot.

271
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
A guy who wants to make lots of money, right?

272
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,500
And in the case of my dad, right, he's really proud of this house that he's gotten for his family.

273
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
He put a lot of work into obtaining the house.

274
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,500
But he scarcely puts the amount of time that he knows he needs to put into, maintain the house to keep it even slightly livable.

275
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Because he's always working all the time.

276
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
My mom is always busy doing things, barely has time for anything.

277
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
And I'm the same way.

278
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Like, I don't really like doing anything other than just focus on one single very specific goal of what is my job that makes me money.

279
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
And I wish just everything else in my life just cleaned and fixed itself.

280
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It's like they say you gotta...

281
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Did you just like put a fan next to your microphone or something?

282
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Well, there's been a fan on.

283
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Oh, it just suddenly got really loud.

284
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:48,500
How come Benz gets to have a fan on and I fucking don't even though I need it more than he does because I live in California?

285
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Benz lives in Atlanta.

286
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
It's real hot here.

287
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I mean, I'm going to noise filter all of it out in the final recording.

288
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Okay, Ben, what were you recording something?

289
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
What was the saying?

290
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Well, I was just going to say it's like, well, now it's not funny.

291
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I was going to humorously subvert a common cliche and say, you know what they say, get busy working or get busy dying.

292
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,500
But now the timing is off and I would have been legendary.

293
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
It would have been legendary.

294
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Anyways, yeah, with what Davoo was saying, my dad is a big time house guy.

295
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,500
He's, you know, we've owned several houses, never like paid one off all the way or anything.

296
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,500
The house I'd been living in up until just recently was a fucking gigantic house where we had Radcon.

297
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,500
We'd been in there for nine years, but parents have done countless fucking things to it and they never stopped tinkering with it.

298
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:47,500
And like my dad, his basically the way he lives is like he works on weekdays and then comes home and he doesn't do anything to the house.

299
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,500
But on all of his weekends, it's just like obsessive house maintenance.

300
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Okay, let me do everything I can to this house.

301
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:02,500
But it's never like he doesn't necessarily have the best priorities when it comes to fixing the house because sometimes you got to fix something that's broken.

302
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Sometimes you're trying to add something new on and it's like this constant battle of like you want the new thing, but then the old things breaking down and you just got to, like the house is never perfect.

303
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
It's been nine years and the house is still far from perfect.

304
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Yeah, it's never fucking finished.

305
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Like when I moved in to this house for the first time a couple years ago, it was like that was when I was full force making videos and stuff.

306
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,500
So like I was just spending all my time getting home from window cleaning and then working on editing.

307
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,500
And it was literally almost a year before I started like seriously unpacking 80% of my fucking boxes.

308
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Because it's just like whenever do I want to do these Mamby Pamby house maintenance things.

309
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I never get around to it.

310
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I just want to like find a maid who I can really trust.

311
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You know, that's just all I really need in life.

312
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
That is exactly the right attitude.

313
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Okay, let me let me drop a red pill bomb on this.

314
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
It's going to offend lots of people give a shit about their houses.

315
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Despite the fact that I like the idea of having a house is just like a place you live in.

316
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
All these people I spent, I see on like every day as I'm driving out summertime, everyone's out working on their lawn.

317
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
They're out doing things.

318
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
They're out there out fixing up shit.

319
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
All these people spending on their time doing that shit.

320
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
I see as people who have given up on their real dreams.

321
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
They're now filling the hole in their life with maintaining their fucking lawn and designing their house.

322
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Why don't you like, okay, like I spend my time pursuing like a second career full time.

323
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
That's how I spend all of my life.

324
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
And when I just think about like how much time, guys like, and this is my dad.

325
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I love my dad.

326
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
He's the best man in the world.

327
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,500
But when I think about all the fucking time he's devoted to caring for his goddamn lawn.

328
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm sure he really cares about it.

329
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,500
But for fuck's sake, you could have literally built like he wants to do be like a car sale or not a car sale.

330
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
He was thinking about during his life starting a car dealership.

331
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm like, think about all the time you could have devoted into like the side dream you have had.

332
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
You could have done that if you hadn't just worked on your fucking lawn so much.

333
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
We need to consolidate work.

334
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
We need to have specialists who go around entire towns.

335
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
They're the ones in charge of maintaining the lawn.

336
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
They're most efficient at it.

337
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
They're the best at it.

338
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
You tell them what you want and we stop this shit about people maintaining their own lawns.

339
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
It's a waste of time.

340
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
The whole time sink aspect of it.

341
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:16,500
It's always like that's part of why I never was that was like an apartment doesn't sound so bad because a house carries with it all this maintenance shit and especially lawn shit.

342
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Like if I ever did own a house, I would really be a big deal to me that there would be no lawn.

343
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:32,500
You guys go the whole self-help book for success tip of you are a bucket full of rocks and you could fill yourself up with big rocks and small rocks.

344
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
You guys all know this metaphor.

345
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Basically the idea is you're a bucket.

346
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Everyone's a bucket.

347
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Say it right now.

348
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I am a bucket.

349
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I am a bucket.

350
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
I am a bucket.

351
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Yeah.

352
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
And you could fill yourself up with fucking rocks.

353
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
And big rocks are your dream.

354
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Wanting to start a family, wanting to become a businessman, wanting to become a billionaire, trillionaire, whatever.

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Then small rocks are things like maintaining your lawn or things like making sure like you're perfectly fucking shaved every day or things like talking to each of your friends every day.

356
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,500
And the thing about rocks, the thing about like fucking physics and shit is that if you put all the small rocks in first, there is barely enough room for big rocks.

357
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,500
But if you put all the big rocks in first, the little tiny ass pebbles just find their way around.

358
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,500
The little pebbles bounce in and out of the big rocks and there's ends up being enough room for everything if you put the big rocks in first.

359
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,500
And I remember my dad giving me this lecture and he very much prioritizes his time like this.

360
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Like he, this is a man who was never able to get into video games no matter how much they casualized themselves.

361
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:41,500
The whole Facebook Wii generations came and went and he was like, I can't justify, I can't find a video game that I can enjoy spending time with my family whilst playing so I'm not playing video games, right?

362
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
That's the only thing my dad will do.

363
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Anything that either promotes his business or helps his family or the only two things he can justify doing with his life.

364
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
And I feel similarly.

365
00:20:50,500 --> 00:21:00,500
That makes a lot of sense and I think that what I was going to say after that point is that I do understand that guys like my dad as well, like he clearly has his priorities straight.

366
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
And for him doing the lawn stuff is I think a form of relaxation.

367
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
It's what he does when he's not worried about his business or paying the bills and stuff.

368
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
So I get it but I still see that as wasted time and I don't care for it.

369
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
For me that's washing dishes, working in the kitchen, that's my relaxation time.

370
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,500
This is coming at a good time. I just got my first place.

371
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:27,500
And I've kind of found the perfect middle ground that does, this is what you need.

372
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,500
You need a townhouse because it is the perfect interstice of everything you're talking about.

373
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Okay, so I was really worried when getting a place.

374
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
I was worried that an apartment would have the problem yours has of noise complaints.

375
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I work all night into the dead of night. I do podcasts. I do raps. I'm loud.

376
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I need to have space where people aren't going to give me noise complaints constantly.

377
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
A place like yours I would not be able to do it.

378
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:01,500
But staying in some of the other apartments that I guested in, we got away with a little bit more loudness because they were just a little bit more open.

379
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I had thicker walls and stuff, just better apartments.

380
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,500
And it made me realize, okay, it's not like I need to be an entire yard away from someone else.

381
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I just need one that's like as a center of the house, whereas yours doesn't really have anywhere that's not surrounded.

382
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Yeah, that's right.

383
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,500
So a townhouse, you have nobody above and below you, so that's taken care of.

384
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
You've only got people on your sides.

385
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,500
The way that mine is organized, they're not quite exactly directly next to each other on one side.

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
So I've got my office set up and it's a split.

387
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
So there's an upstairs and a downstairs.

388
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,500
And the way it's organized is perfect.

389
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
It's just big enough that I can do my recording in here.

390
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
There's space for multiple people, but it's small enough that you can take care of it all really easily.

391
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Cleaning the whole house takes less than an hour because it's so fucking tiny.

392
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
And deep cleaning it would take no time at all.

393
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
But here's the best part.

394
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I've got a lawn, a front yard and a back yard, and the townhouse takes care of it.

395
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Because it's all one giant yard that we all share.

396
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,500
So while there is a little chunk of it that's like, this is my yard.

397
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,500
It's all just one big shared yard and they just have yard maintenance people go around every couple of days

398
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,500
and they even fucking mulch the shit.

399
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
And they completely maintain the yards, like front and back.

400
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
It's pristine at all times and I never have to touch it.

401
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,500
And that's so fucking important to me for exactly the reason you're describing.

402
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Like, I maximize all my time.

403
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:41,500
This past week has just sailed by for me because all of my time has either been spent making videos or fucking my girlfriend.

404
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
And those are the only two things that I want to be doing.

405
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,500
I don't want to have to stop doing either of those to go fucking clean the yard for an hour.

406
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I realize the real difference here between these guys like our dads and ourselves.

407
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,500
And it's that, you know, at least they're later part of their lives when we knew them, when they're like established and they're all that shit.

408
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Like, they're now thinking of like, they do have time in their lives when they choose to just not really do work, you know?

409
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Like, they have already put in the work. They have now made it.

410
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
They've got a giant house or, you know, they've got a house. They've got a family.

411
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
It's time to relax a little bit. The hustle has been done.

412
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:26,500
I totally want that life. Like, I want to get to a point where I don't feel this constant pressure to fucking make videos at literally all times.

413
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,500
But all I want, I don't want to free that time up so I can mow the lawn.

414
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I want to free that time up so I can play a video game.

415
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
That's all I want.

416
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,500
My big dream right now is that I can play a video game ever. That is my big dream.

417
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,500
I never want to get to that point because for me, life is struggle and when the struggle is over, you might as well die.

418
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Exactly. But I suppose there's a degree.

419
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Well, I feel like I want to have relaxation periods just because I see people who burn themselves out.

420
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Even if they have energy, they eventually become hacks because they became artists every day, 24 hours a day to the point that they lost their humanity and forgot.

421
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Which is why my plan after I finish my freaking video game is to then move to Atlanta and then be a friend guy who goes out with friends.

422
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
And then take a couple words off.

423
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Ben, I refuse to believe that you don't spend any time just playing a video game for no reason.

424
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,500
No, no, no, no. I'm not saying there's no need for leisure ever.

425
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:30,500
But I never want to hit a point where I'm like, I'm done with work. I won't pursue anything else.

426
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,500
It's time to just relax. It's time to just take the rest of my life easy.

427
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I mean this on more of a day by day basis.

428
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:48,500
What I admire is the ability to like, okay, I worked for eight hours and now I get to play video games and not work.

429
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,500
That's not how I've been living. I've been living a 24 hour work cycle for the last year.

430
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,500
The people I admire most are those who minimize that kind of time.

431
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Digi fucking your girlfriend doesn't count as work. I'm sorry to disappoint you.

432
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Well, that's my first escape from work.

433
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Right. Well, because for me, it's all about like, if I'm not doing work, then there's the moment I walk away from the computer.

434
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
There is a timer I hear in my head that goes off.

435
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Maybe even with the fucking Metroids now.

436
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
And so like, I haven't shut that thing off for five fucking years.

437
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Like ever since I was like 18 and a half and I finally got a good work ethic, I haven't stopped yet.

438
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I know I'm going to have to force myself to take a break at some point to renew that passion because I know it's going to run out at some point.

439
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Excuse me.

440
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
God damn.

441
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Um, okay, okay.

442
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Should we talk about our deal house? Because I don't think, are any of us in like the best house?

443
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Fuck yes.

444
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
No, definitely not. I'm pretty close.

445
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Oh, okay. Yeah, my ideal house, and it is a house, or you know, town house I guess, whatever.

446
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Like one room.

447
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
I hate big houses. I would never ever want to be in a big house ever.

448
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Well, I fucking hate them.

449
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
What kind of big house is that?

450
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Hang on, this is Munchie's time. Why?

451
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
This is Munchie's time.

452
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Because I'm a little boy and I want to be in a little house.

453
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I don't need to have, I don't need to have separate rooms.

454
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Mika, you are six and a half feet tall. You ain't no little boy.

455
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I'm a little boy.

456
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
In this future world, do you live alone?

457
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Munchie is the littlest boy I know, you piece of shit.

458
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,500
No, Munchie is the babyest boy I know, but he ain't the littlest boy I know.

459
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
He's a big baby boy.

460
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Are you alone in this place? Do you live alone in this place?

461
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Well, okay, ideally I would want to be with two people.

462
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Like each of our, like my section would be the small section.

463
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Because I want, my ideal is just my room, then a bathroom, and then a kitchen.

464
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Maybe, no, that's it, that's it, that's all I want.

465
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I don't want anything else.

466
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I just want to be able to walk up, walk maybe three feet and be at my refrigerator.

467
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I don't want to like do anything.

468
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,500
I want to live the fucking 3,000 pound man life, have all my characters do everything for me.

469
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
But no, no, like, because I just fucking hate-

470
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Did you say your characters or your caretakers?

471
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Caretakers, my characters. The Undertale 587 is going to win.

472
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah.

473
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
In this fantasy world I'm constructing for results.

474
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Yeah, I live in a house, and my OC's just take care of me, and they are my friends.

475
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
And you're in your room, and you hear a knock on the door.

476
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,500
You're like, who is it? You're like, it is me, the Japanese.

477
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Today's anime is breakfast in bed.

478
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Oh, Jesus Christ.

479
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Oh, he's a wonderful man to love.

480
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:52,500
But yeah, okay, this stems from me living upstairs, and every single day I walk downstairs,

481
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,500
I get something, then I walk back upstairs and I realize, I forgot my fucking phone downstairs.

482
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
No! No!

483
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,500
So I have to walk back downstairs, I have to walk downstairs, and I have to walk back upstairs again,

484
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,500
and that's like 30 seconds waste where I could have been getting a sick fucking frag in Quake Live, bro!

485
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I'm drinking that fucking Game of the Seed!

486
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
I hear that, my dude.

487
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Do you relate to not even wanting to be seen at all when you're walking through?

488
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Sometimes I'll take the long way into the kitchen, yeah.

489
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Well, when I was younger and more stressed out, yeah.

490
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
That's amazing.

491
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I did during the most shameful time of my life, that's not even true,

492
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:40,500
but during one of the most shameful times of my life, I was doing the classic Hikikomori technique of P-Bottle.

493
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Pissing?

494
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Yeah, man!

495
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,500
But the reason why was fear of being seen by the people that I lived with.

496
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Oh, that's when you were in California, right?

497
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,500
No, not in California, it was when I was in Somerville,

498
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,500
but it was when I was in that place that was like, it had gotten like,

499
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,500
the lease had been terminated and the landlord had been like, get out,

500
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
and we had challenged the landlord and been like, you can't just kick us out.

501
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,500
So we took it to court, so during the six months it was in court,

502
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
nobody was paying rent and we just squatted there.

503
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Sick!

504
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
It was legendary, but the point is that-

505
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
And they were ashamed of being seen by them?

506
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Well, they were kind of a bunch of, I didn't, you know-

507
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Assholes who won't pay rent?

508
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Some of them were a little terrible and I would try to avoid them.

509
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
So yes, for a while I was just like, I'm just going to keep my head down

510
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,500
and pee in bottles in my room and let God sort the rest out.

511
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I need to make this point, this is very important and it occurred to me

512
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
because I just went to take a piss.

513
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,500
If you, this goes to everyone in this call and elsewhere,

514
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm just letting you know, if you live in a situation

515
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
where you have to put on pants to go to the bathroom,

516
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
you're living your fucking life wrong, alright?

517
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,500
This is everyone needs to be your life goal and I'll tell you why,

518
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,500
because for the longest time I had, you know, when I was living in my parents' house

519
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
that whole nine years I had my own room that had its own bathroom

520
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,500
so I never had to worry about this, like it basically was like I was living in my own apartment.

521
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
But when I came back to my parents' house for a week,

522
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
when they had moved back in and they'd given shade my old room

523
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,500
and it was me and my girlfriend who was staying at my house for a week

524
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
and we have to leave the room to go to the bathroom.

525
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,500
So of course we're naked constantly in my room

526
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
and we have to put on clothes every single time we want to go to the fucking bathroom.

527
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm telling you right now, Digi, this is not going to become the Digi's girlfriend podcast.

528
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
This is extremely important now to the fucking point.

529
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
You motherfuckers, you weird anti-girlfriend fucking,

530
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
you're like an anti-sacrifice.

531
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Thank you Digi, thank you for finally saying it.

532
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Somebody had to say it.

533
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,500
It's extremely important to the point about homes,

534
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
because the whole reason I got a place is to live with my girlfriend

535
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
and it was so shit.

536
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
And he goes on about, oh, we're naked all the time.

537
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Let's hear more about that, so everyone wants to hear.

538
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Yeah, I'm not fucking bragging about it, Nate.

539
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,500
It's just the situation is that you have to put on your clothes to go to the bathroom.

540
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
That is fucking bullshit.

541
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,500
If you're covered in fucking sex funk and you want to wash yourself off,

542
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
you got to put on all your clothes just to go to the fucking bathroom

543
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
because your fucking parents are right down the hall

544
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
and you don't want them to see you naked or smell you

545
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,500
or have anything to do with you when you were just fucking.

546
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
So you got to walk to the bathroom, it's a fucking nightmare.

547
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Having your own place, nobody has to wear clothes ever, it's fucking perfect.

548
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I'm telling you, this is how you should be living your life.

549
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Thank you, thank you for that delightful story that I deeply appreciate

550
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
and I'm glad you told them its entirety.

551
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
The problem is it's fundamentally wrong

552
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,500
because I literally prefer wearing clothes than not wearing clothes.

553
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Nate, okay, okay, I have a counterpoint to that.

554
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I would rather die than not be wearing clothes.

555
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Nate, if you're going to have a fucking humble bragging,

556
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500
do you realize that you're basically part of the hashtag proud

557
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
and happy with my body club right here?

558
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Maybe you should check your fucking physicality privileges.

559
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
I don't understand what you're saying.

560
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Actually, that's opposite logic.

561
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Fuck, I got my logic backwards.

562
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
No, don't get me wrong.

563
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,500
I like wearing clothes too, but I like wearing underwear.

564
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm not a fan of wearing pants, but the problem is not...

565
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Did you? Did you?

566
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I wear shorts.

567
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
They're comfy and easy to wear.

568
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah, I did it.

569
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
I wear shorts and all the time.

570
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
The problem is not like...

571
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
The problem isn't the wearing of the clothes.

572
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,500
It's having to put clothes on just to go to the bathroom

573
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
and then take them back off when you get back to your room.

574
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,500
It's just having to go through an extra process to do something.

575
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
One time when I was like 16,

576
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
my family finally moved out of a house that only had one bathroom

577
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,500
between the five of us to finally having three bathrooms.

578
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
I was basically the only one that used this bathroom

579
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
and I was the only one that stayed in my room.

580
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
My brother had the same bathroom, but he was almost never there.

581
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
So basically, I had a bathroom all to myself

582
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
where no one would ever be able to hear me.

583
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
No one would see me up here, because I was the only one up here.

584
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,500
And just my bladder and bowel shrink drastically over the next year

585
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,500
because I finally wasn't holding it in all the fucking time, right?

586
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Like, oh my God.

587
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Daveau, you and Ben...

588
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Imagine what the diaper lifestyle would do to that.

589
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah!

590
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,500
No imagining needed, brother.

591
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
I have no idea how Daveau, Ben and Victor

592
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
managed to share that middle bathroom in the house for eight months.

593
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Very carefully.

594
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Oh, I think I may have mentioned this in a hi-joon podcast.

595
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
I had to hold my poop in on multiple occasions.

596
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
That would have been fucking insane.

597
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I just had my toothbrush and all my toiletries in my bedroom closet

598
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,500
because I knew that I don't want other people's poop particles flying all over the place.

599
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
You know what I mean?

600
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
I don't want that.

601
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Yeah.

602
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Whenever I needed something, I would take it from the closet.

603
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
That makes sense.

604
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
That makes sense.

605
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I legit have never...

606
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Like, I never appreciated how much I wanted my own place

607
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
until I was forced out of that room.

608
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Like, again, the room I was in might as well have been an apartment.

609
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Like, I only had to come downstairs to go to the kitchen or to leave the house

610
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
and everyone else was so far away.

611
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
It really felt like I was on my own.

612
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Being put into the middle of the house for just one week

613
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
was like abject horror for me.

614
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Like, I hated it.

615
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
It was so bad because you could hear people talking all over the house.

616
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,500
I can't record if I hear someone talking in the distance.

617
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Like, if I'm worried that they're going to come in here

618
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,500
and interrupt my recording or something.

619
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Stuff like that tries to be insane.

620
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I really need a lot of space for the people in that space

621
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
to understand what I'm doing.

622
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,500
I hate the idea of I'm at home, so my mom doesn't know I'm recording

623
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
or she doesn't know how long the recording lasts.

624
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
So she comes, oh Conrad, what is going on?

625
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
God damn it, I'm in the middle of some shit.

626
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,500
The whole living with families, all the fucking stress of living with families stuff.

627
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I think I found a cheat for it, which is that if you move away from your family's house easily

628
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
and you could still afford to do so,

629
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
but of your own volition through financially good ideas,

630
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,500
you realize and decide to just move back in your family's house temporarily,

631
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
all that stress magically isn't there.

632
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
At least that was the case with me.

633
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Because I moved back in with my family.

634
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,500
The room I'm living in now is not the room I was living in before.

635
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Because I used to live up in another room that was basically an apartment just like Digi's room.

636
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,500
But now I'm living in a room that's just across the hallway from where my parents live.

637
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,500
And for some reason, the fact that I felt like I was doing this out of my own volition

638
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,500
with all this agency made me not get stressed out about it.

639
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,500
It used to be if I'm down in the kitchen and anyone else is in the kitchen,

640
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
I have this fucking death glare at them of like,

641
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I don't want to be in the kitchen at the same time as someone else.

642
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,500
But now it's like, man, I reach for a spoon at the same time you reach for a fork

643
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,500
and we have to make a slight grunt at one another because we're in the same general place.

644
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I don't want to kill myself now.

645
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I'm just going to say, if you ever live in a situation where you're afraid of encountering the people you live with,

646
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I think that you have a problem that needs to be sorted out.

647
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
I don't know exactly what it is.

648
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Don't worry, there's other defense mechanisms.

649
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,500
For example, the absolutely dreaded, what are you looking for?

650
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
You know, when you're like going through the shelves looking for a thing and you're just like,

651
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
my mom's going to say, what are you looking for?

652
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I don't want her to know what I'm looking for.

653
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
It doesn't literally matter though.

654
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I just don't want her to know.

655
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
And so you know what I would do to deflect that?

656
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,500
I'd be like, every shelf I open, I'm going to be like, oh, sweet, that shelf is exactly what I want.

657
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Ooh, this shelf has what I want too, so that no one thinks I'm looking for anything.

658
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I'm just like constantly happy when I'm looking around the shelf.

659
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Oh, sweet.

660
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
I'm totally with you.

661
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm totally with you on that.

662
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I hate when people get involved in my business and I don't want them to be,

663
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
which is great because I've been living on my own for a couple years now and it's great.

664
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,500
But the time in my life when I was, I did this for a while too.

665
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,500
After I left college and was living at home and was just doing shitty jobs,

666
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,500
and I think it might have been even before I started doing YouTube-y stuff,

667
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,500
I was paying rent to my parents, but they would always be on me to be working harder,

668
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,500
to finish my degree, just go do the things that you obviously need to be doing,

669
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
that I would do to some small degree but not nearly enough.

670
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
So all the time, this is a big pattern for me throughout my life.

671
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,500
When there are people that I need to do things for and I'm not living up to the obligations I've made to them,

672
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,500
I will just avoid them, which is a common thing that all people do.

673
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,500
So for me, this was completely, I would avoid contact with my parents as much as physically possible

674
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,500
to the point of never ever seeing them and never leaving my room.

675
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,500
But it was entirely because I was not doing the things that I needed to do.

676
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,500
It was entirely my fault that I was making the situation shitty.

677
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
And I'm just saying that I see a lot of that on other people.

678
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
If there's something you're trying to avoid by not seeing people,

679
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
generally you're going to be better off addressing them.

680
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,500
The reason why I was peeing in bottles is because the people that I lived with at the time,

681
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,500
it was a bit of a rogues gallery, but one of them was like super OCD.

682
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
And if he happened to catch a glimpse of you,

683
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,500
not OCD, he was bipolar.

684
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,500
And if he happened to catch a glimpse of you while you were walking through the room,

685
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,500
while he was in a manic episode, he would rope you into some complete fucking nonsense.

686
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
There were multiple occasions where I would just be walking through and he'd be like,

687
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Ben, can you help me? We need to rearrange this furniture.

688
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
He can't stay like this.

689
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Ben, have I met this guy?

690
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
No, no, you have not met this guy.

691
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
But he was...

692
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
No, no, no, I just want to say.

693
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
And then we would move furniture for two hours and he would be like,

694
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
yeah, we need to move this couch upstairs.

695
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
And then two weeks later, he would catch you again and he'd be like,

696
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
okay, we got to move furniture again.

697
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
And then we would move it back.

698
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
So I just wanted to avoid that so much.

699
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I'm with you on that, Ben.

700
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
But really, that's a surface level issue.

701
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,500
The deeper problem is you had put yourself in a situation where you were living with a bunch of degenerates

702
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,500
who were willing to do this kind of squatting, weird, not leaving when they're not watching the situation.

703
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Of course it had problems, but you know what?

704
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
It was fucking worth it to live rent-free.

705
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
So fuck you.

706
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Okay.

707
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
If it was worth it.

708
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
It was the right thing to do and you'll never convince me otherwise.

709
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Objectively.

710
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,500
I've pretty much been doing my best for a number of years now.

711
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,500
In fact, and with my family, really what my parents could have been doing was flying to wherever did you was

712
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
and be like, hey, when you're going to write him a video so he can edit it.

713
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
You know what this really is?

714
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,500
It's if you can look in the mirror at the end of the day and you see and you look in your own eyes

715
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,500
and you see I am doing everything in my power to fulfill my obligations to the people in my life.

716
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:35,500
If you can do that without wincing, without shying away, then you shouldn't be afraid of looking at anyone or facing anybody.

717
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Yeah, I don't fulfill the obligations to other people in my life, but I make it very clear to them.

718
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
There you go.

719
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Well, alright then.

720
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
As long as people know.

721
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,500
It's like if you're lying or hiding things from people, that was me.

722
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
That's what I was thinking.

723
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
You should have a lying podcast.

724
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
I'm very pro lying.

725
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Who, lying?

726
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
That's a good idea.

727
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm very pro lying.

728
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Hey, okay, let's completely shift gears and talk about what are we going to do to end homelessness?

729
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
If we're going to...

730
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
No, hold on.

731
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
What are we going to solve that issue?

732
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Apparently only Munchie has shared his dream home so far.

733
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Wait, I want to go again.

734
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
This is the Munchie podcast now.

735
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
No, it's not.

736
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Just quickly.

737
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Just fucking quickly.

738
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Other people are talking about I don't want to talk to people.

739
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Okay, I've never been like that except for recently because my uncle.

740
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm sure many of you have heard murmurs and rumors and stumbles and mumbles about my uncle.

741
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Uncle Alex, right.

742
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Here's the red pill.

743
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Here's the quick explanation.

744
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,500
He is 55 years old and he loves pole on 4chan.

745
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
Sick.

746
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Yes.

747
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Whoa, shit.

748
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,500
He goes on pole every single day of his life and he's always making threads.

749
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Is he Barack Obama's half brother by any chance?

750
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Probably, probably.

751
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
He's just not black enough.

752
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
He's still black but just not enough.

753
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Anyway, every time I walk past him, he's on his iPad fucking just checking like upvoting

754
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
of 4chan images which I'm assuming is a thing.

755
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,500
He's buying that 4chan gold status.

756
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Of course, yeah.

757
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
That gold pass.

758
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Every single day he's buying more 4chan gold.

760
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Yeah, exactly.

761
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,500
And then when I walk past him, he's like, hey dude, you see this fucking Pepe image?

762
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Check this out, bro.

763
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I'm like, oh, that's pretty nice.

764
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Yeah, it's a pretty rare Pepe.

765
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Yeah, please, please just let me, please just let me get my fucking drink.

766
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Nah, bro, dude, check this shit fucking out.

767
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
You see what Trump's doing?

768
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
He's going to fix the fucking moon, bro.

769
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
He's going to fix it.

770
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
The warming's going to be gone, bro.

771
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
What?

772
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Fix the moon.

773
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Why?

774
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Yeah, he's going to fix the moon.

775
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
He's going to make the moon great again.

777
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
He's going to take all the excess heat from the greenhouse gases on earth and put it on

778
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
the moon to make the moon nice and warm.

779
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh, shit.

780
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
And we can then start agriculture on the moon.

781
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
On the moon.

782
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Of course, we recycle everything.

783
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Exactly.

784
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Makes a lot of sense.

785
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Exactly.

786
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Precisely.

787
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,500
So basically, my uncle is completely incoherent and whenever I walk past him, he always

788
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:59,500
wrote me into a red pill conversation about Trump or Pepe or any sort of 4chan dub memes.

789
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
And I want to avoid that as much as possible.

790
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
So I just stay up in my room and wait for him to leave.

791
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Oh, and the reason he's always over at my house now is because his life is falling apart

792
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
because he goes on poll too much.

793
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Well, it sucks when you're young and you still live with your parents and you don't have

794
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
a job to afford your own place yet, which happens until pretty recently.

795
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Yeah, there's just nothing you can do.

796
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
You've got to deal with it.

797
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:27,500
So my dream home is to basically recreate Owl Farm, which is the place that Hunter S. Thompson

798
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,500
lived.

799
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Hunter S. Thompson lived on his own, like, acre of land up in the hills of Aspen, Colorado.

800
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,500
And he had this relatively small house.

801
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I would probably put a bigger house there because I'm obsessed with living in a labyrinth.

802
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,500
That's also my dream house, is to live in a labyrinth.

803
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,500
But he has this giant yard and he would just have shitloads of guns.

804
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,500
And he was just always firing guns on his property and, like, fucking...

805
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
He had, like, a whole shooting range and he was just fucking around.

806
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,500
He had peacocks everywhere, just roaming.

807
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,500
And he would get into gunfights with his neighbors and shit.

808
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Like, they'd just shoot at each other's property when they were mad at each other.

809
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
And, like, it's basically a libertarian utopia.

810
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
And that's what I want to live in.

811
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:16,500
I just want to have space to do literally any batshit crazy stuff I want to do.

812
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Dude, dude, dude.

813
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
You said Owl Farm, right?

814
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Owl Farm?

815
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
It's called Owl Farm.

816
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Instead of any of the shit you just described, I'm just picturing Drake from Hotline Bling

817
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
with his Owl sweatshirt.

818
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Just, like, that place is Owl Farm to me.

819
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Did you?

820
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
So you described it as, like, a libertarian utopia.

821
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Imagine if it was, like, on a very specific mountain where, like, the Colorado Capitol

822
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
building was, like, within view with a telescope.

823
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,500
So you would have a telescope to see the tiny government.

824
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
I mean, he...

825
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Yeah!

826
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,500
That may have actually been the case, because I think he was pretty close to the sheriff's

827
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,500
office, which he also ran for sheriff of Aspen.

828
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
But, yeah.

829
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,500
Yeah.

830
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
His...

831
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Just seeing...

832
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
There's videos of, like, his property out there.

833
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,500
In fact, there's a video of Conan O'Brien going there and, like, hanging out on his shooting

834
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
range of firing shitloads of guns.

835
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,500
And he has, like, a bar set up at the shooting range.

836
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:14,500
This is a man who literally has a giant stash of alcohol next to his giant stash of guns.

837
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
And he can just do that.

838
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Pretty perfect.

839
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
You know?

840
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
And shoots.

841
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
It's Colorado, man.

842
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,500
You can do whatever.

843
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
I don't give a single fuck.

844
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
He's already attained greatness.

845
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
It's time to enjoy it, I guess.

846
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Yeah.

847
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Who gets the fuck anymore?

848
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Yeah.

849
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Anyway, my dream house really is just a labyrinth, but I guess I can be more specific.

850
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
I don't need the guns and shit.

851
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
I don't need it to be, like, a farm.

852
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,500
But I do like the labyrinthine idea.

853
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,500
I can get more specific.

854
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
I want it to be in the woods.

855
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
You know, I want it to be far away.

856
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I don't need it to be in the mountains, because generally that's a lot more expensive.

857
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
I'm fine with flatland.

858
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
I don't mind flatland.

859
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
But I do like trees.

860
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,500
So you have that.

861
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
I don't know.

862
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Like, there'll just be a lot of specific ways to make it labyrinthine.

863
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
I want a lot of basement shit.

864
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,500
I'd like one somewhere, like, you kind of go into a mountain, and then you come out the

865
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,500
other side, and there's another door over there.

866
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,500
That'd be pretty cool.

867
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,500
And especially the best thing to have a labyrinth for is to have, like, this own little sectioned-off

868
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,500
area that a teenage offspring could live in without having to get, you know, that way

869
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,500
it would really facilitate when they're going through their phase of not wanting to be near

870
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,500
their parents and shit.

871
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
You can make that really easy for them.

872
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
You'll never have to see them, right?

873
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,500
That's what I would love to facilitate to my progeny.

874
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Yeah.

875
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,500
That's basically it.

876
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Excellent.

877
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I guess here's where I want to live.

878
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,500
It forces me to consider, like, what I want my life to be like as well.

879
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,500
So, basically, it would be a house by itself, similar to the one I grew up in.

880
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,500
On Mars.

881
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,500
Yeah.

882
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,500
The center of the Earth.

883
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,500
It'd just be on, like, I don't know, some pretty quiet street fairly far away from another

884
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
house, but probably within, I don't know.

885
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
It could be, like, 50 feet away.

886
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
This might be an important point.

887
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,500
That even though I want this labyrinth on this, like, acre of land, I want it to be

888
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,500
immediately surrounded by, like, nothing but stores.

889
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Like, I don't want it to be in the middle of nowhere.

890
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
Like, I want it to be, like, right in the heart of a city.

891
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Like, it's a public park that I've built a house in.

892
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Yeah.

893
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Yeah.

894
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,500
I was going to say, my ideal house would be just like, it would be just like a dungeon.

895
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,500
It would be just like, or, it would be just like a single, like, dungeon room, like a

896
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,500
spacious dungeon room at the top of, like, a stone spire.

897
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,500
And it would be totally ice, but it would be, but it would be a tall stone spire that

898
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,500
you had to climb some, like, spiral staircases to some stir, spiral, like, like, hours and

899
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
hours of climbing a styrofoam staircase to get up to.

900
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,500
But it would be right in the middle of a metropolitan city so that I could just, like, look down

901
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
and observe.

902
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,500
So I'd be isolated from it.

903
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,500
I'd be isolated from all that hullabaloo, but I could see it.

904
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,500
And if I wanted to, I could put it, I could maybe go and get down there if the mood struck

905
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
me.

906
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,500
You might be interested in the house that I'm currently living in, my family's house,

907
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,500
because it's like, you've seen it in some of my videos.

908
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,500
It's 10 acres of land.

909
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,500
You can do whatever here, but it's like near the highway, and it's like six minutes away

910
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
from a Walmart and a quick trip.

911
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Not good enough.

912
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Okay, there you go.

913
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,500
I want to literally, like, if I leave my property, then there is a store.

914
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Like, that's what I want it to be.

915
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:16,500
Like, I am living on the, like, just build a mall around my house is what I'm saying.

916
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Plus, you've got shit internet, so that's definitely the worst part.

917
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
But there's, like, good internet just a little bit out of reach.

918
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
I think if you could, like, drop, like, a 5K investment, you could probably get someone

919
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
to stretch it out.

920
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
There's also a hospital, like, four minutes away from here.

921
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,500
It's on this, there's this giant fucking hospital on this pure road.

922
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
I don't necessarily want to live right next to a hospital.

923
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Well, dude, like, you're saying, go, let me go.

924
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
God damn point.

925
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Okay, so, so, so it's, it's whatever.

926
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,500
It's a fucking suburb, fairly close to the center of the metropolitan area.

927
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Like, like the outside of Boston or something, that would be pretty cool.

928
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:56,500
And, and, so about the house itself, it would be, I don't know, like, medium-sized, but,

929
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,500
but the size is important, because I want to have a family.

930
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,500
I want to have kids.

931
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Two.

932
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Two, Vincent and Charlotte.

933
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Twin perfect godchildren.

934
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,500
The wife doesn't matter.

935
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
She'll probably be there, but I don't care about her.

936
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Just stop.

937
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Okay, I was going to say, like.

938
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
And here's the important part.

939
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Here's the important part.

940
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
The house can't, okay, so first of all, it's got to have a studio where I can do all my

941
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
work.

942
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,500
That, that's a, that has to happen.

943
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,500
It has to be a nice place.

944
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:26,500
But other than that, the house has to be small enough, not as big as the house I grew up

945
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,500
in, because that house was too big and it forced us to be able to stay away from each other.

946
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,500
I want to be forced to interact with my family so that they can't avoid me.

947
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,500
They can't get mad at me.

948
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,500
We will always be forced to communicate with each other and none of us will ever be low

949
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,500
nuts.

950
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,500
What do you mean, though?

951
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
That's what I want.

952
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,500
That's not how fucking it works.

953
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,500
That's not how it works.

954
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
If they're forced to interact with you, they're going to get mad at you way more often.

955
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,500
He means, he means they can't like, storm off to their room and be alone.

956
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,500
That's not, they, that's fucking not, no.

957
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Every, the best of students I've ever made in my fucking life was run away to my room

958
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
and say a reaction.

959
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
David, David, you've got, you've got your perspective.

960
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
And here is my perspective.

961
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,500
I lived in a big, big house where I was far away from everyone where I wanted to be and

962
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
that had negative consequences.

963
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,500
And what I'm trying to say is I'd like to find ways to avoid those.

964
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,500
And being too isolated from my family made me a lonelier person and has made me the person

965
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,500
I am today.

966
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
And I'd like to avoid that from my kids.

967
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Nate, Nate, having, having been in the same fucking family, let me say, let me say that

968
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
being isolated from...

969
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Wait, you guys are brothers?

970
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Oh my God.

971
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Oh my God.

972
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
I know.

973
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:36,500
Being isolated from said family was just the greatest thing, was the only, the only respite

974
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
from, from the terror.

975
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Well, that's a great opinion you guys have.

976
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
I'm sure love your opinion there.

977
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,500
Being separate, being separate was the best part of it.

978
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Well, consider this Ben, consider the fact that you're two years older than me.

979
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
And, uh, uh...

980
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
You two are brothers?

981
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Everything that that entails.

982
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,500
And maybe I'm just a lonelier person by nature.

983
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,500
But nonetheless, I don't want that.

984
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
And I want to avoid that.

985
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
That's what a family is literally for.

986
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
So that's what I wanted to serve.

987
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
No, no, it's not.

988
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
No, it's not.

989
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,500
I mean, who?

990
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
I don't give a fuck.

991
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,500
Fair enough.

992
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate's lonely.

993
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
He has post-attack.

994
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,500
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, like, I, like, I would, I would fucking chafe and get mad

995
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,500
if I lived in some place where I was like forced to interact all the time.

996
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Like, I mean, what I would do for my house, like I said before, is there would be this area

997
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,340
where some teenagers could live there all by themselves, but have some other rooms that

998
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,340
are right next to each other in case some or all of my kids are like that.

999
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:34,340
You know, I'm sure that Pete, I know that people fucking like grind that whole introvert,

1000
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,340
extrovert thing into the ground, but it's fucking true.

1001
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,340
You can observe it.

1002
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,340
There are people who get tired when they're around people and get energetic when they're

1003
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,340
alone and vice versa.

1004
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,340
It's just a fucking fact.

1005
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,340
I, I literally get tired if I'm around too many.

1006
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,340
If people are in the room, it like sucks my life force away and I'm going to get fucking

1007
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,340
mad and tired and dead.

1008
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,340
So, like, yeah.

1009
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
I've been, I'm an introvert.

1010
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:02,340
I need people to come up to me and say, I fucking know, but it's just goddamn true.

1011
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,340
All right.

1012
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,340
That's fine.

1013
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,340
Oh, yeah.

1014
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,340
Sure.

1015
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,340
Oh, yeah.

1016
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,340
Sure.

1017
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,340
Oh, I got you.

1018
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,340
All right.

1019
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,340
All right.

1020
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,340
Let's move on.

1021
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,340
Let's move on.

1022
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,340
Oh my God.

1023
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,340
Is that best guy ever?

1024
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
When did you get here?

1025
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,340
Everybody.

1026
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,340
All right.

1027
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,340
I'm the best guy ever.

1028
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,340
Oh my God.

1029
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:25,340
I'm, I'm speaking, I'm totally speaking here from a purely self-serving perspective.

1030
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,340
I'm aware of that and yeah, I don't care.

1031
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,340
Which one do I shoot indeed?

1032
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,340
This isn't objective at all.

1033
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,340
This is purely subjective.

1034
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
Okay.

1035
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,340
This is a related note.

1036
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,340
How many of you, when growing up, were allowed to lock your doors?

1037
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,340
Oh shit.

1038
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,340
We didn't even have locks.

1039
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,340
I don't think, yeah, I don't think we had locks.

1040
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,340
What?

1041
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,340
Yeah, it's fucked up, right?

1042
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,340
It fucked me up.

1043
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,340
It's not that fucked up.

1044
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:53,340
I literally locked my door even though my door, like, I'm upstairs, so if anyone wanted to

1045
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,340
come back and just...

1046
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,340
No, no.

1047
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,340
See, that's the sort of thing.

1048
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,340
No child needs to lock their door from their...

1049
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,340
Oh for fuck's sake.

1050
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,340
There's nothing to do.

1051
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,340
I would have, I forgot all about this.

1052
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:07,340
I completely forgot just how angry I was every fucking day of my life that I couldn't lock

1053
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,340
my door.

1054
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,340
My life would have been so much better if I could have locked my door.

1055
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,340
It was honestly, I think it was cruel.

1056
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,340
I honestly think it was cruel that I was made to live in a room that had no lock.

1057
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,340
You know what, I'll give you the peace of mind that can come from having a lock if you

1058
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,340
feel like you really need it.

1059
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,340
You know, I can understand that.

1060
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,340
But I don't really like the idea of living in a house where everyone's got their doors

1061
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,340
locked all the time.

1062
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,340
It's just weird.

1063
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,340
I don't fucking know, man.

1064
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,340
Especially having kids, that means you're creating all new human beings who did not fucking

1065
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,740
choose to be part of this.

1066
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,020
I understand the idea of a locked door between, like, a romantic relationship of two adult

1067
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,020
people who like...

1068
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
You give the children too much credit.

1069
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
They're worthless.

1070
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,020
They have no interest.

1071
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,340
But children do not, did not fuck...

1072
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,340
This is one of the things that Stefan Molyneux, world's smartest and best guy ever, said

1073
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,340
about is that children did not choose this relationship.

1074
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,340
And so if they want to fucking lock you out or kill you, they have that fucking right.

1075
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,340
So...

1076
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,340
Stefan Molyneux thinks way too highly of children's intelligence and agency.

1077
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,340
Yeah.

1078
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,340
Anyway.

1079
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,340
But yeah, I had an issue with my younger brother because he wanted to just...

1080
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,340
One night, he decided, hey, David, we all have separate rooms now.

1081
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,340
We've been sleeping in different rooms for a few years now.

1082
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,340
But what if I just sleep in your room for tonight?

1083
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,340
It'll be like a fun sleepover.

1084
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,340
And I was like, sure.

1085
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,340
And then the next night, he did it again.

1086
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,340
And then two days later, he did it again.

1087
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,340
And I was like, all right, Aaron, no more sleeping in my bedroom.

1088
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,340
And then he just kept doing it.

1089
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,340
And then eventually he knew I was going to say no.

1090
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,340
So like a few hours before bedtime, he would just start hanging out in my room.

1091
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,340
And he'd sort of get comfortable in a chair that's right next to the bed.

1092
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:46,340
And so, you know, but this is where the fucking immovable object meets the other fucking immovable object.

1093
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,340
And I'm just like, no, you're getting the fuck out of my room.

1094
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,340
And he would get mad at me.

1095
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,340
He felt entitled to my attention.

1096
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,340
There was times where, like, he knocks on the door and he starts opening it.

1097
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,340
And I know he's going to be warming his way through a three-hour fucking espionage plan

1098
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,340
to get into my room for the night.

1099
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,340
So I just immediately bang on the door the other direction, block him out.

1100
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,340
By the time he got strong enough...

1101
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,340
He just heard some bullshit.

1102
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,340
What's wrong with his room?

1103
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,340
But he's just a fucking lonely person who has to be around human beings all the time.

1104
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:15,340
Now that he's an adult, he says that he borderline passes out on the road whenever he's driving to work

1105
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,340
because there's no one to talk to.

1106
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,340
So yeah.

1107
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,340
So it got to the point that he was, like, taking pocket knives and stabbing holes in the door.

1108
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,340
So mad I wouldn't let him sleep in my room.

1109
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,340
No fucking, I'm not fucking joking.

1110
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:31,340
Two separate doors among two separate houses, he'd be punching holes in my door for being mad at me.

1111
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,340
To the point that I had to start, like, I enacted an absolute policy of,

1112
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:40,340
no one opens my door at all, ever, without knocking and then getting permission.

1113
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,340
That's how it should be, of course.

1114
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,340
And then years, years, years later, well, I guess seven, eight, nine years later,

1115
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,340
like, that my brother has since greatly matured,

1116
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,340
but that policy is still in place and everyone locks the door because I'm a fucking psychopath

1117
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,340
who doesn't like being fucked with.

1118
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,340
Anyway, that's why you need locks and doors, you know, because of that.

1119
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,340
There's this personality difference.

1120
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Davoo, you're not a psychopath for not wanting some fucking rude foreign invader

1121
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,340
to destroy and dismantle your fucking lands.

1122
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:12,340
Some goddamn room immigrant trying to take your goddamn sleeping jobs

1123
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,340
and then ruin your economy, understandable.

1124
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,340
You're the only one sane in that circumstance.

1125
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,340
That's debatable, but sure.

1126
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,340
I'm open to the idea of having the locks on the doors,

1127
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,340
but I think I definitely feel weird about, like,

1128
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,340
if my kid, like, locked his door every night for no reason,

1129
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,340
I would object, I would object.

1130
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,340
You are.

1131
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,340
I locked my door every fucking night.

1132
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,340
Yeah, dude, like, who are you to tell him, like, dude, you should...

1133
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,340
I am the father.

1134
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,340
It is my house.

1135
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,340
I paid for the house in the situation.

1136
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,340
What are you gonna tell them to do instead?

1137
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,340
You're gonna be like, you're not gonna be in your room.

1138
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,340
You're gonna be down here.

1139
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,340
You're gonna be my fucking friend, you little cunt.

1140
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,340
Is that what you're gonna say?

1141
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,340
Yeah, like...

1142
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,340
That's exactly right.

1143
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,340
I won't even give him the choice because I'll just buy the house I want.

1144
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,340
I'm that far ahead of him.

1145
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,340
I have such a fucking vivid image of what kind of dad you are gonna be.

1146
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,340
Like, it's gonna be really funny.

1147
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,340
I imagine Nate as the dad...

1148
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,340
I doubt any of you have ever seen the show Arakawa under the bridge,

1149
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,340
but the main character is this guy who's like a lawyer

1150
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,340
and his dad is like a rich lawyer guy

1151
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,340
and his dad taught him, like, you always have to repay every debt in your life,

1152
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,340
including when he, basically, when he comes of age,

1153
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,340
then becomes a baby who he then has to take care of

1154
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:31,340
in order to pay back the debt of having been raised by him

1155
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,340
by making him then take care of his dad.

1156
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,340
Well, that just doesn't make any sense.

1157
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,340
That's just the circle of life, my dogs.

1158
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,340
No, that's the son having to pay for both his own children and his parents.

1159
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,340
That doesn't make sense.

1160
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,340
Like, you pay it for the next generation.

1161
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Well, I don't know how that works.

1162
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,340
It's an anime. An anime is not.

1163
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,340
Yeah, you're right.

1164
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,340
The point is that it's hilarious.

1165
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,340
Yeah, I'm with ya.

1166
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,340
Did he become a literal baby?

1167
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,340
Did he, like, turn into one?

1168
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,340
No, he just, like, he just...

1169
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,340
You only see him for, like, a minute.

1170
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,340
Like, this is just the backstory of the main character,

1171
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,340
but his dad, like, puts on a bib and gets in a high chair

1172
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,340
and is like, you have to feed the dad.

1173
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,340
Oh, my fucking god.

1174
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,340
I understand the one for that kind of justice.

1175
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,340
No, Nate, let me explain.

1176
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,340
Just real briefly here.

1177
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,340
My door is always locked,

1178
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,340
but no matter what...

1179
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,340
What are you hiding, Munchie?

1180
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,340
What are you hiding in there?

1181
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
This life!

1182
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,340
He's got my fucking dick!

1183
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,340
What do you think he's hiding?

1184
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,340
I wanna see you jack that dick, my son.

1185
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,340
I'm gonna watch you.

1186
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,340
I'm gonna watch you touch yourself,

1187
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,340
and you're gonna show me what you've learned,

1188
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,340
and I'm gonna correct your technique, you worthless baby.

1189
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,340
Your dad has to be ashamed of our penis.

1190
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,340
Exactly.

1191
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,340
He says no.

1192
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,340
Exactly.

1193
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,340
Whatever.

1194
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,340
I don't want you ripping the skin, Munchie.

1195
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,340
I don't want you ripping the skin.

1196
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,340
You're ripping the skin.

1197
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,340
You're gonna learn.

1198
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,340
But no matter what,

1199
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,340
whenever someone knocks on the door,

1200
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,340
I just let them in,

1201
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,340
because they usually just like, hey, hello.

1202
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,340
Fucking Nate's gonna be like,

1203
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,340
his son's gonna be jacking off in his doorless room,

1204
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,340
and Nate's gonna come in and be like,

1205
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,340
you know, it's more efficient if you turn your hand like this.

1206
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,340
I'm just saying,

1207
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,340
I'm not telling you how to jack your dick,

1208
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,340
but turn your hand this way.

1209
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,340
I'm just saying it'd be more efficient.

1210
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,340
You guys are all coming from the perspective

1211
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,340
of our parents who are like,

1212
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,340
they still, there's vestiges in culture

1213
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,340
of being ashamed of masturbation

1214
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,340
and being ashamed of your body.

1215
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,340
You wanna watch your son jack off?

1216
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,340
You wanna walk in on him?

1217
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,340
I'm down to clown, baby boy.

1218
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,340
Let's get this going.

1219
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,340
Okay, this is like,

1220
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,340
it doesn't make any fucking sense, dude.

1221
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,340
None of us here are ashamed of mastication.

1222
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,340
Would any of us masticate in the same room?

1223
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,340
Yes.

1224
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,340
That makes one of us.

1225
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,340
Dude, we went out,

1226
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,340
we've masticated in the same room together.

1227
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,340
We went out and we all masticated together

1228
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,340
in public, my dudes.

1229
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,340
It's true.

1230
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,340
Under the, before the eyes of God and man.

1231
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,340
Yeah.

1232
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,340
Basically what I'm saying is

1233
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,340
if you don't give your child a lock,

1234
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,340
you should be locked up in jail, that is.

1235
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,340
Agreed, I agree.

1236
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,340
Yeah.

1237
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,340
You know, I'm willing to entertain you.

1238
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,340
I remember as a kid,

1239
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,340
one of the things I did as a kid all the time

1240
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,340
was hear about parental policies

1241
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,340
of other people's kids

1242
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
and scoff at them for being

1243
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,340
totalitarian and shit,

1244
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,340
because my parents only befriended

1245
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,340
other even Christian or Christians,

1246
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,340
and like one family I knew,

1247
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,340
they had a policy of

1248
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,340
if you're going to the bathroom,

1249
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,340
you have to keep the door slightly open.

1250
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,340
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1251
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,340
Okay, that's fucked.

1252
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,340
Why?

1253
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,340
It's like four to eight year olds,

1254
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,340
but still, that's like 80 fucks.

1255
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,340
I'm not, well, I mean,

1256
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,340
if they're like little babies,

1257
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,340
I sort of get it.

1258
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,340
Yeah, eight is like,

1259
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,340
what are you,

1260
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
and like third grade by them?

1261
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
Jesus.

1262
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,340
Fuck's sake.

1263
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,340
Yeah, it's pretty fucked.

1264
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,340
At a certain point,

1265
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,340
really there is a cut off point,

1266
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,340
where you have to be willing

1267
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,340
to let your child drown in the toilet

1268
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,340
if they fuck up that bed.

1269
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,340
It's just, you have to take that plunge.

1270
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,340
I mean, I could see not having a lock

1271
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,340
on the bathroom door

1272
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,340
if you're worried about your kids.

1273
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,340
Yeah.

1274
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,340
I completely understand why Nate would be

1275
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,340
hesitant to take any of our

1276
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,340
stances into consideration,

1277
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,340
because I'm sure that he has

1278
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,340
no desire for his kids to come out

1279
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,340
at all like any of us.

1280
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,340
Of course not.

1281
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,340
So any of the things that we take as wisdom,

1282
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,340
because our parents did it,

1283
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,340
or because we think it would be a good idea,

1284
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,340
I don't think it's going to be stuff that Nate's going to listen to.

1285
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,340
My kids are going to be the most Chad

1286
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,340
Thundercock alpha children

1287
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,340
of all time.

1288
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,340
Nate, here's some basic fucking logic.

1289
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,340
When you were a teenager,

1290
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,340
did you need that lock?

1291
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,340
Do you really think that that lock

1292
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,340
really made your life worse,

1293
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,340
or that it,

1294
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,340
you would have been even worse

1295
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,340
or without it?

1296
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,340
You know, to be honest,

1297
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,340
thinking about it,

1298
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,340
like I would have been more comfortable with the lock.

1299
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,340
It's true.

1300
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,340
Right, so here's the thing, right?

1301
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,340
You're probably thinking,

1302
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,340
oh, well my kids,

1303
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,340
I know all the ways that I was

1304
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,340
like fucked in the head by my parents.

1305
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,340
I just won't do those things.

1306
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,340
And indeed,

1307
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,340
most parents who give a shit

1308
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,340
are able to,

1309
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,340
roughly,

1310
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,340
not make all the same mistakes

1311
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,340
their parents did.

1312
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,340
But the fact is,

1313
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,340
you're going to make your own mistakes.

1314
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,340
Parents never know,

1315
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,340
parents never realize that.

1316
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,340
You know, I mean,

1317
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,340
my parents are definitely like that.

1318
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,340
None of the problems that they were given.

1319
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,340
But you know,

1320
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,340
it's just, you can't be perfect life.

1321
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,340
That's just not how fucking life works, right?

1322
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,340
I know exactly what problems I'm going to create

1323
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,340
for my kids.

1324
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,340
I know exactly how it's going to go down.

1325
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,340
I know which problems I'm going to fix

1326
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,340
for my parents,

1327
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,340
because my parents are terrible at communication

1328
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,340
and just using words.

1329
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,340
Dude, the problem you're going to have

1330
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,340
is that your kids are going to walk down the room,

1331
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,340
walk out of their room,

1332
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,340
and they're going to see you

1333
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,340
walking down naked through the hallway.

1334
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,340
Just fuck my girlfriend up, everybody!

1335
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,340
Just got me on my body right now.

1336
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,340
No big deal.

1337
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,340
Exactly the problem I'm talking about.

1338
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,340
My kids are going to grow up

1339
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,340
with a psychopath.

1340
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,340
They're going to grow up with someone

1341
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,340
who has never known how to be normal,

1342
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,340
trying to teach them how to be normal.

1343
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,340
And more likely teaching them

1344
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,340
how it doesn't matter to be normal.

1345
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,340
First of all, my kids are going to know

1346
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,340
from the time they're born

1347
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,340
that there is no God

1348
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,340
and that school is bullshit.

1349
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,340
And they're going to have to go to school

1350
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,340
with this knowledge and talk to other kids

1351
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,340
and be like,

1352
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,340
I know, I can see it in my head.

1353
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,340
A kid being like,

1354
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,340
oh, are you Christian?

1355
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,340
They're being like,

1356
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,340
no, Christians are dumb.

1357
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,340
My daddy said so.

1358
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,340
And the next thing I know,

1359
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,340
I'm in school fucking

1360
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,340
at a parent-teacher conference

1361
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,340
having to put my kid

1362
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,340
in some kind of fucking weird,

1363
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,340
satanic private school cult

1364
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,340
or something.

1365
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,340
Yeah.

1366
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,340
Burn it all to the fucking ground, dude.

1367
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,340
By the way,

1368
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,340
I'm just imagining right now.

1369
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,340
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1370
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,340
Hold the fuck on.

1371
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,340
If your kid says there's no God in class

1372
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,340
and they get taken to Satan's school.

1373
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,340
Well, the Satan guys are more open-minded

1374
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,340
than the Jesus guys.

1375
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,340
Did you guys know that basically,

1376
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,340
there's an organization,

1377
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,340
like the Satanists,

1378
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,340
every time there's like a new

1379
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,340
bit of legislation passes

1380
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,340
that gives Christians permission to do

1381
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,340
XYZ, teach Christianian schools

1382
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,340
in some bum-fuck-nobody town.

1383
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,340
There's this cadre of Satanists

1384
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,340
that I wish I could remember their name.

1385
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,340
But they then go in

1386
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,340
and make the same pot.

1387
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,340
They try to be like,

1388
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,340
okay, well, we're going to now

1389
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,340
promote Satanism in this place.

1390
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,340
Yeah, oh my fucking god.

1391
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,340
It's the best.

1392
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,340
Well, what I'm going to do with my kids

1393
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,340
regarding religion

1394
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,340
is I'm just not going to say shit,

1395
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,340
or if they ask me,

1396
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,340
I'll be like, I don't think there's a God.

1397
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,340
But then obviously their grandparents

1398
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,340
will be able to talk their fucking ear off.

1399
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,340
And I will love to see what decision

1400
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,340
they come to on their own.

1401
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,340
Because I know there's kind of a trend

1402
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,340
of grandchildren to latch onto the ideology

1403
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,340
of two generations up rather than

1404
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,340
one generation up.

1405
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,340
So that would be really fucking cute

1406
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,340
if my kids are like Christians.

1407
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,340
It definitely, definitely skips a generation.

1408
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,340
I was just, I was only,

1409
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,340
I was just talking to one of Jackie's friends

1410
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,340
the other day and he was telling me that,

1411
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,340
he was telling me that like,

1412
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,340
every other generation of his family

1413
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,340
is a preacher,

1414
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,340
and that every generation in between

1415
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,340
is an alcoholic.

1416
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,340
Yeah.

1417
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,340
Yeah.

1418
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,340
That's perfect.

1419
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,340
It's perfect.

1420
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,340
Yeah.

1421
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,340
Well, my parents are,

1422
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,340
my parents are a nihilist

1423
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,340
and a guy who just believes in

1424
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,340
weird random spiritual shit

1425
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,340
that he doesn't even get into.

1426
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,340
So like, between me and my parents

1427
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,340
it's the same exact thing.

1428
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,340
So I think my kids are going to be the exact same.

1429
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,340
The only reason that I won't beat

1430
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,340
into the heads of my children

1431
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,340
how evil religion is,

1432
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,340
how brainwashed all the other sheep

1433
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,340
out there in the world are compared to them,

1434
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,340
is because I'm afraid of that teenage backlash

1435
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,340
that they'll just switch around to the other side.

1436
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,340
They will.

1437
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,340
You know what?

1438
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,340
Jesus fucking rules.

1439
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,340
Well, I can't take that chance.

1440
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,340
I cannot take that chance.

1441
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,340
The problem is that,

1442
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,340
that your kids will get made fun of

1443
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,340
for like believing something different.

1444
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,340
It'll make them strong.

1445
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,340
It'll make them powerful.

1446
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,340
Unless you put them

1447
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
into a completely distinct scenario,

1448
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
like a weird satanic cult school

1449
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,340
where like everyone thinks that shit,

1450
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,340
you know?

1451
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,340
But it's just like all the arguments

1452
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,340
for why God is real

1453
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,340
that people just bring up

1454
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,340
are just so easily defeated by like,

1455
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,340
remember guys,

1456
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,340
you have no reason to believe any of this.

1457
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,340
You're just going off on all these tangents.

1458
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,340
Like once you're armed with the logical tools,

1459
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
I mean, fuck, you know,

1460
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,340
people talk about this for fucking centuries.

1461
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,340
Like there's no argument anyone could make

1462
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
that is any value.

1463
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,340
No man, talking about being a bad parent,

1464
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,340
I know that the place that I would fuck up

1465
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,340
if I'm not really careful

1466
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,340
is I'm going to be the fucking adoptive dad

1467
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,340
from Three God to No Lion

1468
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,340
who only cares about Shogi

1469
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,340
and all of his children,

1470
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,340
his actual children,

1471
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,340
end up being scarred for life

1472
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,340
because they're not good at Shogi enough

1473
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,340
to get his attention

1474
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,340
and his adoptive son is.

1475
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,340
And so they hate him

1476
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,340
and they become dysfunctional abortions forever.

1477
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,340
You know what?

1478
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:04,340
I might have to adopt.

1479
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,340
That's what I'm going to be with,

1480
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,340
that's what I'm going to be with fucking

1481
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,340
like YouTube videos and video games.

1482
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,340
It's like if my kids aren't

1483
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,340
as obsessed with art as I am,

1484
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,340
I'm not going to hang out with them as much

1485
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,340
unless I really discipline myself

1486
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,340
and I'm going to ruin them.

1487
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,340
And yep, that's going to be my problem.

1488
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,340
Like your kids,

1489
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,340
like your kids coming like,

1490
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,340
dad, want to hang out

1491
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,340
and you're like,

1492
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,340
guys, look,

1493
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,340
you're just kind of embarrassing me

1494
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,340
in front of my cool art friends.

1495
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,340
Yeah.

1496
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,340
I actually love this idea.

1497
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,340
You kids are just too square.

1498
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,340
I've got to adopt

1499
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,340
a superior athletic older kid

1500
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,340
to motivate my younger children

1501
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,340
to advance to that level

1502
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,340
and be cool and badass like that.

1503
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,340
That is kind of genius.

1504
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Like adopt a kid to be

1505
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,340
the older sibling to your kids.

1506
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,340
That is kind of fun.

1507
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,340
Oh, well, I didn't catch that at first.

1508
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,340
That is pretty fucking genius.

1509
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,340
I think I've seen that in an anime actually.

1510
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,340
I think I've seen that be used

1511
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,340
in a show and it was, yeah.

1512
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,340
The eldest kid always has

1513
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,340
like a thing like he feels bad

1514
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,340
because he's not as

1515
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,340
clearly not as loved by the parents

1516
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,340
because he's not their progeny,

1517
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,340
but at the same time,

1518
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,340
the siblings really look up to them

1519
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,340
and so he still feels like part of the family.

1520
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,340
You adopt yourself a commune

1521
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,340
to motivate your younger shit children

1522
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,340
and then...

1523
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,340
And obviously the number one place

1524
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,340
to get adoptions from is Africa

1525
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,340
where they have the best athletic ability.

1526
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,340
So it's pretty much...

1527
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,340
There you go. It works perfectly.

1528
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,340
Did you even adopt one of those

1529
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,340
like Russian babies?

1530
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,340
I know like at one point in the 90s

1531
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,340
they were adopting a lot of Russian babies

1532
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,340
and that way you had the best alcoholic.

1533
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,340
I already know my kids

1534
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,340
are going to be fucking clones of me.

1535
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,340
Like they're just...

1536
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,340
Really?

1537
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,340
Yeah, they are.

1538
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,340
Don't you want to experiment with improvements

1539
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,340
like Gohan and Dragon Ball Z?

1540
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,340
Experiment with improvements.

1541
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,340
Yeah, let's just let the kids

1542
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,340
tinker with them a little bit, you know?

1543
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,340
Yeah, that's where we're going to.

1544
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,340
Just hammer them out a little bit

1545
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,340
in my laboratory.

1546
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,340
I didn't mean literal clones.

1547
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,340
I meant they're going to be figurative clones of me.

1548
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,340
Oh, well I meant literal.

1549
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,340
Yeah, I see.

1550
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,340
When you think that way,

1551
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,340
that's like an idealistic way of thinking.

1552
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,340
Like I've already thought, you know,

1553
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,340
the idea of...

1554
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,340
Okay, I'm going to have kids

1555
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,340
who are going to be into sports.

1556
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,340
That's just what...

1557
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,340
I just have to get ready

1558
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
for that right now, right?

1559
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,340
I want my kids to be into sports

1560
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,340
so I can get into sports

1561
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,340
so I can play tennis with my kids.

1562
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,340
That would be fucking awesome.

1563
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,340
But like...

1564
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,340
Yeah, I got it.

1565
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,340
Why tennis?

1566
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,340
Why tennis?

1567
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,340
Yeah, that's what Raito Koon

1568
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,340
and Elle played.

1569
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,340
And tennis is by far my favorite sport,

1570
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,340
so that's why.

1571
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,340
See, Deji, there you go.

1572
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,340
You're still idealizing.

1573
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,340
Look at this.

1574
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,340
Obviously, the most obvious way to rebel against you

1575
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,340
is to be super like western culture

1576
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,340
and fuck weed shit, right?

1577
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,340
I don't think my kids are going to be rebellious, though.

1578
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,340
I was...

1579
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,340
Me and my brothers were never rebellious.

1580
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,340
We had no faith in it.

1581
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,340
But your parents are like

1582
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,340
the most rebellious people ever.

1583
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,340
Yeah.

1584
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,340
Well, that's the thing.

1585
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,340
That's why I think...

1586
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,340
My attitude...

1587
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,340
Like, everything about how I am is like

1588
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,340
if you just put my parents in a blender,

1589
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,340
you get me.

1590
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,340
You know?

1591
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
Like, I am exactly like them.

1592
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,340
I don't know.

1593
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,340
When you think that it's going to be predictable,

1594
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,340
that will be your folly.

1595
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,340
If you have an idea of what you want your kids to be...

1596
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,340
I don't want to fucking talk out of our ass here anyway.

1597
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,340
Yeah, you're completely making that up, Devu.

1598
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,340
There's no logic to support that.

1599
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,340
Well, so are you, though.

1600
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,340
So are you.

1601
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,340
You have no idea what your kids are actually doing.

1602
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,340
I'm just saying.

1603
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,340
It makes the most sense to me

1604
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,340
that considering that me, Victor, and Shader

1605
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,340
are all exactly like our parents,

1606
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,340
and I know I'm the kind of person

1607
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,340
who's going to be extremely close with my kids.

1608
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:21,340
I'm probably going to be like right on them at all times.

1609
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,340
Maybe they'll get annoyed with me.

1610
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,340
Maybe they'll get sick of me

1611
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,340
when they get into their teen phase.

1612
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,340
But like, by the time they're teenagers,

1613
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,340
it doesn't matter if they get rebellious in the teen phase.

1614
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,340
You've already fucking built their mind.

1615
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,340
Like, you know, they're already you.

1616
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,340
Like, everyone...

1617
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,340
But the building process doesn't go smoothly all the time,

1618
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,340
and you never know what you're actually building.

1619
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,340
Dude, almost every rebellious, like, kid

1620
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,340
is like a carbon copy of their parents.

1621
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,340
Like, you know, my mom, like,

1622
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,340
all the things she can't stand about her mom

1623
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,340
is just the stuff that is exactly the shit she does.

1624
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,340
You know?

1625
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,340
Like, everything that she criticizes her mom for

1626
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,340
is something that she just has a different version of.

1627
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,340
So, like, I think almost everyone,

1628
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,340
like, anytime I hear somebody be like,

1629
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,340
oh, my mom, she's such a fucking bitch,

1630
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,340
she does this and this,

1631
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,340
I'm like, you basically do that

1632
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,340
just in a different form, you know?

1633
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,340
Yeah.

1634
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,340
This has been a really enlightening discussion

1635
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,340
of homes and homelessness.

1636
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,340
Yeah, it has.

1637
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,340
Yeah, it's true.

1638
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,340
Well, join us for the sequel to this in ten years

1639
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,340
when we all have kids.

1640
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,340
I want us to have a proper

1641
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,340
how we raised our kids' cast.

1642
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,340
That's a good idea.

1643
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,340
And don't tell anyone anything about your home life.

1644
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,340
We want it to not spoil it

1645
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,340
for the ten-year podcast.

1646
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,340
Yeah, don't spoil it.

1647
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,340
Don't spoil it, anybody.

1648
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,340
I imagine that's what Dick would do if,

1649
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,340
like, if he gets a girl pregnant,

1650
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,340
he's like, okay, I'm not going to see until

1651
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,340
it's like five years old.

1652
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,340
I want to, like, get my live reaction on the show,

1653
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,340
like, see what the kid looks like.

1654
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,340
I don't even know what color it is necessarily.

1655
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,340
I mean, pipe it for 20 episodes before talking about it.

1656
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,340
Yeah.

1657
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,340
So, today we're going to want to close.

1658
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,340
Yeah, go on, Munchie, go on.

1659
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:49,340
Me, I just, to go with Digi,

1660
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:52,340
I have never been rebellious against my mom ever.

1661
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,340
She's always just been, hey,

1662
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,340
shut the fuck up, you're retarded,

1663
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,340
and also tiny.

1664
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,340
And I'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.

1665
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,340
Munchie, if she says that,

1666
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,340
your mom must be enormous.

1667
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,340
Your mom must be the largest woman in the world.

1668
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,340
No, no, no.

1669
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:12,340
Rhonda Rousey, the largest woman in the world,

1670
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,340
aka Munchie's mom.

1671
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,340
But it's made me think,

1672
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,340
because I'm not rebellious as in, like, fuck you, mom.

1673
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,340
But I am rebellious in the sense that I'm not retarded

1674
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,340
and also angry all the time.

1675
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:24,340
Oh, like, she says you're retarded,

1676
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,340
so, like, you don't be retarded,

1677
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,340
like, just to stick it to her?

1678
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,340
Yeah.

1679
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:31,340
You're like, joke's on you, mom.

1680
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,340
I know what's fucking up.

1681
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,340
Oh, okay, it's like, she always,

1682
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,340
she's pretty, like, gullible,

1683
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:39,340
and she's super hard, like, you know, lib-cuck.

1684
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,340
Yeah, she's super gullible

1685
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,340
because she lives in an apartment.

1686
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,340
Exactly, exactly.

1687
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,340
And she's also, like, really angry.

1688
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,340
She's, like, car-cat, basically,

1689
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,340
like, twenty-five-seven.

1690
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,340
Yeah.

1691
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,340
All right.

1692
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,340
But specifically, like, in between...

1693
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,340
Unresolved character arcs out the ass.

1694
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,340
All right.

1695
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1696
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,340
Exactly.

1697
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,340
Anyway, so I'm, like, in IRL, offline,

1698
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,340
I'm, like, calm, I don't really, you know,

1699
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,340
I'm not really fucking crazy,

1700
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,340
except for when I go out in public.

1701
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,340
Like, when I say in real life, I mean, like,

1702
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,340
in my room, not on the computer,

1703
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:12,340
but then when I walk outside the room,

1704
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,340
I'm just like this.

1705
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,340
There are slivers of sanity in that.

1706
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,340
Yeah, slivers of sanity.

1707
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,340
Anyway, so in that, I'm, like,

1708
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,340
very different from my mom in the sense

1709
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:24,340
that I'm not fucking weird.

1710
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,340
But, you know, I think it's the way I rebel

1711
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,340
in the sense that I am still crazy.

1712
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,340
Never mind, my point makes no sense.

1713
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,340
Yeah, that's what it's like.

1714
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,340
No, that's what it's like.

1715
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,340
The pendulum swings.

1716
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,340
The pendulum swings back and forth

1717
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,340
with every generation.

1718
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,340
Or, except for the times that it doesn't.

1719
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,340
And except for the times that it kind of does

1720
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,340
and kind of doesn't and falls somewhere in the middle.

1721
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,340
No, Ben, it's pendulum within pendulum.

1722
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,340
So that's what it is.

1723
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,340
It's like, it's like a, it, yeah.

1724
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,340
It's like wheels within wheels.

1725
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,340
Hey, you know what's cool?

1726
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,340
It's like turtles all the way down.

1727
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,340
Title screen with the pendulum on.

1728
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,340
I gotta be right back.

1729
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,340
Yeah.

1730
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,340
Oh my god, I cried.

1731
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,340
That animation is so good, dude.

1732
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,340
It's three minutes of pure masterpiece.

1733
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,340
I love pendulum.

1734
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,340
Nostalgia.

1735
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:05,340
Oh, right.

1736
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,340
That was good.

1737
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,340
Okay guys, we're going off the rails.

1738
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,340
We need to talk about fucking homelessness.

1739
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,340
We don't have time to crack the code

1740
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,340
of how to fix homelessness in America anymore.

1741
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1742
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,340
I just want to say, I just want to say

1743
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,340
one day, if I play my cards right,

1744
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,340
I want to be homeless.

1745
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,340
And if at all possible,

1746
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,340
dead in the gutter with other dudes pissing on my course.

1747
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,340
If at all possible, that's why I'm painting.

1748
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,340
Luckily, luckily, I mean,

1749
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,340
you have all the tools at your disposal

1750
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,340
to make that happen.

1751
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,340
I'm just going to say, yeah, through God,

1752
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,340
all things are possible.

1753
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,340
True.

1754
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,340
Have hope.

1755
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,340
Take heart.

1756
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,340
Take heart.

1757
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,340
All right, let's switch to questions here.

1758
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,340
We got a whole bunch of questions.

1759
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,340
So let's see what we got.

1760
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,340
Okay, here's one to start us off.

1761
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,340
Here we go.

1762
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,340
At Sizz White Scum 69,

1763
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,340
who I know has asked the question before.

1764
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,340
Yeah, that's much his alt count.

1765
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,340
Thoughts on those who leech off your content

1766
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,340
without patroning?

1767
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,340
So just like thoughts on in general people

1768
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,340
who watch our shit without paying patrons.

1769
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,340
Remember that crime wing re eliminated?

1770
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,340
Remember that?

1771
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,340
That was pretty funny.

1772
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,340
Does he mean,

1773
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,340
does he mean wait?

1774
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,340
Yeah.

1775
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
Wait, no.

1776
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,340
He doesn't mean people like reposting content.

1777
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,340
He's just talking about like free watchers,

1778
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,340
just people who watch and don't do anything.

1779
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:12,340
Well, I mean, that's their prerogative, you know?

1780
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,340
Yeah.

1781
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,340
Like we put it out there for free.

1782
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,340
Yeah.

1783
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,340
We are not charging for it in the first place.

1784
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,340
And it would be,

1785
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,340
it would be really hard to gain patrons

1786
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,340
if our content was gated to begin with.

1787
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,340
Like you got to get an audience of people

1788
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,340
and like most people aren't going to be that interested

1789
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,340
or they don't think the content's worth it.

1790
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:33,340
I mean, fucking Ben and Nate are both huge proponents

1791
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,340
of never pay for any art ever.

1792
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,340
So they,

1793
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,340
I am not a proponent at all.

1794
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,340
I just do that for me selfishly.

1795
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,340
That's the whole thing for me.

1796
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,340
I used to be on that,

1797
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,340
but then, but then I started,

1798
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,340
then I started making exceptions.

1799
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:48,340
Like when I pirated Undertale

1800
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,340
because I was mad that Toby Fox

1801
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,340
didn't retweet my fucking fan art.

1802
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:55,340
But then I ended up liking Undertale so much

1803
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,340
that I went and bought it on Steam anyway,

1804
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,340
even though I'd already played it and beaten it,

1805
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,340
just out of guilt.

1806
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,340
Then when was the last time you bought a game

1807
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,340
that costed more than $15?

1808
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,340
More than?

1809
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,340
Well, well, I mean, that's not a fair question

1810
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,340
because I have not, I have not,

1811
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,340
I have not played a game that cost more than $15 in years.

1812
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,340
Wow.

1813
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,340
Listen to this, listen to this.

1814
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,340
I just yesterday bought Shovel Knight on my Switch

1815
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,340
because I have beaten, I had 100% at Shovel Knight

1816
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,340
years ago, but I like that game so much

1817
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,340
and there's new modes.

1818
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,340
And so I, and I bought it specifically

1819
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,340
for the convenience of playing on my Switch,

1820
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,340
which is the greatest thing in the world,

1821
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,340
every other console's garbage.

1822
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,340
It's gonna be sponsored by Nintendo.

1823
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,340
Yeah, exactly.

1824
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,340
No, it's fucking great.

1825
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,340
So I paid for that because there was a,

1826
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,340
it was the only way I could play it on my Switch,

1827
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,340
and I did it because I had no choice.

1828
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,340
If I'd been able to torrent that shit

1829
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,340
and play it on my Switch like for free,

1830
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,340
I would have done that because that's easier.

1831
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,340
So I'm saying people,

1832
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,340
force me to pay for things.

1833
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,340
That's what you gotta do.

1834
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,340
I cherish the time when I get to pay for something.

1835
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,340
Whenever I get like some throwaway,

1836
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,340
like I always just save money.

1837
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,340
When I get throwaway money,

1838
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,340
I'm like, finally I can buy that fucking Bandcamp album

1839
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,340
I've wanted to buy for a long time.

1840
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,340
And then I can get in fucking flack, bro.

1841
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,340
Fuck yeah, flack.

1842
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,340
You're morally clean.

1843
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,340
Flack.

1844
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,340
Flack, bro, yeah.

1845
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,340
I don't think any of us has problem

1846
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,340
with people watching our shit without being patrons.

1847
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,340
It's fine, but give me good patrons.

1848
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,340
I wanna clarify my stance.

1849
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,340
My stance on paying for art

1850
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,340
is not that you shouldn't pay for art.

1851
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,340
My stance is that you shouldn't pay for art

1852
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,340
that you don't care about.

1853
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,340
And I just happen not to care about any art,

1854
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,340
especially not my own.

1855
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,340
So that's why I don't pay for anything.

1856
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,340
Do we have any questions now?

1857
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,340
Yeah, we're in questions.

1858
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,340
Okay.

1859
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,340
Yeah, my stance on paying for art

1860
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,340
is if you can do things in the general...

1861
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,340
That's not really the question.

1862
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,340
Oh really, oh shit.

1863
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,340
I went to pee for a minute,

1864
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,340
so I'd miss the question.

1865
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,340
Okay, no matter.

1866
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,340
Let's just go to the next one here.

1867
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,340
Okay, this guy's been asking this question

1868
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,340
for like, I think weeks now.

1869
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,340
Let's just do him the favor of responding,

1870
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,340
because it's really simple.

1871
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,340
What's your favorite colors?

1872
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,340
Ask at Spidey Juice.

1873
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,340
It's like a picture that he made.

1874
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,340
Black and white.

1875
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,340
Black and blue.

1876
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,340
Crush them.

1877
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,340
Crush them black and white.

1878
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,340
There you go.

1879
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,340
Purple.

1880
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,340
Purple's my favorite color.

1881
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,340
Oh, me too.

1882
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,340
My favorite color is every color

1883
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,340
from red to blue.

1884
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,340
All of the in-betweens.

1885
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,340
Well, that's actually a pretty good answer, Monchi.

1886
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,340
Oh my god, that's a good answer.

1887
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,340
I picked the same.

1888
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,340
Yeah, I didn't have to do something like that.

1889
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,340
Honestly, I'm into every color right now,

1890
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,340
so I don't have a favorite color.

1891
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,340
My favorite color is everything

1892
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,340
on the entire color wheel,

1893
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:29,340
but with the saturation turned all the way down.

1894
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,340
No, no!

1895
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,340
We can't be friends anymore!

1896
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:34,340
Colors are overrated.

1897
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,340
I think my favorite,

1898
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:39,340
aside from red to blue,

1899
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,340
would be also anything on,

1900
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:44,340
what's the word, shade of red?

1901
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,340
Like pink?

1902
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,340
Yeah.

1903
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,340
Oh, I sent that to me back too.

1904
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,340
Oh my god.

1905
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,340
Okay, hopefully that was enough.

1906
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,340
Guys, we got it.

1907
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,340
This is a fascinating question.

1908
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,340
This is another one from

1909
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,340
atsyswhitescom69,

1910
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,340
and this man needs help.

1911
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,340
All right, listen to this.

1912
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,340
At a super Christian wedding right now,

1913
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,340
what can I do to have a good time?

1914
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,340
Well, this man needs advice.

1915
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:04,340
How can he have a good time?

1916
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,340
This won't help him,

1917
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,340
because he's going to be a weak lady.

1918
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,340
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

1919
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,340
I forgot.

1920
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,340
Just drink all the sacramental wine.

1921
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,340
Yeah, that's the thing to do.

1922
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,340
Find alcohol.

1923
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,340
Get wasted.

1924
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:15,340
Just do everything you can

1925
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,340
to make everyone regret inviting you.

1926
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,340
That's what I would do.

1927
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,340
Give us another question.

1928
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,340
That guy's is out of date.

1929
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,340
He should have thought about the fact

1930
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,340
that it wouldn't get to him for a week.

1931
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,340
You're right.

1932
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,340
Just tell everyone there

1933
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,340
that Bernie would have won.

1934
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,340
Whoa.

1935
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,340
Yeah.

1936
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,340
Well, no,

1937
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,340
because nothing can win against Hillary.

1938
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,340
Hillary is perfect.

1939
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,340
Oh, how are you doing that pop-out stand thing?

1940
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,340
My pop-out stand is the greatest thing

1941
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,340
in my life right now.

1942
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,340
It's bigger than me.

1943
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,340
It's huge.

1944
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,340
It's massive.

1945
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,340
And I got to tell you,

1946
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,340
I got to tell you,

1947
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,340
she's been standing behind me for days now.

1948
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,340
Every fucking time I turn around,

1949
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,340
I jump because she's just looking at me.

1950
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,340
She's just looking at me

1951
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,340
with that fucking smile on her face.

1952
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,340
Oh, man.

1953
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,340
There's actually an old photo of me

1954
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,340
with an Obama cut out from like four years ago,

1955
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,340
because we went to this one like catfish restaurant

1956
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,340
owned by like a black family,

1957
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,340
and they have an Obama room.

1958
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:10,340
Obama room.

1959
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,340
Okay.

1960
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,340
Yeah, it's an entire Obama room.

1961
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,340
Is this like a good Obama room

1962
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:15,340
or a bad Obama room?

1963
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,340
Where are they going with this?

1964
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,340
It's a good Obama room.

1965
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,340
It's a black family who owns a business.

1966
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,340
Oh, I see.

1967
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,340
We got to get a picture of Hillary.

1968
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,340
You're a Hillary cut out

1969
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,340
with my elated Arab gentleman.

1970
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,340
People have been tweeting about that.

1971
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,340
You definitely need that.

1972
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,340
Next time, we'll make sure that happens.

1973
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,340
I just imagine Nate has the same relationship

1974
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,340
that Dave does with the little cow.

1975
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,340
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1976
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,340
She's constantly up in my shit,

1977
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,340
moving around, spazzing out, doing crazy stuff.

1978
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,340
Looking at you with that knowing look,

1979
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,340
because she knows how to fix America.

1980
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:48,340
And she is, in fact, puppeted by the speed of light

1981
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,340
moving actual Hillary Clinton around my room.

1982
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,340
Moving her every time I blink.

1983
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,340
That's what's happening.

1984
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,340
Okay, here we go.

1985
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,340
This is a juicy question.

1986
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,340
All right, here we go.

1987
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,340
At PopVulture asks,

1988
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:05,340
rank every race from best to worst

1989
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,340
on how hot the women are.

1990
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,340
Well, that's easy.

1991
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,340
That's easy.

1992
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,340
The Pokemon race,

1993
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,340
the Dark Souls race,

1994
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,340
and then the Kirby race.

1995
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,340
Kirby is the last?

1996
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,340
Where Kirby's got to be first.

1997
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,340
They're the hottest.

1998
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,340
Yeah.

1999
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,340
Nate, you really phoned it in on that Kirby race.

2000
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,340
People were disappointed.

2001
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,340
Yeah, I was actually reading those replies today.

2002
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,340
They were disappointed.

2003
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,340
But I don't have fucking time to do all this shit.

2004
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:32,340
That was the problem.

2005
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,340
The problem is that we didn't have enough people.

2006
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,340
If it was just three people, it was just lame.

2007
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,340
We didn't have like five people at least.

2008
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,340
You need to have someone who sucks ass

2009
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,340
so that the show lasts long enough

2010
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,340
for everybody to discuss their strategies.

2011
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,340
You really kind of do need two people

2012
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,340
who really care.

2013
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,340
Yeah, you need at least two people

2014
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,340
who are real competitors.

2015
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,340
And the problem was there was really

2016
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,340
only one real competitor on that one.

2017
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,340
So yeah, it's true.

2018
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,340
It's true.

2019
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:56,340
So yeah, there you go.

2020
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,340
Nah, that's a shitty one.

2021
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,340
No, these are all shitty questions.

2022
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,340
Are any of these fucking good?

2023
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,340
No.

2024
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,340
Oh, no.

2025
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,340
I'm just responding to how bad all your questions are.

2026
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,340
Get the fuck out of here.

2027
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,340
You got the best things.

2028
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,340
Here we go, guys.

2029
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,340
Here we go.

2030
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,340
Add Benjamin Whistle as,

2031
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:17,340
is Nicholas Cage the worst or best actor ever?

2032
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,340
Fucking Benjamin.

2033
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:20,340
What the fuck?

2034
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,340
Stupid retard.

2035
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,340
Benjamin Whistle.

2036
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,340
Benjamin Whistle.

2037
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,340
You're a fine bloke.

2038
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:29,340
But get this meme shit out of here.

2039
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,340
All right.

2040
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,340
Can I just find one decent question?

2041
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,340
No, these are all bad.

2042
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,340
Why don't we not have fans asked by Munchie?

2043
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,340
Here's a good question.

2044
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,340
Who's better?

2045
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,340
What's a better show?

2046
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,340
Kill La Kill or Hey Arnold?

2047
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,340
Wait, we already answered that question.

2048
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,340
And you could find the answer

2049
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:50,340

Four episodes.

2054
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,340
The fourth of which is a discussion

2055
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,340
on whether Kill La Kill or Hey Arnold is better.

2056
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:05,340
I'm there.

It's a good question.

2062
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,340
Not only that, gentlemen.

2063
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,340

2083
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,340

2085
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,340
or whatever.

2086
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,340
The links in the description.

2087
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:53,340
You remember.

2088
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,340
Buy our shit.

2089
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,340

So go buy our shit.

2093
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,340
Don't buy a house.

2094
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,340
Your ex-wife will take it from you in the divorce.

2095
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:06,340
I shouldn't have gone to prenup.

2096
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,340
No.

2097
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,340
If you ain't no punk, hola, we want prenup.

2098
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,340
We want prenup.

2099
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:11,340
Yeah.

2100
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,340
We want prenup.

2101
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,340
It's something that you need to have,

2102
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:14,340
because if she leaves your ass,

2103
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,340
she gonna leave with half.

2104
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,340
Leave with half.

2105
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,340
All right.

2106
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,340
It's fucking enough.

2107
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:19,340
Wait, do we have another question?

2108
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,340
Did you ever find a good one?

2109
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,340
No.

2110
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,340
No, I didn't.

2111
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,340
I was just going to end it there.

2112
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,340
I was just going to pay that right.

2113
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,340
Bye, bye.

2114
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,340
Bye, bye.

2115
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:33,340
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2116
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:38,340
I'm supposed to be working right now

2117
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:42,340
But i'm not working.

2118
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:47,340
I'm doing nothing.

2119
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,340
Why did I come jerking?

2120
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:52,340
Myself, I'm sucking.

2121
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,340
I am a stupid

2122
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,340
I got a deadline

2123
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,340
Don't wanna do it
