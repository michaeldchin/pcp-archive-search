00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I'm the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Digibro.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
If you can't tell the meme, you should.

4
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,560
But a welcome one, that's the one.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,480
Hippocrit, there you go.

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm alright, I'm pretty good.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm a pretty good character on the Pro Crastinators.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,560
I agree.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,480
And then the opposite of that would be Tom Oliver's here.

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,640
I have nothing to say, but I'm very upset.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,720
How dare you.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,600
Oh, okay, okay.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
I go on your stream and everything and give you hours of free entertainment out of my time.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
And you betray me the very next day.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,480
That's true, that's true.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,920
Disgusted.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,800
Join us on the best guy ever live stream yesterday.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,560
We're streaming Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and it was a great time.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Munchy and FitMC were there too.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
You should check it out on twitch.tv.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,760
God damn it, we're not even two minutes in, and ads.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
Oh, that's what the people really come for.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,080
No.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,600
Let me get paid for this shilling.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,720
I know, but I do.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
At least to Squarespace.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,920
How often have you guys started like a YouTube video now and the fucking, like as soon as you hear the ad, you just start going,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,720
No.

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,920
I usually like, I go on recommended and I'm like, I mean, that sounds kind of interesting.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Clicking is like, is this video sponsored by Squarespace gone?

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
Like, I would rather just not.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,080
It's the only videos that I get stuck with that on are things that YouTube recommends to me.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,840
VPNs are the big hot thing.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,080
When are we going to get a VPN ad deal?

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,200
This episode of the Procrastinators podcast is brought to you by Private Internet Access.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,680
Private Internet Access is the most secure VPN for making sure you can get past all the geoblocks on your internet connection.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,200
Watch lolliporn without being spied on by the government.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,600
Private Internet Access slash the Procrastinators.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
I mean, that would, that would be on brand, I think.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,280
It would absolutely be on brand.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,360
Man, I don't know.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,480
Have you seen a lot of this?

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,320
I see what people seem to be doing.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,040
I've thought about maybe this makes sense to incorporate, and I don't know.

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,360
We Aguas or something, but it's like, they start with like a summary of the issue.

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,880
You see like, today's episode of whatever, we're talking about how the libtards got blown the fuck out once again by strong African Americans or whatever.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,600
But first, your VPN security or whatever, and then they go into it.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Ben Shapiro is the worst at that.

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
It's like a meme now.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,960
Every time I listen to a show, it'll be, he'll be like, but first, and I'll immediately alt tab back to it.

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,480
And then like, he'll always have like a little like, cut in of it, and then I'll just scroll to when that like,

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
image disappears.

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,440
I can just skip all his ads.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,320
It's great.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,680
You know, it makes sense.

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,560
The good news is, since this is a YouTube video, do you guys spam ever since that hero, that unsung hero who I'll never forget that he taught me this,

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,560
grade A under A, with like his first big video teaching me that space bar is bullshit,

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,200
K is the instant pause or play video button on your keyboard,

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,800
and J and L are the skip forward and back 10 seconds buttons.

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,320
I'll never forget what a hero he is for teaching me that.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
For some reason, that is stuck with me.

62
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,760
It's like the grade A under a tutorial that the only thing I actually care about him for.

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
Wait, why is that helpful?

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Why is that better than using the space bar there?

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,160
For some reason, when pressing the space bar, just sometimes it just doesn't work and like it does some other function, but cable always forces it.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,480
It's specifically, for whatever reason.

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,880
You have to have the window selected in order for it to work.

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, the window selection, I think, all that allows you to use it.

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
No, the video selected rather.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
Like you have to have clicked on the video last as opposed to have somewhere else on the page.

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,480
But if you're just on the page, the J, K, and L, those work just as long as the window is selected.

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,640
Interesting.

73
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,200
So interesting.

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,680
It's better.

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,480
It's dope.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,200
It's real good.

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,760
It's real good.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Rest in peace.

79
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,880
I wonder what that guy's up to.

80
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,680
Him and Leafy.

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
Just in retirement.

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,800
I don't know.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
You think, do you think, here's the thing.

84
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
Do you think we're just going to see continuous cycles of internet content creators forever?

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,560
Absolutely.

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,520
As you rise to prominence.

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,160
I think, yeah.

88
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
That's just top culture in general.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
I was looking curiously at Game Grumps.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,800
I had stopped watching for a long time and they have had this new show called 10-Minute Power Hour,

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
which is like Aaron and Dan doing live action stuff.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
And that is the most popular thing because it's actually funny.

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,960
Yeah.

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,320
But the Game Grumps episodes are getting like 100 something to 500 something K views,

95
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,800
which is still a lot, but they have like 5 million subscribers.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,000
And back in the day, they were getting basically the same, if not more, views than they were subscribers.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,640
And it's just like less people give a shit, but more people subscribe.

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,320
And I don't, like Game Grumps, I feel like if they keep going down this road of just being

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,680
not that interesting, they're going to die.

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
And it's going to be really sad when it happens.

101
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,800
That's true.

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
But it's good to see them mixing up the formula, I guess, with new stuff.

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
I haven't really been keeping tabs on that.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,160
I mean, I feel like they're going to, you know, survive like Aaron and all that.

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,480
But like the Game Grumps Let's Play show might actually end at some point.

106
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
And it won't even be like I'm sad that it's gone.

107
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,760
Because I wasn't watching it.

108
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,400
But like it just, it just makes me feel like everything is temporary.

109
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,280
Yep.

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,520
I have been really fascinated looking back through my own history of all my videos,

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,920
like all the different people I collaborated with,

112
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,920
and how many of them have just simply evaporated from the internet entirely.

113
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,720
Like people who were really good, and then they just like closed shop and disappeared.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
And you've never heard from them again.

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,160
And it's just like, well, I guess what's what happens when YouTube doesn't really

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,040
pan out after a couple of years, you know, you're just gone.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,160
It's true.

118
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,800
It's true.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
I mean, even like, I don't know, things like the My Little Pony thing,

120
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,360
obviously that's tied to like a specific show.

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
But like, I don't know.

122
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,480
An interesting example I think of is a guy like who is still somewhat active.

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,040
And I quite like the guy, but it's Holden Reviews, the anime reviewer guy.

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,240
And that guy, like what happened to him is, as I understand it,

125
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,160
he kind of stopped doing YouTube as much because he just actually is a real animator

126
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
in the industry now.

127
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
So like, okay, so he's he's doing just fine.

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,360
But like his, I mean, it makes me wonder, like, for how many people is YouTube,

129
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,320
like a place to like, you know, rest and like, actually build a future on kind of,

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,160
where as opposed to it being like a step, I don't know how much involved it was for him.

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,760
I think for him, it was just fun.

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,480
But like, because he was he's like an animator at heart, as I understand it.

133
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,400
But and he did like anime reviews and stuff.

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
But now he's back to actually animating.

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,080
So but you can tell in his videos, like there was so much extra work put into them

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
that probably didn't give a return on investment.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,640
Like I very much know that feeling.

138
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,560
But yeah, I mean, I wonder for how many people you can actually carve out a long standing space

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
that you can, I mean, I guess it depends if you're trying to make a living on it or not.

140
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
That makes a big difference.

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:52,160
I mean, yeah, the living on it, that it was always annoying to see that like animators like left.

142
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I mean, this has been said a million times, like the way that the algorithm rewards

143
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
frequency of content and longer videos.

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,400
It just it just ends up like ruining people in terms of like they get all of their content out

145
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
that they could ever possibly make really fast.

146
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,600
And then for the rest of their life, they have nothing to do except do sponsorship deals

147
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,960
and sort of fuck around.

148
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah, because it's all about the frequency.

149
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,360
If it wasn't about the frequency, they could spend time to make, you know,

150
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,640
movies or short films or whatever it is, like like larger projects that stand on their own

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,280
and people return to algorithms are ruining our straight up.

152
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah.

153
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah, that's I mean, and I would argue that it's also kind of the the impetus for frequency of

154
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
content because I don't know yet.

155
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,600
We've said it a bunch before, but it's like, how much interesting stuff do you really have to say?

156
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
Probably not that much.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
Everything's been said a million times.

158
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,520
So like you either need to be like a fucking Logan Paul style daily vlogger and like get into

159
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,400
shenanigans or just like talk about everything you think about and get people into that.

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,520
Or you can like take your time, cultivate something actually interesting to say and like

161
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,120
do some real work like an animator would or I don't know, like a documentary maker, for example.

162
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,440
And then, you know, it comes out and it's like a big like, oh, wow, this is impressive.

163
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
It's like the two options you have.

164
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
Here's something that ties into this.

165
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
I was thinking like advertising is the end of like the Internet.

166
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,040
If we keep relying on advertising, we will all die.

167
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,440
And the thing happened recently is that Tumblr cracked down on pornography because

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,960
they weren't able to get like the iOS app store app, you know, they couldn't have their app on

169
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,960
because it had too much, you know, risque stuff.

170
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,360
I think it was some somebody found child porn and that got reported and it was like, oh shit.

171
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,400
And then Tumblr responded in by banning all and any sexual content at all

172
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,400
because they want the ad revenue because they're a YouTuber and they're struggling.

173
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,640
They got to water down their content.

174
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,480
And now everybody is basically like, OK, well, goodbye.

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,880
Everybody's leaving and Tumblr will have nothing.

176
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,600
Like I get this idea.

177
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
I just heard about that today that like the reason was because they were trying to launch an app

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,440
and it got rejected and shit.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,840
Like Twitter is on fucking Apple.

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
Twitter has porn.

181
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,240
Like to ban all porn is way over the top.

182
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
No, but it's because, you know, if people were aware,

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
like if the companies were aware of the stuff that was on all the platforms,

184
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
none of the platforms would be allowed.

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,640
Yeah, it's just because like some incident caused

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
caused iOS to be a web browser.

187
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
You know, there's a lot of really nasty stuff on the Internet.

188
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
Yeah, it's it's just like that there was an event that

189
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,280
clued iOS or Apple into Tumblr being a porn thing.

190
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Like some executive gets a note saying Tumblr is bad.

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,760
He's like, oh, I guess we get rid of it.

192
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,320
Well, like it's gone gone.

193
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,040
I've been here.

194
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,880
No escaping the fact that we have all literally all of us.

195
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
I mean, I'm sure there's some saints out there who I guess haven't,

196
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,720
but any adult, I would argue, has done something in their life.

197
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,960
If the entire information of your life was laid out before like a judge in a fucking jury,

198
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,080
none of us would be innocent and we would all be shut down or taken off whatever

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,600
because you can just cherry pick.

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,280
And that's that's it.

201
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,240
You can characterize people based on their worst actions once or twice.

202
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
And I mean, and that's why like that's actually a great argument.

203
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,000
Literally, why have we not banned every Internet browser?

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
Because they all facilitate your exposure to hate speech.

205
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
I can go to altright.com or whatever.

206
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
Communism dot like whatever's evil.

207
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
I can just go there.

208
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,200
Nate, don't tell me.

209
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,760
Dot com.

210
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,920
Well, like the reason has to be right that they are a like they're a what's

211
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
the distinction that's being made?

212
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,960
They're not a curator of content.

213
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,720
They are a a platform.

214
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
That's the platform of a publisher.

215
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,960
That's got to be the defense that allows the shit to work, right?

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,320
Because like how does any browser defend itself while allowing you to get to literally hateful

217
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,840
places unless that's the argument that they're not choosing what to show you.

218
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,720
It's on the consumer to choose what they are and aren't exposed to.

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The weird thing, though, is that like legally all these social media sites are platforms

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,800
and not publishers, even though they're making editorial decisions as tumblers clearly exemplifying

221
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,640
right now, they're currently getting away with having their cake and eating it too.

222
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,920
And that's at some point, I would hope that that gets addressed or like like a lawsuit

223
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,360
against a company like this, like by people being ideologically repressed or whatever.

224
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,960
Like I get, you know, they're a free company, but like that you can't curate the shit that

225
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,600
you choose to ban and also say you're free and open platform because you are making

226
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,080
decisions on an editorial basis about what it is and that you're lying what you're not.

227
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,280
There's more to the tumbler thing because I started looking into it because like

228
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,080
my friend Matt, who I do market how do it, like his blog got pulled and like he lost all his shit.

229
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,120
Shit, what was it for what?

230
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,600
He did like NSFW commissions and like lived off of it for like a year and like made a lot of

231
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,080
money off it and they just got deleted and because they deleted accounts, all of his safer work

232
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,480
stuff got deleted as well because they were tied to the same account. And like he got them back

233
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,080
after like bitching about it, but like the next day they're like, Oh, we're just deleting all this

234
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,360
on the 17th. Anyway, so this was his tumbler page. This was on tumbler. Yeah. But the interesting

235
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,160
thing with tumbler is that like apparently tumbler was already planning on doing an NSFW

236
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,400
ban because tumbler, it started back in like 2011. It was an independent company. Then in 2013,

237
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:56,080
it was purchased by Yahoo. Yahoo did nothing with it. So in last year, 2017, tumbler was bought

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,400
from Yahoo or I think Yahoo entirely was bought by Verizon. So tumbler is owned by Verizon now and

239
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,440
they wanted to use that network of like tumbler and like Yahoo stuff to sell ads. So the reason,

240
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,200
like they're not making any money off tumbler right now because of all that the porn shit,

241
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,320
they can't sell ad space against it. So it all comes back to Gibbs point about how ads are ruining

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
the internet. Well, that's that's why I thought that's why you brought it up, I think, right?

243
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:31,840
The yeah, the future I feel is like people funding the stuff they like. I'm glad we have Patreon.

244
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm just I'm just like wary of like Patreon also succumbing to this bullshit.

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,640
And they just banned a bunch of they banned Milo Yiannopoulos. Yeah, and a few other guys.

246
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,840
Did you guys? Sargon got banned as well in this recent thing. And the the reason why they banned

247
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,960
Sargon is very interesting. And it was because I have I saw his video about it before this,

248
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:04,240
it was that on someone else's live stream. He used the word white hard R n word, right, and to

249
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,200
describe the alt right as like they're acting like the black people they claim to like think

250
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,680
or lesser and like bad and shit. So he used that term to describe them. And so that's that's

251
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:23,280
so on someone else's why it was not on his channel. I mean, he didn't do you a couple for that,

252
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,040
right? Because I mean, you should know did you because the man's got an edgy soul,

253
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,440
and which I can certainly relate to. I can too. But like, even I would make sure

254
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,160
that if I was going to use a phrase like that, it was in a context that was that I could easily

255
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,640
defend myself on, you know, well, like the context is fairly good hearted. Like he's making an

256
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,280
anti identitarian argument in the like in his actual say, saying like, guys, guys, all right,

257
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,320
people who are currently trolling me, you're acting like the people that you claim to hate and are

258
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,760
bigoted against by doing that, he's like implying that the type of people that they hate exist

259
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,000
and are worthy of that hatred. I mean, he would absolutely argue and was his point that like

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,720
he doesn't agree with that, but by their argument, they're behaving like in this way.

261
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,640
So I can't be confused. Not worth it. Not worth the joke. Okay, that's fair.

262
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,800
That's fair. Not worth getting yourself in trouble for.

263
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Well, what's interesting about it is that Jack Conte in his in his interview with Dave Rubin

264
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,120
specifically, this is like a year ago or something, a couple months, he specifically states

265
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,040
about how they police the content that people host on Patreon, as well as their, I think it's

266
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,000
manifest observable actions, like the shit you do in real life. Like, like Lauren Southern,

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,560
when she got banned, that's because she got her boat to like interfere with migrants trying to get

268
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,560
to Europe or whatever. So like, okay, that's something she did. Sargon, like, I, this is not

269
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,440
a manifest observable. He didn't do anything. He used a word that, you know, they, they don't care

270
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,560
for, which is okay, fair enough. But it was on someone else's stream, whereas the trust and

271
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,400
safety people were the ones who actually banned Sargon because he had used this thing on someone

272
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,000
else's stream. But Jack Conte made it super clear. They only police as long as it's not

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,200
manifest observable behavior, anything you say is your business elsewhere. They are only going

274
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,680
to ban you on Patreon. If it's content supported by Patreon, and this is somebody else's stream,

275
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,080
this was unrelated. He didn't post this shit to Patreon. So I mean, basically, there's a

276
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,400
lies going on here. It's not lies. It's just, it's just general incompetence. They say that

277
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,440
they're going to do that. But if they get like, you know, they're, you know, they probably would

278
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,320
be like, I fucking hate Sargon, but we got nothing on him. Like, like, there's some people who just,

279
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,520
you know, they have some general idea of what a certain type of person is on my platform.

280
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
And they get a small opportunity to get rid of him. They're like, oh, good. And even if it's not

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,760
like malicious, it could just be somebody got informed. And it is, you know, the same thing

282
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,960
with like, the executive getting a note, saying Tumblr is bad, the executive of Patreon getting

283
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,240
a note. This guy said a bad word. This is a bad thing. This guy's a bad guy. It's like, oh, he's

284
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,680
a bad guy, click the bad guy button, ban that bad guy, the word lie. I should not have done that

285
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,280
because I hate, I feel like saying the word lie implies direct malicious intent, all that stuff,

286
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
which I don't think was had. I think these are people in their bubbles, not communicating outside

287
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
clearly and then like having different views of the world. I mean, in this case, this does seem like

288
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,600
an actual miscommunication between like the trust and safety people and Jack, because Jack said,

289
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,480
like, you won't be judged this way unless you physically do something in the real world. I

290
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,320
don't know. Maybe they have an issue with like Sargon literally being a political

291
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,080
entity now. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't trust anybody to say anything that is

292
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,400
what they will do. Yeah. Because it's never, ever happened. I would be willing to say that they

293
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,680
probably legitimately think that Sargon performed some kind of illegal hate speech with what he said.

294
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,800
Like, they probably just think that like what he did in real life was in fact like, like, if they

295
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,120
don't have necessarily even the full context into what he said, or if they do, and they just think

296
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,160
that even with context, it comes across as hate speech, they might just see it as like, oh, like,

297
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,240
this guy crossed the line that we don't allow creators to cross. I don't know if they have,

298
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,160
if they're supposed to have a line like that, though. Well, here's the fucked up thing.

299
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,320
This put, this means that we all can be banned from Patreon at any time. Yeah, the groundwork

300
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,600
has been set because like we've all done basically the same thing that Sargon did. We've all hard

301
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,800
arred on this podcast. Well, I don't know if it's just the fact that he hard arred or like the

302
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,840
implication behind his words. I would say that what we do probably is worse than that. If he's

303
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,280
trying to like insult, like take down like a hateful ideology by giving an example of their

304
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,680
own backwards thought. That's like, I think, a better moral ground than just saying the word

305
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,280
just for fun. That's true. Well, I mean, yeah, like, okay, like, because actually there was some

306
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
clarification on this, that it was like, the issue is you can't use the word, I think we said, in an

307
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,200
insulting way. So like, so okay, so like, if you simply state it in an academic way, like blah,

308
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,160
blah, blah, the, you know, the N word is used to insult people, blah, blah, racial hatred, whatever.

309
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,200
But like, if you, if you call someone that, like, you call a black person that like, okay,

310
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,640
now you're insulting people. But he's calling white people that. So it's like, you know,

311
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,840
I don't know, I feel, I feel like they just didn't look at it very hard. I don't imagine people

312
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,080
looking at it very hard and thinking about anything. They just, oh, they heard the heart are

313
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,560
this is the bubble effect, because like, you get exposed to one tiny bit of information, like,

314
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,480
okay, he said the word, we've got an audio, you can hear it, like, boom, case closed, that's all we

315
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,440
need. Ship him down the line, it's over. It's really annoying how like, you know, robots and

316
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:15,360
algorithms are terrible, but also real humans are just as bad. We're all broken, we're all fucked up.

317
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,960
For the record, I don't even think the most malicious use of the word in the world should

318
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,840
be grounds for like, taking someone off the internet or banning them or whatever. I mean,

319
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,880
I've been thinking about this, like, I mean, this is stuff we probably already agree on.

320
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,640
And it's not like mind blowing. But like, I was just thinking like,

321
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,960
a much, much more racist thing to say is like, we don't serve your kind here. And that doesn't

322
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,840
have the heart are anywhere. That's true. It's just like, we've literally just, I mean, we've

323
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,200
talked about this, but like, we give words so much fucking power, guys. It's really just like,

324
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,440
the people who are actually racist know that they're going to get in trouble. So they just

325
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,360
imply it heavily and they can't get in trouble because they use the right words.

326
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,200
This is the thing that gets me about this. Okay, it's like, okay, like, like guys like PewDiePie,

327
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,320
guys like Sargon, they've, they've dropped that heart are my dude. Okay, got it. Literally,

328
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,600
what was the intent exactly what Tom just said? What was the intent here? Like, I mean, okay,

329
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,000
PewDiePie slips up and says it, you know why? Look, I feel an empathy with PewDiePie on this.

330
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,720
It's a word that makes people mad. And it's the worst word you can think of that I'm sure

331
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,520
that is why he said it. Because if you asked PewDiePie, why did you say that word? That's

332
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,440
what he would say. He wouldn't say, you know, let's get back to Sargon. Like, why did you say

333
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,920
this word? He's like, well, because I'm trying to create a point that like the alt right is wrong

334
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,760
about their, you know, whatever racist stance. And so that's why I use the word like if you

335
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,680
and okay, you ask, okay, how do you feel about black people? And he's going to be like, yeah,

336
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,080
it's fine, you know, right? It's cool. Nothing to worry about their races are different or, you

337
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,680
know, there are different races. It's fine. There's I don't discriminate. Like, okay, you ask them

338
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,080
the question, you get the answer. But no, we need to deduce the true nature of people because

339
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,320
they're all going to lie to us. They're going to attempt to pull the wool over our eyes, right?

340
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,280
We can't take people at their word. But if you just talk to them, they would tell you how they

341
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,840
feel about this shit. But we got to be the fucking Gestapo here. We got to be the fucking moral

342
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:25,200
police. You know, what it really comes down to is not that like people are excessively moral,

343
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,120
but like if Patreon was just, you know, inclusive, and people who were racist could get a platform,

344
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,240
it just depends on them finding racists to be paying them. Like if there was no moral,

345
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,960
you know, jumping in, it was just like a neutral platform, then they would lose money over like

346
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,160
PR disasters of like, Patreon accepts Nazism. And then a competitor would come up and say,

347
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,480
we're lovely on, we love people and we're against hate speech. Patreon's not against hate speech.

348
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,200
So come to us instead. And then that site would get all of the money and then Patreon would have to

349
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,680
be like, oh, shit. It's always a fucking money thing. And I don't like that.

350
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,320
I think that it's it's a money thing. But I also think that it has to do with the fact

351
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,880
that Patreon and like all these companies that are doing all these rules are from like Silicon

352
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,440
Valley, like the same kind of area in California. And they're largely informed by the moral values

353
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,400
of what is like normal there. And like when you're in a place where there's just like an

354
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,840
overwhelming amount of not just like liberal people, but like talking heads like media pundits

355
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,560
who are everywhere because every celebrity wants to have that as part of their image that they're

356
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:51,600
taken seriously. And everyone in Hollywood wants to have an agenda for for personal clout reasons

357
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,840
to have a narrative about who they are, you know, and like all these companies are surrounded by that

358
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,560
and following in that moral footstep. And it's really funny because Dick Masterson will talk

359
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,760
about this on his show and like complain about Silicon Valley types and their moral codes.

360
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,120
But he has he struggles to use the word retarded, like he'll stop himself, he'll avoid using it

361
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,520
because where he's from, it's like seen as a big deal to use that word because they're just like

362
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,040
it had like major policing on it in the late 2000s. So it's like a whole campaign against it

363
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,440
where I'm from people say retarded constantly. Yeah, it's totally not offensive to me. No,

364
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,440
not in the slightest. So like, it's really fucking funny when I hear him like stop himself from

365
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,880
saying retarded, he'll say it anyways, but like he'll he'll whinge about doing it. And I'm like,

366
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,840
it's really fucking hilarious to see the guy who writes men are better than women whinging about

367
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,680
using the word retarded on his fucking show. But that's how deeply it affects you when you live

368
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,640
in a place where everyone feels that way, where they really will give you shit for using the word

369
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,080
and like make you feel bad and give you their sob story. See, like, you know, like in in this

370
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,680
discussion today, I'm censoring myself saying the n word because I'm here giving it power.

371
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,840
But nigga, it goes out. There you go. Nigger. See, it's fine. We're talking about in an academic

372
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,160
way. What Sargon said, white nigger, everyone. That's what he said. Now, you know, you've heard

373
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:33,120
it from my mouth. Like retarded roles like butter, baby, like butter. Oh, it feels good. I love it.

374
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,960
And like, I mean, the word okay, just I this is silly, whatever we're talking about this, but

375
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,720
like the word idiot and moron literally defined clinical states of being for people of like

376
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,560
mental disability or low IQ. It's just that nobody gives a shit anymore. That's the only difference

377
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,240
that culturally we don't care. And guess what? I grew up in a culture where nobody fucking cared

378
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,560
about saying the word retarded. So what are you going to oppress my culture with your culture

379
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,880
out on the fucking west coast or whatever? Why do you get the right to do that? You don't. Fuck you.

380
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,560
And I'm not just going to say that people the most offended just win in every situation. Like

381
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,400
no, and those those people who are in California and they're looking at it in that that mindset,

382
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,120
again, to them it's normal, but it's not just that it's normal for them. It's that the people

383
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,080
around them are yelling at the rest of the country because of their perception of how those people

384
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,800
are that they perceive it as like, oh, everyone's everyone's being mean to retarded people and

385
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,920
offending them. And it's like, no one even connects this phrase to like an actual like nobody

386
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,280
recognizes a retarded person when they see them per se. We call things retarded when you like

387
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,840
just a regular person does something stupid, you know? Yeah, it's culture shock. It's global

388
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,760
culture shock. I just it doesn't mean anything. It's and I'm going to keep saying new fag moral

389
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,240
fag. It's interesting with with gay because like, yeah, gay is become a little bit more like fag is

390
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,040
more acceptable than gay to me. It's probably true since like, um, like, I don't know just where I

391
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:11,440
was when gayness was like becoming it was it was a thing in school people would say, oh, you're gay.

392
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,200
And then I was growing up and on the internet people were gay and I was like, oh, is it okay to

393
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,480
be gay? And then I realized it was but it was just like and like now I can't say that because that's

394
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,000
not very nice. But then, you know, fag, I'd never heard of fag. We don't say fag in the UK. So I can

395
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,880
say fag it all the time every day. Do you still say fagged for cigarettes or is that just an old

396
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,360
school thing? It's it's a bit of an old school thing. All the older gentlemen in the old cockney

397
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,400
London town would probably say fags. That's for that. You know, this this whole thing reminds me

398
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:53,280
of Majid Nawaz, the the Islamic guy, anti and basically anti like extremist activist and

399
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,920
shit. And he he made the point that like when he was getting sued by sorry, he sued the Southern

400
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Poverty Law Center, which is based in Alabama, a bunch of white dudes, these guys decide what is

401
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
acceptable and like what's hate speech. And then they let everybody know they put you on a fucking

402
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120
list as they did with him, basically putting a target on his back for extremists to come to.

403
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,880
And like, these people are dictating what this Muslim man these Christian guys are dictating

404
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,280
what this Muslim man is allowed to criticize about his religion and his culture. And they deem

405
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,440
the fact that he has identified this is not me making a judgment. This is his words that like

406
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,120
there's an extremist problem in Islam, like and he wants to work on that and address it within

407
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,800
like respectfully as a Muslim himself within the culture. And they call that hate speech. Well,

408
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,360
there's a reason why he sued them for that and fucking one and that they had to take it back

409
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,920
and apologize. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Yeah. And there's a bunch of fucking

410
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,440
white Christian dudes policing with this fucking guy who was deep in the shit man deep in the

411
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,480
shit went to fucking jail for like 10 years for being an extremist. Yeah, that's right.

412
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,760
I might might might have been a little bit less than that, but it was a long fucking

413
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,200
time. Well, I'm glad he fucking sued him. Yeah, damn right. And he fucking won. And I don't think

414
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,680
they've learned anything, but I don't know. Hopefully the money will make him regret it.

415
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:24,800
I think he won like three million or something. Oh, God, man. Well, you know what people, we get

416
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,640
it, right? We're all on the same page here. You know what? You don't have to fucking agree with me

417
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,640
exactly, but at least represent like if you're going to debate me, just all I ask is that you

418
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,680
actually address the points that I'm saying or anybody else is saying, right? When we talk past

419
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,160
each other, it's a complete fucking waste of time. Yeah, please. Nothing gets done. I always want to

420
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,040
remind anybody who listens to this show. I can't speak for you guys, but I don't listen to any

421
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,080
fucking political shit on the internet. There's nobody who I follow who's like my political guiding

422
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,280
light. And like a lot of these fucking kids, when you start going on like a political tirade,

423
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,960
they start trying to figure out who you're quoting or like who they can find a video essay that their

424
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,040
side has made that they can link to you to show you the other side of the argument. And it's just

425
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,920
like, look, I'm not coming at this because I have like an agenda. I don't vote, you know? I don't give

426
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,320
a fuck. I'm just looking at the world and trying to parse it in a logical manner to be consistent

427
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,760
with its own rules, you know? I respect that. I must admit, I'm getting, well, listen to a bit more,

428
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,160
you know, a couple of years ago, listen to the Young Turks a lot these days, listen to more

429
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,200
like Sargon and Tim Pool and guys. I wish I could just, I want to just not do any of it. Are those

430
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,760
like political opposites from each other? Yeah, they are. Yes, they are. Yes, they are. That's

431
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,840
because like things have gotten a lot more extreme. And it's funny that you mentioned that because like

432
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,360
I have only starting like three days ago, I made an active decision to unsubscribe from all the

433
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,600
political shit and just not a bad stop. Every time they pop up on YouTube, just click not interested

434
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,200
because I feel bad because I think there is like some sort of, I think there is something valuable

435
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
in being like educated on what's going on in the world. And that's kind of why I got into it in

436
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,760
the first place because I wanted to like just be informed. Yeah, but it's such a fucking downer

437
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,480
sometimes. And I'm just like, that's, that's the reason that like, I really only listen to the dick

438
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,720
show that even comments on that kind of stuff. And to me, it's enough to just hear that that

439
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,920
something's happening. I don't want to hear anybody's like opinion about it. Like I don't want to hear

440
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,600
Sargon give his spin on a story because they all tell the stories in the way that benefits their

441
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,000
side. And even if they tell it well, like I love Razor Fist because he does a lot of research and

442
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,360
he will present a lot of evidence for a point, but he will always be more forgiving towards the

443
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,760
people on his side and like extra come down with people on the opposite side. And even if it's a

444
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,960
little tongue in cheek and like jokie and irreverent, it still is like, I have to take this with a grain

445
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,160
of salt because I know that you have an affiliation, you know, whereas with, with at least the dick

446
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:13,440
show, he is so politically neutral and somebody who normally wouldn't vote that like I can, he

447
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,520
doesn't usually really share his opinion on it. He just kind of riffs on the fact that a thing is

448
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,920
happening, you know, and that's easier for me to consume because it's not like a guy trying to

449
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,840
tell me how to feel about an event. It's just a guy reacting to it in a funny way. And then I hear

450
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,800
about it. I find out something's going on without having to listen to the hot takes and the immediate

451
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,600
press coverage that all wants to be as inflammatory as possible because that's what gets attention.

452
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,360
You know, I was just going to say where our brains are just being captured, at least, you know,

453
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,320
me, for example, like Tim Pool is a smart guy. I like him, but I do feel he is going for the

454
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,080
clickbait titles and like they, I'm sure a part of it's like a joke and self-aware, but I can just

455
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,800
feel the aura of like, let's get these views, let's like represent the story, at least with the title,

456
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,640
you can like read further for clarification, like, oh my god, battlefield five, you know, hates all

457
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,040
men or something, and not that he necessarily did that, but like they do it on both sides, right?

458
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,000
They skew things a little bit, they tweak it just based on maybe their own perceptions or something,

459
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,160
but like, you don't get the full truth when you listen to either people embedded and whatever,

460
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,520
Tim Pool's in the middle or whatever, but it's just, the whole thing is, it's unproductive

461
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,440
and probably specifically counterproductive to just making your life better, working hard on

462
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,360
shit you care about. It's a good thing that we did something unproductive for the last half an hour

463
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:50,080
then talking about this and wasting everybody's time. I just think that like it's, it's not cool

464
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:58,880
or like a good idea to be ignorant willingly, but I feel like it is very respectable to admit

465
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,520
when you are ignorant on something rather than taking any old thought that you hear.

466
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,000
You know what the thing about that is though, Gib, I feel, the reason that I'm, I feel almost

467
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
paralyzed politically a lot of the time, it's because I legitimately feel everybody,

468
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,640
basically everybody who's not a complete idiot. By the way, offensive word, why are you okay with

469
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,200
that word and not retarded people, think about it. God, I'm so fucking smart, my brain is absolutely

470
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:34,320
check, I can't, Jesus Christ. I checkmated all of them. I forgot my point now because I was just

471
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,280
talking about how smart I was. Okay, you know what, it doesn't matter.

472
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,880
All right guys, I had to, oh, Kippo, you go ahead. Oh, no, no, if you got something.

473
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,720
I had a great idea for a good Pokemon anime. Okay. It would be like a mixture of like Code

474
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,840
Geass and Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon and the idea is that the main character is like, like a guy with

475
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,800
like a big smile on his face, scheming, kind of like Sora from No Game, No Life and he's like,

476
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,440
I'm gonna become the champion through fucking tactics. And so through the show, you'll see

477
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,960
him like watch other, he'll watch like a gym leader fight somebody else and they'll pull out like,

478
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,120
you know, you'll see their spread and like what tactics they're using and why they're so hard to

479
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:23,040
beat and then he'll come in and he'll have like really obscure counter picks. So like every time

480
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,160
he reveals his Pokemon, it's always like, oh yeah, like muck happens to have an immunity to this

481
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,360
thing. I was inspired for this because of a false swipe gaming, the YouTube channel who

482
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,880
of all of you heard of him, if not for anyone in the audience who doesn't know,

483
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,240
he does videos that are about how viable each Pokemon was throughout the generations in competitive

484
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,720
play. And because of the fact that Pokemon's competitive play is split into categories

485
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,080
where there's like the Ubers, the underused, the overused, like Pokemon can have, you know,

486
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,360
matchups that like even if it's not the best Pokemon, it could have a place in one of those

487
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,600
categories of fighting. So because of that, there's lots of really unique matchups that

488
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,480
can happen in Pokemon where like specific guys can be used for specific tactics. And if you wrote

489
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,320
an anime around that, it would make Pokemon seem really cool and deep and smart. And it would be

490
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,880
really fun to watch and the main character would be a badass. And you could get away with making it

491
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,640
like it would feel kind of edgy without having to actually be edgy. Like it would be completely

492
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,760
family friendly, but older. If you made it look cool enough, older kids would also be into it,

493
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,960
you know, that just kind of just sounds like the earlier generations and the nerds were kind of

494
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,480
afraid of like being a little bit edgy with like Mewtwo's origin and shit, as opposed to now where

495
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,680
it's kitty baby fuck time. I don't think it's kitty baby fuck time now. But like, like the movies

496
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,920
later had like a fucking war in one of them. Did you know there was a Pokemon war in one of the

497
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,280
movies? Did they shoot guns? Oh, was it was that the one with them? Well, there was a war in Gen

498
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,520
one with Lieutenant Surridge having come back from the war with his electric boys. That's true,

499
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,080
but they show a war in one of the movies where like people are writing on mammoth swines and

500
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,400
thrusting spears into each other, like writing on mammoth swines and Charizard's. It's in like

501
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,040
the Diamond and Pearl movies, I think, or the black and white movies. Dude, I'd love to write a

502
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,480
Charizard and then kill everyone with a spear. That would be great. Where's that Pokemon game?

503
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,840
You know, that reminds me of, did anybody ever watch a living flamethrower using a spear? Make

504
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,040
sense to me. Well, whatever. Did anybody ever actually watch? I always wanted to. There was

505
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,040
like an OVA that was I think it's six episodes long that like actually covers like red, like

506
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,560
actually charging the elite foreign shit. They're good. It's pretty sick. Like that that sound

507
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,200
like so there's the show the show in general is kitty baby fuck time. But this this OVA is like

508
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,640
technically more true to the games in that the character is actually making progress and like

509
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,800
defeating gyms left right and center and being a badass. I think the final episode is the final

510
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,520
champion fight against blue and all that. And dope. It's like actually hardcore legit. There's

511
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
like an infamous scene in that when he fights like something for the first time and I think he

512
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,920
had Charmander. His Charmander just gets like bitten and it just screams in pain for like 30

513
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,320
seconds and you're just like, oh, this is what we've been playing for years. That's a little

514
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,480
too real. That's a little different. Oh, wait, animal abuse is a thing. Like they went the root

515
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,360
of making it like, whoa, it's like a little like spooky because it's like violent. Do you like

516
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,240
they actually in pain? But like I want to go more the root of like the main character is like really

517
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,040
deeply strategic because yeah, like we'd frame it like Yu-Gi-Oh where you're just going to explain

518
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,640
what the thing does anyway. So it's it's going to be like they they fucking but like if you if you

519
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,720
know the game well enough, then you can see the things coming. You can see everything falling

520
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,560
into place and you'd be excited and we wouldn't reveal who the Pokemon that he has on his team

521
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,760
are until they like come out, you know. So it might be that like he watches a gym leader fight

522
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,240
and then it'll be like he goes, huh, guess I've got some Pokemon to go catch. And then like in

523
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,120
the next episode of he's fighting the gym leader and like maybe he'll like pick out a Pokeball

524
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,120
and he'll be like, huh, I thought you were going to use that. And then it'll cut to a flashback

525
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,520
of him like in a location where this Pokemon to be found. So if you know what it's going to be,

526
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,320
if you know what a good counter pick is, you'll be like, oh, shit, he's in the fucking power plant,

527
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,840
he's going to get fucking Zapdos, you know, and then we get like a clip of him catching Zapdos.

528
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,640
And like it'll be interspersed with footage of him summoning it for the battle. So then it's like

529
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,880
showing both the hard challenge he had of catching it as well as the challenge of using it to overcome

530
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,160
the boss, you know, and then like you can match cut like the ball

531
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,640
against like the final attack, fucking draining the last hit points off of the fucking boss,

532
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,920
you know. So that makes sense. Oh, so it's like Hiroyuki Sawano music, like Kill La Kill,

533
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,560
fucking attack on Titan, like epic fucking trick or Pokemon anime would be great.

534
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,240
Oh, yeah. Well, so would these okay, now I think I have the idea, but I gotta ask anyway,

535
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,680
are we talking about like actual game strats that would be implemented, or is it going to be like,

536
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,440
like you said inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh. So does that mean we're going to pull out like some weird

537
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,120
bullshit like the fact that was immune to electricity. There's already enough in the

538
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,520
actual meta of the game that if they did it based on the real meta, the fucking Pokemon

539
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,640
nerds would be like just eating it the fuck up like the guys who think the anime sucks because

540
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,360
it's baby shit because they like the deep tactics of the games like if you gave them an anime that

541
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,280
like played up, you know, the kind of shit that like Nuzlockers or competitive players are into

542
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,200
then like they'll fucking lose their minds. How long is it going to take? How long is it going to

543
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,000
take until like the Pokemon company, the game freak, like understands that there are a lot of

544
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,560
older big nerds that will love Pokemon if they made Pokemon. I think they will never care because

545
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,600
that's a much smaller group than just the world. Could they have like a branch of a game dev team

546
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,000
to make a little version of something? I mean, I think with Mario and Luigi RPG, those don't sell

547
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,320
as well as like the fucking, you know, big Mario platformer, but like people love them and they'll

548
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,560
buy them, so do it. I think that with the with Pokemon though, it's just that like the easier

549
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,400
way to reach the Pokemon is too big. Like it's bigger than its hardcore audience. Like yeah,

550
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,800
they could make games that were just for the hardcore people, but there's lots of adults who

551
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,640
will be interested in Pokemon in a much more basic way who just will play the kiddie games

552
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,800
and like the normie games and not even think about it. And like, I think that like let's go

553
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,640
Evie and Pikachu. Like a lot of people have made it to do about it being like a baby game, but I

554
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,280
think it's way more for like the people who were into Pokemon in the 90s and then got out of it and

555
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,160
then came back with Pokemon Go. And like it's trying to appeal to those people and be like, hey,

556
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,040
we remade that game from your childhood, but with the mechanics of the thing that you like to play

557
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,960
now and you know, reimagine with modern graphics. On today's episode, there's three people who like

558
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,440
Pokemon Go and then only me on the opposite side who has not even played the game. I

559
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,240
can't defend myself. I mean, let's go. I mean, let's go. I haven't played let's go either because

560
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,800
it's a video game and you got to buy it and I don't have money to put to like like Pokemon

561
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,320
Let's Go in a perfect world. If it was a free thing, I would definitely have it and I would love

562
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,240
it because it looks great and it gets rid of a lot of annoying tedious bullshit that didn't

563
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,040
like out of the Pokemon games because they are JRPGs and I don't really like that. They just take

564
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:44,160
so much time. Well, so like Pokemon Let's Go is great for me, but like I forgot the point I was

565
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,000
saying. Speaking of JRPGs, everybody go watch my Tales of Fantasia analysis on the I Am Games

566
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,400
channel. That was good. Thank you. I haven't watched it yet. It's like 50 minutes though, ain't it?

567
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, it's as long as fuck. It sounds deep as shit. By the way, by the way, just I was just

568
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,920
imagining. Okay, imagine that the the Pokemon OVA that you're thinking of there, Digi, is a nine

569
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,240
episode long OVA, maybe 10 if you want to one for each gym and then two for each gym and then but

570
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:21,280
imagine it. It basically it's like Katana Gatory or Katana Gatory, whatever it is. You got episode

571
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,400
one through eight where it's like insane strats, like talking about optimizing and observing gym

572
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,400
behavior and like what the leader does and then you beat them with tactically and you whatever.

573
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,880
But then the final episode, like he's prepped his team because I just experienced this with

574
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,000
my Nuzlocke. You prep your team. They're like God mode could prepare to defeat all of them in a row

575
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,800
and it's just like that final scene in the last episode of Katana Gatory where he just mows down

576
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,800
all of them for the final battle against the actually difficult one at the end who isn't

577
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,880
elementally themed. I fucking hated that Katana Gatory though. It was like I don't know why people

578
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,520
don't like it. It's so cool. Well, I didn't like the show at all. So well, okay, that's

579
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,640
understandable part of it. You know, Ben said the same thing though that like he thought I think it's

580
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,880
just that he hated the show and that the last episode. Okay, the thing is that like for me

581
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,320
watching that show like the writing style of Nisi always seen is that he likes to be extremely meta

582
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,240
and to like have all these twists for the sake of themselves. And to me, it felt very forced in

583
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,320
that show. It felt like he was like showing off how much he could undercut what he had set up.

584
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,960
You know, I mean, I just didn't even fucking I basically blanked out for the first like nine

585
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,280
episodes or whatever and just like let it wash you like well, there was like half an hour. Well,

586
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,520
there were like an hour long episodes. I think there was 12 the moment 13 or whatever. No,

587
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,920
because there's 12 stories. Yeah, okay, whatever point is like basically talked forever. And I

588
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,600
never cared about anything they were saying outside of like, just tell me how you're gonna

589
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,440
beat the next guy. Just tell me how you're gonna fucking fight this guy and not destroy the sword.

590
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,720
That's all I care about. Your personalities are boring and you're a blank slate, whatever. It's

591
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,720
fine. They're actually kind of interesting. There was that whole ninja thing going on. I didn't

592
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,440
care about that at all. I didn't know what the point of any of those characters was.

593
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,640
Do you know about how that story came about? No, I have no idea. It's a stunt novel where

594
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,840
Nisi Oesin decided to write a book every month for a year. So he wrote 12 books, one for each

595
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,720
sword and each one is just like about a different, you know, them trying to track down a different

596
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,040
sword held by a different person. And but that's also why it's like that's what I think sucks about

597
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:40,080
it. It clearly was just written like in a very speed, like efficient way and not really having

598
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,240
much thought put into it in the end. I bet that works way better as a book where I can like use

599
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,760
my imagination and like think because it just does not work as a fucking anime. And the show was

600
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,920
also adapted the same way. They did one episode a month for a year. That's why they were like 45

601
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,680
minutes long. And then fucking the last episode I felt was fucking dope. There were some weird

602
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,960
things, weird characters. I don't know. I don't know. This has been your PCP anime review for

603
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:15,920
get out of here plebe and the weave. All right. I have an artist's tale. A little story. A couple

604
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:24,560
days ago, I woke up at 7am with like a severe headache. And it was like the like a like a red

605
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,280
hot poker. The tip of a red hot poker was like in the center of my skull and I couldn't get at it.

606
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,440
And it really hurt. And it incapacitated me for the whole day. And I was just like drinking water

607
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,240
and trying to get better and feeling like shit and dying. And I couldn't work on any of the things

608
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,080
that I was working on up to that point. And because of that, like the day after I was still

609
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:53,680
recovering and I just I was trying so hard to work on the things and I was going all depressed

610
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:03,760
about like I'll just and I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't do anything. And it was just really

611
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,560
upsetting that like physical like pain could like interrupt my flow. And then I couldn't get it back

612
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,600
until just like five minutes before this podcast, where I was like, oh, you know, I should I should

613
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:23,440
do some stuff. And I was doing some stuff. And there was this one moment where I in order to

614
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,360
like cool off, I guess, I went outside at night out into the garden. And I was just looking at like

615
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,360
the silhouette of the trees, swaying in the breeze, the completely pitch black against like

616
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:43,600
the orange glow of the city street light street lamps off in the distance. And I was just I was

617
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:49,440
just like, God, like this, this, this is so beautiful and so calming and so perfect. And I

618
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,480
could only feel this particular way in this particular moment in having all this pain and

619
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,280
like slightly getting over it with this cold breeze and looking at this really nice like

620
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:10,800
this calming image. And I was just really, really wanted to to be able to like replicate that in

621
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,080
art in some way and show people how cool that this feeling I'm having is and I was so annoyed

622
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,160
because I suck at drawing and writing and everything. And I was like, I can't make this.

623
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,360
I can't paint a picture. I can't make a video game that feels like this.

624
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,080
Should have made a song.

625
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,440
God damn. I mean, I could but like I'm not I'm not even good at songwriting. I'm just

626
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,480
it was just really in that one moment.

627
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,400
It sucked.

628
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,960
I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I've felt that before.

629
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:47,840
The melancholy of not being able like knowing you can't replicate a feeling for,

630
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,240
you know, for yourself or for others.

631
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,960
I feel that I understand that because there's lots of like, there's lots of songs that I've

632
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,080
written in my head that are to express those kinds of feelings. But my pain is more from

633
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,320
not being able to replicate the sound in my head into reality that like, yeah, like I feel a certain

634
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:15,040
way. And then I go, oh, man, I could communicate how that felt this way. But I have no means by

635
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,960
wish to produce this thing in a way and like to enough of a degree that anybody would get it.

636
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,320
Because if I tried to just describe it to you, you won't get it. Like it needs to be done in

637
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:32,880
the form of like a song. But like, I just can't make that song. I don't know what I would need to

638
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,480
be able to. I don't even know what I don't know. Like I don't know what things I need to learn in

639
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,240
order to be able to produce this song. Yeah, that's what got me on the whole. Like, you know, I was

640
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,800
thinking I should I should figure out how to draw this and then make it real. And then people will

641
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,440
be like, Oh, dude, I know that sort of feeling. But it didn't work. And that was why I was getting

642
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,880
more depressed upon, you know, realizing that my skill level sucks. And I would need to work. But

643
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,360
it's so hard to work when I'm in so much pain. And I can't do anything. And I just ended up playing

644
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:12,000
Dark Souls 3, which is pretty good. At least that this story is a happy ending. Yeah. By the way,

645
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:21,200
unrelated, but kind of cool is Dark Souls 3. I usually spend like video game time, especially

646
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,400
Dark Souls, just listening to podcasts. But since I cut out so many podcasts, except Hello Internet,

647
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,800
I didn't really have anything to listen to while I was playing. And so I just had the

648
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,320
game audio and I had blasted it out the speakers. It was really loud. But it was like,

649
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:44,720
really immersive. Because, I mean, obviously, but like, imagine having the game audio be playing

650
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,520
when the game's playing. And it feels like it's a totally different experience. And I really

651
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,600
like it. And I would recommend people listen to that Foley. That Foley's really good. And it's

652
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,440
really scary when it's at max volume when you stab a guy and it's like, I can see it now. Give

653
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,320
just playing Dark Souls 3 having a grand old time, all the pain leaving him. And then he gets like a

654
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,480
calm point as he's like traversing through the land, he looks over and like the sun setting,

655
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,280
where these silhouettes of trees perfectly captured, he's like, God damn it, they can do it, but I

656
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,880
can't do it. That's that. Dude, it's exactly this sort of feeling. I was thinking like, oh, if I could

657
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,280
make a Miyazaki movie, there would definitely be a moment where it would see the silhouettes of the

658
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,080
trees and the city and this exact feeling would happen to me as a viewer. But dang it, I can't

659
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:41,280
do that. That's a lot of work. Yeah, it sure is. Fucking Miyazaki's. What the fuck? Yeah, why is the

660
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,240
world gay? You know, I heard he's coming out of retirement. Anybody else hear about this? He's

661
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:54,400
doing a CG movie. A CG movie. Yeah, his first ever. Completely gay. First ever that stands for.

662
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,600
Well, I guess we'll have to see how that goes. There was a new Ghost in the Shell standalone

663
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,440
complex announced as well, also directed by the guy who did the, yeah, and all. Is that going to come

664
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:13,600
out before Best Anime Ever, Ghost in the Shell? Probably. Probably. Maybe, maybe not. That was

665
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,000
the joke all along. That announcement was for this new version of Ghost in the Shell. And that's

666
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,760
why it hasn't out yet. You were just waiting for it actually to be released. Actually, it's a

667
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,280
collaboration between me and Mr. Ghost in the Shell himself. You know, to the Lord of Ghosts.

668
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,240
It is Best Anime Ever. Is Ghost in the Shell next season of standalone complex. It's been a long

669
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:42,080
time coming and please enjoy and pay my rent. Hey, Digi. Yes. You said a while ago, or not that

670
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:48,400
long ago, really, that you were talking about, like, Endless War, the Rowdy Focus Cop Killers

671
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,720
Discord video game as an ARG. Yeah. And although Munchie and Ben are not here, I would like to

672
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,240
know what you meant by that. Well, the game takes, it kind of takes place in an alternate version

673
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,640
of reality because everybody's playing like a character version of themselves. It's almost

674
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,680
like a role-playing game. Like, it's kind of an MMORPG, but like, because it's set literally in,

675
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,920
like, an alternate reality. Like, because it goes outside of the game board. Like, they hold

676
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:25,760
conventions for it and shit where, like, you know, the characters are still alive in as much as in

677
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,440
everyone's heads. So it's kind of like they're in a shared alternate reality to an extent. And like,

678
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:37,680
definitely, what got me thinking about it was that I was just on the IM Games Twitch channel and we

679
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,920
host everybody else, so there was a, there just happened to be a slime fest going on or something.

680
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:49,520
And they were like listening to what I assume was a Slime Times, like, audio recording. Like,

681
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:57,360
the in-game newspaper made by a fan has graduated to the level of being a radio program that they

682
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,640
play during live streams. And I was like, this is an alternate reality at this point.

683
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:10,960
Yeah, I wasn't sure when you said ARG initially, but like, yeah, that is very much, it is very much

684
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,960
a role-playing, like, character server. Because even though people are, like, normal, they generally

685
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,280
keep up some sort of appearance of, like, being completely insane. Because, like, Munchie used

686
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:30,800
to be big into, like, role-play threads on, like, slash MLP and shit. Like, he used to do a lot of

687
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,360
those character games, so I think that's probably, like, part of the inspiration behind it.

688
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:46,240
Yeah. I like it. I recently made some characters. The, the, the image of my, my discord icon is

689
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:53,120
Redman, one of the, the new rowdies. And, and his character is, his character is that he is a very

690
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,400
philosophical guy, but he's also like a big hulking blood beast that drinks blood and needs

691
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,800
always looking for blood. But he's just kind of a nice guy and he's kind of chill.

692
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,800
Yeah. And he thinks, he thinks a lot about video game analysis. He has a video game analysis channel

693
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,200
and he made a video about Pokemon Let's Go. Can I watch this? Is there a link to this?

694
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,080
Yeah, I can link it to you. Oh, shit. That reminds me of us. Put it in the show notes, people.

695
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,960
In the, in the story that I was working on a couple months ago that I was going to make on a

696
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,960
DAT browser, there was one guy who is basically inside of this universe I created. There's a

697
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:37,200
guy who's an AR programmer and he, he's like, if you wear AR glasses and walk around this town,

698
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,920
you can see like an overlay that he's created across the entire city. So like everywhere you

699
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,200
go, there's like holographic shit that you can see if you've got like glasses on. However,

700
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,720
he's a huge fan of Knuckles the Echidna. So everything in town is themed around Knuckles

701
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:03,520
the Echidna. And I made a Knuckles fan site that I just, I built myself out of HTML on a DAT site.

702
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:10,000
So I would link to it, but like I'd have to have it open for it to exist,

703
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,040
which is why that we haven't been talking about DAT as much lately.

704
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,400
Okay, okay. Hey, by the way, listen to the description of this YouTube channel for Red

705
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Man. It reads, hi, I'm a rowdy fucker. I will get blood. Game reviews are my passion. That's the

706
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:34,560
full description. Yeah, I went, I went to extra lengths and I subscribed to like as many blood

707
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,200
related YouTube channels as I could. Jesus Christ. That's fucking hilarious. I will get blood.

708
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,240
Oh my God, featured channels. NHS Give Blood is a featured channel.

709
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,640
God damn. Well, what about Gun Girl? Where's her, you know,

710
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:57,040
Gun Girl is on the killer side and she is a, she's a Fortnite school shooter. She played

711
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,840
Fortnite and killed her parents because she loved Fortnite so much and she thought guns were cool.

712
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,080
And so she has a gun and she just goes around killing. And that is, that is, that is Gun Girl.

713
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,480
That sounds good. I kind of want to like make more of these characters, but I kind of just

714
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,400
like that they exist and they're in the server and they do, they can talk to people. Yeah, yeah.

715
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:25,760
God, Red Man. Please click on the link in the show notes, people. Check this shit out. I will get

716
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:33,600
blood. Game reviews are my passion. Yeah, he's all, he's all. It's really good.

717
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:40,320
Yes, it's great. I got to click on this fucking video and it's 18 minutes long.

718
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:45,680
Oh my God. It's just his face is huge and slowly is getting wider as the video goes on.

719
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,320
Is there any actual game analysis? There is like five minutes. He just,

720
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,960
he's just singing for like five minutes and then he starts talking about Pokemon Let's Go.

721
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:04,000
Oh no, it's, it's recorded like, it's got like, like a munchy level of effects on his voice.

722
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,920
Yeah, it does. Okay, this is good shit. This is where we need to be headed in the future.

723
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,800
This is where things are going. Yeah, so like, like role playing as strange characters is very

724
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:21,920
much the core of Endless War and, and it's more fun to do stuff like that than it is really to

725
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,880
play the game. Haha. That is literally true in my humble opinion. I thought that was like the

726
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,640
point was like the game is just a framework for this bizarre story. Well, there are some people,

727
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,880
I mean, for a while at the beginning of season two, I was pretty dedicated and was leading the,

728
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,480
the boards. Not, I wasn't first place or anything, but I was doing quite well actually playing the

729
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,840
game, but I've just, you know, I thought you were first place at some point was like the most

730
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,280
slimy. I might have been. I might have been. I can't remember offhand, but there's just people,

731
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,680
man who've not to insult them, but they got a lot more time than I do to play ratty fuckers,

732
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,960
cop killers, and you got God bless them for their dedication, but I just can't keep up. I can't do

733
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:08,480
it. It's cool though. It's cool shit. Hey, so Smash Bros is out. Smash Bros is out. That's exciting.

734
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:15,280
That's pretty cool. Check out the streams. They're all they've all got. They've all got them. But

735
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,960
all right, I'm so annoyed. Well, I'm not that annoyed. It's, it's fine. It's, it's understandable,

736
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,400
but like I go into a number of discords and then there are people, groups of friends, and there's

737
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,600
always a call going on and it's like, okay, I'll jump in the call. See what people are talking

738
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,640
about. They're all just in voice chat, playing Smash with each other. And I'm like, well, I

739
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,480
can't really listen to this because they're not talking. They're just going, oh, fuck you. Like

740
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,000
every single discord call I could possibly be in is a Smash call. I'm just like, well, I've been

741
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,800
playing Smash the entire time. Ooh, ah, getting the kill. Got him. There you go. That's what it

742
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,960
sounds like. Is that what your streams sound like? That was exactly. Getting the kill.

743
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,320
Plus 100. Here's what I wanted to talk about. I was, I was curious. I talked about this a little bit

744
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,080
when I was streaming yesterday, but, but I was curious what you guys think. So not every character

745
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,920
was unlocked in Smash Bros, right? In Smash 4, they were all unlocked. In this game, they are

746
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:22,400
not. And you have to play to unlock them. I like it a lot, but it took a long time. And I feel

747
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,840
that's going to annoy some, you know what? I don't even know why I'm, I actually, I literally like

748
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,080
that you have to do that. But you seem like the sort of person who would like that. I do. Other

749
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,400
people who are angry about it. I love it when other people are angry about things that I did

750
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,320
better than them at. That's literally true. But, but what I was annoyed at was that like, after I

751
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,960
had unlocked all the characters, and I know Tom said something about this yesterday, that he got

752
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,920
like a notification, but after like, I fought Chrom and I lost, right? After I like did the whatever

753
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:56,800
to unlock Chrom, like tucked off in a secret menu. Okay, I kept trying to like do the running thing

754
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,840
and then like do the 1v1 stock match, whatever to unlock Chrom and like Ridley. I've both lost it.

755
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:06,880
This is like 10 characters that's happened with because I'm shit at the game. But uh, uh, like

756
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,040
I kept doing it for like two extra hours. I was watching Star Trek or something and I'm like,

757
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,200
well, that's weird. Why am I not getting any of the characters popping up again? Turns out you

758
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,440
have to go to the fucking settings menu and in that menu, there's like a little thing that's like,

759
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,080
do a rematch against the characters. And so I fight Chrom. Guess what? I lose again. All right,

760
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:29,040
because I'm shit at the game, but fuck it. It doesn't matter. And then I had to like wait

761
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:34,640
like half an hour in real time. I tried restarting it. You don't get to fight him again. You have to

762
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:40,400
wait real time for him to reappear in this sub menu to fight him again. And I'm just saying,

763
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,960
I don't think the game did a good enough job of showing me what I had to do to unlock this character

764
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:52,240
and it pissed me off. And that's why I'm mad. That's such a weird Nintendo smash thing to do,

765
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,320
to take the conceit that was kind of cool and just run so far with it that it goes around to

766
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:05,760
being weird and baffling. And like, I like the idea of having to unlock all the characters,

767
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,800
because when I was younger, that used to be what I saw as like your goal in a fighting game. It's

768
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,480
like, yeah, there's a bunch of open slots. I want to fill those. That's the, that's the, if you're

769
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,880
somebody who only plays a fighting game for like a week after it comes out, you know, like a regular

770
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:27,360
video game, then that's pretty much what you do. And with smash on melee, like I had the strategy

771
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,560
guide, there were a lot of guys that took a lot of effort to get because it was either you had to

772
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,240
do something really difficult or you had to play a certain number of hours or a certain number of

773
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:44,480
matches. And like to get everybody, you'd have to play like 1000 rounds in order to get the hardest

774
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,520
to get character. So, you know, hearing that you had to unlock everybody in the new game was really

775
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,880
cool, although I also heard it was like really easy. But then in order to mitigate it being too

776
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,920
easy, they put in like a weird mechanic that makes it like, oh, well, now I'm just waiting around,

777
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,160
and I can't do anything to expedite making this happen. I can't just get better and beat the

778
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:12,000
challenge that I was stuck on. I just have to wait, you know? Yeah, I mean, you can play through

779
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,640
World of Light to get them, but like that, that's like a 40 hour gauntlet, basically, from what I

780
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,720
understand to get everybody there. Maybe it's a little faster than that, if you know what you're

781
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,840
doing, but I certainly didn't. I don't know. You know what? I'm not that upset about it, frankly.

782
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,280
I just thought it was weird that it was like tucked off in this side menu to unlock them,

783
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,400
and it was very strange. But you know, I literally like and am glad that some people are getting

784
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,360
fucked and they don't know how to unlock, and they're confused and scared. I like this. I like

785
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,560
this, that people are traumatized. Because like, remember Mortal Kombat back in the day or whatever,

786
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:50,560
where like, you get you got fucking, I don't know, Sub-Zero and what's the fire guy, you know,

787
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:56,480
the fire Sub-Zero? Scorpion. Bowser. Scorpion, yes, thank you. The fire guy. I'm sorry. But like,

788
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,960
then you got like, I think, I think just Scorpion was unlocked to begin with. Like, you have to like

789
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,760
figure out how to unlock Sub-Zero. And then it's like, oh my god, I think there's like a green one

790
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,800
two, what the fuck? And then you unlock fucking Reptile. And then there's like a gray one two,

791
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,000
who I can't remember, like Fog or something. Smoke. Smoke. Fog? Really? Fog, whatever. Okay,

792
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,120
I'm sorry. It's like, Jesus Christ, there's a gray one. I can unlock this guy. What the fuck do I

793
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:26,640
need to do? I guess I just missed the mystery, you know, of the olden days. Before I was an old

794
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,800
jaded fuck, who knew too much about video games. I remember unlocking all the characters in Soul

795
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:39,360
Calibur and like, fucking... Fucking Yoda. Fucking, what's the other, what's another good game?

796
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:45,920
Tekken. Yeah, King, I don't know, Dead or Alive. I never fucking played Dead or Alive. That's

797
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,000
another one I was thinking. That one wasn't about secret characters, but getting extra costumes

798
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,240
for all the characters. You got to unlock the booby sliders. You can just pump them all up to

799
01:05:54,240 --> 01:06:01,200
max. That's the way. Oh, you know what? I was thinking like, I don't, I can't relate to this

800
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,880
because I've never played a fighting game enough to unlock characters, but I do remember

801
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:12,480
in Rayman M, Rayman Arena, you can, you can unlock skins for like Rayman and Glowbox and stuff

802
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,800
by playing loads of levels and completing different challenges. And I did enjoy... That's fun.

803
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,320
That's cool. Completing all of those. Kind of like that in the city too, but you know what,

804
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,160
actually now I think about, in Dead or Alive, I distinctly remember, I think we were playing

805
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,720
Dead or Alive 3, me and my boys on his like Xbox or something, we had heard that like there were

806
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:37,680
tricks to get nude cheat codes in Dead or Alive. So I remember playing that game extensively and like

807
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:44,080
doing deep dark web internet, you know, searching, trying to, trying to get big old Kazumi titties

808
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:49,360
out or, you know, you know where that came from, right? Do you remember? No, where? That was from

809
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:54,240
the pages of Electronic Gaming Monthly, that was their April Fool's joke for that year. Oh,

810
01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:00,480
fuck! Yeah, the screenshots in there were photoshopped. Oh my god, that's literally

811
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,880
not acceptable. The year before that, they photoshopped Sonic and Tails being unlockable

812
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,600
characters in Melee and the whole world went insane for a while.

813
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,080
Literal fake news. Shut them down. They have to... That was the thing because like GamePro had like a

814
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:24,400
fake insert of like joke articles, but EGM just slid something in there that was just plausible

815
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,240
enough to piss everybody else off, and that was their expert troll. So yeah. You know, I like

816
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,800
that a lot, I like that a lot, but that is cruel to do to children who just want to see big anime

817
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:41,920
titties, goddammit. I just want to see big anime titties with Sonic the Hedgehog. Well, the internet

818
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:49,040
has some places for you, my friend. That's true. That's true. Okay, I'll go to tumblr.com. Oh, no.

819
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,640
Oh, no. Where am I going to get my Sonic anime titties now? That's a good question. I wonder what

820
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,480
the future has in store for Tumblr. Hey, have you guys heard about the... Okay, this is actually

821
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:08,480
fascinating and hilarious. With the shutting down of Tumblr's NSFW shit, the refugees from

822
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,400
Tumblr are flooding like Twitter and other places, and have you heard that as a consequence of like

823
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,320
a light being shown and all the cockroaches scattering from inside Tumblr, things like the map,

824
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:26,000
the minor attracted persons or whatever, are making little communities outside of Tumblr?

825
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:34,800
This is hilarious. The degeneracy is being exposed, and it's like becoming a minor attracted person.

826
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,680
Wasn't that what fucking Clegg called himself? I think so, yeah. I think so. It would give this

827
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,720
like a minor attracted person, aka literally just a pedophile, like who advocates. I mean, they say,

828
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:53,520
you know, like, yeah. They're trying to rebrand? I mean, that's for a while. That seems to be the

829
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:59,520
option when shit goes south of PR. That's true. It's kind of funny that we're even playing along

830
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,800
with that. I mean, we call it, because if they call themselves the map community, then it's like,

831
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:09,600
well, I guess that's what they're called, but I mean, yeah, it literally is just a word that

832
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:17,200
means the same thing as pedophiles. It's just for pedophiles. There's a thing for no contact maps,

833
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:26,400
you know? I'm like, okay, good. That's good. But man, this is just... The fact that this was just

834
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:33,120
going on... I wouldn't trust somebody who says, oh, yeah, I'm no contact rapist. Okay, I believe you.

835
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, good. You can stay at my house. I don't know, man. This is like, there's these little pockets

836
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:51,040
where like, I mean, for example, there's like, when 4chaners like leave 4chan and go act the

837
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,080
same way they do on 4chan elsewhere, you know, there's slapback. There's like, well, you can't

838
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,640
behave that way here, sir. We don't do things that way. And it's like, okay, fair enough. But it's

839
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:07,120
just so funny to me that all this degeneracy going on there, when it's brought other places,

840
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:14,320
suddenly there's a spotlight on it. Yeah. It was just going wrong. Are these people confused and

841
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,880
surprised that they're getting backlash because of the they've stayed on Tumblr for so long? This is

842
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,720
the fascinating thing. Shu on head made a video about it and I've seen, I've heard about it for a

843
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:29,120
while. But like, there's a legit attempt being made by these individuals to hitch their wagon to the

844
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:38,400
LGBTQ plus like wagon because like, it is true. I guess it's fair to say, and I do feel for people,

845
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:46,480
they didn't choose to be born a map, I guess. So okay, that's fair, I guess. But there remains

846
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:53,040
a distinction here, I think, between, you know, the ability to consent and not the ability to consent.

847
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,360
Like, if you're a necrophile, for example, like, I frankly think that's not such a terrible thing

848
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,720
to be. It's obviously not really a great lifestyle. But like, in no way are you really a threat to

849
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:12,160
anyone. In terms of, I think, I think there's, I mean, yeah, at some point, you've just got to

850
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:20,800
realize that like, sex is not actually that important to one's lifestyle. Like you, if maps,

851
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:28,320
like, whatever, pedophiles, they can't help being attracted to younger people. I can imagine that

852
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:36,320
that is true. But like, you just have to go without. There's no way around it, you just can't do it.

853
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:42,800
You know what, this is the thing, like, okay, I kind of get the argument that like, hey, like, stop,

854
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,600
like, I don't know, what, bullying us, being mean to us, because like, we didn't choose this. So like,

855
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,520
I get the connection there, and I'm not trying to conflate this with any, you know, like, sexuality,

856
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,360
whatever, like, being gay or whatever. That's obviously a different thing. But it's like,

857
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:01,120
I legitimately feel bad for people like this, and they don't get to choose it. And it kind of makes

858
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:06,560
sense that there could be people saying like, hey, man, we didn't choose to be this way. We don't

859
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,560
deserve to be hurt. We haven't hurt anybody. Like, I get it. But I'm not advocating for them to be

860
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,280
bullied. I just feel like you've got to realize that you can't, you can't be protected with having

861
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,720
this thing. There is no way to be a good. No, we have to imagine the other way. We have to imagine,

862
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:30,320
let's say, that we give total acceptance to the pedophiles. And in fact, the government's like,

863
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,960
we feel for you guys, you can't help who you're attracted to. And it's not fair that you have

864
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,240
to go your whole lives penalized and not able to have sex with anybody. So we're going to cover you

865
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:48,560
guys. We got you government mandated lollies. So you just round up, no, you just round up a bunch

866
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:57,440
of like orphan girls who've got, you know, what the fuck. And these girls are going to die in the

867
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:05,120
streets anyways. So we're just giving them the pedophiles as a prize. This is justice, ladies

868
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,880
and gentlemen. No, dude. I got it. I got it. 3D printed silicone lollies. That way nobody gets

869
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,080
hurt. And it's very funny. That's good. They can't hear about that. You're just fucking a doll. But

870
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,640
I mean, good. I guess, I mean, you could already do that. You could already just go and get a real

871
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:26,080
doll that looks like a little girl. They have those. You know, like, some people... Where did

872
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:31,840
you? Where can I find them? Just Google real doll. I hear that they're like being banned in places.

873
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,840
I don't know. Like, I get the idea. That's dumb. That's really dumb to ban them. I was looking at

874
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,000
real doll websites before because I wanted to know what all the different types are and shit and

875
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:50,160
like what even because they're fucking fascinating. And the ones that are like smaller, they refer

876
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:57,520
to them as travel size. Okay. Well, like on the plane, you just get them out. No, they're like,

877
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:03,120
oh, this one like can be taken with you because it's only like three and a half feet tall. So it's

878
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:08,640
just, you know, just, you know, it's a three and a half foot tall facsimile of a human girl.

879
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,960
Air gun. It looks like a little, like it looks like a child, you know? You know what would be

880
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,400
interesting? An interesting experiment, though. If someone could do a study of this, it's like,

881
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:23,040
okay, you just take like the same like document or style or like doll thing or whatever, like the

882
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,960
design is the same and you have one that's like, I don't know, five foot five and one that's like,

883
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,320
like, I don't know, like four feet or whatever, like child size, like the design is the same. There

884
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,920
are no differences. It is simply the size and like one's labeled travel size and one's just labeled

885
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,520
normal. Like would people have an issue with that? I assume they would. I assume they would

886
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,240
when in actuality, there's no, nothing is really being implied or anything with that, you know?

887
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:54,240
It's just a difference of size. It's just like getting to own a physical version of when you

888
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,840
imagine your girlfriend what she looked like when she was like 14 while you're having sex with her,

889
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:05,920
you know? Well, I mean, I could understand people having an objection to that, I suppose, but yeah,

890
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,760
I mean, I've thought about, I've talked about this before. It's like, I remember when I was 12,

891
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,640
and I was way into Nina Mori from Fooley Cooley. And like, what am I going to pretend that I

892
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,600
like don't have a memory for that? I'm thinking about this. Like, I'm thinking that if you made

893
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,960
a doll of like, like that looked just like a real little girl, it would probably be seen as like

894
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:30,960
hyper illegal and not okay. But if you made a doll that looked like a younger version of a woman

895
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:36,080
who is of age now, would that be illegal or questionable to people? I mean, their parents

896
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:41,280
would probably be fucking weirded out. Everybody would be weirded out. Everybody on earth would

897
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:48,400
be weirded out by this. By the way, the question is where is the line? I'm very, I'm just, I'm just

898
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:55,680
no. I mean, the line is and always should be at real people. Right? Well, it doesn't matter.

899
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:02,800
This is a person who was real at some point. I mean, and now they're dead. Like, I mean, I get

900
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,120
the through line that like, okay, this person's attracted to like the facsimile of an actual

901
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,960
child doesn't matter that they're older now, they used to be. And like that's like, I get the connection

902
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,280
there. I mean, I'm not even asking if it's right or wrong. I'm just asking like, would yeah, like

903
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:21,120
if you made a doll of a real little girl, it would definitely be not okay, like legally, you know,

904
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,920
well, sure. But if it was like of a girl who is of age, and you were doing a doll like what she

905
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,000
looked like at a younger age, I don't think that makes a difference. I think people would still

906
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,680
be upset. I think that they're equitable. It all depends on like people finding out. If they find

907
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:41,920
out that you have a sex doll that raised eyebrows already true. And then the fact that it's young

908
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,520
is like, Oh, well, it's okay. So it's of his wife as a girl, like that nobody's gonna say that.

909
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,600
But like, okay, what about this other thing though, that's like, in Australia or wherever,

910
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,560
I always, whatever. So somewhere this is true, that like, if you have like women who have a

911
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,600
petite build, they are not allowed to do porn, even if they're fucking 35. Yeah, because they

912
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,160
just like so. So now we've got that thrown in. So that's pretty weird. So now it's,

913
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,800
I guess it's just about the appearance and nothing else.

914
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,640
Weird guys, I don't know. Let's go. Yeah, you got it. There you go.

915
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,760
Shall we move on to voicemails, please? God save me. Okay, let's do it. Let's do it.

916
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,320
Let me let me pull it up. Everybody. Let me wait. No, I'm going to do it right this time.

917
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:38,640
Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemails, right, Tom? Yes, you did it. Is it doesn't have an s at the

918
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,280
end? Is it voicemails voicemail voicemail? Okay, so I'm still wrong. Oh, you got it wrong. Fail.

919
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:49,360
You said voicemails. I did. Well, you were close. I'll take back those claps, but I don't know what

920
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,640
the sound is. I'm clapping right now. It doesn't make any noise, but okay, I feel the pain though.

921
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,440
Okay, first one. Here we go. This is from definitely not one spar. Let's see what he's got today.

922
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:09,520
Shot it. Now I was thinking back on my voicemail from last week and I realized I definitely didn't

923
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,960
have as good a time listening to it as I remember having recording it. Now you guys know good old

924
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,400
one spar. If there's one thing I could certainly use more of, it's male genitalia. And if there's

925
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,480
another thing, it's constructive criticism. But before I go anywhere with that, I just want to

926
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:30,560
say shame on you, PCP, for making fun of my accent. I know my audio quality was significantly worse

927
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,360
than usual. That wasn't him, right? We're being beamed. Just awful. But that one was a bit of a dirty

928
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:40,000
shot. Anyways, back to my personal shortcomings. First of all, I should have known better than

929
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,800
to ask a specific question like how can I be more gay without even knowing whether or not Digi or

930
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,680
Hippo would even be on. I mean, that's just a beginner's mistake. I did also realize that I

931
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:54,640
spent most of my question rehashing the same joke, which I guess was just referencing my sexual

932
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,960
preferences. I don't know. It doesn't seem like my strongest entry to date. But let me know what

933
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,800
you guys think. And if you see any more one spars running around, please feel free to destroy them

934
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,080
because like my stalemate Hans and Jerome from the Glory Hole convention told me, no one likes a

935
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:16,960
biter. See you next week, guys. Oh, that was a great ending gag. Yeah. One spar is he's really

936
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:23,680
evolving the medium here. He's really moving us forward. I am confused. But what wait, was there

937
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:28,320
a question? Okay, last week, we got a question from someone who I think was I forget what they're

938
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,160
saying their names, but their name was like definitely one spar, I think was it. And they just

939
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:37,040
went on about how they can be more gay. And they like had an accent that we thought was weird.

940
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,920
So I think we're so it's someone who who knows one spar and was trying to be funny. That's probably

941
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,040
true. That's probably true. Or maybe he just was Asian for a day, or whatever that accent was.

942
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:54,560
Maybe he was gay for a day. Oh, shit. What do I do? People will get that eventually someday.

943
01:19:54,560 --> 01:20:00,160
This mystery rag. No, never, never. No, I was promised much. He promised it's coming. I'm

944
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:07,920
waiting for it. I made a vow or a bet or whatever. So we'll see. You did. Okay. Anyway, next one's

945
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,560
from Centerpoint. Let's see what Centerpoint's got for us. Tell us your favorite Christmas story.

946
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:23,280
Whimsical, delightful, filled with blood and violence. Epic. Yeah, favorite. It's getting

947
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,760
close to the Christmas season, people. I want to put this in to get us in the mood. It's time

948
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,520
to deck the halls and you know, I don't really have a good like Christmas story that's like

949
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:39,280
unique to a specific year. But there was one time when it snowed a lot and I think I may have

950
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:44,720
talked about this before on the PCP, but a long time ago, where it snowed a lot and me and my

951
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:53,280
brothers went down to the park and there was snow in the park and we rolled a snowball together,

952
01:20:53,280 --> 01:21:00,160
all three of us, around the park and it was it was just got really big. It just went downhill.

953
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,240
It just got really, really big. It was like three meters tall by the end and we couldn't move it

954
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,600
anymore. And then people went up to it and like, well, dude, look, check this out. And they took

955
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:16,080
selfies with it. Dude, that was the coolest snow time in the snow that was really big.

956
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,440
Hippopotamus, the snow that was really big. Hippopotamus, the snow that was really big.

957
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:32,080
Yeah. You know, one time a little Nate woke up on Christmas morning and ran downstairs to find

958
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:39,120
a beautiful, shiny new pair of Jordans of sweet kicks. They were red and black and white and

959
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,520
they were pristine and I put them on and just felt like so happy and content with the world. I

960
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,840
was running around jumping and feeling great, filled with a Christmas spirit. Nate, why do I

961
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,360
feel like I never see you wearing those shoes anymore if you loved me so much? Well, because

962
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,640
you see, then something happened. A dark shadow began looming over me from the distance who

963
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:01,360
pushed me down and ripped the shoes off my feet and he pulled them on himself and then he said,

964
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:08,720
haha, Nate, I, Ben Saint, I'm stealing your shoes. I have no justification to be doing this. I have no

965
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:14,240
moral right to do this, but I'm doing it anyway like I will steal your dollars at patreon.com

966
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:20,400
slash Ben Saint for the shittiest quality of content. And that's the story of literally how

967
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:28,480
I lost my shoes in real life to Ben on Christmas. He is a monster. Don't support him. Give it all

968
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,120
to me instead. That's my Christmas story. Oh, it gets me in the Christmas spirit every time

969
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:39,600
I think about that cruel, vicious blows that Ben reigned upon me. We're stealing my chopping off

970
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:49,760
my feet with your own sneakers. Okay, that's all I got. I don't have any good Christmas stories,

971
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,280
but I did start making up my own Christmases at some point. So my family was just like,

972
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:02,000
eh, Christmas, whatever. So one year I was like, hey, let's do Festivus, which is a thing in

973
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Seinfeld, the Christmas for the rest of us. And it's, it's just you do a bunch of silly

974
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,120
shit. You have like a pole instead of a Christmas tree. You eat lasagna and you have an airing of

975
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:20,640
grievances and yet the rest of the head of the family. It's a fun time. And then like the next

976
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:27,360
year I started making up my own holidays. So then we did a, we did one called agarwood day where I

977
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,040
themed it around the lyrics of agalodge songs. That's pretty fucking nerdy. And then it was the

978
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:38,880
hearth's warming eve where I did the My Little Pony holiday with a bunch of just basically a bunch

979
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,840
of events themed around the stuff that happens in the episode of the show. And there's a video about

980
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,080
Oh yeah, we would do, we would do like different things throughout the day. Like there might be

981
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:58,640
like a scavenger hunt or a fucking big luncheon of some sort. You know, that's pretty cool. I mean,

982
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:03,360
that's a lot more work and thought than most people put into it. Um, yeah, it's good. It's

983
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:08,000
cause like generally I've always been like unable to sleep before any kind of major holiday. So I

984
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,080
would just stay up all night and set shit up until morning. That's all right. Hey, that's,

985
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:18,080
that's constructive. You know, I've been dreaming about apple cider that one time my cousin, I

986
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:22,320
think cousin Maddie came over and I was like, Hey, let's make some apple cider. And so we did.

987
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,760
And that it's like, it's just apple cider with fireball whiskey. And I think like with like,

988
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:32,480
we made like cinnamon, um, sugar like crust for like, you know how you make that like the top of

989
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,880
your glass with like the sugar crystals or whatever you like dip it in. Oh my God. It was

990
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,640
like the most delicious drink I've ever had in my life. I've been dreaming about it for years and

991
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:46,080
I never made it again. Uh, I'd highly recommend it to everybody out there to drink on Christmas day.

992
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:50,000
Make this drink. It is so good. I'm just going to go over it again because you should do this

993
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,280
because it's so good. Just get some apple cider, fireball whiskey, and then look up a recipe for

994
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:00,320
like cinnamon and like sugar topping on like the rim of your glass. You will love it. Oh,

995
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:04,720
and you got to cook it in like a crock pot thing. You just like, you just warm up the drinks in a

996
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:10,800
crock pot, uh, the fireball and the apple cider. It's so good. It's my favorite. Nothing's better.

997
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,120
And it's so please play another fucking voicemail. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Anyway, let's move

998
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:22,000
on. Next one's from, uh, Cluster Punk Kitchen. Hey, go. English muffin in the toaster.

999
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:31,600
Butter that shit up. Yeah. Arrange six cheesy Doritos in the center. Press it down. Hear the

1000
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:41,200
crunch. That's your lunch. Take a bite. Change your life. You just learned how to make an English

1001
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:49,600
Doritos sandwich on today's episode of Cluster Punk Kitchen. Hell yeah. Now you're cooking with

1002
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,560
what the fuck? That was amazing. Thank you. Cluster Punk Kitchen. Damn. Uh, I'm going to try

1003
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,680
that next week's episode. Speaking of cooking recipes and shit. Um, damn. Finally, finally,

1004
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:10,720
some quality programming to replace poor boy eats. I've been waiting forever. Oh yeah.

1005
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,120
Poor boy eats was legendary, though. I want another episode. One of these days,

1006
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:21,040
Radcon 4, maybe? This voicemail gives me ideas of having, you know, how like in

1007
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:27,360
just stealing that idea and making that a show we do live action. Well, no, no. Like having people

1008
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:33,360
do ad breaks, but for the PCP, like how you did and how they marketed. Yeah, that'd be great.

1009
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,160
Okay. Next one's from Mr. Upload. Uh, let's hear what he's got.

1010
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,960
I got a question from Nate. What is your favorite Stanley Kubrick movie? Because I know

1011
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:54,240
you mentioned and other episodes, 2001 Space Odyssey and The Shining. And I'm pretty curious.

1012
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,640
Yep. This is just my chance to gush about Kubrick because I love him so much.

1013
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:05,360
Okay, that's fine. He's normal question. I'm like kind of confused. I know it's weird, right? Uh,

1014
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:12,160
my favorite Kubrick movie is probably The Shining, but I absolutely love Doctor Strange Love is a

1015
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:17,840
masterpiece. Everyone should watch it. Uh, Eyes Wide Shut is a masterpiece. Everyone should watch it

1016
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:25,120
as The Shining. Um, oh, fucking, what's the other one? Um, uh, the first half, I was just watching

1017
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:33,200
a ton of Full Metal Jacket. The second half is good, but the first half is better. Um, and there's

1018
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:38,320
other stuff, but I forget, but he's just the best. Everything he's made is gold. Highly recommended

1019
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:44,080
across the board. Um, okay, that's it. I'm looking at, I'm looking at the list. Yeah. And I think

1020
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,560
the only one I've actually watched all the way through is Full Metal Jacket. The other ones were

1021
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,040
just on TV and I was like, oh, what's this? My dude, do yourself a favor and watch The Shining.

1022
01:27:53,040 --> 01:28:00,240
It is the best movie. It is the spookiest movie. God, it's so good. Everything. Kubrick is just,

1023
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:06,080
he is that guy. He is that bitch. He went there. He's not afraid to go there. Um, okay, let's go

1024
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:12,640
on to the next one here. This is from Moon Jew. From Moon Jew. Big, big, big friend of the show.

1025
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:19,680
Let's see where he has to stay. Big. All right, Nate, bud, this one's for you. All right. I'm

1026
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:27,120
recording this the day after Smash came out at midnight and I am so fucking hyped and I cannot

1027
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:34,720
explain to you just how badly your ass is going to get beaten. Your next stream, I swear to God,

1028
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:41,120
my camera will fucking demolish you. No matter what character you play, I fucking destroy you.

1029
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,720
So get your lube ready because I'm ready to fuck you in the ass.

1030
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:55,120
Um, is that, is that another Smash, Smash, uh, stream, uh, ad for, for Nate?

1031
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,360
Maybe a little bit. Maybe a little bit. Uh, I just put that in there to, to, in case I didn't

1032
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:03,840
say it before, to, I don't think I did. I feel public service announcement. Uh, I made a bunch

1033
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:10,400
of Smash videos. I'm a huge fan. The, the thing is though, um, actually shit. Uh, so I feel like

1034
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:15,280
I've misled people a little bit into thinking that fighting me would like be interesting or

1035
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:22,320
challenging or fun. I mean, I put up a good fight against Nate. Tom beat me every time except once.

1036
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:26,160
Yeah. Um, and it was on a gimmicky bullshit stage. Yeah, that's true.

1037
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:33,360
I, I, it's, it's, it's strange cause like I don't feel that hype about Smash because of,

1038
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:37,680
of how bad I am at it. Okay. I'm divorced from that. Interesting. I was talking about this on

1039
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:43,280
the stream. Is that like, I don't like Smash at all. I find the mechanics, the mechanics are good.

1040
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,760
I don't like the controls. I don't like the lack of flow, but then I played little Mac who's all

1041
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:53,200
about just heavy single hits and I'm like, this character makes sense for the control. So I almost,

1042
01:29:53,200 --> 01:30:00,480
I almost, almost kind of like Smash now just because of little Mac. Well, all right. Almost.

1043
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:04,400
Yeah. I mean, we were talking about this on the stream that like with fighting games, it's really

1044
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,960
about like whether or not you like the game is going to depend on if you find a character that

1045
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:14,720
you can play. Yeah. You know, um, like that's the reason I never have gotten too into street

1046
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:20,640
fighter is like the only character I'm okay with is Kami. And all I really do is like spam the same

1047
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:26,080
couple of attacks. I don't know how to like play her on like a technical level. So like in a fighting

1048
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:31,840
game like Smash, where you can use such a huge variety of different techniques and how you want

1049
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,400
to play the game, depending on who you're using, like just because I found a way to play Samus,

1050
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:41,520
that works for me. That's why I will go back to Smash. But like as soon as I have to venture

1051
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:47,200
outside of Samus, the game is significantly less interesting and less depending on the game. Like

1052
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:53,440
in Smash four, I really liked playing as Ganondorf. So it made the game fun again. But like I wasn't

1053
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:59,040
good enough at it or playing him to like, you know, consistently beat my friends. So it's like

1054
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:04,800
ultimately I, if I'm having a good time, it's because I'm playing Samus and winning a lot.

1055
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,880
And then people get sick of losing to you. And then the game is not fun anymore. And that's a

1056
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:14,640
Smash session. Yeah, more or less. Luckily, you've got a new Echo fighter to mess around with,

1057
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:21,600
being a Dark Samus, just like a variant of Samus. Incidentally, you said you played

1058
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:28,240
Kami? Camille Toe? Okay, moving on to the next voice. Thank you. Here we go. You're welcome.

1059
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:33,840
Terrible. So hello there, procrastinators. This is your old ass boy who said that you were my role

1060
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:39,520
models. You all sucked. And I have no friends. Well, two things, you know, actually suck. And I

1061
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:44,960
got new friends. They were fun for like two weeks, because I told them that Pokemon Go was great.

1062
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:51,120
And it was fun. But then they got bored and said it was gay or some shit. After that, I realized

1063
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,400
just how unintellectual those people actually are. I was arguing with them all day, every day,

1064
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,520
just to understand where they're coming from. Still still don't understand. They got mad at me

1065
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:07,440
for some reason. So I don't have any friends once again. But the point is, the best guy from the

1066
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:16,080
group messaged me after the incident and told me that he has completed Homestuck and he's now gay.

1067
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:24,080
My question is, what the fuck? What? Homestuck? How did Homestuck turn him gay? Is this real?

1068
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:31,280
Well, what the fuck? To be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand Pokemon Go.

1069
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:38,880
Yeah, that's true. To be fair, you have to be a pretty high gay gene. To be turned gay by Homestuck.

1070
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:46,080
I mean, this is the guy who the other day, if people remember, which is like, guys, I'm literally

1071
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:55,120
too intellectual to talk to these people and make quote unquote friends with them. It sounds like

1072
01:32:55,120 --> 01:33:00,160
he gave in, finally did make friends with them and then fucked it up immediately somehow.

1073
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:05,360
That's what it sounds like. I mean, I mean, he said there was an incident. So yeah, what was the

1074
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:14,160
incident? Unless you beat the shit out of somebody. And even then, I don't think it's like completely

1075
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:20,560
a lost cause. Did you ever have friends growing up who were on paper? You'd think you'd get along

1076
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:26,880
with them, right? Because they like the same shit as you, but they just were annoying and not fun to

1077
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:33,200
hang around for one of many reasons. Maybe they're just like, they're really nitpicky. Maybe they,

1078
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,480
you know, try to correct you a lot and it's just kind of wears on your patience.

1079
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:41,120
I knew a kid who was exactly like that in elementary school and in high school,

1080
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:47,840
he tried to shoot up the school and is now in prison. Maybe that's our voicemail caller here

1081
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:53,520
today. This is his future as well. I would say, dude, look a little more inward. I would guess

1082
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,760
the problem is you. I'm just saying pragmatically, even if you're like the greatest person in the

1083
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:03,040
world, this is not an objective like good versus bad thing, right? If other people are forming

1084
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,320
friendships and they're getting along, but you're not able to, I would say that there's something

1085
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:13,680
you got to change. I mean, that was a joke though of his call, right? Like he was trying to imply

1086
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:19,200
that it was him because he's being like an elitist. Was he? I mean, I don't know because he made a

1087
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:24,400
similar call before and I just assume that he's relatively serious about this. The fact that

1088
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,040
he's shitting on them for being like so unintelligent comes off kind of cartoon-y. That's gotta be,

1089
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:37,040
that's a joke for sure. I'm curious about the homestuck thing. Does he, when he said, his friend

1090
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:41,680
called him and said, I finished homestuck and now I'm gay. Now I'm gay. I think he's messing with

1091
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:49,360
that. Obviously, that's not like homosexuality. I'm just thinking like does he dislike homestuck?

1092
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,600
Or is this good for him? Is this one of the guys from his friend? I took it at face value and assumed

1093
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:59,520
that his friend had been like gay and didn't recognize it in himself until he read homestuck

1094
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,440
and like related to Dirk super hard and was like, oh my god, I'm fucking gay. Yeah, maybe that's what

1095
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:14,640
it is. I can see that happening. Okay, next call. This is from Steve Help Me Saint. Okay, go.

1096
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,040
Upon hearing Munchie's clarification last podcast that Ben St is in fact a real boy,

1097
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:25,600
I felt like I had to be pragmatic about this and test it. So I took Nate's advice. I stared into my

1098
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,000
I stared into my bathroom mirror, my eyes milky and bloodshot as I chugged three pints of heavy

1099
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,040
cream and went into a keto induced coma and didn't wake up for three days. But when I did

1100
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:40,160
woke up, I was sprawled out on the ground like a sweaty beast. But you know who was there? Ben,

1101
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:46,640
haven't showered in three months fucking saint. He was staring at me, sipping my fucking heavy

1102
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:52,080
cream again that he stole from my fridge. A devilish grin etched into his sunken face. He

1103
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:57,040
stole my heavy cream just like he stole Nate's shoes. He's just a thief. He snapped the fingers

1104
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:02,880
on his right hand. Boom. All the food in my house that wasn't keto friendly. Gone. He snapped the

1105
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,600
fingers on his left on his other hand. I put my bank account. Gone. Why are you the page on

1106
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,760
dot com slash ben saint? That's page on dot com slash ben saint. I can't live like this when I

1107
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,080
he's haunting me when I try to fall asleep. All I can hear in the background is in the distance

1108
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:22,080
is a can of monster zero popping open. Every time I try to fall asleep, I don't know what to do. I

1109
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,680
really like Ben St, but I can't live with him haunting me Munchie anyone. Can you give me a

1110
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,240
keto exorcism? Can someone help me? Also, I really like that just has been on the podcast

1111
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:35,440
again recently because I really like him and he's like best boy. Thanks. Yeah, that's that's great.

1112
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:40,800
That's great. I think I look I've been trying to rid myself of the Ben St demon for for 28

1113
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,560
years. All you have to do is all you have to do is bread all the meat in your house.

1114
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:51,600
Yeah. Yeah, just bread that means read that much ketoing power. So you just keep keep hitting him

1115
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:57,920
with the non keto shit. He will overload. Here's my here's my tried and true method.

1116
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:04,720
Schedule everything and he will always schedule everything in your life and do it on time because

1117
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:09,040
he won't be there on time. And then you're in the clear and then you're in the clear.

1118
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,760
He'll always be 10. I mean, if you think about it, he showed up late because you were in a coma

1119
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,480
for days and woke up and that's when he was there. So that's true. That's true. I think we found

1120
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:24,480
is one weakness, the way to cut through. Okay, next one. Okay, this is an important call everybody.

1121
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,800
This is from this is called Reclamato Reclamato. We talked about Clemato juice.

1122
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,640
Clemato is disgusting. Let's let's hear what he's got. Okay, so the guy who is asking about

1123
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:46,640
Clemato juice as an clamato, not clamato. It's it's it's tomato juice. It's not there's no clam in it.

1124
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:54,080
Oh, my white person. What are you doing? What it is is like a margarita. You add fucking tomato

1125
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:59,360
and shitty beer. It's like you're drinking healthy shit, but you get to get drunk on shitty Mexican

1126
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:05,360
beer. He's wrong. Clemato is clam and tomato. Don't ever say clamato again. It makes me it

1127
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:11,440
fucking it hurts my client Mexican. It's not just a beer. It's like a it's like a thing that's consumed

1128
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:16,160
as a regular drink. Is that okay? Maybe there's like different varieties or something.

1129
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:23,040
I thought it was like a clam tornado. Okay. Clemato is a commercial drink made of reconstituted

1130
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:28,880
tomato juice concentrate and sugar, which is flavored with spices and clam broth. Okay, so it's

1131
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,480
called Clemato because it has clam in it. This guy has no idea what he's fucking talking about.

1132
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,080
This guy is a little off base. Sounds like the facts are on it. So I don't listen to a white

1133
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:40,640
people about a Mexican drink. Obviously, this guy is Mexican now. So I guess he's

1134
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:45,840
all right. I'm confused as to why this is being advertised as a drink and not a soup.

1135
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:52,960
It is a drink. It comes in a can. Soup can come in a can. It's fucking disgusting. It's really

1136
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:59,120
gross. It tastes like drinking tomato juice mixed with clam. I like the idea of like a clam and

1137
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:05,840
tomato soup, but like that sounds good. A drink. Yeah, like a refreshing drink like I wouldn't

1138
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:11,760
call it refreshing. It's odd. So it's like he was doing a little he was putting a little

1139
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,560
panache on that. We put a little spice on it called the Clemato. Clemato juice, right? So that's

1140
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:25,520
I mean, it is they do make beers that are like Clemato beers. I had one on on a fucking

1141
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:32,560
the beer alcohol on Sundays show I did. It was the fucking disgusting. I had to like spit it out.

1142
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:38,800
I couldn't drink it. All right, we'll shit alcohol on Sundays as well as some other ones of

1143
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:44,000
the of that of the series are just great names. I really like like unironically enjoy alcohol

1144
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:52,400
on Sundays as a name. I got that from a skit that's in AMV hell three where Shinji is on the phone.

1145
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:57,440
It's like the clip of Shinji on the phone and episode one of Eva on the payphone and like

1146
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:01,920
this guy's running through all these like options of what he can click on on like the button. So

1147
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,200
it's like if you're out of alcohol on Sundays, press five. If you need a hoe for the evening,

1148
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:12,640
press six. If you woke up with a hangover and a pair of sweaty balls on your forehead, press seven.

1149
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:19,600
And deep lore show. So alcohol on Sundays comes from that. I because in a lot of places you can't

1150
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:25,920
buy alcohol on Sundays. Since why? Yeah, yeah. All right, well, let's go to our next call here

1151
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:33,600
from the worst guy ever or possibly H four hot boy. I guess that's also his name. Do it.

1152
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:41,520
Nate, it is me from the deepest darkest pits of the deepest blackest hell. Your tithesis,

1153
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:51,760
the worst guy ever. Can't be. I've come here to tell your general audience. No, a success is bad.

1154
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:58,880
Don't pursue success ever. You be gay and be that your dreams are dumb and that you

1155
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,360
shouldn't try to do any of them ever because they're all going to fail.

1156
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:10,640
Now that I blew built your audience, there's nothing you can do to stop me.

1157
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:20,320
Oh, yeah, munchies gay,

1158
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:26,960
which I assume is a resounding endorsement from the worst guy ever to say something's gay.

1159
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,120
Nate, have you listened to the latest Andrew WK album?

1160
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:37,040
No, I don't think so. You should check it out because it's basically it's the most like life

1161
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:42,080
affirming motivational music imaginable. And all of it is basically after hearing

1162
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:48,960
Fantana's review, I would describe it as music about finding inner greatness through sheer force

1163
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:55,600
of believing that you will find inner greatness. Okay, just believing in yourself so hard that you

1164
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,560
just do everything because you just believe that you can do anything. What's the name of that album?

1165
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,480
I don't remember the singles called music is worth living for.

1166
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:11,520
What fascinated me about that was I listened to Fantana's review of it and I haven't listened

1167
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:18,800
to much of WK's music in the past. I know you and Jesse are fans, but the way he described it was

1168
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:24,240
that there was an evolution of the concept. Originally, Andrew WK was the party guy,

1169
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:30,240
like the party never stops, party every day, etc. But now he's adapting this party every day formula

1170
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:37,840
to a lifestyle of like the party is light. That's what his thing is because it was that

1171
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:45,120
from the beginning really that was the idea of the party was that he approaches it as

1172
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:51,520
not literal, but that at all times he's having a party. There's a lot of reference to the idea of

1173
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:59,440
partying primarily by yourself. Most of what his parties are is him by himself finding the inner

1174
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:06,480
strength to have fun and consider all moments a party. He used to tweet constantly about what is

1175
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:12,000
a party. He would say things like just pissed on my hand, life is beautiful, hashtag party.

1176
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:20,320
Goddamn. That's dope, that's dope. It's like, yeah man, wake up, go to your nine to five,

1177
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,280
that's a fucking party. Come home, change the baby's dirty diaper, make it a fucking party,

1178
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:33,920
dude. I concluded that it is the ultimate bloomer music and it really sounds like one

1179
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:41,280
rung away from being Christian Rock. That album in particular, it's so sappy and over the top and

1180
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:49,440
cathartic and almost religious sounding that it's Christian Rock for people who are too edgy to be

1181
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:56,240
into Christian Rock, basically. That sounds good, I'll have to check it out. Okay, last call here

1182
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:02,800
from, this is from, this is called Racist Forest Gump Finale, so this sounds like a big one, let's

1183
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:11,200
brace ourselves. Johnny, it's finally time to put an end to all of this. Not far as what are you

1184
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:22,960
gonna do? I'm gonna say the end word. No, stop, there's still time. Neon Genesis is about to get it.

1185
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,200
Oh my god, he did it.

1186
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:39,280
Nice. Boris, Boris, that's three words. Shut the fuck up.

1187
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:52,000
Johnny, blow the fuck out. God damn. Oh shit. Thank you very much for joining me on Racist Forest Gump.

1188
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:59,200
I'd like to thank the podcast players for hosting this. I got to thank God, Netflix for sponsoring

1189
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:06,720
this episode and God bless the world, thank you to the economy, thank you to God, thank you to Jesus,

1190
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:13,200
thank you to the idiot piano and thank you to all of you, you've been a wonderful audience.

1191
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,000
It's been an honor.

1192
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:33,120
Congratulations. Congratulations, you did it Gump. Wow, he really leveled up there, he did it.

1193
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:38,800
That was good. God, I like this, I like the voicemails of like, there's like,

1194
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,400
now I'm musical, you can follow along with it. Yeah, there was effort put in there,

1195
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:50,080
there was a complete character arc of Racist Forest Gump evolving, you know. What a joy,

1196
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:57,600
what a joy. I would like the audio for all the Racist Forest Gumps to be put into like,

1197
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:03,920
animated as a thing. That would be incredible. It would be the coolest looking thing I'd ever seen.

1198
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,720
I'm sure they're all available on the SoundCloud, you know, under Racist Forest Gump,

1199
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:13,280
because I put the names in all of them, so they're all there. It's probably like four or five or

1200
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:18,480
something, including if you want to include the intro to last episode where someone did the voice

1201
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:25,200
of Racist Forest Gump. Anyway, that was dope. Thanks Gump, appreciate that, love you, see you

1202
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:30,960
soon in that dusty trail. But that's it for the episode I guess, that's our last voicemail,

1203
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:38,480
that's our last problem. Do we still do questions? We don't, we stopped doing questions,

1204
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:45,440
we've evolved. When the fuck did this happen? A month ago? A month or two ago? That's impossible,

1205
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:50,320
I was on like four episodes ago and we were still doing them. Yeah, pretty sure we stopped at that

1206
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:57,920
point. I think the last time was, the podcast went on for a really long time and then we did

1207
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:03,920
voicemails and it felt like there couldn't possibly be anything else to do anyway. But we already

1208
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,680
had stopped doing questions by that point and that's the end of the show. I just didn't even

1209
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:12,880
fucking notice. Well the voicemails are fucking way better than the questions, so I'm happy.

1210
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:19,360
Agreed, we all agree, I think. I don't think anybody misses them too much. Anyway, patreon.com

1211
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:25,360
