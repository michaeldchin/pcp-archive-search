3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:22,900
Hello and welcome to another episode of the Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,800
It's your three best friends here once again to talk about stuff that is interesting to

5
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
us.

6
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,640
We're keeping it a little bit smaller today, it is me, your host, bestie boy, the best

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
guy ever.

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:43,080
We've also got my good friend Digibro, and Ben Saint of Patreon, and our topic for

9
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,800
the week is something, I'm going to call this a bottom of the barrel cast.

10
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:57,540
Our topic is, since no one's here, we had to put aside all the good topics, all the incredibly

11
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,800
juicy topics we've got lined up.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Yeah, oh yeah.

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Such great topics.

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
No, some of them are good.

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I like them.

16
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Some of them are good.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Some of them are good, and I hope to get into the more.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Most of them, though.

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Total shit-fest.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Total trash.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,300
Including, for example.

22
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Shrek vs. Harry Potter.

23
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
I don't know who wrote that.

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Is that one?

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
I don't know who wrote that in the topic.

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
I don't get it.

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Wow, some idiot.

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
It's in there.

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Jesus.

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Shrek.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Shrek.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,900
And today's topic, which is never going outside, or, I don't know, being a Hikikomori, you

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,580
know, keeping it in the homestead, not being a social butterfly out in the real world.

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,300
And I don't know, I thought we'd just share anecdotes, how we feel about it, our relationships

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
with the outside world.

36
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,220
Share some hot tips and tricks for all you aspiring Hikikomoris out there.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
Exactly.

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,020
So, who's got something to say, Saraswamy?

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Digi, I know you have.

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Okay, Ben.

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,460
My room is pitch-dark right now.

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,460
It's 6 p.m. The sun is out, but my room is pitch-black because I got my bathrobe tape

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,460
to my window.

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,580
That must be some strong tape.

45
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Because I don't want it.

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Actually, it's not tape.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,580
It's wedged into the frame.

48
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,580
Whatever.

49
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Oh, okay.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,140
And I got my air conditioner in under it.

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,940
It does not let any light in.

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
It's nighttime.

53
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Oh, nice.

54
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
It's nighttime all the time.

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,940
Here in Ben St.'s house.

56
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
That sounds great.

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,740
So, do you like it dark for any particular reason?

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,220
Well, my sleep schedule is off.

59
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,820
I've just been staying up until 9 a.m. or staying up until noon the next day drawing,

60
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,940
and I don't want to reset.

61
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,780
So I just said, I'll just ignore what time it is, and now I don't know.

62
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Now I'm just...

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
Now I don't...

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,820
I never know what time it is, so I just work until I'm too tired, and then I go to bed.

65
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,380
And that's my life.

66
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,380
That's the way to do it.

67
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
If you can.

68
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
If you can.

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,020
Is it more of a that you don't want to know what time of day it is, or that you can't get

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
to sleep with daylight?

71
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Both.

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,220
I mean, I always do know what time it is, so that's...

73
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,340
I wish I didn't know what time it was, but no, I can't go to sleep when the windows open

74
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,100
and there's a sun.

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,420
I can't go to sleep with the sun.

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,580
Oh, Jesus, a fucking garage door opening under me.

77
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,820
Is that loud?

78
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
A little bit.

79
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,540
You know, our dad had his office was built into the building, or like the room right

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,740
above our garage, where he would, you know, he's a psychologist, he would have like patients

81
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,780
there, and all the time he would just get fucked up when we'd come home and open the

82
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
garage door.

83
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,660
I still wonder why he chose to put it there.

84
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
I don't know if it's...

85
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
It's not a choice.

86
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,660
Never mind, never mind.

87
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,060
All right, anyway, Digi, I was curious.

88
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,580
I mean, you've talked about this many times before, but you've got a friend who was like

89
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,100
a professional Hikikomori for a while.

90
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,540
Yeah, like full blown.

91
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Yeah, that's right.

92
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
That's right.

93
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,700
Yeah, it was at a time when, you know, I was in high school, was probably my most, like,

94
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,380
well, I don't know, it's hard to say.

95
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,460
I mean, obviously right now I'm the most Hikikomori because I have no social obligations at all,

96
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,220
and when I was in high school, I was going to high school.

97
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,380
But like, back then was when I was the most, like, paranoid about going outside and like,

98
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:23,460
you know, I had, luckily at the time, well, luckily for this lifestyle, there was a bathroom

99
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,420
that was right at the bottom of my stairs.

100
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,500
Like I had, my room was a room over the garage, which it is as well now, but now I have my

101
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
own bathroom.

102
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,500
But there was a bathroom at the bottom of the stairs, and a door, like, basically like,

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,780
I would go down the stairs and to the left is a bathroom, to the right is a door, right?

104
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Yeah.

105
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,060
I'd keep that door closed for the most part.

106
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,740
And I would always, like, I was always paranoid when I was like, because I was doing pretty

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,500
bad in school and stuff, and just generally my mind was falling apart at this point in

108
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
my life.

109
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Uh-huh.

110
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,060
The same time as the story I told in the school episode, like, this is that time.

111
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
Oh, yeah, right, right.

112
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
Okay, sure.

113
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Yeah.

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,140
So, I was like, I didn't want to see anybody, like, I would always be worried that if my

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,780
parents, like, saw me, they'd ask me questions about, like, how school is going.

116
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,300
Oh, yeah, very understandable, sure.

117
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,860
And so, I, yeah, so I would go down the stairs, like, you know, real quiet, and then go to

118
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,300
the bathroom, like, real quick, and leave, and then I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't

119
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,900
go into the kitchen or anything, I wouldn't, like, go into the rest of the house.

120
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,340
And this is when I started, um, like, because I would, like, for drinks, like, all I drink

121
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,340
was Mountain Dew at the time.

122
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Yeah.

123
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,420
And I'd get, like, a two liter of Mountain Dew, and I'd pour myself, like, this, I'd

124
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,420
have this huge cup, and I'd just fill it up to the top and take it up to my room and

125
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,060
just be drinking that, like, all day, and not leave, you know.

126
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,660
Like anything to not leave my room, um, because I was so worried that if anybody saw me, they

127
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,300
were gonna, like, I don't know, I, I don't know about you guys, but do you ever feel

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,020
like, uh, your emotions should be more readable than they are?

129
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,580
Like, um, yes, I understand that, yeah, I know what you mean.

130
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,500
It took me a long time to realize that, like, my depression was not on my face, like, because

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,780
I would always wonder why nobody was asking me what's wrong, because, like, I'd be, there

132
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,460
would be times where I'd be, like, at dinner, and I'd just be, like, crushingly depressed

133
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,460
and have, and, like, all I'm thinking is, like, someone please ask me what's wrong,

134
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,820
because I look, I feel like I look terrible, but then I'd look at myself in the mirror

135
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,540
and I'd look completely normal, you know, but, like, I'm basically going all full feel

136
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
guy right there.

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,740
I'm the opposite.

138
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,820
All my life, people have been asking me what's wrong, even though I'm fine.

139
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm not kidding, like, something about my face or something, like, in school, people

140
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,900
would be like, oh, are you okay, you look sad, and I'd be like, what?

141
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
It's, it's fine.

142
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,420
I've seen, I've seen a little bit of that, I've seen some moments where I saw you and

143
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,460
you looked like you were gonna cry, and then I talked to you, you were okay, and I burned

144
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
a car.

145
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,820
Yeah, um, I, other people have said that, and I don't get it, but, uh, whatever.

146
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,820
Yeah.

147
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Man, that's, that's interesting.

148
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,780
But you know, did you, I can totally relate to, uh, when me and Ben were growing up, like,

149
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,540
we would, uh, it's not like we would hide, but like, we would go upstairs to our rooms,

150
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,860
and we knew if we came downstairs and saw our dad, our dad might make us do things,

151
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
you know.

152
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Oh my God.

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
He might make us do chores.

154
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
Oh God.

155
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,940
Or make us take out the trash, and at the time, I would do whatever it took to avoid having

156
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
to do that.

157
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Yeah, same.

158
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,700
I don't, I don't want to, I don't, okay, if it's the same for you, then maybe this

159
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,180
isn't that important.

160
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:40,300
I just, our dad, I don't want to go on a big thing about our dad, but like, his, his,

161
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,340
he always like, he always like needed, I don't know if you felt this way, Nate, but he always

162
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,940
needed me to be doing something, even if nothing needed to be done.

163
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,940
Dude.

164
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,440
That was the biggest thing.

165
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,180
Seeing me not doing something would make, would irritate him, even if nothing needed

166
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,580
to be done, it would irritate him so much that he would make me do something totally

167
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
unnecessary.

168
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,460
To this day, I'm uncomfortable playing video games unless I'm like locked in my room alone,

169
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,140
because if, if whenever I hear someone come along, I feel this pain, like this sudden

170
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,660
panic and guilt, like I'm going to get in trouble for like doing something fun instead

171
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,860
of doing the work I'm supposed to be doing.

172
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Dad, dad would be mad.

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,460
He made me a fucked up guy.

174
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,660
Dad would be mad just for seeing us play video games, even if it was totally fine.

175
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,660
But, alright, I don't, I also don't want to get into a big thing about that, but it was,

176
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,740
it wasn't enough for him that like we do our chores.

177
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,540
What he wanted, he wanted us to like, want to volunteer.

178
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,340
Yes, he was like extra things.

179
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,740
He would lecture us about this.

180
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,320
It's not enough that you do the things I ask you to do.

181
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,340
You should be doing them without me asking.

182
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Dude, it's exactly like, it's exactly like that speech.

183
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,740
You should be volunteering to clean the yard and do the dishes.

184
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Oh my God.

185
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,340
Dude, it's just like an office space.

186
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,460
When that boss was lecturing, yeah, go on.

187
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,980
My dad did something similar.

188
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,620
He was never as, my dad was never as like a strict with us, but he would always get

189
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,820
mad at us that like, he'd be like, and y'all like never do the dishes.

190
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,900
And I'm like, well, you never say do the dishes.

191
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,660
Whenever you say do the dishes, someone does them.

192
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,140
And he's like, I shouldn't have to be saying do the dishes.

193
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,340
I'm like, well, the thing is that like, well, it's like, it's like not understanding a difference

194
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
in values, right?

195
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,140
Like to my dad, he's, my dad was in the Navy and like you had to keep your room perfectly

196
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
clean.

197
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Right, right.

198
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
And he's kind of a neat freak anyways.

199
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,140
I live with a guy in the Navy right now who's, who's kind of the same about like our

200
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
business and shit.

201
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:39,340
And so like to him, when he sees mess, he registers it as a problem in his life that

202
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,540
there is, that he comes home to a messy house, whereas for me, I come home to a messy house

203
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,060
and that's just what it is.

204
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,740
It's, I don't care.

205
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,460
Like there's nothing about what I'm seeing feels wrong to me.

206
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
That is the exact same.

207
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,860
And I've felt this the same way about like the difference between me and my dad.

208
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,980
Like my dad is like, what are you, what are you doing that your, your, your room is messy?

209
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,380
And I'm like, why, why shouldn't it be messy?

210
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
What's the, what's the big deal?

211
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,340
There's a, there's a clear difference in values there, but you know, I understand how this

212
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
might sound.

213
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,260
And I don't want it to come across like, because I too, like now that I'm an adult, I understand

214
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,020
that like when I see that there's things that can be done, it's, it's not like you have

215
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,020
an opt in or opt out only option to like everything in your life.

216
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,500
Like it's good to, to contribute to the environment in which you live.

217
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,380
It's like a responsible adult thing to do.

218
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,380
And it's good.

219
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,060
And like to not do it could be construed as generally shitty.

220
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,220
Well, here's a funny thing because you guys both moved out when you became adults.

221
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,220
Oh, that is not.

222
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
No, that's not true.

223
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
Oh, in that sense.

224
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Yes.

225
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
In that sense.

226
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Yes.

227
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
You went off to live in dorms.

228
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
We came back for a while.

229
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,300
Me and Victor and Shade all still live at home.

230
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,700
And at some point, at some point around when Victor graduated, I guess, maybe even earlier,

231
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,580
when I graduated, my dad realized this difference.

232
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,780
Like he finally, it's like clicked in his head that we were never going to care about

233
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
certain things.

234
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Right.

235
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:12,380
And so he just stopped asking and started hiring people, like for the, the lawn, our,

236
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,340
our house, he has like a whole team of yard workers who come like every weekend or so during

237
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
the summer.

238
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,140
Ben, have you had to do those stakes on the, on the goddamn perimeter trees anytime recently

239
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
in recent years?

240
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,140
He has to do all of the yard work.

241
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,140
A year ago.

242
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Yeah.

243
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Oh God.

244
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
It's, it's, my dad has never learned that lesson and never will.

245
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,140
He will insist.

246
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,460
Well, he would, you know, cause, cause people would always say, you have three strong, strapping

247
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,460
young boys.

248
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,140
Why are none of them doing the yard work?

249
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,260
You know, he'd always say that and stuff and I'm like, because I don't go outside.

250
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,780
I don't see the yard and when I do see it, the fact that it's two inches longer doesn't

251
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,780
bother me.

252
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780
I don't care.

253
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
It looks fine.

254
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
It's a, it's grass.

255
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
It's supposed to be long.

256
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
I don't know.

257
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Yeah.

258
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,180
My dad would like, he would like, see me come downstairs and be like, Ben, you're not doing

259
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
anything.

260
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,300
I'm automatically upset about this.

261
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,620
Uh, here's some mulch, go and spread it in the yard.

262
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,380
And then I'd be like, well, since you asked, okay, and I go out and I spend, you know,

263
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,100
like an hour or two, like fucking spreading mulch on the flower beds or whatever or something.

264
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,540
And then, yeah, this is the sort of thing he would say.

265
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,180
He would come out and look at this mulched yard and be like, now, Ben, he would like

266
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,900
sort of indulgently, like smilingly be like, I got him now.

267
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,940
Like now, now, Ben, look at this.

268
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Look what you've done.

269
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Look at this yard.

270
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Doesn't this look better?

271
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,340
Like, isn't this satisfying to you?

272
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
Don't you feel like you've done something good here?

273
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,580
And I'm like, no, shut up, stop, stop trying to make, stop trying to make me care about

274
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,580
what I've been doing.

275
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
Yeah.

276
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,580
And that's the thing.

277
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,580
That's how it ties into this.

278
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,220
Because for, for a lot of us, our world doesn't extend to the perimeter, the outside lawn

279
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,580
of the house that we're living in.

280
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,460
For us guys, we're like, we're, we're, you know, we're, we're ghosts living in the

281
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
shell of the internet.

282
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,260
My world does not extend beyond my room.

283
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:13,340
Like, I mean, yeah, like my, my mom does the dishes and, uh, like these days and like,

284
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,860
if there was one thing that I, that I feel the slightest bit bad about not doing, it

285
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
would be the dishes.

286
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,580
Cause I'll just leave my plates down there and let whoever is going to clean them, take

287
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
care of them.

288
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,500
But other than that, like as I've grown up, um, because like we all eat or we all like

289
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,700
get our own food now at this point, like no one, we're not like meeting downstairs for

290
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
dinner.

291
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
I don't go downstairs much.

292
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,020
I, I have no opportunities to mess up anything else in the house.

293
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:47,860
So as far as I'm concerned, it's not my house really, you know, like the yard outside, like

294
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,380
if, if it was, if, if my dad was like, uh, the yard is partly your responsibility cause

295
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,380
you live here.

296
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,620
I'd be like, no, the yard is your yard.

297
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,780
I don't, I don't interact with the yard.

298
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,780
It's not my yard.

299
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,260
If it was up to me, if I lived in my own place, I would get a place without a yard.

300
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,780
See, you know, that's, that's, that's where our dad had a different mentality.

301
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,500
Because we lived in that house with him, he viewed that like, okay, you're benefiting

302
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,700
from this lawn.

303
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
You're living in a nice place.

304
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Yeah.

305
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,100
But are you really, I mean, the thing about that is, yeah, I agree with you that no, I'm

306
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,820
not really getting anything out of the yard.

307
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,660
And if I had a place, I wouldn't own a yard.

308
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,300
So like, uh, it's your responsibility dad.

309
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,700
I agree with that on the one hand, but on the other hand, like lawn maintenance contributes

310
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,420
to the overall value of the house and the value of the house is well, I know that's why

311
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
he cares about it.

312
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,060
Yeah.

313
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,620
And that's, that's just like, that's just like protecting your investment in the house

314
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
base.

315
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,500
I've come to understand that is like the purpose of lawn care is so that the value of your

316
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,020
house does not fall.

317
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,220
Okay, sure.

318
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,460
And my dad is constantly like refinancing the house and like doing stuff like that with

319
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
it.

320
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,500
But, uh, but you know, for me, it was like the second I started paying rent, then it

321
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,300
was like, all right, I no longer feel like, cause, cause a lot of the obligation is like,

322
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,260
well, I'm living here for free.

323
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,060
So I should be doing things to help my dad.

324
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,500
But if I'm not living here for free, then, uh, I'm doing my part and I'm giving you money.

325
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,700
You can use my money to pay the guys who mow the lawn.

326
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,820
And now like I live in an apartment, I stay in my room, I do my work.

327
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,220
I don't give a shit about the fucking lawn outside.

328
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
What am I going to do?

329
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Go mow the lawn?

330
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Why?

331
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
No, never.

332
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Not in a million years.

333
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,500
I think of doing anything for the lawn outside and that's, you know, that's the place I want

334
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,780
to be in life where I don't have to be loaded up with these extra worries about things.

335
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,020
I'm much more concerned with getting, using my time to get my fucking work done because

336
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,820
the nature of the work that all of us are trying to do is like spent as much time as

337
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,740
possible doing your shit so that you can fucking make it out there.

338
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,180
So I was living in this place where the people on the lease were being evicted and no one

339
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,940
was paying any rent and it was a very stressful situation.

340
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,660
We were all afraid every day that the landlord was going to show up with this sheriff and

341
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,200
either evict us or just murder us or something or just burn the house down.

342
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,660
He actually came into our basement uninvited and unannounced one time and cut our internet

343
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,020
cord to try and fuck the landlord.

344
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,940
Yeah, the landlord actually came in and physically chopped the internet cord in half.

345
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,380
We were without internet for several weeks while we were trying to figure out what was

346
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
going on.

347
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Yeah, man.

348
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
It was fucked.

349
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:30,340
His name was, that guy's name was Charlie Tseng, but Charlie was his American name.

350
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,420
His actual name was Dragon.

351
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,220
His name was Dragon Tseng.

352
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Awesome.

353
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
Holy shit.

354
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,820
Was he in a Yakuza?

355
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
What do you think?

356
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
More likely the Triad.

357
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
Yeah, the Triad.

358
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,460
All right, go on.

359
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,180
Anyway, anyway.

360
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,300
And I also lived with this, a couple of guys, but one of them was a really stressful, heavily

361
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,900
bipolar dude who was always like, he just had weird manic episodes where he would like

362
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,340
make us all move furniture around and like get me.

363
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,340
And whenever I got involved with him, it was always this big fucking thing.

364
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,340
It would always take like an hour and a half of like him deciding where all the furniture

365
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,340
was going to go.

366
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
And like, I couldn't leave.

367
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
I couldn't get out of it.

368
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
It was very annoying.

369
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,460
Anyway, all of this is to say that the stress of this environment made me so hesitant to

370
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,620
leave my room that I was actually peeing in two liter bottles for a while because I didn't

371
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
want to walk to the bathroom.

372
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,860
I knew we had to get to that because that seems, to me, that is the thing.

373
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
The Hikikomori technique.

374
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
That's when you know.

375
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
Really?

376
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
That you've arrived at Hikikomori.

377
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
I was.

378
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
I was for a while.

379
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
That's very interesting.

380
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Yeah, go on, go on.

381
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,980
I do not understand why all I would have had to do was walk to the bathroom and walk back.

382
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,220
This is like, it was not a complicated thing.

383
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,900
Looking back, I don't understand why I decided this was the right thing to do, but I did and

384
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,980
I won't apologize for it.

385
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,820
That makes some sense to me, but what doesn't make sense to me to this day is that when I

386
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:01,020
was a freshman in college, my roommate, James, was a super alpha drug dealer and he was a

387
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
pretty cool guy.

388
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
Alpha drug dealer.

389
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,020
Yeah.

390
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,140
Why do you say that he was, was being a drug dealer making more alpha?

391
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
No, no, no.

392
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Those two things were separate.

393
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Those two things were separate.

394
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
He just happened to be a drug dealer.

395
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
He wasn't a bitch at all.

396
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,340
He was on the baseball team.

397
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,300
He fucked bitches constantly.

398
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,420
He sold a little bit of drugs and he was just, he was a pretty cool guy.

399
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,140
We didn't really talk much, but he was all right.

400
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,980
But the point is like, for whatever reason, one day we had a recycling bin, I look in

401
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,980
the bottom of the recycling bin and there's just bottles of piss.

402
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,540
There's just bottles of piss down there and thinking back on it now, in fact, this is

403
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,700
just a current in me right now.

404
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,260
I had assumed, I see do this in the middle of the night sometimes and I was like, what

405
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
is this?

406
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,020
And so the next day I took the bottle, put it on his desk and just said like, this has

407
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
to stop.

408
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,860
I didn't even speak to him about it.

409
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,260
It's so confrontational about it.

410
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,020
Well, I just didn't know what to do.

411
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,380
I was completely thrown.

412
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,820
This has to stop.

413
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
This has to stop.

414
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
Yeah.

415
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,500
And, but you know, thinking back on it now, I'm wondering if he was maybe saving clean

416
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,540
piss for some sort of exam.

417
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,780
Well, maybe he would have been keeping them in the fridge then.

418
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
That's true.

419
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,900
He wouldn't have put them in the trash can.

420
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,220
I just think he didn't want to leave the room.

421
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,820
Maybe it's that when he was on drugs, he didn't want to be seen by anybody.

422
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
Maybe he wouldn't leave the room.

423
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Maybe he had.

424
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
It seems likely to be.

425
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,100
Maybe he, yeah, maybe it was he was saving piss, but like they'd been there too long

426
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,780
and they were too old or something or maybe he had gotten through the test he was saving

427
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,380
up for and he didn't need them anymore or something.

428
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,380
Why would you need that much piss?

429
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,500
That there were multiple bottles.

430
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,940
There were literally several bottles full of piss at the bottom of the recycling bin.

431
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,820
I think the best logical reason would be that he didn't want to be outside his room when

432
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
he was on drugs.

433
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
All right.

434
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,940
If that's the case, if that's the case, then he still was pulling a boner move by not getting

435
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,700
rid of them the next day and leaving them there to pile up in our shared room.

436
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,020
Fuck you James, you're all right though.

437
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,780
That friend of mine who was a Hickey Comrie to get back to that story, because God, we

438
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,500
got on a 20 minute sidetrack.

439
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,860
You guys are at 25 minutes, right?

440
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,940
Yeah, about 23 or so.

441
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Yeah.

442
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
23 or so?

443
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
23 or so.

444
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
It just hit 24.

445
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Okay.

446
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
Well, that's right.

447
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
I think I started.

448
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
You probably started before us.

449
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
Yeah.

450
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,380
I'm making sure because it looked like it was like somehow the time was going faster than

451
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
it should be.

452
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,060
It was why I wanted to stop my recording.

453
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Yeah.

454
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Okay.

455
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,860
It looked like seconds were going by in half seconds on the recording.

456
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Weird.

457
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Yeah.

458
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,380
It was really bizarre looking.

459
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,140
But the recording itself looked fine, like the waveforms looked fine.

460
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,140
I don't know.

461
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
It was fucking weird.

462
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:46,860
Anyway, yeah, when I was in high school and I was talking to my friend, like he had cluster

463
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,540
headaches and he just stopped coming to school because like he would get them in the morning

464
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,780
and it would just be like a severe debilitating migraine that would happen at like 6 a.m.

465
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,780
And it could last up to like hours.

466
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,220
And so it would just happen every single day.

467
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,660
Like every day on the news, he'd get a giant headache.

468
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,460
And if you look into cluster headaches, they're like a weird thing that like is not well documented,

469
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
like medically.

470
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,660
It only became like a known phenomenon like 10 years ago.

471
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
Yeah.

472
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,500
We had a neighbor who got those who would occasionally, they should get mad at us for

473
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,420
like our dog barking too much and aggravating your shit.

474
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
But yeah, it sucks.

475
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,180
I wouldn't want to live like that.

476
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,340
It was crazy because like it's something that everyone who had it, it would be different.

477
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,020
Like each migraine would have a different intensity.

478
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,540
Some people had it like multiple times a day.

479
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,900
Some people had it like, you know, just once a day.

480
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,020
Sometimes it was on a schedule.

481
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,780
Sometimes it wasn't like everyone had a totally different case of it.

482
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,220
And they had no idea what the cure was or anything.

483
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,980
So he became a part of a experimental like thing to like try to find a cure.

484
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,260
And it ended up being literally psychedelic mushrooms.

485
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,140
And he hasn't had one since and that was like 2008 or 2009.

486
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,380
So he basically got the Eric Andre, feed them LSD, link arms in a circle, scream nightmare

487
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,380
and cured his retardation or in this case, his cluster headaches.

488
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Yeah.

489
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,980
Because of those, because of him not going to school because of the cluster headaches,

490
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,020
like from what I understand, because he told me about himself in middle school and it sounds

491
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,940
like he was pretty normal in middle school.

492
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,460
Like he listened to a lot of hip hop hung out with other kids his age, you know, like

493
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,380
just was just a normal Asian middle school.

494
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,020
That's the gateway drug.

495
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Yeah.

496
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,260
And then once he got like in late middle school, early high school, he started getting the cluster

497
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,620
headaches and he became a full blown otaku and just dedicated himself to just sitting

498
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,500
in his room watching hundreds of anime and playing like he was one of those guys who

499
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,180
played like every video game, seen every anime, read every manga, like he did all of it because

500
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,500
he had nothing but time and he had no real interest in like making things.

501
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,900
So he would just sit there and consume all of the information on the internet, essentially.

502
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,500
He was like, he was a fucking genius.

503
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,340
He knew like, he managed to get his, like he got his GED and he like passed all the

504
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,620
tests without even studying.

505
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,740
He just like walked in and took them all and got a hundred because he just knew everything.

506
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,460
But like, but because of the cluster headaches, he couldn't come to school and so he would

507
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,660
just be in his room all the time and he told me that like before he met me, there was a

508
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,300
period where he reached a level of paranoia where he wouldn't leave his room at all.

509
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,700
Like his parents would leave food at his door.

510
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Oh, hardcore.

511
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,340
He'd wait till nobody was around and drag the tray in, you know, like sometimes he'd

512
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,940
get like super paranoid and start pissing in bottles and not even, he's like right next

513
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
to a bathroom.

514
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,340
Crazy shit happens to you when you're isolated.

515
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Yeah.

516
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
Yeah.

517
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,900
It's just like you get these, these weird ideas.

518
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,380
I mean, there was a few times where I was like, I almost was pissing in bottles.

519
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,620
Just I couldn't, I couldn't bring myself to do it.

520
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,940
It was weird because like, didn't expect to be so important in this podcast, but yeah,

521
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,180
no, I remember a time where like I had, I had like an empty two liter bottle and I'm

522
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,500
sitting there like, just contemplating, like really having to piss and like holding my

523
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,020
dick over this thing and I'm like, I can't do it.

524
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm seeing, I'm seeing like, I'm seeing Digi like push himself back from his computer,

525
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,980
like slump down in his chair and then like, and then like his head turns to the side and

526
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,220
then the camera focus changes and he blurs out and in the foreground, the bottle comes

527
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,580
into focus and he's just like, oh my God.

528
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,460
The fish I let zoom on it.

529
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,980
Yeah, I could never bring myself to just piss in bottles, but but I had a lot of times

530
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,780
where like I got to that level kids at home.

531
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
Don't do it.

532
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,780
Don't fucking do it.

533
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,460
If you're thinking it might be a good idea.

534
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,740
Yeah, just go.

535
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,340
It's not.

536
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,020
It's not the answer to your problems.

537
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,060
OK, however much it might seem like it, what was always funny to me about it is that it's

538
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,380
not that weird to piss in a bottle.

539
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,260
Like it doesn't, it doesn't mean anything.

540
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,820
It won't do anything bad.

541
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,420
Like it's there's nothing wrong with it.

542
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,740
It's totally like some people have like a mouth nearing trick to like keep yourself high.

543
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,620
Well, here's, here's what I found about it.

544
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,340
Once I started, it was very easy to continue.

545
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,420
Once, once I pissed in that first bottle, I was just, I was just like, well, this is

546
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,340
OK. Once you pop, you can't, you know, it really is an issue of it's not the answer

547
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,580
to your problems you're looking for.

548
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,700
You know, you can do it.

549
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,940
Like if you do it once in a while, no big deal.

550
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,780
You know that Casey Green cart or comic of the dog sitting in a room full of fire and

551
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,020
he's like, this is fine.

552
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,380
Yes.

553
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,300
Just imagine me sitting in a room full of bottles of piss.

554
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,700
With a little coffee cup full of piss.

555
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,340
And I looked down into the, and I looked down into the piss filled cup and I go, this is fine.

556
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,660
And then he picks it up and takes a long slurp.

557
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
You see, that's where you go.

558
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,020
That's the path they're going down.

559
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,420
Yeah, basically.

560
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,900
I could, I could decide if I want to get into a whole unrelated piss story or we just

561
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,860
want to sit you with the piss cast dude, go for it, go for it.

562
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,460
All right.

563
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,660
Well, when I was getting my job at Target, I had to take like a piss test

564
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,540
to the doctor and like I was sitting there waiting for them to like call me in.

565
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,140
And I'm like drinking a bottle of water, you know, trying to get myself ready to piss.

566
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,860
And I had like by the time she called me, I had to pee more than I've ever had to pee

567
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,940
in my entire life.

568
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,820
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,860
So she calls me back and like there's two women working at this clinic that I'm at.

570
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,180
One who's they're both like fat black ladies, one at the register

571
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,540
and one who's taking me back to do the test.

572
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,140
And they're both just pissed.

573
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,980
Like they both seem like they have no desire to be there or to be alive at this moment.

574
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,100
Understandable.

575
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,340
She she calls me back and like the the the the room where they do the test is just

576
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,620
it's like a a bathroom that's like real small.

577
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,460
It's just like a toilet and a sink behind you.

578
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:49,740
Yeah. Right.

579
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,340
And it's one of those real narrow ones.

580
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,900
But she was like standing right outside the door and had the door slightly open

581
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,380
because like I guess they have to make sure you don't try to, you know,

582
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,340
yeah, yeah, yes, whatever.

583
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,060
And I get like really bad like piss paranoia.

584
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,660
Like I don't want people to hear me.

585
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
I don't want them to be next to me while trying to pee.

586
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,460
You know, like I've always had a problem with that.

587
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,940
I've sort of incurving it over the last few years because of this incident

588
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,380
making me realize how much of a problem it was.

589
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,580
But I I'm standing there with like the cup in my hand.

590
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,540
I have to pee more than I've ever had to pee and I cannot make myself pee.

591
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,060
And I'm standing there like trying with all my like pushing with all the force

592
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,380
of my body and it won't work.

593
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,100
And finally, the lady's like she she keeps like going like where are you up in there?

594
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,900
You know, in the green mile.

595
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,620
I don't know. I haven't seen the green.

596
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,540
He had a yeah, but she keeps saying like hurry up in there.

597
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,420
And I'm like, I can't I can't like I can't make it happen.

598
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,500
And she was like, well, you're taking too long.

599
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,140
So now you have to go wait again.

600
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,020
What? So she sends me back out to the.

601
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,860
Yeah, because if you're taking too long, like you could be trying to rig it or something.

602
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:59,140
So she sends me back out to the lobby and makes me like a re wait for this test.

603
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,500
And at this point, I'm like, things feel like they're rupturing inside me.

604
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,100
Like I actually felt like I was dying because I had to pee so bad.

605
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,180
And I'm like sweating and shit.

606
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,060
And I'm like, I'm tempted to just go to the bathroom because I have to pee so much.

607
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,620
And I'm like, I can't wait for this anymore.

608
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,540
Like I've got to die, you know, and then finally she called me back again.

609
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,620
And I had to like pull my pants all the way off and like sit down and like angle

610
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,660
my dick right into the bottom of the cup and like push with all of my might.

611
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,700
Like it never, you know, a lot of the times when like if you're if you're

612
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,060
if you feel awkward in like a bathroom, then you might like it might take you

613
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,900
a minute to get started. But then once you start, you kind of ease up.

614
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,420
You're like, OK, now I feel relieved.

615
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,660
This was not like that.

616
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,940
Every ounce of it had to be pushed.

617
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,700
It was like me standing there like, ah, ah.

618
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,540
Just on the green mile.

619
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,420
It feels like I'm pissing glass, he said.

620
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,260
Yeah. Oh, God, that is what it what it felt like.

621
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,660
It was a fucking nightmare.

622
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,980
And I filled that cup up to the max.

623
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,740
And then I had to keep going into the toilet afterwards.

624
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,820
Oh, man, that's brutal.

625
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,740
That's hard. It was fucking horrifying.

626
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,020
But yeah, anyway, about not leaving your room.

627
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,060
It's all related.

628
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,660
So this is integral to the story of every need.

629
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,220
I guess so.

630
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,420
Well, let me let me let me tell you, I live in I live in a house with a bunch

631
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,020
of guys and they're all they're they're pretty cool guys that we're friends.

632
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,780
And for a while, I had what I would almost describe as an act of social life.

633
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,940
I would go out and hang out in the living room and have conversations with people.

634
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,700
Imagine that. Imagine.

635
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,820
But I've been living here for like six months now.

636
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,820
And I kind of feel like the honeymoon is over.

637
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,020
That's exactly right.

638
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,060
Holy shit. Holy shit.

639
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,780
Yeah, damn, like, like, like now we've hung out enough.

640
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,300
Like, I know who they are.

641
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,380
They're not surprising me anymore.

642
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,020
Like, I get it.

643
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,060
So I'm just like, OK, well, nice knowing you.

644
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Have a have a good life.

645
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,660
You know, you know, just, you know, I'm now I'd stay in my room all the time.

646
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,900
I've noticed that all my friends are really boring

647
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,420
unless they're doing something new, you know, unless they're exposing me

648
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,140
to something interesting when it's happening.

649
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,020
I'll just, you know, I've I've known a bunch of people for my entire life.

650
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,740
And I don't really care about their shit anymore

651
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,660
because it's the same shit they've been doing for years.

652
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,820
I mean, I'm friends with a bunch of people that still come over and like,

653
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,140
I don't know, they we we used to share hobbies.

654
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,940
But now I've like, I've like given up all my old hobbies.

655
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,500
All I want to do is do my art and shit.

656
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,740
Yes, all I want to do is describing my life.

657
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,260
I like I used to I used to be into, you know, playing Dungeons and Dragons

658
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,500
and playing board games and Magic the Gathering.

659
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,020
Now I think that all those things are just big fucking waste of time.

660
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,500
And I hate them and I feel like I'm disappointing them sometimes.

661
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,620
And they're like, yeah, we're going to do this.

662
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,980
Do you want to like, no, goodbye?

663
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,740
Dude, just my co-workers invited me out to go see some fucking rom-com movie.

664
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,780
And it just sounded like the absolute worst possible use of my time.

665
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,140
And I was like, no, of course I don't want to go.

666
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,260
Why on earth would you even think that I would go?

667
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,700
I would go and see a movie.

668
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,900
We'll see. I thought about it.

669
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,740
And I was like, you know what?

670
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,020
I could put in the effort to make this relationship between us just a little

671
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,260
healthier, but this movie sounds horrific.

672
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,460
There's no chance I'm going to go watch this movie.

673
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,860
And what what is the benefit of this relationship long term of these?

674
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,580
The only way it could ever pay off is if I, I don't know,

675
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,700
like get some social group thing going where I feel a rewarding connection with.

676
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,260
But I don't these people are fine.

677
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,260
My co-workers are totally cool people, but we definitely don't share interests.

678
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,500
You know, so how many months of time am I going to have to like water

679
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,460
this little seed to make it bloom into a relationship

680
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,660
that I can get something out of?

681
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,020
I don't know. I don't have the time for that.

682
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,540
I got videos to make.

683
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,100
Yeah. You know, that's why the PCP is such a healthy group

684
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
because we stay interested in the shit that each other's doing.

685
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,940
I think that I think that the basis of a great and healthy friendship

686
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,660
is that the two partner, the two members of the friendship,

687
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,740
mutually benefit one another. Yeah.

688
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,780
And like if if hanging out with a friend is just you like

689
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,980
emptily indulging in like hobbies that you don't aren't interested in

690
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,180
or just like, you know, shooting the shit, I don't know, drinking beer,

691
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,460
waxing about the good old days. What do you get out of that?

692
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,940
Nothing. Right.

693
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,820
Totally agree. Waxing about the good old days.

694
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,780
One of the things I least like to do the only time I hang out with my friends

695
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,260
at all is when I like want to get fucked up drunk because it's not fun.

696
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,300
You know, which I also don't do anymore

697
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,380
because it's a waste of time and it irritates. Oh God, I did it yesterday.

698
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,020
It was the worst time of my entire life.

699
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,340
I never drank alcohol ever again.

700
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,900
You were very sick yesterday.

701
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,500
I sure was.

702
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,180
PSP had to be postponed. I mean, PCP.

703
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,900
So, um, me and that that friend of mine, becoming friends,

704
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,180
right, a huge part of it, like a huge basis of how we became so close,

705
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,500
was welcome to the NHK, the anime about Higikomariness,

706
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,700
which I still haven't seen it, but I want to.

707
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,140
I watched it recently and it changed my life.

708
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,660
One of the best shows I've ever seen in my entire life.

709
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,300
Yeah. And it was, uh, because at the time,

710
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,700
because this was 2007 and that show aired in 05 or 06.

711
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,060
I think it was in 05, but yeah, whatever.

712
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,540
I think it ran between them.

713
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,460
Either way, I saw it in early 07 and it was like my favorite show for a long time

714
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,500
because, you know, I was a heke, a borderline Hikikomori at the time.

715
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,060
You know, I didn't trust people.

716
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,740
I was paranoid about everything.

717
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,420
And so this show was like, man, this really speaks to my life.

718
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,020
But the funny thing is that, like, um, I think one of the most important things

719
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:42,260
about Welcome to the NHK is that even though Sato kind of gets out of it at the end,

720
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:47,340
yeah, the there's this implication that he's like, it's not complete.

721
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,740
Oh, dude, the little monsters are still there.

722
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
They're hanging around trying to get back in.

723
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,900
And if you read the original novel, which is a lot darker, every pony, baby steps.

724
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,860
Yeah, the novel is a lot darker than the anime.

725
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,460
And at the end of it, like, because there's like an afterword for the, you know,

726
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,420
like after like a year had passed since he wrote the novel.

727
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,860
And the guy was like, you know, all I've been doing is living off the residuals

728
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,100
from this book and sitting around and still being a Hikikomori.

729
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,140
He's like, he was like, I tried to write this like as a way to maybe

730
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,540
write my way out of it, and it did not work.

731
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,940
And since then, he's he's only written like a few books like for a Japanese

732
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,060
creator, he is not prolific.

733
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,500
Like most Japanese creators are obscenely prolific.

734
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,140
He is not at all.

735
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,420
He really did just like coop up inside himself and like remain a paranoid man.

736
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,380
And like all the books he's written are all about the subject of paranoia and stuff.

737
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,940
It kills me that anyone has to live like that.

738
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,060
When I know the problem is solvable, just with like that's how it was for me,

739
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,420
though, because I watched the show and like it was kind of because my favorite

740
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,820
moment in the show I've brought this up before is like when they meet the other.

741
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,660
Hikikomori. Oh, yeah, like I've read every self-help book there is.

742
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,980
I could probably write a self-help book, but I'm still a Hikikomori.

743
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,180
And the only thing that gets that guy out of the situation is when his lifelines

744
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,940
cut off and he has to literally get a job to live.

745
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,460
Yeah, that's what finally gets him out of being.

746
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,980
Oh, God, that scene is so fucking wonderful.

747
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,180
Everything about it rules.

748
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,340
That seems fantastic.

749
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,980
And like for me, I watched the show so I understood like the nature

750
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,700
of what I was dealing with and how to get out of it.

751
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,620
But there was no actual like thing making me out of it.

752
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,580
I was still in high school.

753
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,260
I was still miserable with my school.

754
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,300
Man, you can't do shit when you're in high school anyway.

755
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,580
Yeah, nothing could change it.

756
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,420
Because like all because I was determined to drop out at the time.

757
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,980
Like all I wanted was to drop out of school and be like,

758
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm going to go become a director because school is making me miserable.

759
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,140
Yeah, like no one was going to let me drop out.

760
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,500
You know, people are constantly telling me no.

761
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,740
And I didn't have the balls to just like up and, you know,

762
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,300
leave or anything like that, because I would think about running away every day.

763
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,860
I was always like, I'm just going to fucking go out on my own and find my own path.

764
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,340
But I didn't know how to do that.

765
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,020
So yeah, I'm going to I'm going to go out with with a wooden sword

766
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,980
and slay and slay mobs until one of them drops a legendary artifact

767
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:18,260
camera so that I can use this rare camera drop to become a director.

768
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,900
That's the only way I can see it working.

769
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,940
So me me and well, I had a nice camera.

770
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,500
My dad bought me a nice camera for this purpose and we never used it.

771
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,460
So and then it broke.

772
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,420
So life. Well, I have one of my roommates is kind of a of a shut in.

773
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,980
And he he's a pretty nice guy.

774
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,100
But let me let me tell you two things that stick out to me about him.

775
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,060
One, if he gets even a little drunk, he starts to become like more open and more fun.

776
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,340
Yeah, like he starts to become like kind of a more outgoing guy.

777
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,300
But he also at the same time and in the same stroke,

778
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,180
starts to get nervous about the fact that he's drunk and it makes him worried

779
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,900
and he retreats to his room.

780
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,580
So as soon as he starts to get fun and loosen up, he's like, oh, no,

781
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,820
I'm loosening up and then he runs away.

782
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,020
The other thing the other thing is that like he goes out to eat a bunch,

783
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,820
but he has very specific things.

784
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,500
He won't he won't go to the same place twice.

785
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Ever if well, like in too close proximity.

786
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,260
Like one time he went he went to this rest.

787
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,740
He went to stop and he doesn't want them to learn who he is essentially.

788
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,900
It's it. No, it's like it's well, sort of.

789
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,980
He went to Whole Foods and he bought a bunch of stuff and he came back

790
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,500
and then he was like, oh, man, I forgot the flour or something.

791
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,740
And I was like, you know what, I used to be like this too.

792
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,300
I would never go. I don't I didn't want I still am a little bit.

793
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,740
Like I feel like it's weird if I go somewhere that you wouldn't

794
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,260
ordinarily go twice in a row.

795
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,380
Yeah, and I'm like, well, if you need it, you know, you're going to go get it.

796
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,060
And he's like, no, I can't go back.

797
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,540
I was there earlier today.

798
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,540
Oh, man, you know, I can't know that I was there twice.

799
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,820
That's really like who fucking cares?

800
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,180
This really touches on something for me that I think is maybe

801
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
like a root cause of this whole issue.

802
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,940
Like having a life living and doing things with purpose,

803
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,460
like with a goal, with a mission makes like all these weird

804
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,420
like depression and like self-conference issues.

805
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,700
They all kind of just fly out the window.

806
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,820
I like have to do something like like example.

807
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,860
If like, I had probably needed that flour for something important.

808
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,700
Why would he care about what?

809
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,300
First of all, why would anyone care ever about what the employees

810
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,260
that Whole Foods think about? I'm like, oh, what a weirdo.

811
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,100
Well, that's a whole logic, you know.

812
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,500
Yeah, it's an emotional thing.

813
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,540
But yeah, but if there's something you actually need,

814
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,380
if there's an actual good reason that really would compel you to get that flour,

815
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,140
you would go back, you wouldn't care.

816
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,180
Some people rationalize, you know, whatever for whatever fear they have.

817
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,020
They'll say, well, I guess I didn't really need it.

818
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,100
You know, I can go. You know what? The weirdest thing.

819
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,620
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But if you really did, you would get it.

820
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,700
Right. Yeah, totally, totally.

821
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,500
Which is the same thing that made it. God damn it.

822
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,940
OK, go on, go on, go on.

823
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,340
The weirdest thing about my like brand of paranoia when it comes to that kind

824
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,020
of stuff, Ben, is that like I always say, like, I don't care what anybody

825
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,420
thinks about me, right? And like, yeah, it's weird because my sense of self

826
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,820
image is like, I'll dress however I want.

827
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,980
I'll look like a weirdo.

828
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,740
I don't like I'm not bothered that people think I look weird.

829
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,220
And yet when I'm out in public, I constantly am thinking about what

830
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,980
do people think I look like?

831
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Like, yeah, yeah, I'm so fixated on myself and like because if I go out

832
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,380
in like any kind of My Little Pony attire with the beard I have,

833
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,900
I always think I look like a pedophile and you're right everywhere I go.

834
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,340
I'm like, does everyone think I'm a weird fucking pedophile?

835
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,500
Does everyone here think I'm like some kind of rapist?

836
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,180
Like when in reality, they're probably thinking nothing about me.

837
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,100
They don't have any opinion, you know?

838
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,980
Yeah, I got I got catcalled the other day.

839
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,380
No way by a pat by a driving bro.

840
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,940
Well, because I was dressed like a fucking clown, right?

841
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,740
I was wearing I was wearing like two different bright plaids,

842
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,220
like a bright plaid orange.

843
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,740
That's how I dress normally.

844
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,500
A button down shirt and a bright like starburst colors, like plaid long shorts.

845
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,580
I looked like it like, oh, we've also with long black socks.

846
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,820
So I looked like I was wearing stockings because the shorts.

847
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,660
Dude, you were rocking the you were rocking the cluster punk aesthetic.

848
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,140
I guess so.

849
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,820
Dude, I took it.

850
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,420
I took a picture of me with a giant with a giant scale model of Bender

851
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,820
from Futurama that we found in the trash the other day.

852
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,180
It lives in our house now.

853
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,260
Yeah, we have Bender. Bender lives in our house now.

854
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,780
He's great. That's awesome.

855
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
Yeah, it is.

856
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,220
I'll post a picture on Twitter sometime.

857
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,380
But anyway, the point is some guy slowed down, passing me in my stupid clown outfit

858
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,580
and he yelled out the window that outfit is on point, brother.

859
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,820
And I was like, that's cool.

860
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,340
And I just I gave him a salute.

861
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,980
I just gave him like a thumbs up because like I could have taken it like,

862
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,180
oh, I feel bad that this guy made fun of me.

863
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,380
But like, yeah, I don't know.

864
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,420
We'll see. He's just saying hi.

865
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,660
I hear what you're saying, Ben.

866
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,740
But like if you watch and I, you know, I don't really have much experience

867
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,740
with depression, but like the NHK guy, Satato, yeah, Sato.

868
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,660
Like when he he tells the story about when he first tried to go to college

869
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,180
on like his first day, like he he didn't even have an experience like that.

870
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,980
But he just like was out walking and just like felt so much pressure

871
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,420
from everyone's stairs at him that he just like completely panicked

872
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,540
and just like even though no one was even though nothing happened.

873
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,980
Yeah, that's that's what my that's like what I related to the most back then.

874
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,700
It was like I would go out and just and I still feel this way.

875
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,580
I always feel like people are like looking at me when they're not.

876
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,020
And like, I'll actually go out somewhere and like start to feel weird.

877
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,900
And I'll look around to see if anyone's looking at me.

878
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,260
I think it's like to confirm that they're not because I wouldn't do that before.

879
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,660
Like I'd walk into Barnes and Noble and I just look straight down.

880
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,980
Like I was always one of those guys who looked down everywhere I walked, you know.

881
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,780
And so I would just like I would just look down

882
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,700
and try not to like make eye contact with anybody.

883
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,420
And I always think like, oh, I look like the fucking of course

884
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,860
I'm going to the manga aisle because I look like a fucking weirdo.

885
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,780
Like, yeah, that's exactly who you expect to see looking at the anime stuff, you know, like.

886
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,340
And then I'd get there and no one's no one cares.

887
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,140
Yeah, no one cares.

888
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,340
It gives a fuck, you know.

889
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,500
Yeah, yeah, totally.

890
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,980
And even if they did care, it doesn't matter.

891
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,140
Even today, like when I walk into Barnes and Noble,

892
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,460
like my first instinct is like, oh, God, I look weird.

893
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:19,300
But then I have to go, wait a minute, I like looking weird.

894
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,300
I've chosen to dress this way.

895
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,420
I've chosen to have this beard and I'm proud of myself.

896
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,620
That alternative lifestyle like right.

897
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,420
Then I like pick myself up and go, like, did I say,

898
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,140
did I tell you the story one time about how me and Ben were driving

899
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,020
and he told me that he wanted to look alternative

900
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,100
and I've been giving him shit about it for years ever since he said that

901
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,220
because I looked like a weirdo and yeah, my rationalization for the fact

902
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,460
that I know I had like a weird haircut or something.

903
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,660
I think I like, I don't know, I had a weird haircut.

904
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,660
That's the point.

905
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,260
And Nate was like, why don't you get a normal haircut?

906
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,580
And I was like, if I haven't, if I look normal,

907
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,420
if I have a normal haircut, then people will see me and think I'm a normal guy.

908
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,180
Yes, that's not me.

909
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:07,140
I want people to see me and understand that like I am like a weird guy.

910
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,940
God, that's stupid.

911
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,180
That's what you told me at the time.

912
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,180
No, I'm with you, Ben.

913
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,060
Yeah, if a girl saw me, if a girl saw me and was like this guy,

914
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,300
he looks like he works a nine to five job.

915
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,940
I don't want girls that like guys with nine to five jobs to see me

916
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,500
and be like, I mean, I want girl.

917
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,860
I want girls who want a fucking loser weirdo.

918
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,020
That's exactly why I have that kind of girl to see me and be like,

919
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,060
now there's a guy.

920
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,940
Yeah, yeah.

921
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,620
I often think about like, hey, if I'm ever going to get into the dating scene,

922
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,900
I got to clean myself up.

923
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,860
But then I think about it and I'm like, well, if I clean myself up,

924
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,900
no, I'm just going to be selling a false product.

925
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,660
Like, you need to present what you actually are so that the girls

926
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,060
that actually like that can recognize it and be like,

927
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,780
exactly, yeah, like those girls might be harder to come by,

928
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,380
but they're the only ones who are worth having.

929
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,900
Yeah, there's no otherwise you're just going to the veils

930
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,340
going to come off pretty quick.

931
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,020
There's no point attracting a girl who's looking for something

932
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,140
other than what you are.

933
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,460
Well, there's a lot of girls out there who don't know what they want.

934
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,700
You know, that's true.

935
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,460
I guess so. Just saying.

936
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,820
But whatever. You see my point. I hear your point.

937
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,860
I do. I do.

938
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,300
I just think it's funny to say, oh, Ben's into that alternative lifestyle.

939
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,540
Well, but it's true, though, I do.

940
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,980
I don't lead a normal life.

941
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,020
I don't have a job. I'm a fucking artist.

942
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,860
All right, Ben, you've got to get in on the cluster punk aesthetic.

943
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,580
Here's how you become a cluster punk.

944
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,460
Yeah, tell me.

945
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,540
Every everything you wear has to be either pajamas or plaid.

946
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,860
Well, I am wearing all plaid, but

947
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,100
and or or an anime shirt or some kind of like video.

948
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,420
I've heard that I've heard that.

949
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,740
I've heard that what's in this year is Pail Wave.

950
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,100
What the fuck is that?

951
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,860
It's just like you wear like pastel T-shirts, just pastel colors.

952
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,580
Pail Wave is the movement, is the fashion movement.

953
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,220
I haven't heard that word for it.

954
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,140
But yeah, no, man, I'm all about like, because all I wear is pajamas,

955
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,180
either pajama pants or pajama shorts.

956
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,300
And then if you want to go full cluster punk,

957
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,060
which I do not have the balls to rock this in public anymore.

958
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,260
I have done it before.

959
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,340
But it's to put your plaid shorts over your pajama pants.

960
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,580
Oh, my God.

961
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,500
And the reason for this technique is that

962
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,260
the reason for this technique is

963
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,020
a lot of pajama pants don't have pockets.

964
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,060
Kids do not buy this at all.

965
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,300
If you want to have if you want to wear your pajama pants that don't have pockets,

966
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,780
but you want to have pockets,

967
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,580
they just put on a pair of shorts over your pajamas and they have pockets.

968
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,420
Why would you eat?

969
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,820
Why even wear the pajamas?

970
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,060
Why not just wear shorts?

971
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,180
Because it's maybe it's cold outside and.

972
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,020
Yeah, you don't want to wear pants.

973
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,260
Yeah, OK.

974
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,860
I mean, like I said, this is something that I mean,

975
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,740
there's enough ways to not do this that I would rather just change my pants

976
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,140
so that people don't fucking laugh at me openly in public.

977
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,660
But maybe don't be a scrub and get some pajama pants with dude.

978
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,820
But at the same time, if I wanted to go full cluster punk, this is what I would do.

979
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,700
I mean, because when you think about it,

980
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,460
because that's what punk is all about is looking like an absolute freak in public

981
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,580
and embracing the fact that people are staring at your crazy gauges

982
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,180
and giant spiky hair.

983
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,220
Yeah, yeah.

984
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,020
So if I if you really, to me, the moment it goes from just cluster fuck

985
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,260
to cluster punk is when you decide to go all out

986
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,060
and wear the the the shorts over the pajama pants.

987
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,860
That's when you've got cluster punk.

988
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,620
I kind of like it.

989
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,700
I like it, too.

990
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,420
Because that is, you know, that's that alternative lifestyle

991
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,820
that I'm always seeing that I'm always famous for quest questing after.

992
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,740
Back.

993
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,380
And no, but I think a lot of this relates to the peacocking of of pickup.

994
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,860
I was I was, you know, yeah, I was I was a lot better than blending in

995
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,700
if you're trying to get people's attention.

996
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,340
Yeah, standing out is better than blending in, just like you got it.

997
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,100
You got to you got to be noticeable.

998
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,700
The thing that the OK,

999
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,420
what you were saying before about feeling like people are staring at you,

1000
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,900
even when they're not, I get that.

1001
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,380
I felt that way before.

1002
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,900
So in secure.

1003
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,300
Yeah, I don't I don't really feel it so much anymore.

1004
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,700
Now, the worst thing about going out and leaving the house is is girls.

1005
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,620
I hate seeing them when they don't love me.

1006
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,100
You know what? I'm completely with you, Ben.

1007
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,740
If I see you, if I see a cute girl and I'm like, I see a cute girl

1008
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,180
and I'm like, you idiot, you stupid idiot.

1009
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,140
You've never.

1010
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,260
How do you not recognize that I am the coolest?

1011
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,220
Oh, yeah. No, you never know.

1012
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,940
We've never said two words together, but that's your fault.

1013
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,020
Whenever I see a cute girl out,

1014
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,660
it's always when I become extremely self-conscious about everything

1015
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,140
I'm wearing and what I look like.

1016
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,220
That's when I'm like, yeah, because all I can think is,

1017
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,140
like in this exact moment, if I looked right,

1018
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,660
then I'd be able to talk to her and it would seem normal.

1019
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,860
But at this moment, if I talk to her, I will look like a rapist.

1020
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,220
So I don't want like it.

1021
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,020
It's never a problem until I see the cute girl.

1022
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,220
And I'm this is the exact emotion.

1023
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,300
It's God damn it.

1024
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,100
Like that's exactly how I feel, like the snap of the shit.

1025
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,500
If I knew she was going to be here today, I would have dressed in pants.

1026
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,660
You know, the thing about talking to girls in public

1027
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,820
is you always look like a rapist.

1028
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,340
You can't you can't not look like a rapist.

1029
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,820
You just got to accept I'm going to go and talk to this girl

1030
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,820
and look like a rapist.

1031
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,620
And that's just part and parcel of the of the fucking thing.

1032
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,700
I don't know. Somebody's doing the raping.

1033
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,340
I, you know, I agree with you guys on both those.

1034
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,700
I have, man, I I I hate talking about these things.

1035
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,060
It makes me look not cool.

1036
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,100
But yeah, these are these are real issues I have.

1037
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,220
You know, but like, but there's no but there's no right.

1038
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,700
I love that you're still concerned about looking.

1039
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,380
I'm always concerned about.

1040
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,980
Well, Nate is the only one that has

1041
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,540
guys, let's make a podcast about not leaving your room.

1042
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,780
His idea and he's concerned about looking cool

1043
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,580
in the Hiccomery podcast, you can you can spin.

1044
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,460
You can spin almost anything to sound cool if you say it the right way.

1045
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,420
But it's hard to spin deep personal insecurities to sound.

1046
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:32,420
You know, maybe, maybe deep personal insecurities are the coolest thing of all.

1047
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,900
What girls are into these days.

1048
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Yeah, you know, damaged man.

1049
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,340
Let me give you guys some more some more Hickey stuff.

1050
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,860
So when I started hanging out with that friend of mine,

1051
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,660
you know, both of us were super socially awkward,

1052
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,660
but I was a little bit less than him.

1053
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,620
Like I would I would often yeah, I would often say that, like,

1054
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:55,380
in terms of personality, I was the Yamazaki to his Sato.

1055
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,500
Like, I don't know what any of that means.

1056
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,100
If you see the NHK, Sato is the main character

1057
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,340
and he's full Hickey Comery, never leaves his house, never talks to anyone.

1058
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:08,140
Yamazaki is his neighbor who is like borderline,

1059
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,620
but he still goes to college and he's more like just angry at the world,

1060
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,620
like less completely unable to talk to people and more like

1061
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,580
has this burning hatred for everyone kind of thing, you know,

1062
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,220
because of the fact that they that he's seen as abnormal or anything.

1063
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,820
So and he's the one who in the end is able to totally turn his life around

1064
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,940
as soon as he figures out what he's trying to do.

1065
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,940
Yeah, he kind of just falls into it as it happens. Right.

1066
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:41,620
But like he like my friend, my friend who

1067
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,820
who is the Hickey Comery, like when we started hanging out,

1068
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,140
because like I said, we I first met him because he just happened

1069
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,700
to show up to school at the Lucky Star booklet.

1070
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,260
And so I was like, holy fuck, someone else knows this is early 2007.

1071
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,780
Yeah, that wasn't even the cutting edge.

1072
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,580
A ring yet. No, it was it was done airing, but only by a couple months.

1073
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,980
So like seeing someone holding a Lucky Star book was crazy.

1074
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,020
And so I asked him for his Yahoo Messenger name.

1075
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,460
And that was the last day he ever came to school.

1076
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,220
So if I hadn't asked him for that then, then I never would have what a what a

1077
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,460
what a painful meeting that was.

1078
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,500
At some point, I started talking to him about Welcome to the NHK.

1079
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,540
And that's how we became like good friends,

1080
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,860
because we both like related to that like paranoia and everything.

1081
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,460
You know, I like I was someone who completely understood

1082
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,700
like all the stuff he was going through that to anyone else would have seemed

1083
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,420
insane to me was like, yeah, man, I'm an otaku.

1084
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,260
I know all this stuff because I've also watched Welcome to the NHK and Genshiken

1085
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,620
and like I relate to these things, you know, so we sort of bonded over that stuff.

1086
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,980
And then like I would come over to his house and then like at some point,

1087
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,340
you know, we started hanging out.

1088
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,060
So we would go out to like to go get food and stuff.

1089
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,340
We'd like go to Taco Bell.

1090
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,140
He could not order food.

1091
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,660
Like he could not.

1092
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,580
Yeah, a lot of people seem to have that problem.

1093
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,220
Yeah, I've been talking to a couple of people who say they have that issue.

1094
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,500
I don't.

1095
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,420
Growing up, I had I had an issue with ordering food

1096
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,660
not so much in the way that like it was a paranoia over talking to the people.

1097
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,140
But because I was used to my parents doing it and it felt like anything

1098
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,740
that like my parents had routinely done in front of me felt kind of more like

1099
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,700
official or something like something that's off limits for kids.

1100
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,700
You have to like be trained or something or that shit. Exactly.

1101
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,380
I do feel stupid when I order food,

1102
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,620
but not like an anxiety.

1103
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,300
I love ordering food now.

1104
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,100
I'm the best food order in the world now.

1105
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:41,380
I love it because I am so good at talking because like I have a very clear voice

1106
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,940
and I can communicate well with people and I can make sure because I have friends

1107
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,060
who will get like really frustrated when someone gets their order wrong.

1108
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,620
Like this this friend we're talking about like at the time,

1109
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,300
he couldn't even order food like he wouldn't he wouldn't talk to the people.

1110
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,860
He would have me do it for him.

1111
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,420
So I would go up and like order both of our orders and bring it out to him and stuff.

1112
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,220
And then over time he, you know, learned how to talk to people.

1113
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,020
Now he's like pretty normal.

1114
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,260
Like he has a job now.

1115
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:09,060
He's living living a normal guy's life, you know, cured of all the things he had before.

1116
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,980
So he's got lots of responsibilities and shit.

1117
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,460
But he's still when he goes out to order food

1118
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,620
and now he has a loud, clear voice because he trained himself to have one.

1119
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,940
He's a big guy, so he can project really easily, you know,

1120
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,180
he'll go out to order food.

1121
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,860
But if they like seem confused, he'll just leave.

1122
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,460
Like if it seems like they can't figure out what exactly he wants,

1123
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,940
he'll be like, you know what, forget it and he'll leave

1124
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,700
because he can't deal with like misunderstandings and stuff.

1125
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,740
Whereas I will sit there and I'll sit there and like go through everything.

1126
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,940
I'll be like, no, it's one quesadilla with beans, no rice.

1127
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,140
You know, and I love doing it.

1128
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,140
Like it's fun and hilarious.

1129
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,380
So, yeah, like.

1130
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,100
But so, yeah, for a while, like it was funny

1131
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,780
because it actually helped me in a way because I would have to speak for him.

1132
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,900
So, like, you know, I had to be more social

1133
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:09,420
to compensate for his complete lack of ability to be social, you know, like I had

1134
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,020
to start learning how to take orders or to give orders at places

1135
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,500
for him because no one was going to do it for me

1136
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,100
because he's clearly not going to, you know.

1137
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,900
So we kind of had like a symbiotic relationship

1138
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,060
where I started getting a little more out of my shell because of him

1139
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,540
and then him because of me.

1140
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,020
And I, you know, through hanging out with me, he became friends with all my friends

1141
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,660
and eventually learned like to, you know, like people and talk to them.

1142
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,780
That's good.

1143
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,780
Yeah.

1144
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,900
So, yeah, that's how we got out of.

1145
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,500
But that has not stopped the fact that I still spend most of my time in my room.

1146
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,820
Yeah.

1147
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,540
I want. Here's what I want.

1148
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,900
I want my room to be cold, dark, dry.

1149
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,580
I want it to just become a tomb.

1150
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,860
I just want to live.

1151
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,700
I just want to become a living corpse.

1152
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,580
I want to be a list.

1153
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,740
I thought you were going to say a list. OK.

1154
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,260
I want to be a little more than anything else.

1155
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,180
That's that's the fantasy creature I'd most I'd most like to be.

1156
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:17,180
And I just want to live in like a fucking stone, cold Steve Austin.

1157
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,580
Steve Austin.

1158
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:24,140
Yes. And I just want to be fucking frozen in time forever in my room.

1159
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,380
You mean you so basically what you're saying is you want to be able to do your

1160
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,700
art stuff and not have to worry about the other bullshit.

1161
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,420
I have a terrible.

1162
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,300
I mean, I'm sure everyone can relate to this.

1163
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,660
I have a terrible fear of the passage of time and the inevitable end of all things.

1164
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,100
And what I would like more than anything else is just to freeze time forever.

1165
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,500
For you guys, do you ever, for me, like part of my logic behind not going outside

1166
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,420
much is fewer chances to die?

1167
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,820
There's like because when I leave the house, all I can think about is like

1168
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,820
like in my room right now, like the number of things that could kill me is

1169
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,220
like I could choke on a few things.

1170
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,620
I could trip on a few things.

1171
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,780
And if you're maybe your entire house collapsed, you might.

1172
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,940
Yeah. Yeah.

1173
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,220
Or something some freak accident happened.

1174
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,500
But like if you're just out driving, there's like hundreds of

1175
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,100
way you use ways you could die every second.

1176
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,460
You know, like all like all I think about when I'm out is like

1177
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,500
or even when I'm at a place, I'm just like, what if this place gets shot up?

1178
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,020
Or what if what if I'm walking in the middle of an area where a gang

1179
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,340
fights about I don't I don't live in the nicest place personally right now.

1180
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,820
Yeah. I'm I'm when I'm on the bus, I'm always picturing

1181
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,340
like which one of these guys is going to be the or girl is going to pull out

1182
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,460
the gun and just start just start blasting fools.

1183
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,060
I had who is it going to be?

1184
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,300
It's definitely someone.

1185
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,820
This is the time.

1186
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,100
The guns are everywhere.

1187
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,740
There was a time in like my late teens where I happened.

1188
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:56,900
It's like I was first getting introduced to like grimdark concepts,

1189
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,900
like like or like realizing like how dark the world is.

1190
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,980
Because I'd never grown up on like dark media.

1191
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,180
And I saw like the ending of American History X.

1192
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,300
And then I saw all of Boys in the Hood and after seeing Boys in the Hood,

1193
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,780
I had this like long time fear that the way I'm going to die

1194
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,620
is that I'm just going to get caught up in a gang shooting.

1195
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:19,940
And I knew someone online who like had lost a brother that way

1196
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,220
were like her brother walking down the road and like he was passing by a house

1197
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:28,300
and the people on the porch and in this car that was like going to do

1198
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,340
a drive by on the people on the porch.

1199
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,860
He just happened to be in that spot when it happened.

1200
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,300
So like a gang fight broke out around him and he got caught in the crossfire

1201
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,340
and died. And I was like, this is how I'm going to go.

1202
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,900
That's gay as hell.

1203
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,060
Yeah, but I always thought it would happen at age 44.

1204
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,060
I don't know why. We'll see.

1205
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,620
I was like, I really thought I'm going to end up dying at age 44

1206
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,700
in a gang in a game shoot out 20 years ago.

1207
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:58,420
Even aside from the issue of death, I'm I'm very concerned.

1208
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,700
Like, all right, in my in like the timeline of my life, I am very I really,

1209
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,300
really want to never be maimed or mangled.

1210
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,140
I really want to get to the end of my life without any kind of like

1211
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,260
like any like limbs being severed or anything like that.

1212
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,020
I know. Weird, right?

1213
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,380
What a weird desire to have.

1214
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,300
So, yeah, I'm like, I'm like, I got to say it.

1215
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,460
I got my alternative lifestyle.

1216
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:29,700
I got to stay home.

1217
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:33,500
I got to not go anywhere because I would because that's the

1218
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,780
safest way, you know, that's how I can make sure as much as possible

1219
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,260
that I'll never suffer any catastrophic injuries

1220
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,380
because they would hurt really bad, right?

1221
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,260
They catastrophic even worse than the pain is the like, God,

1222
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,860
imagine if your if your drawing hand got blown off or something, you know,

1223
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,340
like, that's it. You're done.

1224
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,860
Oh, my God, I would be done.

1225
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:57,580
If I do often think about like the gamble of like which body parts am I

1226
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,940
like if I had to lose anything, take a leg, take a leg, man.

1227
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,900
Probably make it without the legs.

1228
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,540
The hands would be a huge problem.

1229
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:11,220
The eyes would be eyes or ears would be just complete done.

1230
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,380
You know, if I lose my eyes, anime is out.

1231
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,580
Yeah, exactly. Oh, my God.

1232
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,980
But here's what I also do.

1233
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,740
I also think a lot about like if I lose these specific parts,

1234
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:27,740
what am I going to because if I lose my eyesight, I'm going directly for music.

1235
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,540
Well, I'm going to learn.

1236
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,980
Yeah. First, I'll cover music.

1237
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,860
I'm going to learn Japanese, like how to like hear it pretty quick.

1238
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,300
And then I can listen to like drama CDs and stuff.

1239
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,420
Oh, my God.

1240
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:40,380
Whole Avenue.

1241
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,460
Like audio dramas and stuff.

1242
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,100
Yeah. And anime tie ins.

1243
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,100
Holy shit. Yeah.

1244
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,220
I'll become a huge audio drama, audio book guy, like analyze those.

1245
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,580
But the biggest problem is just that I have to have someone like hit,

1246
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,060
record and upload for.

1247
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,860
Yeah, you need people.

1248
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,140
I would have to have someone to to do that stuff.

1249
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,420
But that's what I would do.

1250
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,460
I would become like an audio only guy.

1251
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,700
Or if I lost my hearing, I would become like a manga guy.

1252
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,700
Probably. Yeah, that's the smart move.

1253
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,980
Yeah. Yeah.

1254
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,260
All right. You've got all these contingencies planned out.

1255
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,460
Oh, yeah, man. I think you hear that.

1256
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:21,260
You hear that haters, even if even if you destroy Digi's eyes and ears,

1257
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,380
he'll still he'll keep on doing it.

1258
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,620
He'll never stop.

1259
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,820
I dare you to do it.

1260
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,820
I dare you to do it.

1261
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,300
I'll see if it stops him.

1262
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,060
You know, this whole time, I haven't really said it up till now.

1263
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,620
I've been been waiting for a moment to interject that I'm definitely like the least

1264
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:45,820
by far, Hiki of anybody in the in the procrastinators group,

1265
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,220
except maybe like Tom, because he's got a job now, too,

1266
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,220
because I have a wage slave job that I work every week, nine to five.

1267
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,860
And but but I very much feel, nonetheless,

1268
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,660
like like like Hiki, because despite doing that,

1269
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,780
I have no connection to anything I'm doing there.

1270
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,500
And I'm only really good.

1271
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,140
It's not like I'm uncomfortable at work,

1272
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,500
but I want to say I'm only really comfortable when I'm at home.

1273
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,380
That's when I feel like I get to be myself and I'm doing the things I want to do.

1274
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,940
Typically leave the house at all.

1275
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,220
No, not at all.

1276
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,020
So there you go. You know, there's how often do you leave the house?

1277
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:25,060
Oh, less than once a week, I think.

1278
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,140
Oh, my God, like at all to get groceries or something.

1279
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,820
Yeah, like at all.

1280
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,780
Holy shit. There you go.

1281
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,940
See, the funny thing about this is that I leave the house several times a day

1282
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,300
exclusively to eat. No, I never do that.

1283
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,700
Well, I'm a huge foodie.

1284
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:45,020
So like I can't stand like just today I went out before we started this show.

1285
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,660
I went out and drove all the way to a faux restaurant

1286
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,700
and I got take out faux just because I wanted to try.

1287
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,420
I wanted to understand what take out faux was like.

1288
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,860
It's weird, incidentally.

1289
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,460
I believe you.

1290
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,940
I am thinking about leaving the house later today

1291
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,580
because I'm all out of diet soda.

1292
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:06,220
I haven't had any diet soda in like two days and it's making me very irritable.

1293
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,300
There you go.

1294
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,740
Yeah, I mean, that's another thing because I all I drink is diet green tea,

1295
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,860
which I get from Wawa and I only buy like two or three bottles at a time.

1296
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,540
So like every other day, I am guaranteed to go to Wawa to get tea.

1297
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,580
And then, you know, while I'm there, I might get something to eat.

1298
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,020
Like this weekend, I've just or I haven't left the house

1299
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,620
because I just ordered food from Grubhub, you know, instead of doing anything else.

1300
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:30,900
That's what I do.

1301
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,260
You know, uncharacteristically, I did actually two days ago,

1302
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,140
I went to the Cirque du Soleil.

1303
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,380
Whoa, no way.

1304
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,100
Yeah, which is not something normal, but just as it so happens,

1305
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,540
we've got a temporary roommate subletting a room

1306
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:47,420
and she is a roadie with the Cirque du Soleil and she got us all tickets to a show.

1307
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,140
Yeah, I like I didn't want to go.

1308
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,940
I didn't think I was going to enjoy it.

1309
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:55,020
My housemates like banged on the door and they dragged me out of bed.

1310
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,900
They made me come because they had four tickets and they weren't going to waste one.

1311
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,700
Yeah, OK.

1312
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,260
And I went.

1313
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,300
How was it?

1314
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:00,940
It was great.

1315
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,060
I bet it was.

1316
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,340
It was awesome.

1317
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:03,980
That's awesome.

1318
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:09,580
Yeah. And I realized on the ride home, oh, man, there was a.

1319
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:14,060
I like now I want to do like hearing Ben just say outright.

1320
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,180
It was great.

1321
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,940
Like, yeah, Ben makes me like how I want to see Cirque du Soleil.

1322
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:22,780
No, I thought I would be sitting there like, oh, this is dumb.

1323
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,580
This is terrible.

1324
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,620
Why am I wasting my time?

1325
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,420
But no, they're like, I mean, not every act was a brilliant,

1326
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,420
but like a bunch of them were really good.

1327
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,940
You know, we've been talking a lot of shit.

1328
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,980
He didn't look like a clown.

1329
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,980
He was just a guy in a purple bowler hat.

1330
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,180
But you could tell I could tell that what he was doing was clowning.

1331
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:41,580
I think that guy may have gone to clown college because he had like he gave the air

1332
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:45,100
of like having like an air of professionalism about his clowning that I yeah.

1333
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,220
And that the fact that I could tell that he was a clown,

1334
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,980
despite the fact that he wasn't dressed like one.

1335
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,020
That's oh man.

1336
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,220
It's very impressive.

1337
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,980
And and also on the ride home, I realized this is important.

1338
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,980
I realized that the Cirque du Soleil, the Carnival of the Sun,

1339
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,300
must be the the mortal enemy of the Dark Carnival.

1340
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:08,460
Whoa.

1341
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,740
That's so true.

1342
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,100
Oh, I think that Jesse isn't there.

1343
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,900
Jesse be fighting truth and dare.

1344
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,580
I wonder if that's why they named it that.

1345
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,660
I wonder if that's why it's called the Dark Carnival.

1346
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,380
I doubt it.

1347
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,020
Maybe.

1348
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:17,340
I don't know.

1349
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,980
Yeah, you know, the final battle, the apocalypse comes.

1350
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,500
Jesus and Satan, a Cirque du Soleil versus the Dark Carnival.

1351
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:25,580
Yeah.

1352
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:25,740
Yeah.

1353
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,940
That's one of the many facts.

1354
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,940
You know, we've been talking a lot of shit about like going out and how we we always

1355
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,500
stay home and stuff.

1356
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,900
But but you know, it's a lot of it is kind of in our little bubble.

1357
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,540
We we kind of miss cool things that are going on outside because our focus is elsewhere.

1358
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,900
I didn't hear about Brexit until it was happening.

1359
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,260
Well, no, you know, there's some cool stuff going on out in the real world.

1360
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:51,180
You know, I learned about Brexit all the way through because I watch a lot of YouTube videos

1361
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,300
and sit on Twitter all day.

1362
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,900
So I knew everything about Brexit.

1363
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,260
But and I listen to the news.

1364
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,420
Here's the here's the thing, though.

1365
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:03,020
Like, yeah, I hate the NPR the radio every on my way into work NPR the radio every day.

1366
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:03,420
It's great.

1367
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,780
Yeah, I do kind of like NPR.

1368
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:12,860
Like when I was like a teenager and like in my early adulthood, I like really had this

1369
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:17,020
mindset like once I get money, I'm going to go out all the time.

1370
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:21,740
Like I'm going to do all the fun stuff, you know, especially if my big part of why this

1371
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,860
never happened is because my friends never ended up having a lot of money, you know,

1372
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,700
but like I have enough money right now.

1373
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,740
I could do anything.

1374
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:29,660
I could go any day of the week.

1375
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,540
I have the time.

1376
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,340
I have the money.

1377
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,620
I could just go somewhere.

1378
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:38,380
And what I eventually realized is that I don't like any of the stuff you can go do.

1379
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,500
What about music shows?

1380
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,220
You like shows?

1381
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:43,180
There's not no cool bands come here.

1382
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:47,260
Like because I've done a lot of the stuff that like you just go to go.

1383
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:47,580
Right.

1384
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:51,340
Like I've done a lot of the like random events because for a little while,

1385
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:56,860
like early last year, you guys might have heard this because you both listened to some episodes

1386
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:57,820
of Digi Bros.

1387
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,020
When Victor was working for this company called Yaloha,

1388
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:06,940
where it was like they would send him to random events around like the area and like just have

1389
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,700
him take little films and like make little two minute videos out of it.

1390
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:16,220
And they would just they pay him like, uh, like what was it like 25 bucks a video because

1391
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,500
it usually took him like an hour.

1392
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,860
He would just like drive out their stuff for an hour and come back and send them the videos.

1393
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:27,980
But like I went to a couple of those with him and it's like on the one hand,

1394
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:33,580
it was really fascinating to realize that there's like always an event happening around here.

1395
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,620
But all of those events are fucking stupid.

1396
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,340
Yeah.

1397
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:41,820
It would be like, all right, there's a little music festival happening in like what like a lot in,

1398
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,180
in Norfolk, right?

1399
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,020
It's the city next to mine.

1400
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:48,220
There's literally like on the edge of a neighborhood,

1401
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:53,900
there's just a spot where there isn't a house and they just like put a little like fence around it

1402
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,780
and set up a stage and had like a little music festival there.

1403
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,620
And it was that, that little lot.

1404
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:05,740
And then the restaurant across the street and like the inside one was like metal and the outside one was like jazz.

1405
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:11,980
And it was like, it was fascinating to know it was happening, but none of the bands were that good.

1406
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,700
And, you know, it was hot outside.

1407
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,020
It was a bunch of fucking hippies out on the lawn.

1408
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,540
No one's doing anything.

1409
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,340
You go inside and it's like, I don't want to pay for beer and tacos and I don't give a fuck.

1410
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:28,140
Like it was cool to know it was there, but I would never go again because I didn't get as much out of it

1411
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,740
as I would have got out of sitting at home watching anime for an hour.

1412
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,660
You know, dude, I totally hear you on that.

1413
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:42,620
And, you know, my life right now is kind of lonely because I really only do things by myself or online with you guys.

1414
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:49,580
Like I would really love to have in my life a physical thing I can do with the people that I like.

1415
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:55,980
And that's why the, you know, Horseshoe House, the Announce HQ is such a great dream for me personally because

1416
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:03,180
being around people I like, just being physically around people, I think is a healthy thing that I don't do it all right now.

1417
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:03,740
Yeah.

1418
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,780
And that would be a life upgrade, as Christian would say.

1419
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,780
There have definitely been times where like having my friends around is cool because like, you know,

1420
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,820
when there is something that we all want to do, then we could do it.

1421
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:23,100
But like, these days, most of my friends are either working all the time or they have no money or they're just fucking lazy and shitty and don't want to do anything.

1422
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,780
So like, but I mean, my dad is a total outdoorsman, right?

1423
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:33,180
And him and Victor will have periods where like, my dad goes on like 20 mile bike rides like every day, right?

1424
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,700
And he'll be like, Vic, let's go for a bike ride and they'll go do that.

1425
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:42,620
Or he'll, there was a while where he got into like paddle boarding and like every weekend he'd be like, let's go paddle boarding and they'd go do that.

1426
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:48,380
And I'm just like, none of that in like, I don't want to do that because all I'm going to do, I know what's going to happen.

1427
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:56,860
I'm going to go out or there was one time we went canoeing and kayaking with like my, like all our friends, like my dad took everybody out.

1428
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,140
We all went canoeing, right?

1429
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:06,300
And it's like we rode out into the middle of this lake and then we hung out there for a little bit and we rode back.

1430
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,860
It took a couple hours and it was like, it was kind of fun and it's cool to have that memory.

1431
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,860
And it was cool because all my friends were there.

1432
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:20,220
But the end result was that I was in pain for days because not only did I get sunburned everywhere,

1433
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:24,780
but like it was way more intense of a workout than like I was ready to handle, you know?

1434
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,700
So like there was like days of lost productivity.

1435
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,740
And I mean that one I would do again because it was everyone.

1436
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:36,620
But like the idea of going out to do that every weekend is not at all appealing.

1437
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,860
It was special because it was special, you know?

1438
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,260
Right, it was a one-time thing and that made it cool.

1439
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,100
But like that's the thing.

1440
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:51,420
I feel like the only way to, like I think there's a mental image I had as a kid,

1441
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:55,100
that there was all this stuff going on that was interesting or places to go.

1442
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,980
Like you got like a, like I live right, less than 45 minutes drive from Bush Gardens,

1443
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:03,980
which is one of the biggest and best theme parks in the country, right?

1444
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,980
Phenomenal theme park.

1445
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,100
I hate roller coasters.

1446
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,540
I hate walking around.

1447
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,060
I hate overpriced food, you know, like going there.

1448
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:17,180
Like as a kid, it sounds, because it's such a big unique thing you can go do,

1449
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,540
it sounds like a great time.

1450
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,340
And there was a, there was a period when I was like 20 where I was like,

1451
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:25,820
what if all of us, me and all my friends, what if we all got season passes to Bush Gardens

1452
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,820
and we could just hang out there all the time?

1453
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,420
Because like as a kid, you're like, I only get to go here once a year.

1454
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,460
I'm going to ride all the biggest rides and make sure I do all that stuff.

1455
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,260
But there's tons of like just hanging out stuff to do there.

1456
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,540
So I was like, what if we all had season passes and we just hung out here all the time?

1457
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,100
And then it was like, none of us really want to do that.

1458
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,660
It's like a 45 minute drive and what are we going to do?

1459
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,980
Eat some wiener schnitzel and we'll get bored, you know?

1460
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,260
It's just, there's so many things that sound cool.

1461
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,340
But if you do them more than like once a year, then it quickly loses its luster.

1462
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,220
You know, dude, society has changed.

1463
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,980
We're at a point where we have tons of stuff that you can do,

1464
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,540
you can do whatever you want with your life for the most part.

1465
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,140
If you're a lucky person, you're born in a good family, you have a good job, whatever.

1466
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:14,460
So things like interpersonal relationships, they take energy.

1467
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,100
They take effort and you need to work on them with the people that are in your life.

1468
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,060
If you want to keep that healthy, which is an important thing about being a human

1469
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:25,100
and having a good human life, which I want to do before I die.

1470
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,980
Which is why I think something like setting yourself up in a situation

1471
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:33,580
where you're kind of forced to do the things that you want to do,

1472
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:38,300
but don't necessarily always make the time for is kind of a healthy thing.

1473
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,780
So like setting up your business scenario, like what I hope to do with us guys,

1474
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:47,740
similar to like the red letter media guys, they have just the perfect situation in my mind.

1475
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,940
Like they're all friends.

1476
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:52,220
They work together on these like funny creative videos.

1477
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,260
They're, you know, they're successful on YouTube.

1478
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,340
They're filmmakers as they want it to be.

1479
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,460
They just released their first actual movie not too long ago.

1480
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,980
Everything about that set up.

1481
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,980
Side note, I bet it sucks, but go on.

1482
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,180
I want to say, I haven't seen it yet.

1483
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:05,340
I'd like to see it.

1484
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,140
That wasn't their first movie.

1485
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,260
They've made a few movies.

1486
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,300
But they have been working on Space Cop for like 12 years.

1487
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:10,940
There you go.

1488
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:14,140
They made a bigger movie sort of thing and it came out.

1489
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:21,340
And it's just, you have to put energy into stuff and you're going to get things out of it.

1490
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:26,460
And these days, the way our world is set up, human relationships are definitely one of those

1491
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:30,380
things that we have to like work on, you know, and that's why it's important to structure your

1492
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,700
life in a way where you can get those things out of it.

1493
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:38,700
And currently I haven't, I haven't put in like any work into getting any of that like human

1494
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,500
relationship stuff.

1495
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,100
I don't know anyone in the city.

1496
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,020
I barely talked to my coworkers at all.

1497
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,860
And it's because, yeah.

1498
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,500
Housemates.

1499
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:52,380
Yeah, you know, my roommate Ben is sort of a friend, but we never hang out.

1500
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:55,500
And he's a pretty isolation-y guy, just like I am.

1501
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:01,420
When I moved into my current place, yeah, I moved in with a bunch of, like I said before,

1502
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,660
I live with a bunch of guys that are all pretty cool and are friends.

1503
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:08,380
And yeah, I was, like you said, being in that situation did facilitate a lot more human

1504
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,300
interaction social scenarios.

1505
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,740
And like you said, it was good for a time.

1506
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:16,380
In recent weeks, I've sort of gotten a little bit like, well, I've kind of had enough of

1507
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,340
it for a while.

1508
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:17,740
Yeah.

1509
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,140
I'm not, I don't feel much motivation for it anymore.

1510
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:23,820
If there was something kind of forcing you to mix with them, it'd be, you know, like there's

1511
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,020
there's something good about that.

1512
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:28,860
That is why I got forced to go to the Cirque du Soleil, which is, you know.

1513
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:29,420
Yeah, right?

1514
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,820
Like your life was probably better because you would do that.

1515
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:37,900
I think for me, if you're passionate about anything, it justifies all of it, right?

1516
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,660
Like I mean, I think if I was really,

1517
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:47,900
into like skating, like my mom, when she grew up, was always at the skating rink, right?

1518
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,060
Because it was a popular thing to do back then.

1519
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,580
You went out to the skating rink, everybody skates in circles for hours and you listen

1520
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:57,820
to music, you know, and we have one near our house.

1521
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:02,300
And there was a while where my mom was doing roller derby, where you know about roller

1522
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:02,780
derby, right?

1523
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,500
I was going to ask if she was into roller derby.

1524
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,620
Yeah, she got into it.

1525
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,860
I don't understand it, but I like it.

1526
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:13,820
I mean, she got into that like, this was like 10 years ago, like not as, like she was at

1527
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,340
the skating rink all the time as a kid.

1528
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:20,700
And then as an adult or as a mom, you know, she became a roller derby person until she

1529
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,500
couldn't do it anymore.

1530
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,260
Because, because she's like got injuries and she's too damn old.

1531
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,500
Shit, hardcore roller derby.

1532
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:32,460
Yeah, but she got into roller derby and you know, we go out there and like watch her

1533
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,660
matches sometimes and stuff.

1534
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,980
And like, my mom is the type who will never leave the house.

1535
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:41,820
If there's not something to do, you know, like she'll go out if there's some kind of

1536
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:45,100
social gathering or if there's some reason for her to be there.

1537
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:50,700
But if not, she will completely stay inside for weeks on end, not leaving the house, just

1538
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:55,740
playing Facebook games, you know, like when she was into roller derby, she would go out

1539
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,980
to the skating rink all the time, you know.

1540
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:02,940
And so like, she, so I think that for me, it would be the same.

1541
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,460
We're like the times when I've gotten out of the house the most is like when me and Victor

1542
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,500
were working out together.

1543
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
You know, it's like we're going to the gym every other day.

1544
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,180
So yeah, like it's, you know, it's, it's not so much that we're going out of the house

1545
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:17,660
just to get out of the house, but because there is a thing to do out of the house.

1546
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,620
Right, but when there's nothing like that, it's like, we create those things for yourself

1547
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:21,740
pretty much, you know.

1548
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:27,020
And if there's nothing like that, like for me, I have to be like passionately interested.

1549
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:32,860
And there's been like, there have been sports and like things that I, that I would be interested

1550
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:37,340
in doing that, or even just like a e-sports, like, because my friends are super into fighting

1551
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,340
games, right?

1552
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,580
And they have been for a couple of years now, like the main thing all my friends do is play

1553
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,100
street fighter and shit.

1554
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,660
And for a long time, I thought Brandon Tolentino was going to like try to go pro because he's

1555
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,460
like incredibly skilled at fighting games.

1556
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,940
But because there's not really much of a like pro culture around here and no one he can

1557
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,460
practice with who's like good enough, then it's just never happened.

1558
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,380
And he's still obsessed with fighting games.

1559
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:05,660
But like for me, it was always like, man, if all my friends got into like, like trying

1560
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:11,180
to do this professionally, then I would feel like a desire to get into it and like to leave

1561
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,620
the house and go to tournaments and stuff and like do all this shit.

1562
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:18,220
But as it stands, but ever they go to a tournament, like when they actually do, they're usually

1563
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,660
not even to compete just to watch.

1564
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,020
And I'm like, I don't want to do that.

1565
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,300
Like, I don't want to say it takes work.

1566
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,500
You know, it's about finding things that that fit into your life because, you know, it might

1567
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,340
not, it might not be true for everybody.

1568
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:35,540
But I think overall, like if you are in a situation that kind of makes you mix with more

1569
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,940
people and be more social in general, your life is generally going to be better.

1570
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,940
You know, it's going to shoot off endorphins in your brain.

1571
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,780
It's just a rewarding day.

1572
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:48,500
If I had one friend who maybe I'm just projecting because I want all these things in my life,

1573
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:54,340
you know, if we all moved in together and just one one friend of mine was like, dude,

1574
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,220
let's get really into tennis.

1575
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:03,300
I'd be like, done because like it's kind of the thing is I would never do it by myself

1576
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,060
because it's an expensive thing to do, right?

1577
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,500
You have to rent court space a lot of the time.

1578
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:11,820
You have to buy a racket, buy balls, buy it by a nice racket, buy some decent balls,

1579
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,700
buy, you know, the right shoes and stuff, not too expensive.

1580
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,060
But it's it's it's a costly hobby.

1581
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:21,220
And it's not something that I see myself like forcing just myself to do.

1582
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:24,100
Like if I was the only one who cared, it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth it.

1583
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:28,820
But if I had a friend who was like, dude, let's the two of us hang out every Saturday,

1584
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,340
practice tennis and just get really good at tennis and have fun playing it.

1585
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,180
I'd be like, yeah, dude, let's fucking do that.

1586
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:41,820
You know, but it has to be like that, you know, and I guess I missed the boat on this

1587
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,380
because like my dad is really into running and cycling and he does all kinds of races.

1588
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,860
Like he goes out every few months.

1589
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:52,300
He goes out to a race, you know, like and that's something I like that's the kind

1590
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,660
of passion I'd be looking for.

1591
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,940
I don't like running or biking that much, but if my dad had that kind of passion

1592
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:02,700
for like a sport I was interested in like tennis, then I'd be like, yeah, dad,

1593
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:06,700
let's go out every weekend and do tennis, you know, like and I feel like I've always

1594
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,820
wanted that. I've always wanted a friend with whom I could get into something

1595
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:16,460
other than my job because like as it stands, I get so obsessed with my work

1596
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,860
that I don't do anything that doesn't in some way pertain to it.

1597
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:23,460
You know, and it's like as a result, my life becomes this

1598
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,860
like living hell of just any time I don't have work that I'm doing,

1599
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:31,740
I'm thinking about the work I should be doing, you know, which is I don't

1600
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,820
I don't think it's a better use of time.

1601
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:38,500
Like I don't think you find I don't think you find ideas more often

1602
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:43,180
by thinking about them more, you know, like I don't think sitting around all day

1603
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,980
like for like there's sometimes I'll sit around an entire day just going like,

1604
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:52,460
what if I what if I did this, you know, if I did that, humans are funny things.

1605
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:55,340
We're pretty much at the point in civilization where we really need to

1606
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,020
trick our brains into doing things that make us happy.

1607
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:01,860
You know, it's like we we've reached and it is like I think a lot of the

1608
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:04,780
depression that people feel these days that is in things like, you know,

1609
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:08,700
NHK and needs and stuff comes from like all your base needs are met.

1610
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,740
But your higher level ones on the Maslow's hierarchy,

1611
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,620
like you're just not self actualizing and it kills you and you're not socializing

1612
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,180
enough and these things torment you.

1613
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,300
So we have to figure out the ways to fucking, you know,

1614
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:25,100
the only times like that's why I get I get so excited when there's actually

1615
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:30,340
like a new video game that I legitimately love enough that I'm willing to say,

1616
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,540
fuck it, I'm going to play when I played through Dark Souls 3 and like all the

1617
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:38,940
Souls games, like yeah, like with Dark Souls 3, I was prepared for months

1618
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:42,620
beforehand that I was like, I'm going to get all my work done before this game

1619
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:46,500
comes out because all I'm going to do is play this game and it was glorious.

1620
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:51,460
It was like three or four days of just sitting around playing Dark Souls 3

1621
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,100
with no other cares in the world.

1622
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,220
I did not give a fuck what it was going to eventually,

1623
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,060
like I thought I would make a video out of it.

1624
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:01,220
And then after I finished the game, I spent like a month and a half agonizing

1625
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:04,220
over whether or not I should make a video about it and I didn't end up doing it.

1626
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:08,300
Because in the end I was like, I'm just so desperate to make everything I do

1627
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,860
a part of my work that like the idea that I spent three days just enjoying

1628
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:15,180
myself is like a nightmare.

1629
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,420
And Jesse talks about that all the time himself too.

1630
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,020
He's breathed it out.

1631
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,620
And then like I felt lucky when Doom came out because like I played through Doom

1632
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,900
and I loved Doom and everyone else wrote a review of Doom.

1633
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,180
And I was like, cool, I will never have to talk about this.

1634
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,420
Like there's no possible thing I have to say about this game

1635
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,580
that 40 other people didn't say.

1636
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,420
So it was just pure, yeah, Doom.

1637
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,180
You know, that's it.

1638
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,740
It was no complication.

1639
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,940
It's always interesting to me that you have this mentality about like somebody

1640
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,460
out there has to make like the intelligent, you know, get the points

1641
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,980
across about what makes Doom or any game or anime out there, you know, good.

1642
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,420
I don't think about things that way, but it's interesting.

1643
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:56,100
Like if someone if someone else has said the thing, I'm not going to write

1644
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,700
a video that that other people have already written.

1645
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:03,740
And like I watched because like with Doom, it was like literally the day

1646
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,140
the game came out.

1647
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:08,580
There was like a 40 minute Noah Caldwell Jervais video about it.

1648
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:12,940
And then within the by the end of the week, it was like fucking.

1649
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,900
Oh, who was the second person I saw cover?

1650
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,220
I don't know.

1651
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,220
There was someone else I saw and then like a third person and I was like,

1652
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,260
these guys have already said anything I would ever want to say about Doom.

1653
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:23,820
There's nothing left for me to say.

1654
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,020
I read some more articles.

1655
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,660
Then later down the line, like Aaron's signal made a video.

1656
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,700
Super bunny hop just finally made a video.

1657
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,940
And it's like there is nothing left to say about Doom.

1658
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,700
Why would I ever cover it?

1659
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,620
But he was surprisingly critical to I was interested by that.

1660
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:41,340
His was I think he because he says in the video, he's like he said.

1661
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,700
Everyone else has talked about this game.

1662
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,300
So let's just play Doom.

1663
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,300
And I'm going through all these hallways and killing all these demons.

1664
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,620
And I'm just having so much fun with it.

1665
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:55,420
I just it's a really great game and I'm really enjoying myself.

1666
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,900
Good George impression.

1667
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:02,740
He even said on Twitter later, like people were like being like like that.

1668
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:05,180
He wasn't trying to like say it's a shitty game.

1669
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,300
He's like, the game is amazing.

1670
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,700
I just I just wanted to talk about the critical points of the game.

1671
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,020
Yeah. Yeah.

1672
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,020
Because everyone else has already talked about the game.

1673
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,180
So why would I say what they're all saying?

1674
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:19,460
Even then, the first half of this video when he was praising it was all

1675
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,580
shit I'd heard before.

1676
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:22,900
So I was like, yeah, get to the point, get to the criticism.

1677
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:26,300
I just want to hear the bad shit, you know, like I got it.

1678
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,780
But yeah, I will not.

1679
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:32,980
I if someone makes a video and I watch it and it says what I would have said,

1680
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,260
then I'm like, cool, I don't have to make the video because I can literally

1681
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:37,860
just link people this one.

1682
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:40,460
Like I could just make a video saying, hey, guys,

1683
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,340
all of my thoughts on girl in the gun right over here.

1684
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,420
Go watch best guy ever's video, you know?

1685
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1686
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,060
Which is not true.

1687
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:50,140
I still have a few that I actually want to do on that show.

1688
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:54,540
Yeah, it was never intended to be a, you know, summation of everything.

1689
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,980
Let me tell a story.

1690
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:58,700
Let me tell you a shitty story.

1691
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,140
While you do that, I'm going to go take a piss.

1692
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:00,860
I'll be right back.

1693
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:01,820
All right, fucker.

1694
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,660
I want to hear it, but I got to go.

1695
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:07,140
Like two, like a year and a half, two years ago, I was living at home

1696
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,140
with my parents and it was a nightmare.

1697
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,100
And I could not wait to get out.

1698
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:16,620
And then January of last year, I was, I got the chance to move in

1699
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:19,220
with some friends in this house and like the Boston area.

1700
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:23,820
And I was like, oh my God, I'm going to be living in like a city.

1701
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,660
There's going to be social events occurring.

1702
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,420
This house is like full of people.

1703
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,300
They host, they host parties there.

1704
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,540
They do things.

1705
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:35,900
It's going to be a great time and I'm going to meet girls and bang them.

1706
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,380
It's going to be.

1707
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:42,180
That's any time you go into an event with that expectation, it's not going to happen.

1708
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:44,060
Well, it wasn't a specific event.

1709
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:48,300
It was the idea that there would be events and that at some of, at least some

1710
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,940
of them, I would bang girls.

1711
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,860
Anyway, I was so excited.

1712
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,540
I was like, I'm turning over a new leaf.

1713
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,300
I'm going to have an active.

1714
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,060
You're going to be called a well laid.

1715
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,660
No.

1716
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,060
So I went.

1717
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,380
I moved that.

1718
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:09,180
And then in that January, I moved into this house and then there was the whole

1719
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:12,740
thing I've mentioned before with the landlord and it was all, everyone moved out.

1720
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:17,220
It was just me and like these two weirdos and there were no parties.

1721
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:22,780
And, and they were occasionally invite me to like little mini concerts or

1722
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,900
like screenings of obscure movies.

1723
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,980
And I would always go.

1724
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,860
I would be like, oh my God, a social event.

1725
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,060
I will go and meet a girl and have sex.

1726
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,860
And, and I always wanted that so bad.

1727
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:37,780
Like I wanted, I wanted that life, but like it would always be shit.

1728
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,540
It would always be, I would get there and it would be like, it would be like

1729
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:44,060
some concert and I would get to the venue and there would be someone playing

1730
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:45,860
and like this little gallery or something.

1731
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:49,540
And I would just have to stand there and nod my head, pretend to care about this

1732
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:54,100
music that I wasn't interested in, wait until the event was over, mill around

1733
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,460
and socialize with a bunch of fucks and leave.

1734
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:00,380
Or it would always be all guys or it would always be a weird crowd that would

1735
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:04,060
make me uncomfortable or it would always be, there would always be something.

1736
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,980
There would always be something that ruined it.

1737
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:09,980
I mean, sometimes the movie would be good, but the band would be okay.

1738
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,980
But the event itself would always, it was never satisfying.

1739
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:17,060
And it really, it really got to me because I was there for like six months

1740
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,460
and this was a consistent pattern.

1741
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,020
And I just got so fed up.

1742
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,820
I just got so fed up with the whole thing going out.

1743
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:26,020
It was it when I was the other place with the landlord.

1744
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:26,180
Yeah.

1745
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:26,420
Okay.

1746
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:26,740
Okay.

1747
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:34,300
And I, and I just, I just didn't, I just got burnt out on, on events and on doing things.

1748
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:40,220
I was like, wow, the whole like socializing and going to things is not as fun as I fantasized

1749
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,020
it would be back when I was stuck at home.

1750
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:47,140
You know, I always kind of thought when I started disillusioned about that, I was never

1751
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:53,580
really a big social gathering guy, but my senior year of college, I made man, my

1752
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,860
damnedest effort to, to change that.

1753
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,980
And I started doing a couple of things.

1754
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:03,620
And at the time, I thought that I wasn't really capitalizing on them enough by just

1755
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,420
like not being outgoing enough at the time.

1756
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:08,180
But I went to a lot of those.

1757
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,460
And you know, good things did happen at them sometimes.

1758
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,500
But, uh, yeah.

1759
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,620
Did you become well laid?

1760
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,900
Well, no one's well laid like Ben St.

1761
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:22,900
of Patreon, but, uh, no, there was a little, an acceptable

1762
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,980
amount of, of being laid going on.

1763
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,540
Actually, I'm really curious.

1764
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,460
I feel like Jesse's probably the most well laid out of us, right?

1765
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,580
He seems that way.

1766
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,220
No, I think, I think it's me.

1767
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,740
Yeah, I honestly think it's me.

1768
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,620
In terms of frequency of having sex or in terms of, okay.

1769
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:43,180
In terms of frequency, I'm, yeah.

1770
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:46,740
Honestly, in terms of partners, it might be you.

1771
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:48,180
I, it's, it's me.

1772
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,900
How many girls have you slept with?

1773
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,420
Uh, like 20.

1774
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:52,740
20?

1775
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,460
That's pretty good.

1776
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,980
That's probably about double me, I'd say.

1777
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:59,340
I catch up working on it.

1778
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,100
You got two years, two years between us.

1779
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,100
I'll catch up and then I'll mustard.

1780
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,380
Nice.

1781
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:11,180
Yep.

1782
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:11,540
Yep.

1783
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:13,300
Well laid.

1784
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:15,660
I'm never going to get over that.

1785
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,660
That's the best fucking term I've ever come up with.

1786
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:18,860
It's what was that?

1787
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,460
That was a classic moment.

1788
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:23,980
That was a classic, classic TVC moment right there.

1789
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:24,420
All right.

1790
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,820
It feels like this thing's ending.

1791
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,180
Anyone got it on last?

1792
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:27,500
Okay.

1793
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:27,940
You got more?

1794
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:28,300
Okay.

1795
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:33,140
This was supposed to be the end of that story I was saying before.

1796
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:35,420
There was a very disillusion with going out and doing things.

1797
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,340
And whenever I hear about an event, I always think like, oh, it's not

1798
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,420
actually going to be fun.

1799
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:42,340
It's just going to be some, some shitty, some bluster.

1800
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:43,820
And it's all just some bullshit.

1801
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:47,460
It was why I was really shocked that I actually enjoyed the fucking circus.

1802
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,220
The circus.

1803
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:48,860
It's a show, man.

1804
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,860
It's designed to entertain.

1805
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:53,660
Yeah, but like I, on the one hand, that's true.

1806
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:57,740
But on the other hand, like that's the epitome of like corny, you know, like,

1807
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:04,100
like kind of silly, sort of, sort of pointless entertainment.

1808
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,940
Just, just spectacle for the sake of spectacle.

1809
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,020
It really felt like it really felt like it was anathema to everything

1810
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,820
that I would like, but I was totally wrong and it was a great time.

1811
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:14,060
Well, I don't know.

1812
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:18,540
I guess that goes to show people at home that even sometimes you just

1813
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:23,740
got to, sometimes you just got to be like, well, life might suck and things

1814
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,260
might suck.

1815
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:29,100
And even if the majority of things suck, you still got to do things because

1816
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,500
you got to find the ones that don't.

1817
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:35,180
You know, this is, this is a real subject yourself to a, to a, to a lot of stuff.

1818
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:41,180
It really is though, like, sorry, it really is a, like, uh, like a shot in

1819
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,740
the dark of like whether a thing's going to be good or bad.

1820
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:48,220
And I can't say that the number of things that have turned out to be

1821
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,740
good have made it worth all the times they've turned out to be bad.

1822
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,140
But no, it's not on the net.

1823
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:57,380
On the net, things are bad, but you got to wade through that.

1824
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:59,340
You got to wade through it anyways.

1825
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:03,140
You got to wade through that quagmire so that you can find the things that are

1826
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:06,660
good and keep them and then keep them in your heart and focus your life,

1827
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,340
remember that scene, an episode.

1828
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:13,020
I think it's episode one of NHK where Sato manages to like get out of his room.

1829
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:17,260
He goes all the way to like the manga cafe to like apply for a job.

1830
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:20,460
And then he just totally, yeah, it's first episode and he, he chickens out and

1831
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,820
he runs and my God, like that, that episode is so powerful for me.

1832
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:24,660
It's, it's insane.

1833
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:29,180
Uh, but like that was, that was him taking an opportunity to try to do something.

1834
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:33,780
And who knows if right then he had taken the job at the thing, uh, maybe he would

1835
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:36,900
have, you know, right then he would have like branched out and things would have

1836
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,660
worked out instead of having to spend, you know, the next 24 episodes or whatever

1837
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:44,940
you're languishing in pain of being a neat, uh, yeah, I'm just saying that it's

1838
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,380
about, it's about, and I can't, if you've got like a mental condition,

1839
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:51,900
like a serious clinical thing, then I mean, it's not my expertise.

1840
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:52,340
I don't know.

1841
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,700
But if you're just a normal depressed kind of guy, then you know, you gotta

1842
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,540
get out there and do shit.

1843
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,900
It's the only way like Ben saying you got to wade through the shit to find the

1844
01:30:58,900 --> 01:30:59,380
good stuff.

1845
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:01,220
I definitely got it.

1846
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:02,380
Uh, sorry.

1847
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:06,660
Depression is like, it's like a cycle and it feeds into itself.

1848
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:12,580
And the only, the only way to make it any better is to kind of ignore it and go

1849
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:17,220
against the, the instincts that it is telling you stay at home, don't do

1850
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,260
anything, give up.

1851
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:23,060
You, you got to like, you got to do something that feels wrong and just,

1852
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,260
you got to, you got to go against.

1853
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:28,800
Because you know, by the way, uh, I was just going to say, I know everyone

1854
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,540
hates Zoe Quinn or I know that that whole thing was a big to do.

1855
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:36,500
But before Gamergate ever happened, I played depression quest and I

1856
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,620
thought it was really good.

1857
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,220
Is that so?

1858
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,820
Uh, and, and only later, only after Gamergate exploded and I heard about

1859
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:44,140
Zoe Quinn, did they realize, Oh, she was the one who made depression

1860
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:44,420
quest.

1861
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,020
Well, holy shit.

1862
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:45,460
Yeah.

1863
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,940
And then I, and then I hear people being like, Oh, yeah, Zoe Quinn, she, the

1864
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:50,220
game she made was depression.

1865
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,460
Quest is not even a real game.

1866
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:52,340
Well, fuck those people.

1867
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,740
Because before she was even famous, I really liked it.

1868
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,020
Hey, well, can't, can't argue with that.

1869
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:56,780
Can't argue with that.

1870
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,860
And you know, I was going to say that, uh, the reason that we feel pain is

1871
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:05,300
because man is marble is both the sculpture and the sculptor and to reshape

1872
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,140
himself will always cause him pain.

1873
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:10,580
That's a metaphor people like that's never heard that one.

1874
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:11,300
It's a big fitness.

1875
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,180
So it's a fitness one.

1876
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:20,940
So, uh, yeah, like I think up until like just maybe even not even two years ago,

1877
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:26,100
I was absolutely the guy who would walk all the way up to the store, like get

1878
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:29,100
the application and then never return.

1879
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:32,100
And like that was, I've done, I've literally done it.

1880
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,380
Yeah.

1881
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,140
I've gone to places and like picked up an application and then just felt

1882
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,820
so weird about I've done that too, man.

1883
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:42,620
I've done that for a job or like gone somewhere to ask for an application and

1884
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:46,300
then not like, you know, I go to GameStop or something and then just like look

1885
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:53,140
at games and like then just put my tail to my legs and leave, you know, I've done

1886
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,340
a lot of that back before, but like, I don't know.

1887
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,540
It's not the kind of thing I would do now.

1888
01:32:56,540 --> 01:33:02,260
It's just cause like after having like worked in retail briefly, which with

1889
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,380
target, it was easy cause the place wasn't even open yet.

1890
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,780
So I, you know, it was like an online registration.

1891
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:12,620
So like, I got the job before the place even was like, you know, operating.

1892
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:17,860
Um, and, and like through having worked in those places and like kind of

1893
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:21,100
understanding the mindset of the people who are actually there, which is they're

1894
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,340
not thinking about you at all.

1895
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:23,740
They don't care about the customers.

1896
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:26,060
They're just thinking about the job they're trying to do right now.

1897
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:32,060
And then like, uh, and then just having money has made it like, cause I go out

1898
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:34,020
like I said, I go out to eat like almost every day.

1899
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:39,580
So I, you know, I constantly am out talking to people and throwing money around

1900
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:42,940
and like having this feeling like I belong in the place I'm in because I'm

1901
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,500
spending money on it, you know.

1902
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,780
So yeah, I think those things have helped me a lot to like, if I, if I had to get

1903
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:53,660
a job today, I would just walk into a place and sign a fucking application.

1904
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,620
Like there would be no to do about it.

1905
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,620
You know, if I had to get a job today, I would sell drugs.

1906
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,180
Oh yeah.

1907
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:00,660
Yeah.

1908
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:04,420
I would do, I would do anything to not get a job.

1909
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:08,340
You know, I think the one factor that might be an issue for me trying to do

1910
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:13,140
that would be, uh, like personal shame, like self loathing about like, oh my God,

1911
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:16,740
I can't believe I'm going back to work at fucking Best Buy or something like that.

1912
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:18,700
You know, like that would, that would be tough for me.

1913
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,820
Definitely not Best Buy.

1914
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:24,900
Well, I wouldn't go for something I was going to feel ashamed about, but I think

1915
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,260
I could probably get a little better.

1916
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:32,060
But if, if I had to get bottom of the barrel, yeah, yeah, um, like I've worked

1917
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:32,940
some shitty jobs.

1918
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:34,900
I worked in some back alley pizza places.

1919
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:39,660
I worked at like, oh man, just like a bunch of Craigslist jobs and food, then

1920
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:41,180
I'll fucking kill myself.

1921
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,700
Like if I had my jobs, not that it's bad, my jobs came from Craigslist, even

1922
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,340
like the kind of good ones like teaching physics and Poland and being that like

1923
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:53,100
mirror coding, sputter engineer, those both came from Craigslist, mine were,

1924
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,980
mine were pretty shitty for the most part.

1925
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,820
For those days there are behind me now.

1926
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,500
So it's sort of like sum up this podcast, because what I think is interesting

1927
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,220
about this is the trajectory that we followed.

1928
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:08,100
Unintentionally, we followed this in the way we told it, but like, I think all

1929
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:12,620
three of us, when we were teenagers or young adults, we didn't leave the house

1930
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:17,700
more out of like paranoia and like social awkwardness.

1931
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:22,860
And then there was a period when all of us tried to fight that and realized that

1932
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,740
we like, we could go out and do things.

1933
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:28,060
And then we all came to the conclusion that we didn't, like now we don't

1934
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,020
leave the house for totally different reasons.

1935
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,340
Like, before it was, I hate, I don't want to be seen by humans.

1936
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,180
So I won't leave.

1937
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,540
And then we all went, you know what, I want to be able to do fun things.

1938
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:42,180
And then we went out and did the fun things, realized they weren't fun and

1939
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:43,340
went back into our room.

1940
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:48,100
You know, kind of, yeah, I think, I think I'm in a little bit of a different

1941
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:52,420
camp because I do, I mean, I know we all long for human companionship.

1942
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,620
That's just a normal human thing.

1943
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,140
I'd like to, I'd like to do more things.

1944
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:59,420
And I could, I just, I just don't put in the effort.

1945
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:02,460
I take the, I'm taking the path of least resistance really, but just keep

1946
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:06,060
doing what I do every day and edit shit and, you know, doing that stuff.

1947
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:11,220
I'd like to, I would like to get out more, but only if it's to do something interesting.

1948
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:16,500
I don't want to get out more just to go with my friends to some dumb show or to

1949
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,900
go sit at the beach, like asshole or something and do nothing.

1950
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:23,980
Like if I'm going to go out more, it's got to be because we all decided like,

1951
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:27,140
Hey, we're all going to like really start working out for real.

1952
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:28,260
Let's all go to the gym.

1953
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:31,140
Let me just tell you a quick story about this or even just me and one other.

1954
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:34,500
Like if me and Victor didn't have the weirdest fucking job schedule in the

1955
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:38,260
universe and he wanted to start working out again and he had money, then I'd be

1956
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,420
like, Hey, Vic, let's go start working out again.

1957
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,460
Cause that's a thing to do outside.

1958
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:45,020
Makes me feel like a real human being, you know.

1959
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,780
You know, the time when I was feeling probably the most low about myself was

1960
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:53,020
after I came back from college, uh, I was taking like a class of two a semester,

1961
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:56,860
just chugging away, trying to finish my degree, uh, which is almost done now,

1962
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:01,900
thankfully, um, and was, was working these really shitty jobs and I was like 22 or

1963
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,740
so before Tbap started or anything.

1964
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:05,540
So I had no direction in life.

1965
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:10,820
Um, like one day I was just like, I think I'll go skydiving all by myself.

1966
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,500
And, uh, so I, so I did that.

1967
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:18,620
I paid like hundreds of dollars, went drove out by myself to a Newport airport

1968
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,060
in Rhode Island and just went skydiving by myself.

1969
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:25,780
And the fascinating thing was everyone there was like in a group or like was

1970
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:29,420
there with like their, their significant other of, of many years.

1971
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,220
And like, yeah.

1972
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:35,500
I mean, it was clearly like a group event, but the most interesting thing of all was

1973
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,780
like the whole time that you're getting ready to go, they're pushing all these

1974
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:43,460
things on you like, like, Hey, you want to buy like this recording of like the

1975
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,980
footage of you, you know, doing the skydiving, you want to buy like the

1976
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:50,820
landing photos that we take, we're going to take them anyway, but you only get

1977
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:54,620
to have them if you pay like the extra hundred bucks for our like deluxe package.

1978
01:37:54,620 --> 01:38:00,100
So like this was so obviously what they were selling was like Facebook, uh,

1979
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:04,540
page headers, no, they were saving Facebook headers that the, oh, look at me.

1980
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:09,820
I did this kind of like, it was so much more about having like showing that you

1981
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:12,180
had done this than actually experiencing it.

1982
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,820
Everyone else was there for a different reason than me.

1983
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:17,100
And I'm not saying that I was like a fucking hero or anything.

1984
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,780
I was there because I was depressed and looking for something that makes me

1985
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:21,060
not want to kill myself.

1986
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,860
I'll fucking say, you're a fucking hero.

1987
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:23,380
Oh, yeah.

1988
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:24,500
Fuck all those guys.

1989
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,020
All right.

1990
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,140
Someone had to say it.

1991
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:26,780
Thank you.

1992
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:27,220
Yeah.

1993
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:29,340
Uh, and it's not about me.

1994
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,580
It's just, it's just about them.

1995
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:33,420
I thought it was really interesting what everyone else was doing.

1996
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,980
Um, and our different motivations, you know, that's it.

1997
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,140
That's all I got to say.

1998
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:43,060
My parents are the type who every single time we even so much as go out to eat

1999
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:47,700
as a family, my dad will take, he'll make a big thing out of like taking a

2000
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,460
picture of everyone at the table together and then post it on Facebook and be like,

2001
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,820
out with the family at this place.

2002
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:56,620
I'm like, we literally just went out to eat.

2003
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,660
Like there's nothing special about that.

2004
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,340
The only thing that's fun about this is that we're doing it.

2005
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:05,100
Learning about it online is not interesting.

2006
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:08,780
Like I see things that I was involved with on Facebook.

2007
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:11,060
And I'm like, why is this up on Facebook?

2008
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,060
I don't care.

2009
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,340
To impress people, did you?

2010
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:17,260
It was only interesting back when I was doing it's all marketing.

2011
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:18,500
It's marketing your life.

2012
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:22,460
I don't really get the whole thing about taking pictures of stuff.

2013
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:25,980
I feel like if something's important and meaningful, then you'll remember it.

2014
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:26,180
Yeah.

2015
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:31,380
And if it's not, then like when I see pictures of stuff that I don't remember,

2016
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,300
then I'm just like, why do I have a picture?

2017
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:33,940
Well, now hang on.

2018
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:37,060
I don't want to, I guess there's a, I don't want to say the picture entirely worth

2019
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:40,380
us because sometimes we'll come across like kid pictures and it'll be really

2020
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,180
fun to be like, oh man, I was like a little, I was cool to do that.

2021
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:47,020
It's cool to see like what I, to me, the most interesting thing is always

2022
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,500
what I looked like at the time.

2023
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:52,180
Like not what I was doing, but the fact that there was a time where I looked

2024
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,780
that way, you know, I think they serve a function.

2025
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,340
I can see the appeal on that level.

2026
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,820
And if there is something that you don't remember, it might, it's

2027
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:01,820
could be interesting and maybe edifying to be like, oh, wow, I did that.

2028
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,300
I totally forgot about that.

2029
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,500
I totally forgot about all this stuff.

2030
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:09,780
This Facebook culture that we're kind of in now, like propagates the idea that

2031
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:13,260
like everyone but me has such an amazing life.

2032
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:16,260
And I think it could really be a, it could be a big pressure on people who are

2033
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:16,780
like needs.

2034
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,060
They'll be like, oh God, look at me.

2035
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:18,820
What am I going to do?

2036
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,940
These people, these are heroes out in the real world, you know?

2037
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:26,180
It may be like that for some people, but for me, you know, for someone like me

2038
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:31,620
living, as we've said, an alternative life, I've, I've, you know, I've, I've

2039
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:32,740
just evolved beyond it.

2040
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:38,100
Some, some idiot, some idiot like you, Nate, might, might see someone on

2041
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:41,820
Facebook doing cool, doing cool things and be like, wow, that person's got a

2042
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,340
great life.

2043
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:42,620
I get it now.

2044
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,540
Might see someone on Facebook right there.

2045
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:44,340
That's the funny thing though.

2046
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,940
Yeah, yeah, with their family or like doing something, doing something with

2047
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,500
quote unquote, loved one.

2048
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:51,780
No, here's the funny thing because I, I look at that and I'm like, man, that

2049
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:52,340
looks dumb.

2050
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,140
I don't want to do that.

2051
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,660
I'm glad I'm not, I'm not that person.

2052
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:55,780
I feel more like Ben.

2053
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:57,380
I'm always like, this is stupid.

2054
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:58,420
Why are they posting this?

2055
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:01,500
But like the funny thing is I've raised this point with my dad because I've

2056
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:06,420
seen people like very emphatically against like, uh, showing how awesome your

2057
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,780
life is on Facebook for the reasons like what Nate's saying, like, uh, like a

2058
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:14,020
nerd writer, um, before he became like big and popular, like he used to do

2059
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:18,300
vlogs and he had a one whole vlog about like how, uh, Instagram was like slowly

2060
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:21,420
being ruined because people were treating it like Facebook when it used to be like

2061
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,540
artistic or something.

2062
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:25,940
And he was like, we have to stop, uh, people from just posting like selfies and

2063
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,420
stuff on, on a can't be done.

2064
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,460
Whatever, can't be done.

2065
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,980
And I, I thought it was interesting.

2066
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:32,860
And then I, I brought this up to my dad one time where I was telling him, like,

2067
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,620
you know that like a lot of the internet, like really shames this kind of

2068
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:40,180
Facebook posting and he was like, the way I see it, I'm giving people something

2069
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:46,580
to aspire to, like because my dad is the type who like a lot of the little

2070
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:47,780
egotistical, but okay.

2071
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:47,900
Yeah.

2072
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,100
But like a lot of my dad's life improvement is from, he loves like egotistical

2073
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:56,700
people and like reading books about like he has several Trump books like that

2074
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,460
Trump wrote.

2075
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:57,940
Cool.

2076
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:01,660
He has a huge collection of nonfiction of like anyone who's successful.

2077
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:05,580
He wants to read about them, you know, and like he, like he sees other

2078
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:09,060
people's success and he thinks, I want to be that guy.

2079
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:11,740
And so he tries to like, you know, learn about their success.

2080
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:15,860
And like when he sees people like doing something fun and cool, then he's like,

2081
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:18,420
Oh, I want to get to a point where I can do that.

2082
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:18,820
You know.

2083
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:23,100
And so he sees it that way, that people will look at his Facebook and want to,

2084
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:27,700
you know, better themselves so they can do the fun things that he's posting about,

2085
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:29,660
you know, yeah, man, that makes sense.

2086
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:34,060
The thing when I see someone, maybe this is just my fucked up mindset.

2087
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:39,060
But when I see something, someone doing something fun, my reaction is to be like,

2088
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:40,300
well, it's probably not that fun.

2089
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:40,500
Yeah.

2090
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,380
That's how I think it's understandable.

2091
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:44,700
That's why like I get my dad's mindset.

2092
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,700
And I feel like that way about, you know, people who do like jobs I want to do,

2093
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,580
like, you know, anyone who's successful at YouTubing, like I look at them and

2094
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,860
I'm like, I want to be like them.

2095
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:56,860
But like when I see, yeah, when I see like photos of people like, we're at

2096
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,300
Disney World and it's awesome.

2097
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:01,500
And I'm always like, it's like, it was probably awesome for five minutes.

2098
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,180
And most of it's fucking boring.

2099
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,300
You're smiling in this picture, but I know you were waiting in line for

2100
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:09,660
like two hours before this and you paid $80 a day for cotton candy.

2101
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:12,140
My dad is very easily excitable.

2102
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:16,540
So like, I know that he legitimately has a great time wherever he goes.

2103
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:21,580
And I usually am like just like, for me, because again, all I think about when I'm

2104
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:24,700
out somewhere is like, is this better than what I could have been doing?

2105
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:25,820
Well, see, that's the thing.

2106
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:29,420
A lot of people don't even, that doesn't even cross their mind, you know,

2107
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,700
like most people, I won't say most people, but like,

2108
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:35,980
is ignorance truly bliss, you know, to just go through your life?

2109
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,540
Yes.

2110
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:37,340
Probably yes.

2111
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:39,020
It's probably just like a better way to live a happy life.

2112
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:41,100
Does the time reach your life?

2113
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,100
We went to this place called Motor World.

2114
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:46,540
And it was like, just like, it's like a place where you like ride around

2115
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:48,380
like little go-karty type things.

2116
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:49,900
And there's like a bunch of different courses.

2117
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,060
And it was like, it was hot as shit.

2118
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,580
No one else was there.

2119
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:56,700
It was like, the place was pretty much desolate because it was like, you know,

2120
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:58,140
relatively early on a weekday.

2121
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,660
So like, everyone who was working there looked like they didn't want to be there.

2122
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:03,820
The place is dirty and unkempt.

2123
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,740
Everything's way more expensive than it needs to be.

2124
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,300
Which, I mean, my dad was paying for all of it and he didn't care,

2125
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,500
you know, that it was expensive.

2126
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:12,460
But we were all just like, I'm the type who if,

2127
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:15,260
even if someone else is paying for something I'm doing,

2128
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:18,940
if I think it wasn't worth it for them, then it bothers me.

2129
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,500
Where I'm like, I did not get a level of enjoyment out of this,

2130
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,820
that you should have paid that much money for it, you know.

2131
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:24,060
Yeah.

2132
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:27,180
And so like, we were at Motor World and it's just like,

2133
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:33,340
I mean, it was a thing to go do all day on a day when I had no other plans.

2134
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:38,940
But like, I really left the place like, you, we have spent hundreds of dollars here

2135
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:42,540
and I would have been just as happy not having gone, you know.

2136
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:43,260
Yeah.

2137
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:47,420
I remember as a youth when our family went to Disney World,

2138
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:50,460
we went to like one or two, we went to Disney World I think twice.

2139
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:51,820
I think so, I think so.

2140
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:54,860
And I remember the second time I was probably like 14.

2141
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:58,300
I remember my dad just being like, oh, we're having a great time.

2142
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:59,180
You know, we're at Disney World.

2143
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:01,340
And I remember just being a little shit and being like,

2144
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,100
uh, I don't feel good.

2145
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,300
I'm not having a good day.

2146
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,740
I'm not having fun.

2147
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:06,300
I was such an edgy teen.

2148
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,380
Parents should just kill their kids.

2149
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:08,700
You know.

2150
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,780
I'm living, I'm living proof that you're totally right.

2151
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:17,020
I was an edgy, I'm still an edgy teen.

2152
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:20,860
I've decided I've recently come to the conclusion that I am as edgy a teen

2153
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:23,020
as I ever was and I probably always will.

2154
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:27,260
I think like whenever and any family event I see,

2155
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,900
I always see it as being like vacation,

2156
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:34,620
like National Lampoon's vacation where it's like the dad just desperately wants

2157
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:38,940
to do something that he thinks will make everybody have fun and be happy.

2158
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:43,740
But without an understanding of what anyone really wants to do.

2159
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:47,980
And like because you're told it will be fun to go to Disney World,

2160
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,820
then you want it to be fun.

2161
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,980
But then you get there and it's not fun.

2162
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:53,980
And as a kid, it's harder for you to like,

2163
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,020
you know, like express that and like,

2164
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:59,100
you know, because you know that it costs a lot of money

2165
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,740
and that for you to be disappointed is, you know.

2166
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:04,780
It probably could be fun if you go with the right people.

2167
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:05,260
Right.

2168
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,180
And if you're not, and if you're not like,

2169
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:10,780
if it's not such like a rare and valuable thing that you feel like pressured to have fun.

2170
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:11,340
Exactly.

2171
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,780
That's why I know it's probably fun.

2172
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:17,500
That's my favorite thing about being an adult is that I can now go and like spend all this money

2173
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:21,660
on whatever and it's not a big deal because I was prepared for it to not be good.

2174
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:26,140
You know, or like, when I was dating my ex-girlfriend,

2175
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:30,380
like I really wanted to go to Disney World with her because she's a huge Disney fan.

2176
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:34,700
And like there was nothing I could imagine that would have been more fun for the two of us

2177
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:38,620
than to go see a bunch of cool Disney shit because she would have been like losing her mind.

2178
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:41,180
You know, as soon as we broke up, I like,

2179
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:43,420
I had this moment of realization that I was like,

2180
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,700
I no longer have any desire to go to Disney World.

2181
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:49,340
Because as awesome as Disney World sounds like it might be,

2182
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:53,980
going with someone who likes Disney, it would probably be the coolest thing ever.

2183
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:57,180
But without that, it's like, I don't give a fuck about Disney.

2184
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:59,500
All I'm going to go is like, I'm going to look and I'm going to see like,

2185
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,620
Oh, hey, it's Cinderella.

2186
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,900
I didn't like that movie.

2187
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,980
That's a strong six maybe.

2188
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:07,340
It was a five.

2189
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:07,580
Yeah.

2190
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:10,780
Like that's, that's exactly how I would be if I was there, you know.

2191
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:13,420
I'd say, Hey, Cinderella, your movie fucking sucks.

2192
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:19,580
I, something, something seems, something is a little bit crass and gross to me about the idea

2193
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:23,660
of a place like Disney World where, yeah, you're, you're told,

2194
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:29,260
commanded really by the marketing that, you know, this is a fun place where you will have fun

2195
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:34,780
and you like buy into that idea and you go there and you have fun just as you were told to.

2196
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:39,660
I know that to a certain extent, all, all forms of having fun will all,

2197
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:43,980
to a certain extent, all forms of having fun require you to buy into the idea that you're

2198
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,620
having fun.

2199
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:48,540
So it's not, so it's not like it's unique to this, but something about the fact that this is

2200
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:53,740
like a marketed product, a place of fun to which you're like, yes, fun sounds good.

2201
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:57,580
Let's go and have something is very weird about that.

2202
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:05,100
In my career as like a horribly cynical anime critic guy, like in the last, particularly lately,

2203
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:08,540
like after I went through that phase in like the early part of this year where I wrote a bunch

2204
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:14,060
of negative videos, then like there was a period where like it finally got to me that

2205
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:16,620
so many people were like, do you just hate fun?

2206
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:21,740
And I'm like, do, and I had this moment of like, do I hate fun?

2207
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:24,140
Like, do I, did you hate fun?

2208
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:25,580
Do I know what fun is?

2209
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:29,900
And it was, it happened when I was watching Myriad Colors Phantom World and I almost wrote a whole

2210
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:33,740
video about this, but I ended up writing something else about that show instead.

2211
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:36,540
I would, I would click on a video titled, Do I Hate Fun?

2212
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:41,260
Yeah, and it was, it was because there was a moment in the show that I could tell

2213
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:45,660
was engineered to be fun, but I did not find it fun.

2214
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:53,100
And then I realized that I could identify a similar moment in another show that I did find fun

2215
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:57,020
and compare them and say like why one word and not the other.

2216
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:03,580
And ever since then, I now have like, when I feel legitimate fun, when I watch something and I

2217
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:09,340
have fun, then I can truly cherish it because I'm like, oh my God, it's happening.

2218
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,620
I'm smiling.

2219
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:13,820
I'm watching something and it's just making me smile.

2220
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:15,740
This is, this is what fun is.

2221
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:16,540
I know fun.

2222
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,420
I can see fun.

2223
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,540
I see you fun.

2224
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,900
I see you over there.

2225
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,740
That's what it was like at the fucking circus.

2226
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:25,740
There was like some big muscular dudes like bouncing each other on this giant

2227
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:27,580
high wire like trampoline thing.

2228
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:31,260
The suspended, they were, they were flying like 30 feet in the air and like,

2229
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,300
yeah, I was just sitting there.

2230
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:33,420
Like I was on the edge of my seat.

2231
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:36,940
Like I cannot believe how high these dudes are getting.

2232
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:41,740
How high do you even have to be just to do something like that?

2233
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:50,620
And, and yeah, I mean, I think to have genuine fun, you have to, you have to, I mean, it's,

2234
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:52,940
it's okay to be, you know, told to have fun.

2235
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:57,260
It's okay that you're like, go in with the expectation of having fun, but you have to,

2236
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:01,020
in that moment, you have to forget that you're supposed to be having fun, right?

2237
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:02,940
Yes, mandated fun is not work.

2238
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,780
I got to say one of the coolest things.

2239
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:09,180
This has been one of the best things about the crunchy roulette game that I started the other day

2240
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:13,100
on a DigiRaptor Dark, which I just put out episode two of, I think today,

2241
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:17,900
because it's a game where I just hit the random button on crunchy roll and I watch anything that

2242
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,820
I've never seen before.

2243
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:24,140
And like in the course of this, I, because I never have any expectations.

2244
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:26,700
It's all shows I know nothing about pretty much.

2245
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:32,540
And like when I get a show that I have no expectations for and it ends up like being

2246
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:36,460
a lot of fun, then it's like such a surprise that it's like, whoa.

2247
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:39,820
Like yesterday, me and Shade did it together.

2248
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,740
Like we watched six shows together.

2249
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:46,700
And the third one was an OVA called Cosplay Complex from like 2002.

2250
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,260
And I'd never heard of it and I had nothing about it.

2251
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,700
And it was a fucking blast.

2252
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,540
And like I was laughing the whole time.

2253
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:54,060
Like I thought it was fucking hilarious.

2254
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,260
And I never heard of this thing.

2255
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:56,460
And I was just like, what?

2256
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,500
This is fun.

2257
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:58,540
This is what fun is.

2258
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,060
When something's good that you didn't expect to be good,

2259
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:03,260
it just makes it that much better.

2260
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:04,780
Yeah, definitely.

2261
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,420
In my opinion.

2262
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:07,180
Well, man, these character designs are pretty tight.

2263
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:11,100
Yeah, it was a three episode OVA.

2264
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:15,900
We watched the first episode and it was just, I mean, I literally thought,

2265
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:17,740
like I didn't know anything about it.

2266
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:20,220
I was like, this could be total garbage and it was not.

2267
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,900
It was a lot of fun and I liked it.

2268
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:23,740
Awesome.

2269
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:23,980
Yeah.

2270
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,860
I guess that about wraps up this podcast.

2271
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:27,420
Yeah.

2272
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:29,820
Oh, we've covered a lot of topics.

2273
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:34,380
We went from pissing to the concept of fun in general.

2274
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,660
A lot of pissing.

2275
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:36,220
There was a lot of.

2276
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:36,380
Yeah.

2277
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:38,780
It was just on the nature of sort of depression

2278
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:41,180
and the forces that keep you locked in your room

2279
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:43,900
and what you may or may not choose to do about them.

2280
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:44,460
Yeah.

2281
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:45,100
Good stuff.

2282
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,700
This was a blast.

2283
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,780
I've had a great time here today.

2284
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:49,100
Yeah.

2285
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:51,100
If only Hippo could have been here.

2286
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:51,980
Yeah, true.

2287
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:52,860
True.

2288
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:56,540
Yeah, his shitty internet is fucking him up.

2289
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:59,500
He couldn't be here today, but we'll be back.

2290
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,420
You guys should get me your audio as soon as possible

2291
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,020
so I can upload this tonight.

2292
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,420
Since I'm not going to be able to finish the podcast

2293
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:08,540
that we recorded last week until probably next week.

2294
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:08,780
So.

2295
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,260
God damn.

2296
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,500
Let me say real quick.

2297
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,900
I uploaded a vlog on my fucking YouTube channel.

2298
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:14,780
Oh, yeah.

2299
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:16,940
I've been saying and putting out YouTube videos now.

2300
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:17,580
Imagine that.

2301
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:18,300
Imagine that.

2302
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:21,020
Yeah, I'm going to actually have to like subscribe to you

2303
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:22,540
on the Procrastinator's channel.

2304
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:23,180
Yeah, good idea.

2305
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:26,780
I think I already subbed me on there.

2306
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:29,500
Anyway, yeah, go and click my little icon here

2307
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,900
and go and listen to me talk about art and stuff, viewers.

2308
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:32,860
Yep.

2309
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:35,500
And buckle your fucking seatbelts for next week

2310
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:39,020
when I'll finally drop the epic bombshell that was last week's recording.

2311
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:39,980
Oh, man.

2312
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:44,380
The three and a half hour argument over what is the color yellow.

2313
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,900
I'll bug other things.

2314
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:51,420
That was not the whole thing, but it was the worst part of it.

2315
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:52,540
And the best part.

2316
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:53,980
It was the worst and best part.

2317
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:55,340
It depends on your definition.

2318
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:56,940
It was it was just the worst.

2319
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:57,980
All right.

2320
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:58,940
See you next week.

2321
01:52:58,940 --> 01:52:59,820
Bye, everybody.

2322
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:00,780
Bye.

2323
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:01,020
Bye.

2324
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:03,260
Yeah.

2325
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:10,380
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2326
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:15,980
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2327
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:18,780
But I'm not working.

2328
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:21,340
I'm doing nothing.

2329
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:23,980
My dick, I'm jerking.

2330
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:26,700
Myself, I'm sucking.

2331
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:29,420
I am an asshole.

2332
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:32,060
I am a stupid.

2333
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:34,700
I've got a deadline.

2334
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:36,700
Don't want to do it.

2335
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,180
What the hell is wrong with me?

2336
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:53,100
I'm supposed to be making money.

2337
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:58,380
I'm supposed to be creating money.

2338
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:06,380
Think that the people gladly will pay for artistic genius.

2339
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:09,100
That's what they came for.

2340
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:14,380
Instead, I'm tweeting hashtag repeating.

2341
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:21,100
That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling.

2342
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:25,500
Yeah, it's quite the burden.

2343
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:29,980
It's a hard knock life, being a genius.
