00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,320
Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm here to

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:24,360
talk about a big problem, hegemonic masculinity. Here to weigh in, we've got Nate Best Guy

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:33,520
Ever-Bestman. Yeah, I'm like Edward Scissorhands. I hate hedge cutting masculinity, you know?

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,920
Fuck, okay, cancelled. We've got Tom Oliver. Look, I just do what my dick tells me to do.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,720
It's good, it's bad, it doesn't matter. It's the boss and I know where I stand in the packing

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,960
order. Arrest this man. The pecker order, you might say. And finally, we've got Lethal Aurora

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,080
Mage. Completely unrelated to the topic, Pokemon. I'm glad to hear you're an ally. I'm going to poke

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,080
your mom, Mage, because I'm a bad toxic male. Pokemon is gay coded, I'd say. Queer coded. Hey guys,

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,160
I have an announcement. I have a big announcement to make right now. All right, go, go, go. My

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,760
Kickstarter is launching right now. Hooray! Maple is two physical copies available right now on

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,040
Kickstarter. Link in the description. I don't have, as I record, I have not actually made the

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,680
website, so I can't say it out loud, but it's real. Damn it, it's real. It's real in the future

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,360
when they're listening to this, not right now, correct? I can't go right now, but I can when this

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,360
is live in the future. Yes, on Friday at 2 p.m. or whatever, release these. Yes, at that point,

15
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:48,280
the page will be up and the suffering will begin. Deb, Deb, Deb. Now, I'd very much like to have

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,320
physical copies of all the vapor chapters, but what can I expect as a fan for new content? Is it

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,160
vaporettes? Here's the thing. There's going to be like, there's going to be, unless any of my,

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,800
the artist that got lined up, drop out, I'm going to, it's going to have, this is going to have six new,

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,920
six new, fully new vaporettes. They are canon. I wrote them. They're being drawn by guest

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,200
artists, but I wrote them. They're canon. We're probably actually going to be more new content

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,160
than old content, actually. And we're going, we're going deep. We're going deep diving. Guess what?

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,480
You're going to meet, you're going to meet Vincent and Magda's parents. You fuckers. Oh my god.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,280
That's exciting. Yeah, they're in there. Yeah, they're in there. We can find out who's responsible

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,040
for these fucking delinquents. Yeah, there's some fucking shit in there. Okay. There's some

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,880
fucking shit. You're going to, you're going to feel real fucking bad when you read this

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,640
shit. You piece of, you fucker. Don't see that. That's actually pretty interesting because that's

27
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,040
like an important part of your character's kind of like development is like reveal these characters

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,440
and, and you're not even drawing it. You know, you've outsourced a very big kind of like,

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,880
I would say plot point, but that's kind of cool. Well, I made, um, well, I did some like concept

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,680
sketches, not just for parents. Like there's other things like, like if a particular thing

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,600
factors into a story, I'll draw it out and be like, here's what this looks like or something. So

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,440
like I did like design stuff, but like, I mean, I don't really care. I don't feel any less like,

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
I don't feel like divorced from it at all. If like someone else draws, I think that's cool. I think

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,680
that's cool that I can get my ideas represented in another person's style. And I'm, and I, and by

35
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,640
the way, um, I'm giving all the guest artists a cut. I'm giving, like, you know, I got six of them.

36
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,960
So I'm giving everyone as a cut. Every, my deal is with them all that every chapter, every copy

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,800
of Vapors two that sells, I'm going to give them 50 cents. So last time I moved about 200 copies.

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,200
So that would be like a hundred bucks. If I did really well, it would be even more. So Ben, Ben

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,920
same, putting his money where his mouth is and giving his artists the Vapors dividend.

40
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,560
Yeah. Yeah. Dab. Yeah. Uh, uh, uh, workers, workers of the workers of the world tonight.

41
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Everyone's, we got, you got mutual ownership here. Right. We got a worker, a little workers co-op

42
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,920
going on right here. We got to mutually, we mutually own the means of production.

43
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,000
But you know, whenever I work with anybody, I make sure that they are financially compensated

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,480
or else I wouldn't possibly expect them to do it. I didn't, uh, funny, funny thing. All these guys,

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,440
like they're not all, all these guys like just asked me if they could do it and said they wanted

46
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,880
to do it like for free. And I was like, yeah, okay. And I was like, wait a minute, I should probably

47
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,920
pay them. I should probably also pay them something. You know, I, from a purely, that's just an art

48
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,880
me too waiting to happen. If it gets out, you don't have any of these artists being paid because

49
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,840
there's nothing that an artist gets mad about more than unpaid work. I mean, how many times have,

50
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,720
you know, we like shit on like guys like Dr. Wolf and KP for, you know, exactly. I didn't want to

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,840
be, I did not want to be a Dr. Wolf. Like I, I guaranteed those people came to them and were

52
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,600
like, Hey man, can we edit for you? They develop a rhythm. And then at a certain point they're

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,400
like, Hey, shouldn't I be getting paid for this? Even though I, I mean it, I can't imagine that

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,960
Dr. Wolf, for example, would willingly take advantage of anyone's labor. I'm sure he just

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,720
bumbles into it due to, you know, whatever free shit that people just offer to him. This is my

56
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,520
guess anyway. Maybe he's a master manipulator. Who can say he's a wily one? You know, I gotta say,

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,000
I was going over, like I was deciding on how much I was going to set the goal at this, this time. I

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,480
was going over the expenses from last time and they were like, they were like almost double what I

59
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,200
thought. Like it cost almost twice as much to do. Like I, my initial goal was like 1750. I think

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:45,320
the actual amount of just like, you know, initial Kickstarter fees plus like postage plus initial

61
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,920
printing plus like making the pay. It all came to like, like 2,800 or something. So like almost

62
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,680
half like the whole thing. Well, it was Ben. It was a real, it was a real, oh, and shipping,

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,280
God, international shipping fucking killed me. This time I am going to have to add like an

64
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,920
international shipping charge just because last time international shipping was so fucking bad.

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,760
With Digi about shipping shirts and stuff. And he was recommending stamps.com where you can get

66
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,360
highly discounted shipping through there instead of going through local traditional channels. So

67
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,920
that might be something to look into. I'll check it out. Is it really cheaper than just sending

68
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,440
with the he was able to ship the shirts that he's been doing for half the price that he was before.

69
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,680
So well, yeah, it seems like it might be worth looking into. I'll, I'll, I'll look into it and

70
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,160
see if that, if that, if that cuts any, any costs anywhere.

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,040
If you want to know more, watch that episode with me, me, Tom and Digi where half more than half

72
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,000
of the episode is about Digi talking about shipping. Oh, I didn't watch the Baronecon one.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,480
Yeah. But maybe before the people are split on that, whether being it was a nice, cool,

74
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,520
calm reprieve from the normal PCP. The other half the audience like this is the most boring

75
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,000
shit I've ever heard in my life. Well, so you know what, at least it was, at least they can't

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,680
variety, you know, at least it was different. People aren't spoiled for choice at this point.

77
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,920
Thanks to me. Indeed, indeed. Speaking of, of financial curves and trying to get ahead of things,

78
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,400
this is very much on my mind as I'm embarking on my, my year long quest to be financially viable

79
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,600
long term and whatnot doing YouTube stuff. And I got to tell you guys, this, this last, I don't

80
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,200
know, couple of weeks or whatever, I have been like an animal with a taste of blood in its mouth.

81
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,440
I have been on the hunt. I have been the hunter in the field. Remember that guy in Jumanji that

82
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,120
like sick, like South African hunter guy who was chasing Robin Williams? Like that's me. That's me.

83
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,280
And, and my prey, and my prey is the most elusive prey, the most dangerous prey of all that I've

84
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:55,960
been pursuing. And it is a, a Huel sponsorship. Oh, my God. Okay. Right now. Are you,

85
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,440
bitch, are you for real? Well, okay. So tragically, I'm not for real.

86
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,160
As far as I know, I've been doing some research. I don't think that Huel has really done anything

87
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,320
like this before. So I've taken on myself to reach out to them and just say, Hey guys, talk to me.

88
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,040
I love your product. I would be, I would absolutely love to shill your shit online,

89
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,240
because I think it's so great and so good for the future of humanity. Let's make a

90
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,760
fucking deal where I can make a little pittance, shill your product and whatever, more people buy

91
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,840
your stuff. You have to do a we Agua on like Starfleet or something and then integrate your

92
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,160
Huel into that. Because what is more Starfleet than Huel? Well, that's, that's couldn't be more

93
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,320
accurate. But I mean, at the beginning of my last we Agua about the Tarantino movie,

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,000
once upon a time in Hollywood, I do like a little gag where I actually say like Huel,

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,200
sponsor me. I'm wearing Huel merch, drinking a Huel, saying Huel, I love your product,

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,280
please let me show for you. I need more Huel. I haven't gotten Huel in a fucking forever.

97
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,480
I just got my second batch of the, of like the bottle, you know, whatever bottle Huel. I just

98
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,000
had one for breakfast. The chocolate Huel bottles are so fucking good. I have not done the bottles

99
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,200
at all yet. Because they are, they're so much better than the powder. They are delicious. The

100
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,160
thing about the powder is it's annoying to make and honestly doesn't taste that great. The bottles

101
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,920
are so good. They are so good. But isn't it like a lot more expensive to get bottles? It is. That's

102
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,200
the doubt. It is more expensive. That's definitely true. But the question is, is it overall for life

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,400
still a better use of your money than like buying a sandwich, which I think the answer is yes. That's

104
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,320
what that's what I've said. I've worked at like between three and four dollars a bottle, which is

105
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,720
like 400 calories. Not cheap. By the way, how do I get to use my EBT on Huel? I'm making a healthy

106
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,240
choice. I have to go contact the government and be like, in a perfect world we'll be there. Maybe

107
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,080
you can find it in like a convenience store or something. I don't think they sell in retail

108
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,680
because they only sell direct to consumers right now. No, no. I swear I've seen like boxed like

109
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,000
Huel. Oh yeah? Maybe. I think so. It was in the same place that we saw the boxed water.

110
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,680
You know? Well, okay. Boxed water. That sounds great. Maybe I'm getting confused. I don't know.

111
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,200
Well, in any case, look, I just want to let people know that I'm not asking anybody to do

112
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,520
anything. But like if anyone knows about ways to get at this point, I have sent two salvos. I've

113
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,640
reached out twice to their support staff just saying, Hey guys, I make YouTube videos, look at

114
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,600
for a sponsorship with you guys. I think you're great. I think we'd be a great fit.

115
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,240
Work with it. Just let me know if you're even interested. So far, I've had no communication

116
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:44,040
back from them whatsoever, which is not a no. You're going about this the entirely wrong way.

117
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,920
This is what you need to do. You need to make a video on YouTube talking about this exact thing

118
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,720
you're saying right now. You want to get a sponsorship. And then you have to make a hashtag.

119
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,520
You have to put it on Twitter and you have to add Huel and get everyone to jump on the

120
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,520
hashtag. Get it trending and they'll have to acknowledge you. What do we got? What's a what's

121
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:12,520
a good hashtag? Hashtag. Heal it up. Hashtag. Hashtag. Huel Nate's heart. I don't know something

122
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,640
like that. You have to workshop that a bit, but we'll get there. I'm gonna like that one. That

123
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,760
was cute. Huel Nate's heart. Like I'm going for like a fuel Nate's heart kind of thing, but it's

124
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,120
Huel. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Okay. There you go. Hashtag. Huel Nate's heart. That's the one.

125
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,760
You're starting a social media campaign. Tell Huel you want me to sponsor their product

126
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:42,680
for reasonable compensation. That's what I'm all about. That's it. Hashtag. Fuck Huel. There you go.

127
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,880
They're doing God's work. So we mentioned Twitter briefly. I'm gonna go slightly off topic. Does

128
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,680
anyone know if Twitter still verifies people because I've heard it doesn't verify people anymore

129
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,000
or something? You know, I've looked into this a bit, Mage. And what I found at my last check was

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,960
that there used to be a process through which they would, in fact, like you could submit a form to

131
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,240
be verified. When I was interested in this a while back, when I looked into it, they said they have

132
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,840
shut down the application thing. So they're not like accepting applications or whatever. But when

133
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,400
they, they will still give out the badge to people that like they just like journalists to

134
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,360
like people who just are known and are recognized. And journalists is like the number one kind of

135
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,120
people who that just happens to when they're known and they do stuff, even people who don't have a

136
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,000
lot of followers or anything. So for us pleads, there's basically no hope. No, I wasn't, I was

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,400
giving it for me. I don't care about the take, but I'm following like this one Twitter account

138
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,640
that's been wanting to be verified for a while. We're talking about Satan. Are you talking about

139
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Verify Satan? Yes, I am talking about Satan. How did you know? Because I saw this on the

140
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:54,040
Twitter. Is it just at Satan? Hashtag verify Satan. That's young Venus's dream is to get

141
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,520
verified on Twitter, but I guess it'll never happen. What a shit. Well, I like how Tom knows me enough.

142
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,520
I mean, what's their, what's their reason for not verifying people? I mean, I think it's because

143
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,440
like there, it seems like their standards for verification were like way inconsistent. Or

144
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,720
maybe they, like there are tiny accounts that are verified and there are like big accounts that

145
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,480
are not verified. It seems like verification is more at this point, not to be this is who you are,

146
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,440
but it's like you're involved with like the traditional media or something like that. It seems

147
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,240
like it's, it's like, yeah, it's not about this is who you are. It's about like, it's Twitter giving

148
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,880
you sort of like an endorsement. Yeah, it's our tacit pad on the head for everything. I mean,

149
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,960
the one, the biggest one was when they simply de-verified Miloianopolis and like we know that's

150
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Milo's account. Like that's verified, but they just were like, no, we don't want to, we don't want

151
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,920
to be with this guy. So obviously that's not what it means. Yeah, anymore. That's true. Later on,

152
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,680
he did get banned. So yeah, that was, that was a separate incident though. Yeah, well, I don't know.

153
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,160
Good luck, Satan. I wish you all the luck on your quest to get verified. Shout out to Satan for

154
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,400
giving us the knowledge of good and evil. It's really enabled everything. It was kind of a good

155
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,960
thing. It was kind of a help. In any other story, Satan would be the hero. Think about it. You're

156
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,800
in this post post apocalyptic dystopia and some heroes. This is my story.

157
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,720
Satan is punishing the sinners. He's not evil himself. He's like, he's being the jailer.

158
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's just running a for-profit private prison. What could possibly be wrong

159
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,880
with that? That's why we need Bernie. That's why we need Bernie to get in there and bust that

160
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,960
cell. But we're already feeling the burn. Satan's got fire and brimstone. We don't need Bernie.

161
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,080
It's the wrong kind of burn, okay? It's the wrong kind, all right? It's not exactly what I was thinking.

162
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,640
It's just, it's just too slow of a burn. Eternity is too slow of a burn. We need something quicker

163
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,080
and faster. We change now. That's why we need Bernie. God, this just makes me think. I've been

164
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,920
watching this YouTube channel. I think Jesse might have complained about this YouTube channel

165
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,280
called Renegade Cuts the other week, and I didn't know what it was talking about.

166
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,280
I didn't know what he was talking about, so I couldn't comment. But I started watching it,

167
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:22,840
and it's great. It's great. It's just my shit. It's my vaguely lefty media analysis in the

168
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:29,160
vein of Big Joel or whatever. It's one of those. It's really good. But in particular,

169
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,520
what this guy Renegade Cuts is good at is, I think he was raised very Catholic. He was an

170
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:42,040
altar boy and stuff. He's got insight. He's got insight into the evangelical mindset. He has one

171
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,760
video that I particularly recommend on the, oh fuck, what's it called? That movie in books

172
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,320
left behind. The ones about the rapture people living in the post-rapture thing.

173
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,920
He goes into a deep dive. I knew about some of this rapture mythology stuff, but I didn't know.

174
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,720
He throws out terms like post-millennial dispensationalism and stuff to describe what's

175
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,840
going on here in terms of the philosophy at play. It's great shit. It's great shit.

176
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,800
What is dispensationalism? Okay. Oh, I didn't know this, but apparently

177
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,440
a dispensation in some... It's a payment, right?

178
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,520
In this context, what it means is a period of time, is a dispensation. The time when Adam and

179
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,400
Eve lived in the garden before the fall was a dispensation, and then the time before the flood

180
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,080
was another dispensation. Currently, we are living in a particular dispensation that has been going

181
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:47,400
on since the resurrection of Jesus, and then what is... An era, an age, something like that.

182
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:55,720
Yeah, an era and age. Not all of them are specific to this, but a lot of rapture theology

183
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:03,240
evangelicals have a particular view of eschatology called post-millennial dispensationalism,

184
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,320
which says that we are currently living in a long dispensation, but there will be the rapture,

185
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,720
and then there will be the millennia, which is a thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, followed

186
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,160
by the judgment, and the return of heaven on earth, which is the post-millennial dispensation

187
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,000
that is when the judgment happens. It's something along those lines, and anyway, Renegade cuts

188
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
this really good, and he talks about that kind of stuff, and I love that shit. Well, all right,

189
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,800
cool. He doesn't only talk about that, but a significant chunk of his videos are about

190
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,560
movies left behind and other Christian propaganda kind of things. I forget the name of the guy,

191
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:52,360
but Michelle was Mormon for a while when she was young, which is basically a cult. It's just a cult.

192
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,640
It's weird. There are some YouTubers that pop up. There's a little sub-genre of former religious

193
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,680
people. It sounds like this guy is one, and there's these former Mormon guys. I can't remember the

194
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,920
guy's name specifically, but there's one guy. I think it was actually Mr. Atheist. I think that was

195
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:17,240
his name, and Michelle was saying for a while that she was watching his stuff, but after a while,

196
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:26,200
it just became like, here I am, not still not Mormon, still wishing I hadn't done that back in

197
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,920
the day. That can't be your whole thing. Well, it's got to change at some point. You don't want

198
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,640
to be a springboard or something with more meat on its bones.

199
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,920
Michelle was telling me about, there are these channels that get huge off of specifically

200
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,760
like Acne. They're like Acne channels, and they're about someone's journey to get rid of their Acne,

201
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,680
so they start off looking pretty rough, and they try, I forget, like Accutane or some of the

202
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,880
procedures. Because people are like, oh, I've got Acne. Would this work for me?

203
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,720
Well, they do this for weight loss, right? They do weight loss journey channels too.

204
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes, that kind of shit too. And the thing is, oftentimes they can succeed, but in doing so,

205
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,520
they develop a pretty sizable following. I saw some people with over like 150,000 subs just off

206
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,680
of an Acne journey, but then it's like, well now what? You're done. The quest is over. You lost the

207
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,960
weight. Yeah. Good job. I think there was something like that, like a channel about a woman trying to

208
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,240
lose her weight, but she ended up like binge eating and just becoming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's

209
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,520
right. I know. I don't know what I know. Well, there's, oh God, I saw a video about this, and it was

210
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,720
like people, it was talking about how people love to hate on these people and to like, and to like

211
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,240
law, like if someone, yeah, there's one, there's one particular channel that is like well known

212
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,560
for this, but it's not the only one, but it's like a weight loss journey where like, based on what

213
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,560
the video contents, you can tell that like they're not doing it. They're failing, right? And they're

214
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,960
like making excuses for themselves and people like, and people like to watch these and do reaction

215
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,600
videos pointing out like, oh, look, like, look how dishonest this person is being. Like, look how

216
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,040
this person's fucking up. You know, it's kind of like a there, but for the grace of God. That's

217
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,600
the internet for you, I guess. Yeah. I know the channel you're talking about, but I don't remember

218
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,360
its name. Yeah, I only heard about it like. Like how long, how long can you milk the idea

219
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,440
that you are on a weight loss journey when like it's been years and like you weigh the same?

220
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,000
I think at this point, it might be like some sort of psychological dependency on the attention

221
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,400
for the female, I think. It's not, it's not quite the same. Well, it reminds me of Boogie,

222
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,200
right? Like Boogie had that like gastric bypass surgery and he went down from like 500 to like

223
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,360
300 pounds and then. That's pretty good. Well, yeah. I mean, it's, it could be better, right?

224
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,600
Sure, of course. But he's like, he's still, man. I mean, 40% weight loss is pretty damn good.

225
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,400
Yeah, well, when you have gastric bypass, of course you're going to have that, right? But then

226
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,800
he's still, he's still morbidly obese, right? But like, I don't know, I saw a video, there's this

227
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,760
one pretty, pretty well known video about like, what's, what the fuck's wrong with Boogie? Just

228
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,480
like what an asshole he is. And he does seem like a big asshole. But in particular, there's people

229
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,680
that have made like really good faith attempts to be like, hey, Boogie, here's what I think is

230
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,920
going wrong on your weight loss journey. And here's how I think you can fix it. And he's responded

231
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,360
with like great hostility, like a totally inappropriate sense of like, I'm being victimized.

232
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Well, well, look, after, I mean, you know me, Nate is hardcore hashtag kill the fats. But,

233
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,720
but aside from that, when you've like, obviously people have been telling Boogie like, I'm sure

234
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,120
great advice for like years and years. And it's absolutely sure true that he should have taken

235
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,240
most or all of that advice and fix his problem, which is fixable. But there's like, I mean,

236
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,640
he's got like, like mental like abuse, any like comfort eats, because he's so traumatized,

237
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,120
but like his fucked up childhood, I just don't know. I mean, I'm not impressed, but I mean,

238
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,920
we've all got our reasons why we fuck up.

239
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,160
He's been like, like for years on the internet, known a person like, and imagine like,

240
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,520
constantly getting this unsolicited advice, it would probably great on your nerves too.

241
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,440
Okay, all right. God damn it. All right, I know you guys are all you guys are all

242
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,040
we love Boogie. And we love the idea. I know the defense of this guy. Let me tell you this.

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,920
Okay, I wouldn't complain except that Boogie has like, he sort of like has made part, he too kind

244
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,320
of made part of his appeal, this like weight loss journey thing. And he's like, he's very cagey about

245
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,200
it. He'll make, he'll make promises. And then he'll like, I know that like, I know that like, to a

246
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,960
certain extent, it's none of his, it wouldn't be his audience's business. If he didn't talk publicly

247
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,560
about it. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I kind of wish he wouldn't make it his audiences. It seems like a bad

248
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,840
incentive structure to make it your audience's business. Your, your especially when you say,

249
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,080
I've got psychological issues. This is not going to be easy for me. You know, blah, blah, blah,

250
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,520
my whole that that just that's like a private thing, man. I don't know why you'd

251
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,680
to be fair. I like, I don't know much about Boogie like at all. Yeah. I've known people say that

252
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,800
he's a nice person in general. That's all I've heard of him. And now I'm hearing this, you know,

253
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm not believing either side, honestly. So I don't know. I don't care. Well, this video,

254
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,200
this video, there's a video called the fall of Boogie 2988, why he's losing subscribers that

255
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,480
has 2 million, 2.5 million views right now. Is that by that guy, Tom, something? Oliver? Yes.

256
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,000
2.5 million Tom, congratulations. Yeah, you know, that's, that's pretty good. I finally came.

257
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
It was like, I got to get into the blood sports is the only way to make this world.

258
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,080
You must be raking in the dough. Oh, yeah, I have like seven whole dollars in my AdSense.

259
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:59,080
I'm so stuck. Have we talked about how the Sonichu lecture is closing in on 100,000,

260
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,120
not 100,000, closing in on a million. It's about 100,000 away from hitting a million.

261
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,640
It's up here and there, but that should be noted. That's that's pretty amazing. Do you think it's

262
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,760
going to see like, well, let's see like a second wind, right? Like, I think back in the day,

263
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,520
Digi said that like, when his, when his old anime videos hit like a million views,

264
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,440
they would sometimes get like a second wind and get like a new wave of like people watching.

265
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,880
I would be surprised. I mean, that's like an algorithm question. I don't know, man,

266
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,720
I am no fucking expert on this shit. I have no idea what made like my Galco video. My Galco

267
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,560
video had like waves. I think that was just because people would like post it on Tumblr and

268
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,200
they'd be like, oh, let's go watch the video. It wasn't a huge wave, but like the past like two

269
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,640
weeks or so, I don't know why. Like viewership on the Sonichu lecture was like double what it usually

270
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,520
is. I don't know. Just just happened. And then it went kind of just drifted back down against

271
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,320
a normal and yeah, I don't know, man. Let me see. Let me see. How's it doing right now? How's this

272
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,560
shit doing right now? Um, YouTube YouTube studio beta. Show me show me the analytics. Show me.

273
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:08,760
Beta. Okay. Yeah, I went back. It went it's gone back down to about normal. The typical like 1200

274
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,040
views a day or so. Yeah, for a while it was doing like 1900, 1800 a day. I think I think just just

275
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,600
for a very distinct little period there. If Sonichu does something, you know, that that makes them

276
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,200
trend, your video will probably get some. Yeah, Sonichu goes out there. You gotta dig deep. You

277
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,600
gotta go to your last 30 days and then you gotta see where external traffic's coming from. See if

278
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,400
like maybe go post it on Reddit or something. Some traffic increase source. It sounds crazy.

279
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:45,560
And yet there is a Sonichu currently living among us in the real world, right? Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,520
One has crossed over the dimension. One has torn through the dimensional veil and is currently

281
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,760
has come over from C197 and has come over to one to two dimension one two one eight specifically

282
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,120
Well, because well, because you said if Sonichu does something and the thing is there currently is

283
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,880
a Sonichu in our domain. They're not supposed to exist in our dimension. They're from

284
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,680
they're from university one nine seven. But one of them has crossed. Magi Chan Sonichu has crossed

285
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:17,080
the dimensional barrier guys. Magi Chan Sonichu has come but not bodily mentally has entered

286
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,200
the body of Christine Weston Chandler and is currently living. He's possessed right now.

287
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:27,080
And tweet. Yes. Currently living and tweeting in our dimension. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

288
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:35,640
And Sonichu himself. Right now. Is this a possession or is this like a head made multiple

289
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:43,080
system kind of deal? I believe that they have swapped bodies. Yeah, that's right. Whoa. That's

290
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,560
what I heard. Jesus Christ. Well, tomato tomato. It's not the same thing. The result is the same.

291
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,720
If you swap body, that means your mind. Two minds have swapped between bodies.

292
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:02,680
Okay, we understand the idea as in as in Christine is currently in 1218 and and Magi Chan Sonichu

293
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,080
is currently here. And the thing that's scary thing about that is that Magi Chan Sonichu is

294
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,040
all powerful, right? We should we should all be fucking terrified right now because Magi Chan

295
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,800
Sonichu contains within him the ability to bait the fuck up everything. I had heard that

296
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,960
completely obliterate our entire time. But does magic magic and retain that ability in the body

297
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,480
of I heard Magi Chan is having difficulties using his psychic powers in Christine's body.

298
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,000
This is what I heard. You know what? It's it's not out of the realm of possibility that maybe Magi

299
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,840
Chan's power only one of us was a fucking Christian and could dig into this deep for us and do an

300
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,200
addendum to a almost million viewed video. I mean, there's there's no there's no precedent.

301
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,680
There's no precedent for this, right? We are in a bold new era, right? The dimensional merge is

302
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,840
happening and this is its harbinger. It's happening. You know, this is like remember those guys,

303
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,400
those like, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, end times, judgment day guys are like, guys, I'm telling you

304
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,960
like August 8th, 2012, it's happening. That's the date of the apocalypse. I really would. Did you

305
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,440
see did you see the internet historian video because I saw the internet historian? I certainly

306
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,760
did, man. I certainly did. And I was one of my favorite YouTubers in the historian.

307
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Just make such high quality stuff. But in any case, hey, my alarms shout out to internet historian

308
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,960
if he's listening. A big old fat shout out to historian. Give us give us give us a give us a

309
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:36,200
plug. Give us a plug lads. Give us a subscribe to like patron $5 for bonus episodes, you know.

310
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,680
Hey, speaking, speaking of these devil tongues and these devilish activities.

311
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,040
I've got some shit I'm going to write down so I don't forget to mention it.

312
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,080
Okay, go ahead. Write it down. Okay. Well, I've got, I've got a truly devilish

313
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,320
point I wish to raise at some point. Speaking of, we were talking about Satan. We're talking about

314
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,520
hell. We're talking about the dimensional merge and all of these things culminate recently in,

315
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,680
in just, uh, let me say in four simple notes. Da, da, da, da. Yeah.

316
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:18,200
It's in Smash Bros. I saw it. I saw it live. It's really, it's pretty fun. It's so funny

317
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,800
because me and my friend were watching direct together. Well, not together. She was watching

318
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,320
in her house me and we were talking to each other on Discord and you know, I said, you know,

319
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,880
wouldn't it be funny if like sans got announced in Smash? This is as much

320
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I mean people have been nemen about it for over a year now. Yeah. I just like, I was like, imagine

321
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,400
the pandemonium of the internet of sans got announced. I didn't, I said it in the tongue that

322
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,680
I didn't expect it to have Terry Bogart that apparently like South Americans or Mexicans

323
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:54,520
like love obsessively love King of Fighters totally overshadowed by sans and one song mega

324
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,280
Louvania getting into, into the new game. It's, uh, I mean, I don't really know much about Terry,

325
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,800
so I can't really speak on that. He just seems like another kind of boring fighter character.

326
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,680
And that's right. Roast me in the comments. Yeah. I literally don't know anything about

327
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,480
Terry, but where can I marry him? He is a very handsome man. Did you hear the cool, the cool,

328
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,040
the interesting thing? All the Japanese fans of Smash are saying that Terry's just a jacked

329
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Pokemon trainer. Oh, I saw, I saw the meme. I saw the meme and I'm like, Ness is like the

330
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,520
base form than the, the Pokemon trainer is the middle evolution and then Terry is like the

331
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:34,040
final evolution. Do you think that, that Pokemon trainer and Terry walk down, they see each other

332
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:41,800
and they point and they go, same hat. Have you seen, have you seen the, the fatal cutie

333
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,280
fem swapped Terry Bogart? No. Is that a thing? You're about to. So get ready for that. Oh,

334
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,480
is it in the show notes? I'm posting it right now. This is like official art from like one of the

335
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,000
recent games or something. Okay. In gross discussing audio links. Okay. There you go. Okay. That is

336
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,560
awesome. Yeah. Oh, supposed to devolution. All right. It's about what I expected. Yeah. I mean,

337
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,120
it is what it is, but this is, I mean, this should be the one of the, one of the character

338
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,520
model swaps for Terry. That's his echo fighter. Oh, that'd be great. That'd be great.

339
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,720
And Terry's fucking cool though. I hope they do. I hope if you fight, if you fight,

340
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:27,560
fucking Ken, they bring back that SNK toss, fucking legendary. It's so cool. It's so cool.

341
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,040
I heard other people, they're just saying Terry is just Ken with hat and that's, you know,

342
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,840
pretty accurate. Since we were talking about sounds, Toby Fox was like made music for Game

343
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,160
Freak's game. Yeah. Toby Fox is a chat now. Yeah. For Game Freak. What game for Game Freak?

344
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,320
Their new game Town or was it Little Town Hero or the fuck it's called? Yeah, that's the one.

345
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,440
He's making the music for it, which means the music is going to be pretty great. Yeah. And also,

346
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,120
this was another one of the big things. Did you guys fucking hear, you brought me to,

347
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,360
probably did you watch it, that he went to Sakurai's house and he played Smash Bros.

348
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Like he's just become, let's just, let's not forget people. Fucking Undertale Man,

349
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,640
fucking Toby Fox has made one fucking video game. He's made one video game. He made two games.

350
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,600
And as a result, Delta Rune is a demo. It is a demo for a game. It does not count. It's basically

351
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,160
a chapter release of it. Well, then I guess we should count his fucking ROM hack for Earthbound

352
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,040
2, but the point is it's not a complete game. No, that's sort of, that's great. Exactly. He's

353
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,400
okay. I'd say his total games add up to maybe like 1.85 games. Okay, fine. I'm rounding a hard

354
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:45,240
down to one. This fucking guy made one fucking video game. And he's literally like the prince

355
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,000
of the game industry, like Kojima and Sakurai and I don't know. When's he going to get me too?

356
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,360
It's only a matter of time. Toby, he's too private. He doesn't do anything. I don't know. Maybe he

357
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,480
is out there smashing Japanese puts right now. It's, he's just, he's living like the literal

358
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,720
drip. He was making Undertale in fucking Andrew Hussie's basement, literally, and was just living

359
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,680
like a fucking cockroach parasite piece of shit. He makes his fucking demos like the best game

360
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:19,320
demo ever. There's hope for us yet. I just, I can't believe the meteoric rise that this one guy has

361
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,080
had. It's inspiring, honestly. All right. And fucking Hussie has got to be on Suicide Watch right

362
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,520
now. Seeing how Huss out just makes me roll my eyes. This is bullshit. What's bullshit? It's

363
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,640
bullshit. It's all bullshit. Toby Fox? Toby Fox, you know, whatever. So he likes to do a really good

364
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,840
video game idea that everyone loved. Oh, great. Is he so much better than the rest of us? No.

365
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,800
No one's saying he's better. It's just incredible. He's fine. He's fine. Yeah. The dude made a

366
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,240
fucking sick product and he's, yeah, he made a pretty big product. All the accolades for it.

367
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,040
He made a pretty good product. He's living the way you do. Good for him. Good for him.

368
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:03,000
Like, Toby did not, Toby did not predict the mimetic rise of Undertale. It's almost baffling

369
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,280
to me to realize that, like, wow, a lot of these guys have not actually put in the amount of time

370
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,160
or, like, even played Undertale, but they just love the Saiyans' memes and they love, you know,

371
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,200
megalovania and those are crazy popular memes and stuff. It's weird for me to think that these

372
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,080
people don't actually appreciate the actual game as much as they should, but it is like one of the

373
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:29,000
better. It's still. Normies don't appreciate art. It do be like that sometimes. It do. It truly do,

374
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,480
but the megalovania is in Smash Bros. I cannot fucking believe it. Its original usage was in

375
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,600
the ROM hack as the final boss theme of his, like, Halloween earthbound fucking thing. It's all, like,

376
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,480
all comes back. It started with Nintendo, ended with Nintendo. It's incredible. It's fucking

377
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,360
incredible. What a journey. What a legend. What a god. What an inspiration. I feel supreme jealousy

378
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:03,640
and I also feel. I'm happy for him. I'm genuinely happy for him. Let's end Nintendo. Let's get,

379
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:12,840
like, Sakurai and Kojima. Let's put them in Toby's shoes and see what they can make in his

380
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,480
shoes, right? Like, let's take our big developers that have, like, a big corporate backing behind

381
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,120
them, you know, obliterate them and put them in Andrew Hussie's basement and say, all right,

382
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,680
what can you do? Huh? Well, you just gotta go back to their early career. That's a fair question.

383
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,160
Toby, I mean, look at the, like, everything in Undertale is extremely simple. Like, the gameplay,

384
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,240
it's just like moving around a keyboard. It obviously doesn't look amazing. I mean, the art's good

385
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,200
for what it is, but it's a very, obviously, you know, the product of a couple of people. It was

386
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,800
styled back and scaled to be appropriate for the man. It's just that the ideas that he did work

387
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,640
with, like the whole resetting, remembering things that happen, like the different timelines, the

388
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,800
amazing way that you can write with genocide or pacifist or whatever. That's all you need. Like,

389
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,720
that's the good shit. That's that's the shit that makes it. It had a great hook that the rest of the

390
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:06,840
game never quite lived up to. I disagree. But the time the time shenanigans were never quite as good

391
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:13,400
as they were in the Toriel fight. I agree. That was the purest concentration. Is this a hot take

392
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,160
that I feel like the Toriel fight promised more to, like, sort of implied that there would be more

393
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,040
to the timelines thing later on and it never really even got as good as that ever again?

394
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,840
You know, Ben, I would totally agree that within within like the demo, the Toriel demo,

395
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:36,120
like it is like basically it's the perfect packaged way to show off how that mechanic works.

396
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,760
And like so it's true, like the game is so much longer. It's the single best instance of it.

397
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,000
It's because like you're not that far in a game that you wouldn't feel sorry about resetting the

398
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,760
game. You know, like once you're further in the game, I might as well stick with what I have.

399
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,520
Well, it just takes more commitment. Well, another thing I played that game like five times.

400
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,440
Another thing to keep in mind with this is that like the Toriel fight was the demo and that was

401
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,040
like what like a year removed from the full game. So you play through the demo and you have like

402
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,720
365 days of being excited for this game and imagining all the ways it could make you could

403
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,920
play with this concept. But I feel like if there was no undertale demo, I don't think the Toriel

404
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,760
fight would be as impact not as impactful, but like it wouldn't be such a huge like schism,

405
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,680
you know, it would just be another part of the game. I think giving that year to just kind of

406
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,440
ruminate on what that implied for the rest of the game makes it stand out for that.

407
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,120
If you if we'd been given the whole game, we would not appreciate the Toriel bit as much.

408
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,160
I never played the demo despite vents and systems at that point.

409
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,600
I did. Yeah, I had that. My friend showed me the demo a couple months, a couple months before

410
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,520
the game itself came out, and I was pretty excited about it. Yeah, like,

411
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,520
yeah, that bit like, I mean, maybe, maybe it is, I think it did because because it was just a demo,

412
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,800
like you had the chance to like play it through a couple times and it was short. And like, yeah,

413
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,240
you got to experience like, oh my god, this this, it like it under it knows what's going on

414
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,000
of it, like adjust and like it knows what you're going to do. And it is like dynamic, dynamically

415
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,640
responds to your fucking around with the save states. That's pretty neat. And then in the real

416
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,560
game, it's like, yeah, we did it once. Well, okay, that that's where you're exaggerating a bit,

417
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,080
because I don't think I am. Well, well, a little bit late. Like, there are a couple of moments

418
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,600
when the game will be aware that like you previously saved and had a game over and restarted.

419
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,440
Well, I totally agree. That's the same gimmick again. Basically, everything that happens between

420
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,880
the toriel thing and the very end, when you do all the finale stuff, kind of doesn't really matter

421
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,200
towards this particular point of the resetting stuff. And it's all funny and humor, blah, blah,

422
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,800
blah. But on this point, which we all know is the best part of Undertale, mechanically and like

423
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,000
story wise and whatnot and game design wise. The it's the fact that you can do these pacifist

424
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,320
and genocide endings. And like that only in very specific ones do you get the ultimate super epic

425
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,640
boss fight against sans. And then that's doing the genocide ending. That's not that innovative.

426
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,640
That's not the end of my point, though, because the end of the point is that even after doing

427
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,200
the genocide ending, and you literally destroy the world and whatnot, you can't I mean, I talk

428
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,280
about this in my in my undertale video. But I'm just restating the point from that. But it's that

429
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,200
you can do that ending. We know the game is teaching us there have been consequences to our

430
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,280
actions and everything, including the toriel thing at the beginning. And you do genocide,

431
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,600
you destroy the world. But then the game gives you the ability to reset. It's that whole thing.

432
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,320
And then you play through the game again, you can do a pacifist ending. But your but that's when

433
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,680
you get the true final thing is after that extra play through, when it turns out the char is still

434
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,840
evil. It's like, oh, it's making a larger point. I get yes. Okay, okay, I guess I guess it's true

435
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,880
that that is sort of the same thing on the scale of the entire game. And that is pretty cool.

436
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,960
But I agree. That's over like a 20 30 hour experience as opposed to like a one hour experience.

437
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,600
But I mean, it's the amount of content what you're just you're what you're describing is literally

438
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,720
like the addition of like a two second moment. I don't think it's a good moment. It's a really

439
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,280
good moment. I think that's the point though. It's it takes that entire slow burn of playing

440
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,600
the game multiple times to like have that hit home. You're like, oh, okay, I mean, I don't think

441
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,000
that that's how I mean, that is a great thing. It is a great moment in the game. And it talked to you

442
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,320
when you did when you were recording the game, you did you were recording or it's like, haha,

443
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,040
look at those fools watching your recording. You're no better than playing the game. Yeah.

444
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,360
There were those bits about like, even the people who watch let's plays and stuff, they're just as

445
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,360
bad. They're just for years to the side. Yeah, okay. I mean, that's not cool. That's a different

446
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,680
point. Yeah. And it's funny. And it's but it's not like it doesn't blow my mind or anything like that

447
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:51,080
point. I haven't seen it done before. And I like when I think it's fair to say that Undertale,

448
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,760
the whole game, the tutorial, it's I absolutely agree. Ben, everyone should have played the

449
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,640
tutorial. The peak experience is I think what you and I had playing the playing the tutorial

450
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,120
ruminating on it for months, then playing the full game with that in mind, because people who

451
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:09,400
just play the game now, they like almost nobody is going to actually do the reset stuff with Toriel

452
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:17,160
when they first play the tutorial, the tutorial. Oh, my God. Oh, fucking. Are you fucking seething

453
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,560
me right now? I can't believe I never saw this connection. Okay, guys, you're joking, right?

454
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:33,400
Yeah. No, no, no, no, I never joke. All right. Well, in any case, I think that it like

455
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,000
homestuck back in the day. God, it was a pun. God, it was a pun all along. Oh, my God.

456
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I think time travel did currently as I exist now time travel did more with or sorry,

457
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,160
homestuck did more with time travel than I've ever seen in any other medium. And so it's the

458
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:55,160
pinnacle of like time travel stories. And I think that Undertale, I'm sure someone could do it better,

459
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,880
you know, eventually, I think it's the pinnacle of like meta narrative in video games using like

460
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,240
mechanics and stuff. It's that's my I think it's the best example so far. Yeah, that's all I'm saying.

461
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm not saying it's the best that could ever be. But I mean, best I know I haven't read House of

462
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,160
Leaves. I do want to do that. That could be it. I could maybe I don't know. It looks pretty good.

463
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,920
I guess you could cheat and say that we're only talking about video games, but fuck that.

464
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,880
Let's talk about all mediums. All mediums. I never played the Doki Doki leadership glove,

465
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,880
but it has that sort of shenanigans, doesn't it? One day I'll do that maybe. It's supposed to be

466
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,840
pretty amazing. Like you edit like the actual data files. I mean, that's just programming. But

467
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,520
if they make it part of the gameplay, that's that's pretty cool. That's pretty impressive.

468
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,600
Well, there you go. Sans is in Undertale and also in Smash Brothers. What do you know?

469
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,840
Dimensional Merge is upon us, ladies and gentlemen. This is evidence.

470
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,480
Have you guys heard like a really stupid, not even a theory, but a comparison,

471
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,840
how Sans just looks like Steven Universe without the skin?

472
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:04,760
I mean, he also looks like Ness. I've seen the thing that's like actually

473
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,480
Steven with his new pink jacket from the movie. If you just make that blue,

474
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,800
he looks even more like Sans now, who's been wearing a jacket the whole time.

475
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,080
Speaking of Steven and Sam. The time lines are slowly coming together.

476
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,040
Yeah, speaking of Steven. New movie, new movie. I want to discuss the new movie.

477
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,640
Sure. Me and Tom have seen it, so I'm happy to talk about it.

478
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,000
Sorry, sorry, Ben. You just had to watch it. Ben, just go download the movie,

479
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,880
watch it on like seven X speed and like half like three you can jump in.

480
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,360
I've got my own shit to say. You fucking cowards.

481
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,880
We'll go on, Mage. What did you think?

482
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,400
I didn't know what to expect when I went into the movie. All I knew about the movie

483
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,480
and when I went in was like, Steven has a neck. That's all. That's all the spoilers I got.

484
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,800
Indeed. That's some real character development right there.

485
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,960
Yeah. And then like when I saw, I saw immediately like, you know,

486
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,440
those pastel colors on Steven, I was like, oh, I wonder, I wonder how long is it going to take

487
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,040
Yeah, excuse me.

488
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,920
How long is it going to take for Internet to be like, oh, look at the trans colors on Steven.

489
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,840
Steven does say trans rights. This is his only line in the film.

490
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,080
Well, now I got a fucking watch.

491
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm not against the idea or anything. It's just like, oh, those are pretty good.

492
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,160
For people who hate trans, I'll just give you an out. It's also a fact that the four colors

493
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,400
he's wearing do reflect the colors of the diamond authority. So there's your out if you want.

494
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,880
Like, no, no, no, it's not trans. It's, uh, yeah.

495
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,560
That just means the diamond authority is trans.

496
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,440
Thanks, God.

497
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,000
But yeah, so and I watched it. It was a musical and but they were like,

498
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,960
Sure was talking.

499
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,320
I did like a few of the again, like the villain song is one of the best songs and any

500
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,840
Which one? Which one? There's several.

501
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,360
Both all of them.

502
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,080
I mean, you could mean other friends or you could mean drift away, etc, etc.

503
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,840
I like both of them. Those are the way two songs that I really like. I guess I like

504
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,600
Okay, no, I'm a little bit torn on that song that he sang at the beginning and at the end with the

505
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,040
We adore you. You're not hurt. We know you're not hurt.

506
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:29,800
Whatever comes my way because as long as I can say here I am in the future with my friends.

507
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,760
Yeah, I completely forgot that song.

508
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,440
And I mean, like all of them are pretty okay songs. They're not they're not bad or anything.

509
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,160
I remember some of them better than others.

510
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,640
Just with a lot of Steven songs. I'm probably going to get fly for this, but I don't like

511
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:54,200
most of the Steven Universe songs. I agree. I like one or two of them that were more like

512
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,120
better sang, but like most of them are just like what like Steven on a ukulele or something. I don't

513
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,800
know. That's interesting. I didn't like most of the songs, but like in this in this in this movie,

514
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,400
they're pretty good. I like them. They're nice. I like I like Pearl's explanation song. I don't

515
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,520
know what it's called, but it's kind of fun. It's got like a long like pearl boot.exe name or something.

516
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:22,520
It's pretty funny. Yeah. It's just it was it was quite cute. Something is clearly wrong. I love the

517
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:29,320
animation at that time. Yeah. Yeah. It was really fun. When I saw a spinel with how with her rubber

518
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,960
hose animation. I bet you love. I bet you nutted instantly when you saw a spinel. Why is the air

519
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,240
going crazy for some spinel? Okay, that's that's the thing because as soon as I saw a spinel,

520
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,400
I was like, Oh, the internet is going to eat her up. She has that she has that, you know,

521
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,720
Oh, she could be your angle or your devil. We like we like old animations. We like rubber

522
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,960
hose. We like Cuphead and stuff like that. I knew I knew the internet is going to eat her up.

523
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,320
And it did. And like, I don't have a problem with it. But it's just like,

524
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:07,000
I don't want to say it's better because but it like it felt weird to see her so animated in

525
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,520
comparison to everyone else being all a rubber hosie and stretchy and stuff. And I know that's

526
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,800
her shtick, but it's just so weird to see her like that. Like, so she's in, you know, that sort

527
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,760
of job and just like, are all spinels meant to be like rubber hosie little psychic character

528
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,560
things. Presumably, presumably, we don't see any others. But yeah, it's yeah, it's just I just

529
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,760
I just like spinel because I'm like, Oh, the Steven Universe staff can actually animate good.

530
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,880
I mean, I'm sure you guys heard, I loved the balloon inflating and deflating sound effects

531
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:46,440
as she stretched. There was so much soul so much soul in that animation. I did I did end up liking

532
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,760
her. I thought I wasn't going to like her initially. When I saw her, I thought she was going to be

533
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,040
super annoying. But no, she's fine. I liked her. And she had her I mean, even to the characters,

534
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,480
she was rather annoying to I mean, intentionally sell. Yeah, but there's a but there's like

535
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:07,400
annoying for a purpose like within within reason in the show and like just being so annoying that

536
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,120
you feel the annoyed rather than like you understand that never really. Yeah, she never

537
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,440
did. She she's good. I like her. And then like her backstory and the song just like, Oh, that's

538
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:24,440
sad. I like I like this. This is really sad. But yeah, well, hey, if I can give my yeah, go ahead.

539
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:33,720
I'm done. I this was one of my favorite movies I've seen in a million years. This was like a

540
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:42,040
nine to a 10 for me. I fucking loved this movie. Not every song was like a perfect 10 or anything.

541
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:48,760
I love this movie so I watched this movie like maybe four or five times all in all. I spent like

542
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:56,280
a day in meditation at my deep feelings about the the issues at play in this children's cartoon,

543
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,560
which are incredibly poignant to the issues of today. And I recorded a we Agua that is currently

544
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,920
being edited about this exact movie and will be out by the time people hear this. I love this

545
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:15,080
fucking movie. I love spinel. I love the usage of I mean pink diamond piece of shit, but like

546
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,200
great usage of her character. Because if I can just spoil just one of the themes of the movie,

547
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,760
the theme here is about family. Okay, it's about family. It's about family. What happens when

548
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,320
okay, like Steve, this movie takes place. It's Steven and it's all the kids like the song is

549
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,240
about like happily ever after never ends. That's like the opening. They're in there happily ever

550
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:41,240
after they've solved all problems. A racism has dropped to zero. We did it, you guys. And all

551
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:48,840
of a sudden, so life is perfect. But spinel spinel was an old friend of pink diamonds who got left

552
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,960
behind. I won't go into how you should go watch the fucking movie and watch all of Steven Universe,

553
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,800
which is unequivocally gone down in history as one of my favorite shows of all time. I just

554
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,680
I love everything about okay, I don't love everything about it, but it just overall it is

555
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,840
one of the greatest shows I've ever seen and I go back to watch it all the time. But okay, back

556
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:17,240
on the point. The theme here happily ever after happened, but spinel was literally not included

557
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,920
in everyone else's happiness. Everyone in the world got a happy ever after, but spinel was

558
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:30,040
forgotten and left behind. And so she comes back full school shooter. And this to me is exactly

559
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,400
like one of the most important issues. Just like when Sonichu didn't accept the CPU goddesses and

560
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,560
decided to shoot up the mall, the Charlottesville mall. Did that happen recently? Yes, Sonichu did

561
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,840
that. Listen, wait for my lecture. Okay, okay, I'll get into it. I mean, everything about it,

562
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,160
like to me, it felt very obvious that this movie was kind of about the exact, it's not literally

563
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,560
about a school shooter, but it's about those feelings that those people have, like when you

564
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,720
don't fit in, when you're bullied, when you're not appreciated by the people around you, when

565
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:08,280
everyone else seems happy, but you're left behind. And spinel is quite clear. She's like,

566
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,240
I came here to do violence against strangers because I hate the world now. This is just exactly

567
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:21,640
the kind of thing that we're seeing. And I thought it was packaged so poignantly, so beautifully.

568
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,320
And the song Drift Away, I feel like the song Drift Away is the kind of song I could feel myself

569
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,920
committing suicide to. I want to make a suicide playlist. I think I've said this before. But this

570
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,960
100% qualifies as a song that you want. I almost felt like it was taking me to like a dark place

571
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,640
because the movie has, I'm not joking, the movie has a happy ending. But for whatever reason,

572
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,000
the strongest feelings in the movie are the lowest point where we learn spinel's backstory

573
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,280
and she sings the song. I listened to that song over and over and over again. And I felt myself

574
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:04,360
like drifting into a dark place with the character. And this is why I spent like a whole day like

575
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,080
meditating on it. And then like I kind of had to force myself like, no, Nate, like it's okay,

576
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:14,280
like things are good. It's not all bad. Like I wanted to say like- Were you getting radicalized?

577
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,160
I was getting hardcore radicalized against Pink Diamond and I wanted to murder her and her whole

578
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:26,520
family. But then I kind of had to jolt myself out of it like, no, the world is not an all bad place.

579
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,640
Pink Diamond, you know, there are actually kind of reasons that aren't just pure malignancy

580
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,400
in what resulted in basically a torturous life for spinel. There are reasons that are just maybe

581
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,160
more carelessness or immaturity. You shouldn't say that like everything's bad, because one person

582
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,920
did something that ended up hurting you really, really bad. And it really affected me in a deep,

583
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,280
deep way. And it kind of was a little bit too strong for me and I couldn't handle it. So I had to just-

584
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,560
Okay, I guess I gotta watch this movie now. I feel bad even over hyping it.

585
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,320
I guess I gotta go get my own opinion, huh? I had zero hype going into this movie and I saw

586
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,600
Spinal and I thought like, oh, this is going to be shit. I was so blown away by how much I love

587
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:14,360
this fucking movie and, frankly, how much I love Steven Universe overall. Right now, it's making

588
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,240
me emotional just thinking about like taking a journey with these characters and seeing how happy

589
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,120
things end up and how they bring up issues like this. Like, Steven, at the end, he's like,

590
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,200
nah, happily ever after, like, it's a lie was kind of his point. Like, there will always be more work

591
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:34,120
to do. We've always got to help people. All this time you were pretending so much for my happy ending.

592
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:39,640
Exactly it. But I, you know, I don't want to go on too long. It just, it made me feel so many things.

593
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,000
It's interesting because like, I'm curious to see your, uh, your Viagra you're going to do on this

594
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,320
because the movie for me was like a seven, maybe? A seven. Well, I think that like, I mean, if you

595
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,480
look at like the kind of thing, this appeals, some things just hit your strike zone, you know?

596
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:01,480
Yeah. And like having a movie like this, which it's, it's almost like, it's like a, a movie about

597
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:07,880
like the kid who was bullied in school who like didn't find happiness and like decided to do

598
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:13,000
terrible things. But instead of like painting that guy is like purely evil, it like tries to

599
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,920
understand why they feel that way. And even the people who made them feel that way, they have

600
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,840
some reasons for what they did. A lot of people are saying Pink Diamond's like pure evil. I think

601
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,200
that's an exaggeration. No, I don't think Pink Diamond is evil. I think the great thing about

602
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:29,320
the movie, I think the themes are the strongest part for sure. And like Steven Universe has always

603
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,200
been pretty good at painting everybody in shades of gray. Like there's no like hardcore villain,

604
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,520
you know, that's why everybody can get redeemed pretty much because there's possibly too much so.

605
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,880
But yeah, yeah, possibly to its detriment at some degree, but like it's, it's, it's playing,

606
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,280
it's playing to its thematic messaging and it sticks to it, you know, through hell or high

607
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:54,600
water is that everybody has like some nuance to them. And that's cool. Spinell was great.

608
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,040
I really liked Spinell's like arc and like what they did with her and all that kind of stuff.

609
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,440
And like, it was a good way of like leveraging more of like getting to know Pink Diamond and

610
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,400
I guess maybe it's like a personal thing for me because the movie does like one of the things

611
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,440
that I just is like a personal pet peeve and fiction is when like they do something to the

612
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,080
characters that you know is temporary and is definitely going to be reverse. So you have

613
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,280
to sit there and wait for it to go back to normal because like, I mean, that, that is the plot of

614
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,440
the movie. 100%. It's like the plot of the first half of the movie. They cut because like I was

615
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,080
afraid that it was going to do it the entire movie because like spoilers for anybody who hasn't

616
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:36,520
watched like go watch it. It is worth watching. But in the beginning of the movie, Spinell has

617
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:42,520
this weapon that resets a gem to factory settings, essentially. She hard resets everybody. So Steven

618
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,160
loses all of his control of his powers and all the gems go back to like stock versions of the

619
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,800
gems without any of their character development. Like they don't know who each other is and shit.

620
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,720
And like, you know, immediately this isn't going to stick. And like that's like, I don't know,

621
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,880
for some reason, when when movies do that or narratives do that, I'm like, now I just got

622
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,840
to slog through like shenanigans until we get back to the inevitable end state of like, you know,

623
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,760
like there's so many songs. There's only so many songs I can take about how much Ruby and Sapphire

624
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,360
love each other. Right. Like I when when that was initially revealed during the season three

625
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:21,960
finale or whatever, that was like the highlight of the show. What was it stronger than you?

626
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,560
Yeah, it took the internet by storm. It was a huge big fucking deal because it was as fuck.

627
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,240
But how many times do we need to have an episode about yeah. So and like so that section, honestly,

628
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,960
their thing was kind of the most boring. Seeing Pearl reverted to factory settings settings

629
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,560
was was kind of more interesting because we haven't seen her that way right really before.

630
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,840
I mean, that was probably the coolest part of that section. But I just feel like that whole

631
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,280
section didn't do a lot for the overall narrative because like we're talking about this like whole

632
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,800
arc with Spinell and everything. I mean, I totally agree. And I think even her just being there and

633
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,720
trying to like fuck up the planet again was enough to be like, Yeah, my happy endings ruined. We

634
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,280
didn't need to kill all this. Here's my case for that. On the one hand, I totally agree with your

635
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,080
points. That makes makes perfect sense. And I agree. Like they absolutely retreaded old ground

636
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,080
for the sake of like, I mean, okay, this is a movie. It's been like, I don't know,

637
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,320
maybe like a year since there's been Steven Universe stuff. I felt like it was like they did

638
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,440
it to kind of establish the characters for people. Yeah, I think especially if people are probably

639
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,360
going to jump into a movie before watching like five seasons of a show, that's something that I'm

640
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,520
sure a decent number of people could do. And if you haven't watched any Steven Universe, I would

641
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,840
recommend you don't do that. And instead, you just watch the whole show, then watch the movie.

642
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,080
But if you only got two hours and you're going to die, okay, then go watch the movie. That's,

643
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,000
that's fine. Don't make peace with your family or anything. Just watch Steven. Yeah, just watch

644
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,920
this movie. There was a utility though, even has a suicide song in there. If you want to end it,

645
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,880
like it does have a suicide song. No doubt. Here's here's the reason why I think that was a good

646
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,760
usage in part because I still agree with your point. It was redundant for a lot of it. And we

647
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,480
got to see fresh things like Amethyst being reverted. We never seen her when she was first born.

648
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,200
She does this like gimmick where she just repeats things. She's got like a blank brain basically.

649
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:11,720
And I mean, that was that amazing payoff to that where like they do a song that's based on the

650
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,600
gimmick of repeating after me, which is like that was like, I loved that touch. I thought that was

651
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:21,960
so clever and such a genius way to like do that little progression for her. And then like Pearl

652
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,200
is like a robot. She's just being like a servant. She gets like a new master with Greg. All great.

653
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:34,040
Okay, but the utility in like going over the love, because like the way that they get their memories

654
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:40,120
back is they relive their experiences together. So like Steven needs to, you know, show Amethyst

655
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,400
a fun time. They need to go do the activities they like to do. And that'll like help her remember.

656
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,480
They do their secret handshake. That helps her. Pearl, they need to like show, they need to like

657
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,320
reproduce Pearl's plot development. So she realized she can be free and be her own person.

658
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,360
Doesn't need to just be a slave or whatever. Like her turning point sort of wasn't Rose Quartz.

659
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,960
It was her own freedom, so to speak. Yeah, that's true. The absence of a master ultimately what

660
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,000
did it. But and then like Garnett is the same thing. But like what the point I see to this,

661
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,280
the reason why I like all of that was because in all these scenes, in every single scene where we

662
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,920
see Pearl doing things and like Amethyst doing things with Steven, like reliving the moment,

663
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,960
it's like we feel how much love Steven has for Amethyst and Pearl and Garnett and you know Ruby

664
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,880
and Sapphire. That's so apparent to us. And it makes me reflect thinking back I did not like

665
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,640
Amethyst very much at first. I love Amethyst now. I've become such a fan of all these characters.

666
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,440
Okay, but the point of this is we as the viewer and Steven himself love and have a huge attachment

667
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,760
to these characters. So we feel that viscerally when we're trying to restore them to their memories.

668
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,280
But that entire time, Spinell, who's been reverted to her like happy go lucky, you know,

669
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:01,880
retarded, mildly annoying self, she is in she's literally third wheeling the entire time and

670
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:08,120
you can feel Steven doesn't really want her around. The contrast is so clear between how much Steven

671
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:13,480
cares about like Amethyst, for example, versus not wanting to have to bother with Spinell. It's

672
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:19,080
just a story about that annoying kid who's not terrible, but is hanging out with you anyway and

673
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,160
you don't really want them around. And this comes to like the final though the head during the the

674
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,920
song or whatever, where Spinell really recognized like, Oh, wow, Steven likes them way more than me,

675
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,440
which is exactly the problem that she had with pink, pink diamond. So like there was a utility.

676
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:40,120
No, definitely that I thought was enjoyable on its own anyway. Totally. And that that that definitely

677
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:45,240
it served a purpose and like for Splinell setting up like the fact like, Oh, I don't, I'm not cared

678
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,800
for in the way that these people are. And like, it's just like, I'm history is essentially repeating

679
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:55,240
itself, you know, exactly. I could see people. I just personally because that that certain plot

680
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,680
element drives me up a wall, I would rather they've done it a different way. Well, that's

681
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,080
understandable. So the other thing that I kind of, I don't want to say had an issue with it,

682
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,800
but it's kind of confused, not even confused about, but just like kind of shrugging at was the end of

683
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,640
the movie, the way the way they resolved the conflict with Spinell is that like, like, like

684
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:19,400
super big spoiler, this is the end of the movie is that she goes back with the diamonds and goes

685
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,240
back to homeworld and hangs out with them. And the diamonds are like, Oh, like you remind us of

686
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,520
pink, because the whole reason the movie starts with them wanting Steven to stay on homeworld,

687
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:35,800
because you're pink and we miss pink and we fetishize pink, I guess, and stay with us. And

688
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,440
the end of the movie is that Spinell serves that same purpose. So she goes back and like,

689
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,040
they are guests are going to fetishize her. And so she can have friends now. And it's just like,

690
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,520
not only the diamonds, like, like, that's not really healthy, you know, like fetishizing someone

691
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,680
who's dead like that. Because like, the whole point of the movie is talking about how like,

692
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,920
there is no happily ever after and like, things are always changing and you have to move on.

693
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,240
And like the diamonds don't move on, they never have and they assumedly now never will,

694
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,880
because they're just going to project all of their musings and desires for pink.

695
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:13,000
In their own song, they repeat as if they're trying to convince themselves the line like,

696
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,480
Yes, we know that you're not her. But like, it's fucking weird to convince us that they think that.

697
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:25,480
But I'm a little skeptical if they really believe. So that's the thing. I agree. The ending and a

698
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,560
lot a lot of the movie, honestly, like was it it was this easy to heal Spinell's wound and like

699
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:35,080
make or not a school shooter anymore? Like, I mean, there's some logic to that. But the overall

700
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:40,600
thing that a lot of people are criticized Steven Universe for and me too, is that it's it is a

701
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:48,680
supremely optimistic version of everything. This movie sounds really strange. It is interesting.

702
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:55,000
And I love it personally. But you should definitely watch it. I wish I watched this movie.

703
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,440
Well, it's not too late, even though you know everything that happens.

704
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,640
If you want to link, I got one. I'm so confused. Okay, I'll figure it out. I'll have to go figure

705
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,800
it out. What can I do? What can I do about this problem of having? I think I think it's I think

706
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,400
we need I think Ben needs to watch this movie and we need to have Steven Fornevers.

707
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,720
Oh, well, this is kind of it right now. I don't know if we should do another one.

708
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:22,200
I mean, then make a separate episode next episode. I have some opinions about your guys

709
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,160
opinions about this movie. Ben, just just watch the movie as soon as we're done and then send

710
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:33,240
me like a five minute take of your thoughts and I'll splice it in right here. All right. Future

711
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:43,240
Ben here. I watched it. I watched Steven Universe movie at 1.2 times speed. I guess I liked it.

712
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,320
The music was pretty good. Didn't like that one song, the truth, the garnet song,

713
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:57,560
didn't like basically anything to do with like the gems reverting and coming back,

714
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,880
getting them back. Oh, we got to we got to make them remember. Garnet remembering doesn't make

715
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,600
any sense. It doesn't make any sense. That part's terrible. I wish that weren't like half the movie.

716
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:14,040
Whatever. Teen Steven's cool. Fusing with his dad. Yeah, it's weird, but it's true that the

717
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,840
messaging about fusion has been inconsistent. So whatever. I don't know why I don't know why

718
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:25,480
Steven Greg fusion is like ripped because like they're both fat. So why is a fusion of them ripped?

719
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:32,120
I don't know. Whatever. Best part of the movie hands down. I mean, I mean, it's all about

720
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,560
Spinal. Spinal? Fuck, how do they say it? It's all about Spinal. It's all about evil Spinal

721
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,200
chewing the scenery, mugging for the camera, doing cool poses and looking awesome and doing

722
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:47,400
cool fights and those like those like two scenes that you can tell are animated by like an anime

723
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:53,800
studio that look fucking awesome. They're so fucking cool. Holy shit. And the ending's the

724
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,680
ending's dumb. The ending about they take they take pink they take Spinal back and they like,

725
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,480
oh, we'll love you instead. It's dumb. But I mean, the diamonds are all dumb. They've always been

726
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:10,920
terrible. Nobody likes the diamonds. So whatever. Nothing is ruined. It's contrived in the end.

727
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,080
Whatever. Is the earth fucked? Seems like the earth's like fuck. I don't know. She injected

728
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,240
the whole thing of poison. It was supposed to kill the entire earth. I don't know why they're so

729
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:27,960
fucking calm that whole time. It's just about Spinal. It's just about her cool faces. So fucking

730
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:36,280
evil. So fucking sick. All right. Yeah, go watch it. Fuck. Maybe I will. Maybe I just fucking will.

731
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:42,280
Hey, last point though about the the the other thing that seems okay. Like they once there was

732
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,240
one thought I had about the ending too, which is just like, so as you said, at the beginning,

733
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,760
they want Steven. Okay, Steven, at the end of season five, they're like, Steven, you're pink. We want

734
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,120
you back because you're pink. Like sure, you're weird now and you're a little fat boy. It doesn't

735
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,560
matter. You're pink. It's like they they were it's understood to be that like they understand at

736
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:07,160
the end because like some crazy shit happens. Pink is gone. Steven is here to stay that like

737
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,440
Steven is not pink anymore. But he kind of is. I mean, it's her son. It's at the very least,

738
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,680
it's pink son. So that's a pretty big connection. So you can see why they'd want Steven around.

739
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:23,080
I think I think more to the point is that like diamonds don't reproduce like humans do. So from

740
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,160
their perspective, this is still pink. Like that was the whole point in the beginning. And I you

741
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,920
know, sure, like you can't really reframe their understanding. That's pinks diamond. That's pinks

742
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,720
gem. Like you can't change who you are from their entire cultural perspective. Like that is still

743
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,520
pink. And so and that's totally understandable. Right. But like so like my point is like, once

744
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,320
they accept, even if they accept that Steven isn't pink anymore, and that he's like different,

745
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:54,040
there's still a very strong connection there. Spinell, on the other hand, is just like a friend

746
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,280
of pinks, basically. But they're and yes, she's very simple. Like she's designed to look like pink

747
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,560
with like the poofy pants. And she's fun. And it seems like they're almost too willing to accept

748
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,360
this as a replacement for Steven. And they just like leave as soon as they've got Spinell. That

749
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:14,040
seems okay, again, especially considering they showed up to stay with Steven on earth. Yeah,

750
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:20,600
but then they were like, well, I guess we have this facsimile of pink now. So they were willing

751
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:27,160
to stay in a place where they really didn't like just everyone wants to suck Steven's cock. So

752
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,720
this is literally like that that way. Wait, speaking of Steven sucking cock, can we talk

753
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:37,240
about how we gem fucked his dad in this episode? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know that he had two

754
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:45,640
dicks. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah. So Steven and Greg fuse and become a four armed pompadour

755
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:52,840
guitar wielding madman to guitar wielding. Yeah, who seduces Pearl essentially and wakes her up

756
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:58,840
from her, her reset status. And it was very fucking strange. It was pretty sick. Because like,

757
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:05,240
because like, again, the show has like, made it pretty clear that that fusion is a metaphor for

758
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,480
like relationships and possibly sex. They're just going back and forth on this. There's no

759
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:15,640
consistency. So some people say he's just love and they could be like, I don't know paternal.

760
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,880
All right, all right, that's that's a slippery slope argument right there. I don't know how to

761
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:28,200
they code it so hard in some episodes, but then they don't at all. And when's when's Connie,

762
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,720
Steven and Greg going to fuse into a crazy monster? I mean, now we I mean, we've long

763
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:38,920
known you could fuse every being in existence, you know, all of the city fuses into the ultimate

764
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:44,440
life form. Yeah, go for it. Why not? That's what God is. I don't know. Oh, it's like, oh, it's like

765
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:49,960
a Madoka Magica moment where like, it turns out that what God is is all life form fused into one

766
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:56,120
being who then go like does things retroactively through time to control things from the future.

767
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,280
I'm just saying it's possible. That's what Madoka Magica. There's enough anime influence

768
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:05,800
in Steven Universe to make that possible. That's true. That's true. Okay, well, here's the thing.

769
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:11,160
Is this the end of Steven Universe? Like season six is I believe confirmed. And it is one more

770
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:16,520
season. I think it should have ended it with this movie. It would have been a perfect ending. I think

771
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,800
you're right because I anything more at this point does seem it's downhill. Redone baby 100%.

772
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:28,360
Speaking of season's ending, just quickly question. Have you guys seen My Little Pony ended?

773
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,760
Is it over? Did the final episode actually air? Yeah, I saw the I saw some gifts of the of the final

774
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,240
Nate spoiled it like a week ago in the chat. I didn't mean to. I thought it well. I thought I was

775
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,920
scrolling through the chat and you're like, Oh, this is the ending. And you put in a spoiler

776
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,800
tag. I'm like, that's considerate. And they're like, actually, fuck it. Here we go. I'm like,

777
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:52,600
because I thought no one cared. I can't box. Twilight looks so I have seven seasons to go. God

778
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:59,320
damn it. Not really. Like five. I got a ways to go. You know what? I do want to watch it. I might

779
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:04,040
skip every episode up to that point. But I do want to watch it. It seems to be very similar like

780
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,240
one episode like the very final episode. It's like it is a time to get forward. So you might as

781
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,000
well just watch that one. Is it really? That's exactly it. Like the kind of the story,

782
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,080
spoilers, by the way, for MLP for the seven people who care.

783
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,640
I mean, I kind of care. I just I, I spoil, I stumbled upon them and I was like, yeah,

784
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,720
all right, that's fine. I was doing so good. I dodged everything on Twitter. And I was like,

785
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:30,440
all right, I can watch some point of my leisure. But no, Nate comes in, ruins. So sorry.

786
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:39,080
Twilight is fucked. Twilight is a fucking Celestia sized horse with a big glowy mane,

787
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:43,160
but it looks like shit because she still has like the same kind of haircut. And it doesn't

788
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,760
look very good. It doesn't look very good. She was not designed to be this way. Implication,

789
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,080
that, uh, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are gay together. That does seem to be the implication.

790
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,720
What? It kind of seems, it kind of, it's kind of implied. It kind of seems like maybe Fluttershy

791
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:00,920
and Discord. Oh yeah. Which I hate that. Definitely. They tell me Rare Jack's not canon. I hate this

792
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,760
show. It's not canon, dude. It's not canon. No, no, I'm done. I'm done. There's too, there's too

793
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,400
many hints dropped throughout the entire show. Pinkie Pie and Cheesy Jean Sandwich. Oh yeah,

794
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:16,360
that's such a show. They're fucking, they had a kid. Oh my God. They had a kid and it just looks

795
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:21,080
like fucking curly hair Fluttershy. Yeah, I was going to say like the, like the one image I saw was

796
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:25,400
like a fucking nightmare. I don't want to watch it at all. No, it's fine. The image I got spoiled

797
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:30,440
was like with all of them together. And I saw the little curly hair Fluttershy thing. And I was

798
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:36,280
like either either Pinkie Pie got together with Cheese or Pinkie Pie got together with Fluttershy.

799
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:41,160
I guess Rarity just dies alone. Okay, that's, that's fine. They saved Rarity for me. She has a

800
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,480
Prodigy now. Rarity gets old and her hair turns gray. They're all old. They're all fucking old.

801
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,720
They're all, they're all gonna die. It's, it's happening. They're all gonna die and Twilight's

802
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:55,240
gonna be, remember how they said, wait, they're confirmed on Twitter saying Twilight wouldn't

803
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,040
outlive everybody else and they blatantly lie. Because she's gonna kill herself when they all

804
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,320
die. That's why. Maybe she's gonna. And Discord just rides from the ashes. It's like my long game

805
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:11,160
plan has finally paid off. Oh my goodness. Maybe, maybe she's gonna make everyone look forever.

806
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,040
You should find the magical. I mean, well, that's kind of fun. She's the Prince of Magic. So, you

807
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:21,160
know, she could. There's a, there was another thing. Shit, what was it? It's bullshit, I tells you.

808
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:27,800
Oh, I don't know. It's, it's complicated. Oh, apparently Luna and Celestia just retired. Yep.

809
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,240
Just retired. They just retired. They're done. They're just done doing a good run and it's over

810
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,680
now. The one to the Pony version of Florida. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard in my life.

811
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:44,440
You know, look, we, I feel like all this thing is kind of like with Steven Universe. I feel like

812
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,760
you can talk shit and you can roast it. I bet if I watched this episode, I bet I would love it.

813
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,200
That's my contention. And I bet I would literally cry if I watched the final song. I bet it's got

814
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:59,720
that emotional sting to it. It's got those good songs. It's probably a musical and it'll make

815
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:03,080
you feel good, but then you'll think about it three days and you're like, wait a minute. Well,

816
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:08,040
fuck, I guess. You get to see what most, if not all of the cast is doing right now. You get to see

817
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:16,040
the cutie microseed is all grown up and stuff and excuse me for my cat. Whoa. Child. Okay. There was

818
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:21,640
just like the Steven Universe movie. The end of my little pony is bad. That's what I'm hearing right

819
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:27,800
now. Sure. It reminds me very much of the last episode of Star Trek The Next Generation is All

820
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:35,320
Good Things, part one and part two. And it's not quite this, but it's kind of a vision of the future

821
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:41,560
where there's time travel involved in it, but it's very well done as most is in Star Trek.

822
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:46,520
Not all the time, but it's like we see what each of them get up to in the future. And here's an

823
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,320
interesting thing. In that episode, Minor Spoiler. Well, actually, these are kind of major spoilers

824
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:56,840
for Next Generation. But I'm just going to say that data, we see him, he's like a, he retires

825
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,760
from Starfleet and he becomes like a professor. And he has like these distinguished white like

826
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,760
lines on the sides of his head. And he's like, he's in this giant library and just seems to be

827
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:10,440
consuming knowledge and he's become way more human. And it's just having a great life. Until a little

828
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:16,200
movie called Star Trek Nemesis came out like 10 years later, where they literally just kill data

829
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:22,040
despite the just just forget all the Star Trek movies. They're not real. Data becomes a wonderful

830
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:27,560
professor from like Oxford or something. He's got a beautiful, sexy robot daughter or something.

831
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,280
And life is great. Speaking of that great ending to Star Trek, the next generation,

832
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:37,640
are you ready for Star Trek Picard to steamroll all of it even more? Oh, I forgot about that.

833
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,280
I mean, I'm just not like I gave up on Star Trek discovery because it sucked. So I'm just not,

834
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,200
I just don't care anymore. I'm just over. I mean, I still got to get through Voyager and

835
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,400
Enterprise. So that's, that's, yeah, but Picard's going straight for the juggler,

836
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,720
they're going to fucking bring back Picard and they're going to do a bunch of dumb bullshit

837
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:02,120
because it's written by the same people who do discovery. So I'm not, yeah, I'm not expecting

838
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:07,080
anything great. I mean, I've been watching the, the red letter media guys are my go to boys to

839
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:12,840
talk about what to expect from Star Trek. And I've got zero expectations. So not watching,

840
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,840
don't care. Picard's dead. I'd love to be wrong, but you know, these things,

841
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:24,280
but he's so fucking old, man. He's so fucking old. Patrick Stewart. I don't know. He's still

842
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,920
making it happen. I mean, that's not the major issue because at the end of the end of all good

843
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,800
things, we see Picard retired to his family's vineyard where he makes wine, which he's

844
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,280
passionate about and is totally sick. But whatever. Anyway, everyone go watch Star Trek,

845
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:43,400
the next generation is really good or Steven Universe. These are all good choices. Now that

846
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:49,080
we've spoiled the endings for all of them. Go watch them. You know, you know, the thing is by,

847
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,440
look, unironically, by the time, if you said, said like, Oh man, they spoiled, I didn't even

848
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,520
really spoil, but let's say I spoiled the next generation ending. If you sit down, you're like,

849
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,800
fuck it, I'm going to go watch. By the time you get through seven seasons of the next generation,

850
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,360
you will have forgotten what we've said here today. So you know what you should do? If any of

851
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:16,760
these sound good, go start at the beginning and watch all the way through. I can vouch for Steven

852
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:23,000
Universe and next generation though. So go watch them. They're, they're worth your time. Okay,

853
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:31,160
anyway, um, that's it. I have some, I have some recent events. Sure. Discuss. Okay. On this show.

854
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:37,560
Okay. We would like to get on. Um, see, guys, the contra points deleted or Twitter.

855
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,440
No, I heard, I heard some vague ramblings about this, that something happened.

856
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,360
Point of order real quick. Everyone says this always, this is just a pet pee. People say

857
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:51,000
deleted Twitter, but I believe that the appearance of this is equivalent to one who has

858
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:57,720
like privatized or like, like made it so no one can see it. You've deactivated your Twitter. You

859
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:02,440
can reactivate it whenever you deactivate it. Possibly. Well, you can, can you only deactivate

860
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,640
it for a certain amount of time? I don't know. Don't know. Ben, you're gonna have to deactivate

861
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:13,880
your Twitter. It's possible it's deactivation, maybe not, whatever, whatever. Um, well, uh, yeah.

862
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:19,320
Um, so I don't know if you guys know why this happened, but I don't know who this person is.

863
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:25,240
Well, they're a, they're a Lefty Tuber. Well, they're a, they're a Trans Lefty Tuber.

864
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,920
What's their, what's their name again? Well, they're like, they're like the

865
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:32,120
contra points, contra points mage. Never heard of them. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, go on.

866
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:39,160
Um, uh, she, she said some, she said some stuff on Twitter that some people didn't like and it was

867
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:44,680
about, um, it was like saying that like older trans people are like more, they want to, they

868
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:49,160
want to like pass as binary basically. Right. They want to like just, just live as a woman,

869
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:54,920
live as a man or whatever. And like the younger generation is more, more like non-binary stuff.

870
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,640
And it's just, I don't know. She just like acknowledged that difference. And there was a lot

871
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,880
of very terrible on its face. Pretty factual. I haven't seen all the tweet. I haven't seen all

872
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,920
the tweets. Apparently there was more to it. I don't know. There might be more to it than that,

873
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,440
but like my understanding of what I've heard people saying is that basically that was the gist

874
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:16,440
of it, but people said that this was not woke enough, that she was erasing non-binary people

875
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:23,160
was stuff and, and, you know, and I mean, genocide right there. That's what that is. That's genocide.

876
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,640
Uh, people say, you know, people said that like, oh, contra points got canceled. She didn't get

877
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,800
canceled. She deleted her own Twitter, but like, what's annoying to me about it? Well, that one

878
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,360
guy just committed suicide. So he just did it himself. Was that a canceling? Oh, I want, that

879
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,560
was my other thing. But let's talk about that in a minute. Let's talk about that in a minute.

880
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,680
I don't know. The annoying thing about contra points is that these are, these are like,

881
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:47,560
these are trans people, non-binary people that contra points is like a huge advocate for. Yeah.

882
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,920
But then, and then they will fucking rip her apart and abuse her and tear into her and like,

883
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,040
distance themselves from her and say that, oh, we need to do better. We don't want this person

884
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:01,080
representing us because she's like, because they disagree on this one, like relatively minor

885
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,480
point of contention. That's been the entire problem with the, the, the lefty tube kind of, or that

886
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:10,200
sphere is that you step out of line a little bit. And it's not even stepping on the line. It's like,

887
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:15,960
you have a minor disagreement on the general kind of talking points and you're immediately

888
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,480
excommunicated. It's ridiculous. I mean, it is a huge win. It is a huge win. And like, if you can

889
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:26,600
show, if you're more woke than contra points, if you can be like, contra points is problematic.

890
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:31,400
Here's why she needs to do better. Here's why I actually am more progressive than, than, than the

891
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,760
legendary contra points. That's huge. You can, she's, she, you can take, if you take her down,

892
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:43,000
you can springboard yourself. You're the wokest. I mean, I guess that's true. You're even better

893
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,640
than contra points, dude. Cause you killed her. You slew her and you took her and you absorbed

894
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:53,000
her all her, all this. Think how much slime she dropped. It's a lot. She's very slime based.

895
01:19:53,480 --> 01:20:00,840
Now you're the biggest boy in New Los Angeles city, baby. You know, man, the take, when I

896
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,840
examine the take itself, it doesn't even, I, I, are you looking at the take? No, well, did you say

897
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:11,240
am I a fan? No, I said, are you looking at the take? Oh, sorry. Not, not right now, not right now,

898
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:16,360
but I'm just going off of my general understanding. It seemed very strange to me because all it seemed

899
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:22,680
to say was that contra points was kind of voicing an opinion of herself and people who share her

900
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:27,880
opinion that did not seem like it was saying like other people can't feel a different way.

901
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,520
They were just kind of expressing a personal desire to kind of just blend in as a woman,

902
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,880
which I mean, how could anyone object to their feelings about how they want to be. It operates

903
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,960
as a hive mind. Twitter is like a hive mind. It's fucking terrifying. I'm looking at the tweets.

904
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:49,320
I'm looking at the tweets. I mean, I don't get why people are so mad. It sure it's not,

905
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:56,120
her position itself is not itself advocating non-binary-ness, but it also doesn't seem to

906
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,880
be criticizing it. So I don't get the point. Okay, well, here, I'll just I'll just read what she said.

907
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,320
Okay, give us the actual some of the offending tweets quote. This has happened to me before

908
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,280
in hyperwoke spaces like it's me and a bunch of cis women and we all go in a circle. We all have to

909
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:17,640
go in a circle saying she her because I'm there. Okay, there's this paradox where I can go to a

910
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,840
sports bar in North Carolina and be mismammed all night no question. But in self consciously

911
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:27,720
trans inclusive spaces, I have to explain my pronouns and watch woke people awkwardly correct

912
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:33,560
themselves every time they say you guys. I guess it's good for trans people who use they them only

913
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,440
and want only gender neutral language. But it comes at the minor expense of semi-passable

914
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:45,000
trans is like me. And that's super fucking hard for us. Okay, I find very so I see. Yeah, so I see

915
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,920
why I see the conflict here. I see that like, sure, sure, she is saying yes, there is sort of a

916
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:56,920
conflict of interest in that like about your fucking milk toast neutral takes on something

917
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:02,360
though. I mean, yeah, there's nothing incendiary there. It's just a literal statement of fact

918
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:07,800
and something it's just the fact that she's I guess not on the team enough of one group. It's

919
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,520
not even that it's just a statement that like the language it's being used here is at a crossroads

920
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,320
and that you're you got to lean one way or the other and it's going to cause I mean, why aren't

921
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:22,840
we mad at these people just as an example for denying contra points is desire to live in a

922
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:31,240
specific is punching up, dude. They're punching up so it doesn't count. Oh, our dynamics. I mean,

923
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:36,840
look, I think punching up at the person who's fucking like doing them more favors than like

924
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:43,000
anyone else on the internet. You know, you're done. It's maybe this is silly. Maybe this is

925
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,680
silly, but especially now I wish I'd gotten a chance to meet contra points at before they died.

926
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,080
They're dead now. Their Twitter is gone. They might as well be where they were

927
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:55,080
suicided. Yeah, they were listening to that spinel song. They're like screw it.

928
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:02,200
Contra points. Don't listen to Steven Universe movie. Don't do it. Now that's actually not funny

929
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,600
because I don't want this person to hurt themselves in any way and that has happened kind of recently

930
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,280
to make it clear because everyone was talking over me. I said deleted their Twitter not deleted

931
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,920
themselves. Oh, whoops. Okay, I took it a different way.

932
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,640
Contra points makes an insane amount of money, by the way. I believe that doesn't surprise me in the

933
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,520
slightest. Okay, I mean, look, they make extremely high. Ben, when you're gonna start dipping into

934
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,280
that pool and start ringing in those big victim box, I can't victim. But I mean, I can't do a

935
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,920
contra point stuff. You can you can you can lack the little experience to just make it happen.

936
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:38,600
I mean, I want to I mean, I'll actually you know what I was thinking. I take it back. Don't do that

937
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,920
because if you do that, it'll take you three months to start building up some momentum and then

938
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,520
they'll find out you're on this podcast and you'll get canceled. So don't even know. Oh, God, they'll

939
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:51,000
find out that I associate with people who say the n-word. They probably would not be fans of that.

940
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,360
You're fucked before you even began. You know, you know, you know what I think? I was, you guys

941
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:01,560
heard of this webcom called Stone Toss? I have heard of Stone Toss. I think I could be the lefty Stone Toss.

942
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,280
Big fan.

943
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,840
Okay, I mean, for anyone who doesn't know, Stone Toss is made by a Nazi and well, okay. I mean,

944
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:17,320
he said he's a Nazi. Are you sure that was like a serious point, though? Because people say those

945
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:23,080
things as jokes. Um, look, we know he's super right wing. We can all agree on that. Here's what I

946
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:28,600
think. Here's what I know. Okay, I know that he has said he's a Nazi and that everything he espouses

947
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,000
in his comic is consistent with the ideology of a Nazi. So I'm going to go ahead and say he's a

948
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Nazi. Okay, fine. I feel like this is a pretty open shut case. All right, whatever. Um, I mean,

949
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,600
but okay, at the very least, he's a far right leaning. Yes, we all agree on that. And I feel

950
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,240
like I feel like I could be I feel like I could be lefty Stone Toss. You gotta make Rock Throw

951
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:54,840
have it be like with a Pokemon angle. Ben used Rock Throw. That's the name. How about Rock Smash?

952
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:01,400
Right? True. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, we got like Matt Bors, the guy who made the I am very

953
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:07,000
smart, like you live in a society and let you critique it comic now. I've seen a couple of

954
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,440
comics dissecting how effective how effective Stone Toss is as propaganda and like the way

955
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:17,960
that it's like punchy and like really easy to understand and like true and like in like funny

956
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:23,160
and ways that are not necessarily like bigoted, even if they carry like some like dog whistles in

957
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:27,080
them, like, like you can laugh at them for other reasons, even if you don't really know what they're

958
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:34,920
saying. Sounds to me, Ben, like you are looking to to as a wise man once said Ben Saint is obsessed

959
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,080
with branding and here he goes again branding himself using his lefty brand. Listen, listen, listen.

960
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:47,560
I saw I've I've seen a couple of people discussing I've seen a couple of people discussing and I've

961
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:54,440
and I've heard people say like we need a leftist equivalent like like the left needs a Stone

962
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,000
Toss we don't have anyone who's like but I was the left can't meme as they say I was like well

963
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,600
maybe I don't know like maybe I could maybe I could I mean hey wait a minute I just remembered

964
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:11,240
that I draw sometimes and I know how to do that these takes a hard left turn in more ways than one

965
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,720
I don't know this is something I was thinking about well you know what I'll say Ben I'll say

966
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:20,040
about this what I what I I mean look if you want to do it hey that's up to you man that's fine

967
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:25,000
but uh in terms of like what kind of it's just an idea it's okay okay around my old noggin

968
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,560
in terms of I'm just but then you'll have to post it under a different under a pen name or a pseudonym

969
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:35,320
because again as soon as they find out you're on the Nazi podcast you're fucked the Nazi podcast

970
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:40,840
all right podcast piece of in terms of when I think about well the things that I want to extract

971
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,520
from Ben's existence as Kant and I like because I I'm a big fan of the stuff you make um it's uh

972
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:52,280
like I think about something like Steven Universe look it is unequivocally true it has been stated

973
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:57,960
by the developers over and over again that like Steven Universe among other things like is is very

974
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:03,960
clearly intended to promote through art like progressive values and uh like one thing is that

975
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:09,800
all the gems are nine are non-binary Rebecca Universe is non-binary I suspect this is not a

976
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,280
coincidence and you know what it's probably made me as a person like more just being like oh a

977
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:19,400
non-binary person oh like a Steven Universe yeah that's oh man you know I get it I get it that's

978
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:25,400
well you're a non-binary person where's your gem where's your gem I'm gonna find that gem boy let me

979
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:32,280
look at your body uh uh oh my okay dark twist on the Steven Universe like there are gem hunters who

980
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,840
just rip the gems out of uh gem people and they harvest them and they use it for currency oh if

981
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,880
they meet like the Ferengi in space at some point from Star Trek cross over okay my point

982
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:47,880
time to write a fanfiction again uh it reminds me uh how much of latinum is a gem worth go yeah

983
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,680
who's like you know that's a good question by the way did you guys know that the currency uh they use

984
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:58,760
in Star Trek latinum is in fact a liquid encased in worthless worthless gold tablets because gold

985
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:04,520
I have heard that gold is replicable latinum is not so uh that's why it has value but my point was

986
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:10,200
Ben if I could have an ideal world uh I want you to make art and everyone in the world to make art

987
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:15,800
that slowly indoctrinates me into your beliefs and coming along for the ride through subtle and great

988
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,560
characters as opposed to you know outright political message I feel like all art does that that's what

989
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,640
I'm thinking because it's sure my spreading my ideas through this podcast sure aren't working

990
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:28,120
because everyone in the comments fucking hates me well it's a bit you're going you're going

991
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:33,080
hard without lube on a Nazi podcast what do you expect is gonna happen it's funny how the last

992
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:41,320
episode had like particular levels of like bile towards wait even though I was like specifically

993
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:47,640
less like like like aggressive about stuff like I specifically didn't talk well look I mean the

994
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:52,280
the commenters don't matter I can tell you that I appreciate I feel like you've been trying to be

995
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:57,320
you know not not antagonistic I'm trying to be a good boy you know I'm trying to have a good time

996
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,000
that is my prime virtue I want to hang out with everybody here you're all my friends

997
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,160
I just want to have a good time and talk about things that are reasonably interesting

998
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,880
and you know I'm not interested in getting like overly if there's something we strongly disagree on

999
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:14,680
and it's like an important debate then the PCB theoretically might not be the ideal place to

1000
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:19,720
discuss it you know like if it isn't entertaining anymore but like in general I mean I'll tell

1001
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,960
everybody I think Ben's being perfectly reasonable he's got different beliefs from me and several

1002
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:30,200
others that's fine you know he's not being obnoxious about it I'm so reasonable you guys yeah

1003
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,680
even though I'm fucking crazy on the inside I'm totally reasonable on the outside and that's

1004
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:42,440
what it's all about I don't know yeah let's oh wait well no sorry I made my point so that's

1005
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:47,800
all right whatever yeah contra points oh what about the suicide guy though that that guy yeah

1006
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:53,480

1015
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:42,440
scandal only like way more important okay um the so Zoe Zoe Quinn comes out with their accusations

1017
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:55,000

1018
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,960
they they're non-binary now okay yes okay I found this out I found this out it's on whatever it's

1019
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:09,080
on Wikipedia um uh they were the person that's kicked off Gamergate because of like a sex scandal

1020
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:14,360
involving like one of their exes like then reviewed their game and it was like oh that they they had

1021
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:20,040
they oh they exchanged sex for uh for uh sex for free review and also they're a bad person and they

1022
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:25,080
cheat on people and they're a bad girlfriend or they're a bad partner and so everyone hated Zoe

1023
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:30,040
Quinn and then that spawned into Gamergate and then the new circadian and the game was like more

1024
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:34,600
about like the integrity of the journalist or something okay well well it depends on who you

1025
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,920
ask Zoe was involved at the beginning for sure I have another bonus podcast on Gamergate

1026
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,120
a liar I'll tell you that yeah yeah okay so keep going keep going keep going get everybody up to

1027
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:52,920
speed okay so that so so the so Gamergate just hates Zoe Quinn right but whatever Zoe comes out

1028
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:59,560
with Alec accusations that like 10 years ago this guy Alec Holoka who is one of the two okay there's

1029
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,440
a three person team that works on Night in the Woods which is an indie game it's very popular

1030
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:08,840
indie game which I personally have not played but I know Night in the Woods okay okay and there's a

1031
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:12,920
three person team but it seems like the two main it's it's Scott Benson is like the writer and the

1032
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:18,920
artist Scott Benson's wife does I think she also co-writes it I'm not sure and then this other

1033
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:24,760
guy Alec Holoka it was the made mainly the programmer and Alec Holoka had sort of like

1034
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,800
gotten in touch with Alec based on Twitter they like Alec had worked on previous games before he

1035
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,800
had known like sort of gaming industry inside people like Zoe Quinn okay and he was sort of in

1036
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,520
this like weird indie game scene he'd been very successful and he got rich at a young age doing

1037
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:45,080
this and he was kind of like an industry an established industry guy like before Scott got

1038
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:53,880
involved with him so she accuses him of basically being like a fucking physically and sexually

1039
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:03,400
abusive guy to her back when she to her to her yeah specifically to her okay and he and then

1040
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:11,960
Scott Benson and the the Night in the Woods team take Alec off their twitter profile and like they

1041
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,120
like distance themselves from him and they like remove reference to him and like it seems like

1042
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:20,360
he's not on the Night in the Woods team anymore and then Alec Holoka kills himself he shoots

1043
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:24,760
himself in the head what was the timeline there was that fast like 48 hours it was like a couple

1044
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:33,400
days oh my god that's fucked up okay all right it was fast um and then and then his sister comes out

1045
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:38,840
his sister comes out with a statement oh how'd you like this one you've you've read this I I saw

1046
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:43,400
bits and pieces of it yeah his sister comes out with a statement that is like you know I knew out

1047
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:50,440
she says she says I knew Alec I believe Zoey Alec didn't want Zoey harassed over this

1048
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:57,000
doesn't help people go after Zoey people call Zoey a murderer like these accusations that you

1049
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,280
accused a mentally unstable person of this and you know you're you're a murderer you killed him

1050
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:06,920
you're you're a lie oh she's at it again the Zoey Quinn body count is racking up

1051
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:13,000
um the sister saying that people are accusing Zoey she's not accusing Zoey well she says

1052
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:18,840
she says don't harass Zoey over this and that he wouldn't have wanted that she says that he

1053
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,440
specifically said that he wished no ill on Zoey gotcha that's what she says gotcha um let's do

1054
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:31,800
that his own sister she says she believes Zoey okay okay and then Zoey deletes their twitter

1055
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:38,440
and then uh Alec is the other guy Scott Benson doesn't delete his twitter but he's he's like

1056
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:45,720
the co-writer he releases a blog post talking about his life with like the time that he knew Alec

1057
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:51,320
and like based it is my take this this is the last thing based on everything Scott said like

1058
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:56,200
Alec Holokos a piece of shit and he's better off dead he's a fucking scumbag okay sorry did you

1059
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,600
say that's a hard take? Zoey deleted her twitter? Zoey deleted Zoey deleted her twitter? Well she

1060
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:06,520
deactivated and reactivated it now it's private okay fair enough okay from what I understand at

1061
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,320
least it could have changed again like people like people okay everyone was really mad at Zoey

1062
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:17,720
and at first I was like man this is terrible a man died but then the reports roll in people

1063
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:23,400
corroborate Zoey's story Scott corroborates Zoey's story Scott describes a whole culture of people

1064
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:28,440
around Alec that he treated in exactly this way Alec's sister says yeah this is pretty much what

1065
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:34,200
Alex was like Scott says like like my whole the whole time that I knew Alec he was like a

1066
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:39,400
horribly abusive person he like you know he was always really secretive and cagey about stuff

1067
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:45,960
he literally gave him PTSD from the fucking shit he put it yeah Scott has Scott has PTSD

1068
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,360
but kind of makes you wonder why he worked with the guy if this is all well it's because Alec had

1069
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:56,120
clout okay it's literally because Alec had clout and uh I don't know he used it to fucking

1070
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,320
he uh you should you should read Scott's art Scott's I've not read Scott's post which might

1071
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:07,160
recontextualize a lot of my understanding of the issue so far um okay if you if you were initially

1072
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:13,160
on the side of like the cancel culture gone too far I get it I don't know shit that was my that was

1073
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:19,640
my take two but like after reading after reading Scott's post no I mean no this is good this is

1074
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:24,840
great thank you thank you Zoey I will not I will not go as far as saying I'm glad anybody's dead

1075
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:31,080
is that just kind of like a hard and fast like I don't want anybody to die um okay I okay I wish

1076
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:35,320
we I wish we could have rehabilitated him right that would have been better but I think it's pretty

1077
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:41,080
clear that that wasn't gonna happen sure okay just in light of and he was a bad guy I mean look I mean

1078
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:47,000
it sounds like we're I'm not saying she's lying or anything I'm definitely not implying I don't know

1079
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,760
anything about the situation I all I know is mostly what you said but yeah it's kind of like easy to

1080
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:57,080
throw shade at a person when they're dead and they're not there to defend themselves I mean it's

1081
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:01,720
kind of I mean it's almost admitting to your guilt when you you kill yourself because I guess you

1082
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:07,080
assume you there's no way to defend yourself but at the same time but the same time you could you

1083
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:11,400
could have just felt like you know there was no way out there maybe some mental issues or whatever

1084
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,880
it's not necessarily his guilt and maybe just some people had it out for him and you know they're

1085
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:21,400
talking about the mob the mob I've seen so many people talk trash about Stanley after he died I

1086
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:26,680
don't believe that that shit but I mean that's a whole other point just recently she also I mean

1087
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:33,880
I mean I don't think anybody can deny the fact that like Twitter is enabling a lot of bullshit

1088
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:38,680
you know the fact that like they're you just you can sick the mob on whoever you want without

1089
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:43,800
any evidence or anything like that and that's kind of the really creepy thing Zoe in their

1090
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:50,840
post Zoe said in their post that this was that they forgave Alex right for all the stuff that they

1091
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:56,120
said interesting isn't that fuck but isn't that weird well here's the thing but why I have always

1092
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:01,960
I assume from the get-go with the statement from Alex sister that this did happen to some degree

1093
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:07,400
whether it was as extreme as Zoe was saying who knows Zoe has a history of coloring the truth

1094
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:13,400
to her benefit but it sounded if your own sister is not coming out playing defense hard there's

1095
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:19,800
probably some grounds for like legitimacy there but the thing this is this is an example of a

1096
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:25,000
piece of shit being a piece of shit to another piece of shit because Zoe Quinn has a history of

1097
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,840
doing fucking ridiculous shit and the whole reason that this even happened in my opinion is that she

1098
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:34,520
was getting a bunch of flak for not delivering on the Kickstarter and this was a smoke screen

1099
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:39,720
especially when it was 10 years removed and she said in the very statement that I forgive this

1100
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:44,520
person and I don't want gave him and I don't want anything I don't want anybody to go after him I

1101
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,360
just needed to get this off my chest it was a way of deflecting before it even took off

1102
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:55,320
I don't want to defend Zoe Quinn because Zoe Quinn doesn't seem like a particularly great person

1103
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:02,040
either but like even if you ignore what she said like the fact that the fact that like lots of other

1104
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:08,040
people and women and Scott Benson came out and said like yeah I want to I want to look this this

1105
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:11,400
is I just want to quickly say everything this person says yeah I just want to quickly say I'm

1106
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:16,120
not saying that everything said about him was a lie no I don't believe that like he he does sound

1107
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,920
like he might have you know done something to upset people and maybe you know harm them and what

1108
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:26,200
not maybe he definitely did well we don't know he's not here to tell his side of the story that's

1109
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:33,320
my point it's kind of remember when we were all convinced about allegedly the torrents and torrents

1110
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:40,040
of people coming out to allege the abuses done by one pro Jared right that all of which fell away

1111
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:46,760
and the only two substantiated ones were basically revealed to be at the one very likely just made

1112
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:52,920
up and the other totally like we can't verify it at all so look I'm not saying that they're not true

1113
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,240
I'm saying we should just wait for the fucking facts and like that's what are these actual

1114
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:01,640
accounts that people are making look no what what like the thing you just said Scott's account

1115
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:06,440
that's a very biased source in this whole affair what do you mean that's a biased source I that's

1116
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:12,840
exactly what I mean he's a very biased source if he was given everyone's a biased source well

1117
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:18,040
that doesn't mean the facts don't exist literally no one point to even one person that has come out

1118
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:25,640
and said I knew Scott he was not like this nobody look my point is very uncontroversial nobody says

1119
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:31,160
that my point is I mean given our recent events shouldn't we just every every everyone is like

1120
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:36,440
yep I knew Scott he sure was weird around women we kind of had this thing that we all said like

1121
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:41,080
don't be in a room then I would challenge you actually present me a list of the people doing

1122
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:45,720
that and show me the evidence here's a problem maybe I will do here's here's the problem I have

1123
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:53,000
with that you know everybody the the narrative with these stories is always someone comes out

1124
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,480
and makes an accusation and then all of a sudden there's a torrent of people coming out and saying

1125
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:03,880
yeah me too this happened to me too and like why wait this is exactly what happened to projaret

1126
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:09,640
why are we waiting so long for this like like if we all knew that this guy was a monster for this

1127
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:15,400
long why did we wait so long for it to happen do something about it like at this point it is

1128
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:20,280
partially your fault for sitting on it for x amount of years and just letting it continue to happen

1129
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:24,920
when is personal responsibility coming to the equation what do you mean personal okay I mean

1130
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:31,640
distance yourself from the psychopath she's not responsible don't work with him I'm not talking

1131
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:35,400
about Zoe I'm saying like if you're if you're a three person team and one of those people is

1132
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:40,840
mentally unstable don't wait until some random person brings up baggage from 10 years ago to

1133
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:46,840
finally pull the plug on him do it immediately okay well Scott I mean Scott the only reason that you

1134
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:51,800
have lived in like a different country from alex right Scott didn't know about like alex personal

1135
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:58,920
but you just said that he has PTSD from him well that's well yeah then not not from not from his

1136
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:04,920
experience maybe stop working for him maybe stop working with him before you get PTSD this is such a

1137
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:10,600
okay this is okay what he describes is a whole pattern of behavior whereby alex uses his clout

1138
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:16,440
to like get people working for him like get people dependent on him and then abuse them look Ben

1139
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:20,280
like this is that strategy I'm not even saying I don't believe you or I don't believe any of these

1140
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:24,920
people I haven't reviewed most of the documents I don't know anything about who's made what claims

1141
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:30,120
but I just think my position is simply I should probably find out as much information how many

1142
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:34,840
of these accounts seem you know and I just want to know if they're credible or not I'm not saying

1143
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:39,320
they're not I definitely just don't have enough and considering what just happened with projared

1144
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:43,880
shouldn't we just I mean at the very least for me I'm speaking just for myself I should probably

1145
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:48,760
wait before I'm like yep it seems all right all right you can wait listen I've heard I've heard

1146
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,720
I've heard enough multiple independent sources also the same thing I'm just gonna say ala caloka

1147
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:57,880
fuck you it's it's you know wish you could have been reformed you weren't gonna be reformed I'm glad

1148
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:03,080
you're dead and I'm 100 positive that we will not be hearing anything that indicates to the contrary

1149
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:09,240
it was a scumbag everyone in the industry knew it and that okay it's already it's already it's

1150
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:15,400
everybody in the industry who knew pairs bears partial responsibility for not acting out sooner

1151
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:21,880
is all I mean fucking weird victim blaming it's not victim blaming at all it's just stating effect

1152
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:26,760
I just find it weird that everyone if Zoe Quinn is a hero for stepping forward then everyone else who

1153
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:31,880
did it is a valet because he killed himself as instead of defend himself because like what are we

1154
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:36,920
supposed to make about like oh boy I what I bet he would have had a great fucking defense he would

1155
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,040
have had like a great like projared level like here's how I can disprove all my acute if only

1156
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,680
he hadn't killed himself then we would know the truth no bullshit that doesn't mean he was completely

1157
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:51,480
guilty of everything just because he did that it's just a it's part of the story I agree it's also

1158
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:55,960
the court of public opinion has too much power something because of social media and it's dangerous

1159
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:01,720
the court of public opinion what did the court of public opinion did not kill alex haloka no but

1160
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:06,520
we really don't know the court of public opinion made made its judgment without and without a

1161
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,360
public opinion and the court of public opinion didn't and the court of public

1162
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:15,080
no stop this is ridiculous the court of public opinion literally did nothing to him

1163
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:21,240
scott scott brought him up for he didn't fire him because alex was not an employee they were a team

1164
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:25,960
and and alex had not been working on the project already for a while he'd been distant from the

1165
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:31,400
project for a while and scott didn't even like him because he was like person like on a personal

1166
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:36,760
level alex was like not good to scott so like the court of public opinion didn't fire alex

1167
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,320
didn't kill alex didn't do anything to him he fucking killed himself so if if me and all my

1168
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:46,280
he's the soul of my classmates at school we bully one kid we don't like and we all do it a little

1169
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:51,400
bit but it's just enough that collectively he kills himself we all bear zero responsibility

1170
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,960
across the board are you calling this bullying yes

1171
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:06,920
i mean i think that seems one one word among others that could be used to describe it

1172
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:12,280
i mean i don't obviously there's a there's a there's a morality attached to the term bullying

1173
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:17,480
that the people doing it must be all evil and the people being okay must be all good well like

1174
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:23,880
how if someone kills so if someone kills themselves like are you gonna like you what

1175
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:29,160
there's a it just makes sense to examine the facts when someone kills themselves and determine why

1176
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:33,480
they did it and you know maybe there was some fucked up situation going on there i have a

1177
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:37,640
people deserve accountability i have a small story i want to that'd be bad so i mean it's

1178
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:42,440
probably not all made up so good okay let's find out exactly where it all is like i don't even feel

1179
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:46,440
like i should be commenting because i don't have anything to say i haven't done any research i'm

1180
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:51,960
simply stating facts are good i will make up my decision once i get more facts and i want to

1181
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:56,280
i want to quickly i want to share a story right okay i want to quickly i got a lot of them and

1182
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:00,840
i've made up my mind and i think it's very well substantiated okay well i mean your problem what

1183
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,400
what opinion you have like a bead nates or bead bends it doesn't really matter the things are the

1184
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:10,680
way things are and whatever you think isn't going to change anything however um i want to quickly

1185
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:15,480
say a story like with the situation it's very complicated it's hard to tell what what's the

1186
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,680
truth and what's not and uh you know like i'm a bit with a date i would prefer to you know more

1187
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:27,080
know more facts than you know make up my mind or whatever remember pro jared yeah i know it's not

1188
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:31,720
the same from the very beginning there were conflicting reports about pro jared you all

1189
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:36,920
just weren't paying attention that's possible i i'm still not paying attention to pro jared i'm

1190
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:42,840
avoiding that as much as as i can anywho uh there was this story about this one girl that you might

1191
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:48,600
have heard uh in uh not saying this is like the same it's definitely not the same it's a lot

1192
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:54,040
clear more clear cut i suppose of the situation but um she drew fanard of rose quartz and she was too

1193
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:59,400
thin and she got so bullied by everyone she was such an evil person and her way out was to try and

1194
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:05,000
commit suicide thankfully she survived but if she had went through it and died would have that made

1195
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:13,880
her guilty i mean i mean no like what's what's the what's the parallel the parallel is that

1196
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:19,160
there's a calculus that i think everyone's doing here that's how much of a crime how much of a

1197
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:24,520
moral crime did the person commit versus what's an appropriate i don't know social backlash and

1198
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:28,440
obviously yeah there's different degrees you're illustrating the point the difference is that

1199
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:35,160
alex actually was like a really bad guy and like lots whereas this person didn't fucking do nothing

1200
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:40,120
these are like opposites i mean these are not people have claimed that this person was awful

1201
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:46,440
in our eyes they weren't wrong well yeah and maybe like some of some of the people who are claiming

1202
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:51,880
that this guy was awful are wrong that's my point i mean i don't know if they're wrong they might they

1203
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:55,800
don't seem to be wrong yeah and they might not be wrong they might they might actually be honest

1204
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:02,200
but it's just i don't like the way the situation has panned out i suppose that's my point and i can't

1205
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:09,080
really trust them in this situation necessarily so i reserve my opinion on this whole situation

1206
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:12,760
well who are you who are you choose who exactly are you choosing not to believe

1207
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:18,200
no one i don't it's just i don't like the way it's such a big mess you don't like the

1208
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:23,320
you hadn't even heard about this since then you're so fucking weird ben you're like oh my god

1209
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:28,280
you haven't looked into the facts and haven't formed an opinion yet that's fucked up man like

1210
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:32,920
you haven't looked into the facts and you're formulating an objection her objection is she

1211
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:38,200
doesn't know yeah that's not her objection what is your objection is let's your rejection is let's not

1212
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:42,040
jump to conclusions without the information and i'm saying i actually have a lot of really good

1213
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:48,920
information yeah but yeah but you're leaning one way and i have your story i have but i haven't

1214
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:53,080
heard the other part of the story therefore i don't want to make an assumption or you know

1215
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:58,840
make us a solid opinion about the situation just yet i think they could be wrong they might

1216
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:03,480
that's i mean that's fair there might more information i feel attacked i feel attacked for

1217
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,920
my opinion okay then listen i don't i'm saying it's it's fine the way you you think i'm just i'm

1218
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:13,320
not agreeing with you but i'm not exactly disagreeing with you either i just think there might be more

1219
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:17,560
facts that might come out there might not be more facts you might be right you might be wrong i don't

1220
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:25,400
know that's my point there's there's okay i i also felt i also felt sympathy i i guess my final word

1221
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:32,040
on the subject i also felt sympathy for alex and i thought boy what if what if zoe was lying like

1222
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:35,800
that would be so bad like that would be a really terrible thing that happened and then i read scott's

1223
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:44,040
article and i was like wow fuck me dude i don't i don't even feel sympathy i reserve all feelings

1224
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:48,440
until i have facts one way or the other and so yeah i'm just i'm saying this for the benefit of

1225
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:55,400
the viewer if you're listening to me and you're like wow wow ben how dare you like good better off

1226
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,560
dead that's a yikes statement go read alex's go read alex's article and then tell me what you

1227
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:05,240
think to me to me is always like the boy who cried wolf i can't and like scott scott's article not alex

1228
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:09,800
i keep confusing scott is the one that wrote the article yeah with like like i was saying like

1229
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:14,760
zoe the boy who cried wolf i can't really believe her other people i might actually you know look

1230
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:20,920
into it and see what they're saying and then reserve my judgment um yeah zoe seems kind of

1231
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:26,440
questionable scott's a scott's a good boy i mean if committing yourself if committing suicide is

1232
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:30,760
sign of a guilty conscience what is do you know privating your twitter or whatever is that all

1233
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:34,840
suicide in the gill i i don't i don't know what does well does that mean that contra points is

1234
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:39,400
guilty you tell me i don't know it's also private i mean i don't think so but other people seem to

1235
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:44,120
what is what i mean that was the point you made like he killed himself isn't that suspicious i don't

1236
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,840
understand i don't understand this because you're you're taking two things that you have the opposite

1237
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:53,160
yes ben because one is the depiction of your point that i'm making for the sake of to show the

1238
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:58,360
fallacy in the argument that that does not necessarily imply anything high i mean killing

1239
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:03,320
yourself doesn't prove you're guilty i agree no part of your you're you're saying that oh killing

1240
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:09,400
yourself seems like an admission of guilt but isn't deleting your twitter also that but it's not

1241
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:14,680
if it's but if it is for zoe then it is for contra points it's it's you know what it doesn't

1242
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:20,520
matter it's not retreating away from you know the public eye isn't necessarily admission of guilt

1243
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:24,280
some people might say but i mean that's what pro jarid did pro jarid retreated from the public

1244
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:28,200
guy for a while and then he came back and he made a video and everyone's like oh i get like i'll get

1245
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:32,360
i'll give zoe that i don't think it's an admission of guilt like being bombarded by a lot of people

1246
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:36,760
who you probably say kill yourself and other awful things you know that that's not fun so you know

1247
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:41,880
just just uh you can private your twitter and that's what you probably did and that's you know

1248
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:47,400
that's fine i don't know that i don't think that makes her guilty of anything that specific moment

1249
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,680
of course anyway hey how about those voice mails uh

1250
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:57,000
it's getting fantastic i raise this game okay this is the inception point for gamer gay too

1251
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,160
all right it's coming i specifically asked not to make this podcast three hours and we're almost

1252
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:05,160
two hours and then like the voice mails are probably gonna be like i don't know one hour so

1253
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,720
well i mean how many of us bitch and complain when the episode goes long mage huh it's almost like

1254
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:15,560
the episodes do that sometimes yeah i'm not i'm not complaining i just i really hope was hoping to

1255
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:21,480
make it a bit shorter this time i was too but i fucked it up well it doesn't matter in any case

1256
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:25,720
we've have the voice mails i fucked i fucked up and gave our listeners even more of the great

1257
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:30,680
content they crave those poor bastards i was really hoping that this episode we could avoid

1258
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:37,240
politics but no ben was here oh wine wine wine wine wine get go well go back to last episode

1259
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:42,120
and get in the comments and say uh thank goodness thank goodness that they shut ben down from talking

1260
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:46,680
about politics oh whenever he says any whenever he has an opinion about anything i just get so

1261
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:50,600
fucking mad because he doesn't agree with me about anything that's politics is things that

1262
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,040
don't agree with me i saw that i saw that one comment like somebody i saw you i think you

1263
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:58,840
responded to or something this some guy was like thank god nate shut bet down when when did i shut

1264
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:02,840
ben down i don't remember i don't okay it didn't happen i went really mad at i got really mad at

1265
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:07,560
that guy yeah i don't even think he was the worst one i feel i was really mad at him yeah i don't

1266
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:12,440
know i don't it's true i did not i i tried to avoid escalating in like a negative way i did you

1267
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:17,960
know that's true i guess there was another yeah okay so that guy i'm a little sorry that i got so

1268
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:23,160
mad at you but not really like fuck you man like get fucked right and then there was another guy

1269
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:27,640
fidelio i don't know what fidelio fidel i don't know what your problem is because you see him like

1270
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:33,240
a comrade right you seem like a comrade who just doesn't give a shit about like identity politics

1271
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:37,240
yeah and this and this guy and this guy is like he's like a purely an economic driven he doesn't

1272
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:41,960
care about the social aspect like that's the sense i get that this is a guy who's like steeped in

1273
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:46,680
economic theory or something and he doesn't give a shit about anything else and so he's down there

1274
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:51,160
in the comments like uh the fact that ben went to protest the straight pride parade just proves

1275
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:55,400
that he's just a larper and he's not and he's not for real like he's like it's like he didn't even

1276
01:53:55,400 --> 01:54:01,400
pull a gun on them ben you fucking pussy you could make you like oh wait he went out and he went out

1277
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:06,280
and actually did a thing well that just proves that he doesn't actually he's not actually doing

1278
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:11,640
so much for the tolerant left am i right for the tolerant left why don't you read chomsky you

1284
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:45,080
a book as i understand it about how like top down governance is uh is in his view suboptimal

1285
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:50,520
subideal and so i'm curious to see uh what he has to say i've i've read like one page so far

01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:51,240
my ass batman thanks riddle my ass batman i feel as a great start to my day all right let's go to

1323
01:58:51,240 --> 01:59:00,120
number two this one's from scumbag chris okay here we go three two one go three two one go

1324
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:07,560
go there is no such thing as human core i thought about this two podcasts ago it was

1325
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:12,520
two chickens hit to make a reaction however after hearing the absolutely worthless voicemails of

1326
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:18,600
most recent pcp i knew i had to set the record straight thank munchy what you said was wrong

1327
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:23,880
humans did not invent agriculture ants have been cultivating fungus for millions of years

1328
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:29,400
and many even keep aphids as a sort of insect cattle and it was while i was sticky pre-nap

1329
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:36,440
wank come at the peak of my kenja taimu or postnat clarity i realized there is nothing humans have

1330
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:45,000
invented that wasn't done by animals long before us clothing bagworms war ants again art birds even

1331
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,520
what i had at one time believed to be the most human core activity suicide bombing is a tactic

1332
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:56,280
employed by ants humans aren't special we're just another animal and i am frankly disgusted by the

1333
01:59:56,280 --> 02:00:01,960
lack of creativity or genuine achievements we've had as a whole it is for that reason that i have

1334
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:07,720
decided to give up my dreams of being an artist renounce my humanity and begin living life as an

1335
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:16,840
ant along with the colony aren't aren't we all just ants living in the ant hill known as society

1336
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:23,320
i i think he's saying he's going to suicide bomb pcph that's fair probably that's fair uh at least

1337
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:27,800
we haven't wouldn't have to listen to you terrible voicemails anymore speaking of which uh we got

1338
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:35,720
another call from human human core human core is human core are things that humans humans humans

1339
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:39,960
must sabotage themselves humans sabotage themselves in specific way i feel like they're

1340
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:48,120
i feel like they're they're a particular failings that humans are are subject to space uh no whether

1341
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:53,000
or not they would if they could there are water bears on the moon that have been living there for

1342
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:58,600
like fucking bajillion years what are you talking about oh wait a minute that's like a tv show ha ha

1343
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:04,280
no that's that's a real fucking thing wait all right it's obviously a lie no there's no there's

1344
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:08,760
little animals like fucking weird little creatures that are co-weekly known as water bears and they're

1345
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:13,480
the most like resilient animal of all time they can resist like nuclear explosions and

1346
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:18,200
shit and can survive in the depths of space and they found them on the moon because like they've

1347
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:25,560
just been flung out into the fucking void and they're just on the moon now look at look at this uh uh

1348
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:30,600
audio links audio links look at this shit i've seen so we don't even get that we don't even get

1349
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:36,520
space travel they they're already forming starfleet without us damn it well if they were already on

1350
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:40,840
the moon to begin with it's not like they traveled through space they hitched a ride on the moon or

1351
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:45,720
something we're hitching a ride on a fucking rocket yeah yeah yeah it was a like a rocket

1352
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:51,880
that crashed on the moon like had it's god's rocket hmm okay well all right pretty cool water

1353
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,360
bears pretty cool all right we can't do anything we suck as a species uh but they're just so

1354
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:01,880
fucking resilient they can survive in the vacuum these are the things that live for like millennia

1355
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:06,840
and just like don't they must be like completely they're not parasites yeah i'm just saying if

1356
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:11,400
we're gonna start doing some dna splicing i think water bears a good place to start you know

1357
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:16,520
probably true they're not they don't look like bears i don't have you guys ever uh

1358
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:20,440
have you ever heard a manga called terraformars you know you know what i'm talking about i've

1359
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:25,560
heard of it yes it's okay it's a great series i mean it's it's interesting i like it and it's about

1360
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:30,680
um basically they they colonize they're trying to colonize mars humanity i i believe it's mars

1361
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:36,120
and they get there and um they they were trying to terraform the planet and the way they were like

1362
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:40,040
testing it to see if it could sustain life or something like that was to use cockroaches

1363
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:44,600
so they left a ton of cockroaches there but when like humans come back to like check on the progress

1364
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:50,600
of the terraforming the cockroaches have mutated and it is big hulking freakish like black monsters

1365
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:56,280
that are super strong in fact let me let me get a picture uh terraformars attack on cockroach

1366
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:01,640
that's basically what it is that's basically when there's a there's a there's a show now too um okay

1367
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:05,480
look at this guy this is what i'm talking about first episode of this back when it was airing

1368
02:03:06,040 --> 02:03:12,440
i i never watched it but i like the anime and they are yeah yeah they are um spooky yucky boys

1369
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:18,280
damn seeing these they uh so the point was like the human beings however who go to colonize the

1370
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:23,960
planet they're they're pretty scary they are absolutely terrifying and uh look at the look

1371
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:29,640
at this happy guy he's having a fun time this cockroach man yeah they're not fun right okay okay

1372
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:34,360
point no thank you the humans uh who come to fight them each of those humans

1373
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:39,320
are given like a specific bug power to like fight against them like what like the main character

1374
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:44,520
guy he gets like sick like wasp butt punching gloves or he can like sting ya and he's got bug

1375
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:49,880
superpowers and everybody gets like a different bug power and it's pretty cool shonen stuff um

1376
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:54,440
but uh what if we gave water bear powers that would be a pretty sick one that's just becoming god

1377
02:03:55,080 --> 02:04:00,520
you'd you'd literally be indestructible invincible it's literally just like curvy rock power you know

1378
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:04,920
that's a pretty good power but then you can get grabbed in smash and thrown so that maybe it's not

1379
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:10,120
so good after all uh well regardless let's check in voicemail number three all right we're gonna

1380
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:15,800
count it down mage why did you send me this pad on the head uh because you said you were feeling

1381
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:21,320
attacked and i didn't say that that's true that's true i feel i feel a little bad i feel a little

1382
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:26,280
bad i feel like maybe i went a little too far to say that like it's good that he died it's not

1383
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:32,360
good that he died it's sad but i also feel like humanity is better off without people like him

1384
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:36,440
is there is that i mean i feel both of these things at the same time hey you feel how you feel

1385
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:41,080
and i understand that position like i don't i'm not exactly thrilled when like murderer i mean it's

1386
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:46,440
sad when like a murderer exists because like sure wish he was not like it is like it's tragic right

1387
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:51,800
like it is tragic when anyone dies right like it's a tear it's a terrible thing not everybody

1388
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:55,800
i mean some people i'm glad that not everyone but yeah i mean some less than others you know

1389
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,120
alex is okay i i don't know there's a spectrum of how sad my scott's account he just seemed really

1392
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:13,880
all right fair enough that's what i think i think it's a fair enough uh feeling to feel like uh world

1393
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:18,760
would be better off with it without certain people but it's always a tragedy when someone has to die

1394

yeah yeah that's how i feel yeah that's how that's exactly how i feel okay next voicemail we got a

like she had like was playing something backwards i'd have to be i had i'd have to listen again

02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:28,360
podcast i'm giving you the opportunity now all right all right that's that's okay ladies and gentlemen

1444
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:34,520
thank you for uh reminding us we did in fact discuss sand he's a good boy i left that in as a fail

1445
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:40,600
safe he does say some stuff oh what do you say he says i missed it i think he just said ladies and

1446
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:45,640
gentlemen he's oh yeah okay all right good good good i mean true true and it feels good it feels

1447
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:52,280
damn good it is a weird i feel like sands is the only assist trophy in history to be celebrated

1448
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:55,960
i think every the other one is not an assist trophy he's not an assist trophy he's a fighter

1449
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:01,400
costume actually an assist trophy would kind of be better i mean sort of g gino is pretty excited

1450
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:07,000
he's he's a as a as a me costume i mean guys like me that that's what sands is too right yeah

1451
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,840
yeah that's true but i mean i'm saying that like when when gino gino got in at the same time that

1452
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:17,000
cloud was announced in smash four and i actually don't think gino is a me costume and smash ultimate

1453
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,880
currently which i think is why people keep alive the hope that he could uh he could really get in

1454
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:26,920
yeah so i mean that's by the way i i you know what i'm glad this came out because i almost forgot

1455
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:31,160
to say did you guys know that this is actually by far the most important announcement except

1456
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:35,880
maybe for sands but in that direct it's that they they stated you know it was a it was a they were

1457
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:40,760
gonna make five dlc playable characters for smash they just blew the door up they're like nah

1458

1459
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:50,520
like money so i mean yeah doors open boys we it's no longer just one and done we don't have to fight

1460
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:58,360
between the steve idiots uh the the doom guy bros the the ramu fags you know it could be anybody

1461
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:03,480
it could be a doom guy like what what if it's one of the demons like the dude the dude one

1462
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:08,440
like like the beholder with just the one eye he just floats around i would love bolder

which cacodemon trophy or something i want i want the dude skeleton cacodemon trophy

1464
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:20,840
trumpet guys uh oh man so many possible i found i found i found the tongue twister

1465
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:29,000
you did yeah the german one can you pronounce it uh hold on i'm good i i can i can try okay uh this

1466
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:37,880
is what it's written um fishers oh god uh fishes fritz fish frishe fish frishe fish fish fish

1467
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:43,480
frishe fritz oh that's terrible wow what does it mean like fresh fish yeah what's it mean it's uh

1468
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:53,880
hold on um the fisherman fritz fishes for fresh fish uh fresh fish is what the fisherman fritz

1469
02:12:53,880 --> 02:13:00,360
fishes okay okay okay yeah pretty good i like it it's good i wonder what the russian one is well

1470
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:05,480
one one day maybe it sounds like a lapino one i'd like to be similar but it's definitely not the

1471
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:11,000
feeling but uh there's one tank just a lot i like showing off because no one can pronounce it yeah

1472
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,200
yeah it is a rare thing uh by the way this just reminds me did you guys you probably haven't

1473
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:21,880
seen this it was like on my trending tab on youtube or something i saw a fascinating video it was um

1474
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:27,480
it was by what's his face is it tom scott that guy with like the blonde hair the british guy who

1475
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:32,360
always wears like a red t-shirt is that you know what i'm talking about yeah he does oh wait is he

1476
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:37,720
like a math guy yes primarily yes but yeah i think i know who he's just like a genius guy he's just

1477
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:43,080
like a knowledge information guy yeah okay he did a video he did a video this was fascinating

1478
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:48,520
where like there is a chart it's about languages there's there's a chart that exists about i'll

1479
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:54,040
try to find this later it's about like do you have the video about all possible that's the one

1480
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:59,720
language sounds that could exist but don't because if you like the human mouth has only so many

1481
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:04,440
positions that we can move our tongue and like mandibles and fucking our palates to to make

1482
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:09,080
different sound effects and like across all languages if you look at the chart there are

1483
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:13,560
blank spots where like sounds could exist but like nobody uses them there are blacked out ones that

1484
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:17,960
can't exist or whatever i'm confusing it there there's marks for symbols that do exist because

1485
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:22,120
someone's trying to make an alphabet of like every human language so that every sound would be

1486
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:27,320
accounted for but there are theoretical ones that could be used in languages based on position of

1487
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:33,080
mouths but in no way have been in any languages yet and i just thought this was the most fascinating

1488
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:37,960
concept that's neat that's neat as right right you should check it out made just my guess to watch

1489
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:43,160
it it wasn't in my list to watch i'm subscribed to good tom scott i mean honestly i wasn't that

1490
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:47,880
impressed by this guy this video blew me away i just thought it was so cool but uh there is

1491
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:52,520
he always makes such beautiful videos but he does make cool stuff he does the video about the

1492
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:56,600
youtube i think i saw his video about the youtube algorithm right i'd like to watch that i don't

1493
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:01,720
know i think he's got a big popular one about the youtube algorithm maybe i've seen him i've seen

1494
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:05,960
him in other ones too i like his videos about the tree that owns itself and there's another tree

1495
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:13,800
that owns it yeah how's that is it is it fluttershy get it no wait the tree that owns itself yeah

1496
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:19,160
how does that work i'm not owned i'm not owned i scream i'm shrinking into a small corn cup

1497
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:24,360
how does that work mage if you if you can break it down i'm just curious it's a very short video

1498
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:29,640
you should really look it up but it's like uh it's something a while ago some some landowner like

1499
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:34,360
you gave the rights to the tree to own itself and like that's fascinating and like and like

1500
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:39,720
people are honoring it but like a few a few like like kilometers or something i don't know how

1501
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:44,360
but like a little bit ways away there's another tree that also owns itself but it's not as popular

1502
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:51,400
as the first one so no one knows about that one lol overshadowed by his big bro that's hilarious

1503
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:56,120
by the way i'm just i mean i'll just throw this out there while we're just discussing smash quickly

1504
02:15:56,120 --> 02:16:02,440
some guy a komodo komodo enesis two just tweeted at me is like what if we had a swordsman me hollow

1505
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:08,280
night oh that'd be cool oh i would love that oh that'd be so sick wait digi's not here correct

1506
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:14,200
or else i would rip him into him yeah for his video that he made about me on the radicalization

1507
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:19,160
of ben i thought that was a hilarious video i did not agree with everything he was saying okay

1508
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:24,280
i didn't agree yeah it's honestly it was pretty funny yeah there were some things i would have

1509
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:28,840
objected to it wasn't all bad i guess but it wasn't all bad i wasn't really that mad with

1510
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:32,760
anything did you say even though i disagreed with a couple of his characterizations but the the

1511
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:38,360
question whoever did you get the feeling that whoever asked that question like hates my guts

1512
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:44,200
um i did feel that they were definitely not a big fan yeah i definitely thought that like he said

1513
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:48,600
i think the kind of questions like i love ben and i love his comics but and then he but i just

1514
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:54,440
think that he's like the scum of the air he did not go back and he's clearly just okay okay he he

1515
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:59,240
brings up like he brings up like some specific shit like he specifically talks about like the house

1516
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:05,480
that i live in and this is like stuff that i don't know why this is relevant to anyone and i wonder

1517
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:11,240
if i know this person personally because i have someone in mind it's hargadine it's hargadine

1518
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:16,280
no no no there's another there's another person i know in real life who has been to my house and

1519
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:21,480
who i know is a fan of digi and i and someone said huh what if it was that guy and i was what it

1520
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:26,360
could be it could be you know that that's possible i don't i don't know i feel like someone uh could

1521
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:31,640
have not not to not to quash the dream just the way the tone was asked was strange to me and i was

1522
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:37,640
like this feels like weirdly personal i think it's theoretically possible someone and i personally

1523
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:41,080
think it's the more likely thing that someone just from hearing what you said about like living in

1524
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:44,360
like a big house with like trying to you know keep the rent low because you split it with a

1525
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:49,320
bunch of people like that in my house i like living with my friends with this question asks

1526
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:54,360
it's like oh ben's just mad because he has to squat in the house with a bunch of guys and a bunch of

1527
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:59,160
dirty you know i got he lives in squalor maybe maybe someone who's christ maybe someone who doesn't

1528
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:04,280
agree with you on everything i i saw perhaps more of what i thought his point was which was kind of

1529
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:10,120
like like given the way you choose to live your life that more aligns with like you know more like

1530
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:16,280
leftist mentality on like i mean i don't know maybe maybe it does maybe it does i don't know i felt

1531
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:20,600
that i felt the question was really hostile well i mean did you answer i don't completely agree with

1532
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:24,280
it but i don't it's like whatever it's fine you should ask that person though i mean i'd be

1533
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:28,040
fascinated here if it's actually he didn't say who it was i mean you should you should you should

1534
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:32,360
grill them maybe suddenly try what conversations i'm out and suddenly like oh did you sure made

1535
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:37,160
a funny video about me haha don't you think so friend no he's not he's not talking to me he thinks

1536
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:41,640
he thinks i'll murder him real is it good he thinks you're gonna revolution on his ass so he

1537
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:47,640
thinks socialism will literally kill him um he thinks he thinks that i want to personally execute

1538
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:51,880
well it sounds like he's just misinformed about your particular beliefs he's i told like that's

1539
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:56,760
not he's just he's just one listen you know it sounds this sounds to me like a guy not i don't

1540
02:18:56,760 --> 02:19:01,480
i don't know him but uh it sounds like he's a little bit too like he thinks that you know he's

1541
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:06,280
heard the memes of socialism death that count or whatever and he's like oh that means me i'm gonna

1542
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:11,720
be death counted or something by i don't know that's that's my guess this this was a this was a guy

1543
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:15,080
i don't know if i really i don't want to i don't want to talk about this guy specifically whatever

1544
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:21,080
but that's that's that is amusing regardless um yes so i mean did anyone else get the feeling

1545
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:25,560
probably not him odds are it's not him but wouldn't it be funny if it was and i was like ah now i

1546
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:30,120
understand everything the context is all that you know about the video though like about the digits

1547
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:35,080
video like i thought it was i really feel like look we all see the world and we see the things that

1548
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:41,160
like we are most attracted to and like yes you've done like interesting marketing things by occasionally

1549
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:45,560
throwing a few dollars to like advertise your your things somewhere but like did you whole thing

1550
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:51,560
about like marketing i feel was him being like this is how i see the world ben must be this way too

1551
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:55,640
so this is my i think it was a little bit of projection yeah that's the right like okay the

1552
02:19:55,640 --> 02:20:02,760
fact like it's not like in a way it's true that like everything you do in public is marketing yeah

1553
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:10,040
right like in a certain sense it's unavoidably true that that ever that i am marketing myself

1554
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:13,800
but that's like a really broad like the part that i object to is that he said

1555
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:18,200
there's a part where he sort of implies that i like i saw people succeeding on the left and

1556
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:23,960
i saw that there was money to be made i mean yeah he did kind of like that's not like i have i don't

1557
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:30,280
know like i mean you'd have yeah i guess i guess there are some people like that but like i don't

1558
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:36,120
think it's like a huge like money mill i don't think there's like and i certainly haven't like

1559
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:42,200
done anything to make money in that way so i don't know that's that that's the one thing that

1560
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:46,440
i'd be like no that's just wrong everything else whatever it's yeah i don't think you said anything

1561
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:50,680
particularly me i just i just thought like i mean me knowing you i was like ben seems pretty sincere

1562
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:56,520
i mean i don't think he's you know i don't know yeah did you didn't did you didn't say like oh ben's

1563
02:20:56,520 --> 02:21:04,040
not sincere but i feel like a lot of the comments like read like heard him as saying like ben's not

1564
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:09,720
sincere a lot of the comments are your typical stupid you crit you you criticize capitalism

1565
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:14,920
even though i mean ever considered the fact that not all of them are like that but a lot of them

1566
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:20,120
are unironically that's silly because to go back to what we were saying earlier is like if you're

1567
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:24,920
trying to like score lefty points to get more money the last thing you want to do is come on a

1568
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:29,800
podcast like this like that's just putting it i mean well i mean to be fair ben is making money

1569
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:33,720
by being here so there is a resistance to just no but i mean if you're trying to make money off

1570
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:38,120
like the left narrative and like being a lefty guy to make that long-term transition yeah you're

1571
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:43,000
just setting yourself up to like like do i want to just tag tie this huge ball and chain around

1572
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,560
my left leg right now you know like it's not a good idea but if there's a space for like a

1573
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:52,840
hardcore like kind of free speech also very lefty person that seems i don't know if that market

1574
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:58,760
really exists though uh they're just what about uh what about look well there's a lot of slovoi slovoi

1575
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:04,040
zizek yo well yeah yeah okay there you go slovoi zizeks like that there's um you know the dirt the

1576
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:10,280
dirtbag left the dirtbag left is all the dirtbag left there's there's lefties that say retarded

1577
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:16,600
and stuff you know they exist yeah that's fair uh okay all right i've seen some of them in the wild

1578
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:21,800
so we've got one last voicemail now this one isn't like a normal voicemail it's more of a someone

1579
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:27,720
was kind enough to make a public service announcement for us on our behalf so let's play this pcpsos
