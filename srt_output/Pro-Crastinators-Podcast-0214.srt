00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the best guy ever, and we're joined by Gibbontake, and Ben Saint. There he goes. Truly hilarious.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The joke police are here. They're not lovin' it. They're not lovin' it.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey, I'm peacefully whoop whoopin' over here. I'm peacefully whoop whoopin'.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is that like a personal attack or something?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're beating me with batons.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, my scholarship!

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Alright, let's cut right to the chase. Listen, I have an announcement to make. There's been a change in my life.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is an important one. This is probably the biggest paradigm shift in the last five to ten years of my life.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright, it goes by a singular name, and that name is Drakengard III, Kuroi Hana, 100% Shower Speed Runs.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's the summary. I will now elaborate on the subject matter.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Please.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, so there's the song. It's the final battle boss song in Drakengard III.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wait, wait, create demand and then fulfill it.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Indeed, indeed.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Drakengard III final boss song in Branch D.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Last thing, you fight a big demon flower boss with a bunch of ladies in it.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The song plays called Kuroi Hana.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have become the hero, the founder, organizer, chief executive of the speedrunning community around showering while listening to this song

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and attempting to beat speedrun strats at various percentile categories to take your shower as fast as possible.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, that's right. Why is a video game song have to be linked to taking a shower in any way?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why not just do it with a timer? Fuck you, it doesn't matter. This is just how it works.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is the community, and if you don't like it, then you can just leave.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So here's the deal. Let me break it down for you.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are seven tiers of success that you can reach in an average speedrun of the Kuroi Hana 100% or any percent runs.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let me just say right out the back, any percent runs, literal trash, if you do them, kill yourself.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't do it. It's a mistake.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hold on. Set the foundation for this. Why would you want to take a shower at a specific amount of time?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why would anyone want to speedrun anything?

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it good to have a short shower? Is that where this came from?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Absolutely.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is it safe water? Is it for the environment?

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The origin of it was simply I was listening to Kuroi Hana in the shower, because it's like an almost an eight minute long song.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So it's good and long. It's plenty of time to shower and stuff.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And I was like, I could be efficient about this.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I got into a pattern of listening to the song every time.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I understand.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So here's how the lore breaks down.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So during the boss fight, in this climactic moment of Dragon Guard 3, basically the song is slash the boss itself.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You play as a dragon Mikhail fighting against this big flower thing, the Intoners or whatever.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So there's six Intoner girls.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And each of them, in fact, you guys should just take a look at the aesthetic of this fight just to get an idea for it.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There will be links in the show notes to this.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Here you to take a peek at this. Just skip in like a few minutes in or whatever.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So these big white girls who you have known, I mean, they're literally white, they're like stone.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They've been like your main character and the other bosses basically of the game.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But now they appear bursting out of the petals of this flower, which is kind of the source of all issues in the game.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So it's broken down into seven chunks.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The first chunk is with zero.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then it goes five, four, three, two, one.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then finally all of them together.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So we call these categories getting a one or a five or a four or three or a two or a one or or the shame.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We'll shame for all of 15.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So getting a zero category is the Holy Grail.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No one's ever done it.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's an under one minute and 35 second category.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Can it be achieved?

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Scholars still speculate to this day.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We think obviously the optimal strats are going to be had because running doing an average run requires, of course,

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
shampooing, conditioning, full body soaping.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have to get the full body coverage.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There can be no skipping.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's what makes it 100% run.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, and just so everybody knows the rules of the game where the time is concerned.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Timer starts when you get into the shower.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So you're dry at first.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You then get wet in the shower and the timer stops when you turn off the water.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Toweling.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Some people include it in their categories.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Not I.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Not I.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It is not part of the speed run.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There you go.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's the facts.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So you get under a one minute and 35.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's the Holy Grail zero.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You get under a two minute and 13 second.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's a fiver.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then two minute 59, three minutes and 40 seconds, four minutes and 20 seconds.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's for 20 very based.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then a winner is five minutes and six seconds.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Anything beyond that, you're in the 15 category.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's absolutely embarrassing.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So I have taken the liberty of doing several runs and I'll tell you my scores right now.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Over the last week, my, my original personal best here was a four minute and 34 second.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's a one or not great, not great.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then I was, I was able to achieve a three minute and 15 second run.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And so far that's my best.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Solid three year and I'm hoping to bag a four on my next run.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And you will see, by the way, if you look, click at the links down below, the rules will be posted.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This will be our central hub.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This link to this video, because this is a community activity.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is the song that is being used seven minutes, 56 seconds long.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You will see my comment as best guy ever under there describing my 100% personal best of three minutes, 15 seconds.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I want to see other people flooding this comment section with their 100% speed runs to see who will be the fastest shower Kuro black flower boy.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There you go.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So there's the challenge that's been thrown down.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We're going to operate on an honor system until money gets involved.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then we'll get in contact, of course, with AGDQ.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We'll get some on camera runs done right now.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Community.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We're just, we're hoping to grow.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So we want more people to join the community and see what people are able to achieve.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, everyone's going to be lined up in the men's locker room.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So that's pretty good.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now we can't.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Unfortunately, it's true.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We can't ignore biology.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Small people have less surface area to cover.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They have an unfair advantage, but that's just life.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But they also have smaller brains.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's true.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They probably won't be able to optimize as much.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It just means we're able to use our instincts better.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's true.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And you know what?

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, right, right.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And also, you know, a large discussion was had about what about people shaving their head and going bald to optimize these strats.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It was concluded that you must have hair and a separate category has been created for bald individuals.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's only fair.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is the most contentious decision yet.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That is contentious.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I feel like no hair, short hair, and long hair are like...

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I feel like there's a middle ground there.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There should be categories for each of these.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I feel like if you wanted, you could split it.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think for each category of hair, you have to trim it to the exact designated length.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're going to have to...

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's going to be...

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It goes to the higher...

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, I think what it's got to be is weight categories.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And if you're in a weight category, you are going to want to trim to the shortest possible length for your weight category, anything else in your suboptimal.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Actually, there's also size categories.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So you have to submit a full body plaster print of your entire body for the judges to measure to gauge how much surface area they have to cover during the shower.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I would actually suggest...

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, what you need to do is fully fill your bathtub up, immerse yourself in the bathtub, measure the displaced water, and give a volume measurement of yourself by measuring the displaced water, and base the categories on that.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What is the opinion on glitch runs?

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I've managed to do a glitch where I can skip through the water and I don't even have to get wet.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is a glitchless run.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm running glitchless.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's the most popular category because one person is doing it me and I'm winning so far.

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The glitch runs, they're just a separate category.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You just don't turn on the shower, you win.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah, pretty much.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's why any percent runs are such a joke.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You walk in, you touch water for literally...

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's measured in microseconds.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You just touch the water in the shower and then immediately clip out of the wall and hit the timer stop.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not good.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It just doesn't make for a very compelling run, is all.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm trying to think of holes I can poke in this in the name of glitch testing.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In the name of stress testing the concept.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It has been discussed.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, do you have to shampoo and condition your pubic hair as well?

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What about arm, leg, and back hair?

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What about your eyelashes?

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Taking under advisement.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Eyelashes, taking under advisement.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Only hair on your head.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Only hair on your head.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Right now.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Do you have to condition?

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Actually, do you have to shampoo?

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, you have to condition.

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You have to shampoo and condition.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
These are in the rules.

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There was also, of course, discussion about what's the correct order of operations.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Should it be enforced by the rules that you have to shampoo, then condition, leave the conditioner in your hair?

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then soap, and then washed all out afterward.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It was decided no, you can do it in any order, but you should do it that way, or you're an idiot without proper hygiene.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But that's another factor.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I mean, if I want to win the speed run, the hygiene is the least of my worries.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just want to get it handled on as fast as possible.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There's been no bonus found.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's been no bonus found in doing it in any particular order, so you might as well do it.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It gives you the luxurious hair.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
See, we've thought about that.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Nobody said I need to get the shampoo and conditioner out of my hair.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If I just get the water on and then put the shower and just turn the water off, put the stuff on afterwards.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll tell you what's really split in the community right now, though.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The two-in-one shampoo and conditioner products that are so popular these days.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That seems like a no-brainer.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Absolutely tearing the community apart as to whether or not it's allowed.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What about one of those six-in-one conditioner shampoo, moisturizer, body wash, whatever?

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That seems like such an obvious tech for the run.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're obviously right.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The thing is, though, that gets into the core discussion about what is the spirit of the event meant to be.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It goes beyond simply, like, there has to be discussions about that.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I feel like it's perfectly within the spirit.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because if that product really does do all those things, then, like...

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Which raises the question, why doesn't everyone just use it normally under normal circumstances?

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's also the question of outside tools.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like, for example, could I simply step into the shower, turn in the water, pull a lever to dump a bucket I have prepared with massive quantities of all-in-one body wash shampoo and conditioner?

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Have it completely blast over my body in two seconds and then wash it off.

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We've got to standardize the shower head, the brand.

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Right.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That too.

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What if you technically have the...

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now you have the shower head on, but you leave the drain closed, causing the tub to fill as though it were a bath, and you actually jump into the bathtub and roll around in it to get yourself wetter faster.

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's because you do have to get fully desoped at the end, too.

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That might be a more optimal strat.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The clog at the end might be an advantage.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Actually, I think that would probably make washing your feet and getting the soap off your feet more difficult.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know if that would actually save any time, but you know, you've got to exhaust all possibilities.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You might lose a few frames at the end if you have to step out and then wipe the soap off and you can't just do it in the shower itself.

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You could lose frames there, yeah.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Definitely.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Damn, this is a rich meta has evolved.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I want to hear people give details on your strats.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's see who is doing the best next week.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I will be looking at the comment section of that video.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to be flooded and be able to be deeply confused as to what's going on on this video.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's got 4 million views.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They've had their time.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's our time now.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I think at first, I was hearing you talk and I was like, what is this?

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is bizarre.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is a strange and esoteric ritual.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is some kind of death cult.

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But now I'm fully invested and fully on board and it makes perfect sense and even a child could understand it.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What's the community's opinion on Nightcore and or Vaporwave renditions of the song?

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I forgot this was about a song.

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Wait a minute, what's even the point of the song?

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Ben, we already covered that at the beginning.

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It doesn't matter.

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's the spirit of the event.

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It is totally arbitrary.

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It gives us fun categorizations to use.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Seven tiers.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Which tier are you?

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm tier...

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Wait, what tier am I?

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think I'm tier 3.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm no more tiers.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm tier 4.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Which is shameful.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No more tiers.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That was good.

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Incidentally, no more tier shampoo.

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Up banned.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You have to deal with the tiers.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Extra tiers.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Extra tiers is the only approved shampoo.

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What if you just shampoo with a fucking bar soap?

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Actually, I would liquid soap versus bar soap.

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Lufa or no Lufa?

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
These are allowed.

252
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sure they're allowed.

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was assuming they were allowed but I would want to know which one.

254
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I guess you just have to experiment.

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I've been a bar man.

256
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
When you got the bar, you don't have to pump the thing to prep the Lufa which might lose

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
time.

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You don't have to wait for the bar to soften under the hot water.

259
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I feel like the liquid soap spreads faster.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I feel like Lufa is probably a time sink.

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's going to be allowable.

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I shouldn't be in the sink in the first place.

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What about Lufa on a stick that lets you save the frames of bending over to reach your

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
soap on a rope?

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That could make sense.

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Time saver?

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't know.

268
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't know what it's for in the first place.

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Really makes you think.

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just optimize your shower, bro.

271
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's the point.

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But to this very specific song from Dragon Guard 3.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The real lesson, the real high level is you get out of the shower.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You break your PR.

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
One day you get a new PB in your category.

276
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And then you realize, wait a minute.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Why don't I do this with every single thing I do every fucking day with the same song?

278
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Playing the song at all times to optimize.

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Every time you finish anything and start any new thing, you smack the timer like you're

280
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
playing speed chess and you just start the song and you go.

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Was I a 3-year?

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Was I a 1-year?

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Was I a shameful 15-year?

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Eating, eating, cooking breakfast.

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Here's the deplor.

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Eating breakfast.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Driving to work.

288
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, absolutely.

289
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Raising child.

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Bonding with family.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Just as optimal as possible.

292
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why aren't we bonding by playing Dragon Guard 3 and beating the final boss as fast as possible?

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's a 15er, by the way, because you're fighting all of the intoners at once.

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The total of which is 15.

296
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's some deplor for you.

297
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Summoning salts.

298
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Your next video.

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I expect to see the history of Castlevania.

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Stop.

301
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mario Kart.

302
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No fucking punch outs.

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Cease.

304
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is the one.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This is the one.

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We've got a story history.

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
We are going to be at HQ.

308
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We're going to win.

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We're going to do a silly one at the end.

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If we hit $10 million raised for whatever the fuck, then we'll be doing actually beating the boss in Dragon Guard 3 while showering, doing both at the same time.

311
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's the equivalent of the blindfolded.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You've got to optimize your strat to avoid it being destroyed by the water.

314
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You've got to dodge the shower droplets.

315
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The individual droplets, yeah.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So there it is.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The category is exploding.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay, good thinking.

319
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There it is.

320
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Boy, that really got my noodle going.

321
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We were talking about this on the stream the other day, and it is now real. It's official.

322
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Please join in.

323
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We await your comments on that video that I don't own.

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What, on Twitch?

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, this is the official Dragon Guard 3 song that is being used as the hub for all these things.

326
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Got it.

327
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Man, oh man, you think you know a video game.

328
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Think you know a person.

329
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Think you know a person, and then they tell you, hey, I just beat my PB in this.

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Whatever, the Kuroi Hana.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Man, I thought you were a fiver, and they say, no dude, I'm a threer.

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm a fourer.

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm a oneer.

334
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Actually, oneer's bad.

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm a threeper.

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Wait, a threeper.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Is that a thing?

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It goes, zero is best, then five, four, three, two, one, fifteen.

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I feel like there's something else that's called a threeper, but I don't know what that is.

340
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's a creeper, Ben. That's Minecraft.

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No, it's like, is that like a name for like a hillbilly from Michigan or something?

342
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No, that's Uper.

343
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What's a threeper?

344
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Damn it.

345
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay, let me know in the comments.

346
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Urban dictionary?

347
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Urban dictionary.

348
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yep, yep, here we go, here we go.

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Let me see.

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I see a threeper, which is probably like a $3 bill.

351
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't know.

352
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Did I only dream that threeper?

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
A threeper is getting three things for the value of one.

354
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Not a threeper.

355
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Those shirts are a threeper.

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't know.

358
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay.

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, that's it, lads.

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's my story.

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Great.

363
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm sticking to it.

364
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Great.

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Where's yours?

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We've all grown on the stream or on this podcast.

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No, no, no.

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You haven't grown until the holy grail is hitting that zero tier.

369
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You have to be, I know it can be done.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I know that a sub one minute, 35 second run is possible.

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Someone out there do it.

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah.

373
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But we need, don't forget, full body coverage of the soap.

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That means behind the ears, between the toes.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I feel, you know, who's, who's, if you, okay, if the requirement, so you have to clean your

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
full body, right?

377
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I feel like.

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Absolutely.

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's going to be so hard.

381
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
At least one coverage.

382
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You know, people miss, people miss spots.

383
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How are you?

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How can you differentiate between someone who misses a spot and someone who doesn't?

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Who's going to know?

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, the judges, the judges will review your body.

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They'll have to judge your cleanliness afterwards.

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You go into one of those airport, like scanning things.

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They scan for dirt particles.

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah.

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

392
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, okay.

393
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You then have to take a long, you then have to bathe yourself again afterwards.

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Much takes much more time and then take the bathwater, you know, tested for like what percentage

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
dirt it is in order to determine your overall cleanliness.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Sure, sure.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I mean, it's not just about that though.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's actually more about, cleanliness is important.

399
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's one metric used, but also surface area covered and touched by soap.

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

401
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Both factors are used.

402
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So the optimal start, of course, is if you're dirty, that's not going to work out.

403
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You got to, I mean, you see an average Twitch, like let's, or speed runner on Twitch.

404
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They'll do multiple runs.

405
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Do multiple runs.

406
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Shower before you're ready to shower and get yourself warmed up.

407
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Get the gunk off the biggest chunks so that you're just ready for your optimal.

408
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Just cover real fast with the bar or your optimal, you know, Loof or whatever.

409
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's, yeah, that's the way to play.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's what we get yourself warmed up like any other speed runner would do.

411
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't know.

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It just makes it's just like doing research, you know, as every speed runner does.

413
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
To save the frames.

414
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
All right.

415
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Same sort of thing.

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's, okay.

417
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I've, I've heard from Michelle and I think from you.

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

419
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That shower shampoo is a sham.

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh.

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And in some, like using it.

422
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We are sponsored by Big Shamp.

423
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I am.

424
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I am being paid lots of money by Big Shamp to encourage people to sacrifice the precious,

425
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
precious oils down the drain.

426
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Where, where the Big Shamp collects them to sell them back to you in more shampoo.

427
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

428
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Talking, listen.

429
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Me and Michelle are divided on this.

430
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Talking about Big Shamp got Michelle banned off Twitter once.

431
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So we should be careful what we say.

432
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This video might get demonetized.

433
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah.

434
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This channel might be, might be stricken from the record.

435
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We just don't know.

436
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We're at risk.

437
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It might be cleaned up.

438
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So, so, so I guess let me just say that when we say that a Big Shamp is stealing your oils,

439
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
what we mean is in Minecraft.

440
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Correct.

441
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Correct.

442
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No real life inclinations whatsoever.

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's all an abstraction.

444
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And it's, it's not.

445
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Jeff Bezos.

446
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You hear that?

447
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You hear that Bill Gates?

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm making mad bucks.

449
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Please use my Amazon link to Amazon.com slash Big Shamp forward slash Nate's money.

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's the full URL.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh, here it goes.

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Amazon.com slash Nate is in cahoots with Big Shamp.

454
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

455
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay.

456
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
There you go.

457
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's cool.

458
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Okay.

459
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
All right.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm done.

461
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's it.

462
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, hey guys, you know, you know, when you're like thinking I'm going to be productive

463
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
or that'll be really cool if I'm productive or something today.

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And instead, you have the stupidest possible idea that's kind of funny and you want to see

465
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,800
it and then you Google it to see if someone else has like saved you the trouble of doing

466
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,000
this really stupid thing.

467
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,080
And then you find out that they haven't done it and you are the only person to even have

468
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,000
considered this really stupid idea.

469
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And so instead of being productive, you spend hours upon hours downloading nostalgia critic

470
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
videos so that you can link all of them together so that he can say hello and the nostalgia

471
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,800
critic every single time he does it in one video.

472
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,600
Cool.

473
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Is the idea to have him say it like layer it on top of each other so like you hear him

474
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
say it every single time in one second or whatever.

475
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean, I could do that as well, but I was just thinking of having like a super cut of

476
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
from the very first to the most recent, hello on the nostalgia critic.

477
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's classic Gibbs stuff.

478
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You can't do it, dawg.

479
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I've been doing it.

480
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,840
You know, Crip Converter, that is the really good YouTube download specifically for its

481
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,040
function to download only a portion of the video.

482
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,640
So download the first like minute or two.

483
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,040
Yeah, the first 10 seconds of each video contains the hello on the nostalgia critic.

484
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,040
So I'm not taking up a lot of hard drive space.

485
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,240
Don't a lot of them start with the later on they do, but you can you can you can choose

486
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,840
I can, you know, manually just choose the point where he says it.

487
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,840
And so I'm so instead of instead of working on my Tezuko manga project, which is something

488
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
that is much better.

489
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm sensitive.

490
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah.

491
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,640
I have been I've been looking at nostalgia critic and I put it in the timeline just to

492
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,040
see like the first 38 episodes and I was I was really he was really funny.

493
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Just he just says it over and over again and his his head wobbles a little more every time.

494
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,040
That sounds great.

495
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
I want to see it.

496
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I'm looking forward to it.

497
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
He gradually low shed his inhibitions.

498
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Yeah.

499
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,840
And you can you can see week to week that is like his sideburns grow and then he shaves

500
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,840
them off.

501
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,140
Something's really funny about watching it all in a line.

502
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,040
How many times does he has he said it?

503
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,440
How many times do you think he said it in his life?

504
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
How many thousands?

505
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,640
Probably near to like a thousand.

506
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,440
What do you think the nostalgia critics pee be on saying hello?

507
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,240
I'm the nostalgic critic is like what's his speed run time for saying those words?

508
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I'm learning that he is.

509
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,240
He varies like initially he's sort of slow to calculate which one was the speed of the

510
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,040
video speeds up like his delivery sometimes when he's excited when he leads right into

511
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
another sentence.

512
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,440
Sometimes he's like says it in a depressed way but like I want to see the general trend

513
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,840
like could you plot on a graph how how it increases in speed over time or whether it

514
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,040
does you know this is all this is all science here.

515
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,840
This is going to be like a very scientific footage video for people to use and dissect.

516
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,840
I'm very excited.

517
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
How long do you think it's going to be?

518
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
What were they?

519
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
What are they?

520
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I think he said.

521
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Oh shit.

522
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
What were they thinking?

523
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,040
How long how long will the video be if you put if you were to put all of them back to

524
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,240
back?

525
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,040
I don't even know how many nostalgia critics he's done so I couldn't even park it but

526
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
are they not numbered?

527
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,840
I mean it's got to be a playlist.

528
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,080
They are numbered but like with seasons I'm looking on YouTube he's got like his older

529
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,640
episodes are uploaded in seasons season one season two which I think are just like yeah

530
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,140
thanks for watching this episode.

531
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,640
I'm sorry I'm making noise.

532
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
What was I saying?

533
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
You don't know how long it's going to be.

534
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,680
Yeah I mean it could end up being like 40 minutes or something ridiculous which would

535
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
be funny.

536
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,640
Oh just for fun I did wait oh wait is this a playlist of every ABGN season but each

537
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
one.

538
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,680
That would be one to watch on two time speed.

539
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Indeed indeed but this one it's every ABGN season but I think each season is rendered

540
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,680
into one video so this doesn't help at all god damn it.

541
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Interesting.

542
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Oh no yeah.

543
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Oof.

544
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Yikes.

545
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Oof bro.

546
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Gonna have to scrub.

547
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,080
Oh you know what that reminds me that does in fact take me back to the past when I remember

548
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,680
when I did me a math of a one.

549
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Wait wait that's the wrong guy Nostalgia Critic doesn't take you back to the past.

550
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:58,480
No no no I think I think Nate was saying that like a super cut of what were they thinking.

551
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
What were they thinking.

552
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,400
I think I think he only says it like about 10 times I don't think he says it quite as

553
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
much.

554
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Yeah yeah.

555
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,760
He just sort of like because it recurs it's just something that people remember.

556
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,800
I think he starts to say it more often and then maybe less often it kind of there's probably

557
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,840
like a sort of like a there's a period and fall much much like the much like the infection

558
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,160
curve of the COVID-19 pandemic.

559
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:32,400
Oh indeed indeed once wrote down my thoughts in a notepad document of of the ABGN like

560
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:39,600
eras like which ones were good basically I mean I'm trying to look for it but the basic

561
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,520
just is it's good and then he's working on the movie and it's bad and then it's sort

562
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,800
of good no it's good again sort of hit and miss.

563
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,880
I rewatched every season for some I just put them on and let them play like not that long

564
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
ago.

565
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,160
I don't know if I mentioned this before I feel like it was kind of you know a waste

566
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,200
of time but what did I expect you know.

567
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,800
Let me hey my point I was saying before it was just that a guy when I made me a math

568
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:18,720
of a one like four years ago a dude says it said if you do this I will make a video putting

569
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
all these together.

570
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,280
Now at the time I was like oh well I would kind of like rather post that myself I don't

571
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,520
know I mean maybe I'll do that but but just for the record he did not do that so that

572
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:35,200
guy is a pussy ass bitch and I did succeed so fuck that guy little bitch okay I'm looking

573
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,640
at my document from 2007 to 2010 is the AVGN golden era where basically every episode is

574
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:49,520
like a peak classic AVGN screaming you can't go wrong 2011 he starts working on the film

575
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
and then 2012-2013.

576
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:58,480
Guys that was that long ago yeah 2011 to 2014 it's like movie era where there's not

577
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,920
so much happening.

578
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,840
Dude feel old yet the AVGN movie can vote can fucking fight and die overseas yeah nine

579
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,480
years old yeah.

580
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,640
I think he really hit his stride somewhere between 2001 September 10th and 2001 September

581
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,800
12th there was just a sweet spot right there where he was really you know knocking it out

582
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:28,400
of the park knocking it all the way down wait guys please back me up please yes wait wait

583
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,680
I didn't know is that a 9-11 joke I missed it yeah of course it was okay how was that

584
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,560
not cuz I was looking at what numbers are Nate you understand this you know who'd back

585
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,840
me up I say it backwards I say 11-9 Sheldon would have backed me up.

586
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Bazinga.

587
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,920
Alright well I still have just not watched this motherfucker more than like three episodes

588
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:02,160
one day maybe I don't know what the big bang theory the AVGN the AVGN or 9-11 bin lad same

589
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:10,400
guy same guy same energy hey here's a here's a new development in the red manosphere the

590
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:17,440
gibbosphere the whatever the fuck yeah yeah yeah yeah gun girls Antifa now yeah that was

591
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,080
my favorite thing now I don't know it's hard hard to say a lot of a lot of cool shit happened

592
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,640
this week but that was pretty based Antifa gun girl brings a smile to my face it's it's

593
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,800
so perfect for our character because she's always been like hates authority to the point

594
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,520
of like ridiculousness and it just so happens that she's a right-wing gun nut in order to

595
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:45,880
get the guns to do so because the girls is based on I was thinking she could be a right-wing

596
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,480
gun nut because she's gun girl and but she's also a cab she's also yeah Antifa because

597
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:02,080
fat cops cop killer you know yeah yeah she's not she's not open carry she's open fire

598
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,360
open shell casing when they I literally for some reason I just cannot hear you talking

599
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,720
at all for the last like minute am I really quiet or something is there's something for

600
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,160
me you were but maybe it's just me I don't know I don't know my thing looks okay can

601
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:25,280
you hear me now let me give you one of those okay cool how about one of these I heard that

602
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,600
brother your your soundboard is so much louder than you are is it really well I'll work on

603
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,080
it you're not leaning into the mic enough or something I like I like to write up on this

604
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,520
bitch I don't know I liked I liked seeing I liked seeing a pro pro protest and black lives

605
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,200
matter stuff from most of us I like I liked seeing it from hippo I like seeing it from

606
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,160
Tom also based who else was doing it Munchie hasn't been on Twitter Munchie was on the

607
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,800
video deafening silence over from over from Nate over here Digi sort of pro but like

608
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,640
in a weird way that you can't quite understand what she's saying we've all we've all we're

609
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:20,480
all in this together all right that's that's politics is beneath me no I don't I don't like

610
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:35,920
I don't like Japanese animated what is this voice much I don't know if this is a voice

611
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:46,560
modulator or soundboard okay it's me it's Megatron it's Megatron that's all that's yep

612
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,840
I like I like Megatron Megatron do you think black lives matter yeah Megatron

613
00:33:51,840 --> 00:34:06,960
of course not that's so bad of you how come on knock was like to this prime he needs to

614
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,000
come in here shit set you straight is the kind of folk don't that there's no Megatron that

615
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,840
turns into like a human meanwhile meanwhile Optimus Prime couldn't be on the show because

616
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,080
he's at he's at the protests he's social distancing he's wearing his mask you know he's holding

617
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,880
up a big he's holding up a black lives matter he's turned into a fucking truck and he's mowing

618
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:44,600
police barricade as we speak they're throwing tear gas in his windows the police are breaking

619
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:54,320
his windows and putting little handcuffs on his little wheels or whatever dude it's not it's

620
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:11,920
not good to run people over but Optimus Prime supports looting Megatron I don't like where

621
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,240
you go I don't like some of the implications of what you're saying right now all all lives matter

622
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:33,920
Megatron even human lives stop it we're gonna cancel the old spark we're gonna get rid of the

623
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:48,000
all spark is an all right dog whistle Donald Trump has declared the Autobots and a terrorist

624
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:02,080
organization this is starting to seem just like a like a gray alien speaking to me what

625
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:18,240
in the Michael Bay movies all fucking Autobots all Transformers are just gray they're just

626
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:32,640
weird gray masses so gray gray lives matter hey Megatron I fucking don't like your attitude

627
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,920
and if I saw the all spark I wouldn't even let you know about it I would say

628
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,920
the culture of the police in America shifted irreparably when the Decepticons arrived on

629
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,200
America scanned to determine who you know the most easily infiltrated authority figures were

630
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,080
decided they were police all those Decepticons became police cars when you see a police car on

631
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,800
the street it's a Decepticon smash each window report it to your local Autobot a splinter

632
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,760
terrorists sell they'll know what to do

633
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,800
they're terrorists because they have the all spark but we will attain it when they claim they claim

634
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,320
that there's no leadership but I know that their leaders have the all spark and we will find them

635
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:50,240
and we will make our Decepticons supreme uh uh uh uh uh so don't forget to vote Republican kids

636
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,000
for more Decepticons we we got a we got a deep platform this guy this guy is spouting this is

637
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,880
hate speech uh this is unacceptable um this is this is uh but he's got the robot card though

638
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,880
propaganda no no that's identity politics don't give in don't give in he's co-opting

639
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,640
he's recuperating liberal he's recuperating liberal identity politics to to undermine solidarity

640
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,320
uh

641
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,320
incredible oh he's still here

642
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:38,080
no i can't just cover your ears everyone just don't just don't let it in just don't let it

643
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:49,920
don't let it okay no more all spark no message received thank you megatron thanks

649
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:34,720
a charity stream and we raised over a thousand dollars for the for the for the uh richmond bail

650
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,440
fund uh this was this was yesterday uh it was really good and real cool and they played

651
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:51,200
sonic adventure 2 for 10 hours i was on the i didn't realize um i i'd left before and i i went

652
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,120
back to to watch the remainder um that like a bail is around a thousand bucks i didn't think it was

653
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:06,240
that high either to to just like it seems like a surprising very obviously like restrictive amount

654
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,440
of money yeah like like it's so obvious where like the point of it is it's pretty yeah cash bail

655
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,080
really is a fucked up is a fucked up thing that should be abolished haha fuck the police i can't

656
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,120
remember the the exact rates but like i remember hearing something that seemed very strange to me

657
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,520
about like uh okay you criminal we're sentencing you i don't know what the person did but like it

658
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,920
was like okay you'll get it was like a like month in jail or like it was like something like a

659
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,440
ten thousand dollar fine and i was like i'll take the month in jail where between those two things

660
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,760
jesus christ well we're not we're not talking about fines we're not talking about paying right

661
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,800
separate fines we're talking about cash bail like to release do people their point do people know

662
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,400
like i feel like there are some people don't understand this because i think a lot of countries

663
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,440
don't have cash bail and even in america where we do have it i think that a lot of people don't

664
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,840
quite understand how it works well all right for anyone who doesn't know cash bail is like you get

665
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,800
arrested you go to jail and then there is like a process of like where they have to like i don't

666
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,880
know file for your trial and like await your actual trial to determine your guilt and most of the time

667
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,800
they will let you leave jail to um you know and you just have to come back for your trial um but

668
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,320
in a lot of in most cases they will have something called bail which is you basically have to post

669
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,760
an amount of money that is determined like based on how what you're accused of like different crimes

670
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,560
have different bail amounts and you have to put up that money as collateral and then once you do that

671
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,800
you know then it's like okay we'll keep that and then you show up for trial and you get it back

672
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:56,720
right so like i guess the idea behind it is that like well the worst thing you're accused of the

673
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,200
more you have to post bail because it's like a higher stakes thing i guess it's theoretically it's

674
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,920
to like be more of a deterrent for people fleeing harsher sentences or something in

675
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,000
in practice it is just a it is just a barrier that like you know uh poor people of which there are

676
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,840
a lot of just can't pay even the smallest amount of and a lot of people you know you know what they

677
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:28,320
always said like during the during the fucking uh uh primary uh race for the elections we heard all

678
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,160
the time that like the average american family can't uh like pay a sudden five up five hundred

679
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,640
dollar uh expense and so you know bail is usually it's like that that would be pretty small for

680
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,800
bail so like a lot of crimes is there a reasonable alternative what's uh what's there is there is a

681
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,240
reasonable alternative and funnily enough it's nothing because um there is there is like no

682
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:00,400
data does not suggest that cash bail actually works as a as a deterrent for flight because like

683
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,480
not showing up for your trial like is illegal and is another crime that you can then be charged with

684
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:14,160
uh um and cash bail just doesn't work and so so the real issue here is simply that and the one

685
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,440
last thing effectively as a just oh yeah gone gone uh and the justification i would say is that like

686
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,840
if a crime if if you are if you are not a flight risk to the point that like any amount of just

687
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:32,320
like money can be just sort of handed over and like they'll just trust you to come back for it

688
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,280
then like letting you go without that i don't know like then if you can be allowed outside

689
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,400
at all awaiting your trial then they should probably just let you go and do it yeah can you

690
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,800
if if something if something is a if something is a like a heinous enough crime or enough of a

691
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,960
flight risk that they shouldn't be letting you out of jail even for money then like they shouldn't

692
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,760
let you do it for money you know yeah like if i mean i don't know how it works but like if say

693
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,600
you're accused of murder like suspected of murder they shouldn't let you out even if you have the

694
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,400
money right i don't think i'm pretty i'm pretty sure they something like that probably doesn't

695
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,880
allow for bail yeah i think i don't know for sure but like not every crime not every charge

696
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,840
allows is like yeah you can be held without bail awaiting trial the thing about it is the cash

697
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:30,800
bail system if someone can't paste their bail then they might just have to sit in jail for days or

698
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,800
weeks or months or who knows how long uh awaiting their trial which would cause them to lose their

699
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,320
job miss uh you know miss payments on their house possibly get evicted from their home

700
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,880
all because they couldn't post that initial like bail payment which happens all the time

701
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,040
and what that leads to is people uh accepting plea bargains uh even when they're you know accepting

702
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,120
like un like unjustly long like sentences as part of a plea bargain just so that they can get it done

703
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,400
and get out of you know jail awaiting trial so that they can go back to their job and not lose

704
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,040
their job not lose their home or whatever this happens all the time this is like one of the

705
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,520
tactics that has led to the like the ballooning of the of the of the like the prison population

706
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:21,440
in the last like 40 years uh and that's part of the problem and that's why and the thing about

707
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,280
a bail fund right which is what we were raising money for on on the the the vican hope stream

708
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,240
was like if you give to a fund like that what i think is really cool about it is that they will

709
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,560
they post bail for someone but then when that person goes back to trial they do get the bit

710
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,600
get the money back and then they can use it again to post bail for someone else so this is just like

711
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,960
a fund of money that that this organization now has to like keep people out of that situation

712
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,320
i just described you know in the future going forward like this is not just going to be something

713
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,120
that's used for relief during like arrests in the wake of the protests like the cash bail thing is

714
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,760
always a problem it's not just right now although for right now i think a lot of these organizations

715
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,800
are focusing on keeping protesters out of jail which is good um anyway that was that was pretty

716
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:16,160
based um oh speaking of that unless anyone else has anything to say because i this was

717
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,120
uh separate from the separate from that stream which was giving to the for the Richmond fund

718
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:28,400
i i donated to my my the massachusetts fund and because i did that and then with the help of a

719
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:38,080
little guy of a guy uh uh by the name of uh uh cuttle sol or or cicada um did you see that tweet

794
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,160
top let me read here a number of individuals companies outlets and media institutions have

795
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,880
stepped forward to announce that they support the groups enabling riots violence vandalism theft

796
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,160
assault and murder dab taking place at the hands of vandals and thugs across the united states of

797
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,840
america and even looking to find out which companies brands and content creators have

798
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,760
betrayed the trust of the american people by aligning with groups that support the destruction of

801
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,640
and they said all games journalism was bad and western value this is what i call in the trend

802
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,520
this is what i would call ethical games journalism uh where i forced to point out an example

803
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,320
which in these modern days i feel like i am constantly these feminists sparking at the door

804
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,360
discord i'm howling at the moon

805
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:57,200
megatron get out of here buddy is megatron a brony i think he probably is he's got definitely

806
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:04,400
he's got the look in his eye they're both hasbro products don't you know oh you brand connection

807
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,200
they're probably best friends i wonder if there was ever a transformer uh in in the

808
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,080
friendship is magic there's gotta be some reference i mean that's a fucking those boys are in deep

809
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,720
dude do you think there's a transformer

810
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,080
hmm uh no

811
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,880
like a transition or are they all by definition trans they're all non but wait actually i suppose

812
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,840
they are binary unless they're those kinds like optimists that have multiple forms uh you know

813
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:41,040
i feel like this might vary from canon to canon do do do do they have a gender like before they

814
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:48,960
come to earth i don't there are clearly female seeming in the old robots on earth right in the

815
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:58,240
old cartoon there were like okay they they don't they like they like take their form when they get

816
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,520
to earth right well but the form that they take is actually usually like like optimus was a fire

817
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,680
truck yeah because there's a fire truck i think he already looked like normal humanoid optimus

818
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,640
his normal humanoid optimus is like his normal like off world form like that's what he looked

819
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:18,240
like before informed by the fire truck this is like elements of that in the design clearly yeah

820
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:32,080
this is a host of juju situation yeah um i i feel like i feel like they i'm i'm i think they have

821
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,680
a fucking i think there are girl autobots which means there are guy autobots or

822
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:48,960
like before like before because from the cartoon which means which means that they have gender

823
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,240
but i don't know if they can be but are they assigned a gender at birth right you have to be

824
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:01,040
you have to be assigned a gender at birth to then become trans by changing your it you know

825
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,240
we don't know the anatomy there could theoretically be some sort of gender

826
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:10,640
since i am sure they don't have fucking dicks and p-holes they are probably not assigned to the

827
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,760
gender at birth the two sexes dicks or p-holes and therefore i don't think they can be trans

828
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:23,040
oh wait now that is true this is my i see i see any any any fucking hey what's the generic word

829
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,920
for an autobot or like a member of the species that is either a an autobot or a decepticon the

830
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,000
only thing that comes to mind is transformer but i don't know if that's actually legit or not

831
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,600
okay uh wait they're from no wait they're from a planet right robot what's the name of their

832
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,000
planet or they're they're cute oh shit i should know that they're from a big fucking hyper cube

833
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,480
in space right big minecraft flick there is a name for it there was a show called like uh

834
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,320
transformers colon something and it was like the name of that because it took place on there like

835
00:58:52,320 --> 00:59:00,320
after everyone was fucking dead uh oh i can't remember mega trans formers yeah home home planet

836
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,840
is called yeah cybertron i don't know this cybertron so maybe they're like cybertronians

837
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,120
or something that would make that would make sense but then again would every like if you're

838
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,440
like a deer and you're brought from earth somewhere are you an earthling or are you like a deer you

839
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,960
know is it like what's the sub category there i think you're you're both well i think i mean

840
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:28,880
you're both i think that the only thing that lives on cybertron are the these things well at this

841
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,360
point that's definitely like like it like if you are from thank if you are like i don't think they

842
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:39,360
like also have like others like native species i think it's just this one kind of being comes from

843
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:45,360
this thing uh yeah yeah maybe it's not even uh maybe it's an artificial planet created by someone

844
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:53,440
it looks like that it doesn't look like a normal uh uh place it's like a big fucking like spherical

845
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,440
like clockwork thing well i gotta google it it's like it's like it looks like um it looks like

846
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,760
fucking uh uh uh coruscant but like that's also been hollowed out and like the inside of it is more

847
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,600
coruscant but you know is is that hard to believe that uh over time this civilization could have

848
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,680
hollowed out their planet because they don't need you know it could have been i don't know i just

849
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:21,680
kind of it doesn't feel right like these like i'm pretty sure that they that these cybertronians

850
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,760
don't have like a biological origin but maybe well i mean maybe like they were created by

851
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,560
like originally but you know not not their specific maybe i don't know maybe not maybe not

852
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,240
maybe the all spark just sprang from the nothingness maybe maybe uh uh well let's see where did

853
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,960
where did cybertron where did cybertron come from i don't know is there a wiki i bet there's a

854
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,520
fucking i'm sure we gotta talk to victor cybertron planet us up i think wiki uh uh general uh

855
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,880
marvel comics cybertron was a was the what was the adopted form of the lord of the light gods

856
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:07,120
primus who trapped himself and unicorn in baron asteroids it's a god trapped in an asteroid

857
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,000
which or a does a marvel or a multitude of gods which they then shaped in their physical forms

858
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,360
while unicron turned his prison into a transformable humanoid body primus reformed himself into a vast

859
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,960
Saturn sized machine world home for a robotic race he created to fight unicron with similar

860
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:30,240
transformation abilities okay all right there you go it's just a god manifesting as a as a machine

861
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:38,160
sphere gave birth to a species uh yeah all right there it is now at least according to this now we

862
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,160
know if they all agree on that i know unicron is no that's just the first one that's the first one

863
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:56,720
from the marvel comics continuity okay from the cartoon um oh okay yeah um 12 million years ago

864
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:04,080
no that's that's later okay i guess maybe they maybe they don't go into where it comes from

865
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,240
in the real quick just listen to this sorry okay this is this could we could probably spend the

866
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,520
rest of the episode just talking about uh transformers canon please don't indeed okay let me leave

867
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,800
you with this one detail no i went so that that second god or whatever unicron i just went to his

868
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:24,080
wiki page on the transformers wiki and this is the description at the top of the page quote

869
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:31,200
a unicron or lots of unicrons did lots of stuff in the primex universal cluster it's not all very

870
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,160
clear primex that is the description universal cluster okay and then on the right there's a

871
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,080
there's a cool picture of unicron which is captioned with i usually don't look nearly

872
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:46,320
as cool as this as he holds the planet earth in his hand um who's writing this uh all right

873
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:53,120
they're not taking this very seriously that's from the transformers yeah yeah the tf wiki.net

874
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:59,760
which sounds authoritative i mean what article i linked the unicron article unicron in generation

875
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,520
one oh okay well this is gonna have all kinds of the oh wait which is distinct from the main

876
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,000
there's a main unicron that was generation one the the cybertron article is much more professional

877
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,400
unicron's main page it because cybertron is the home planet of the transformers and usually the

878
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,920
body of their creator primus cybertron is blah blah blah blah blah okay you know what on the main

879
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,000
one let me just say unicron is the eternal arch enemy of his twin brother primus also known as

880
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,880
the lord of chaos the chaos bringer the planet eater blah blah blah blah blah there you go he

881
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,560
wants to consume the multiverse understood thank you but would they say trans rights though

882
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,240
i don't think they would i think they're cowards but they say they'd say transformers

883
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,040
transformers rights no not good enough they're recuperating it

884
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,880
it's an alt right dog whistle on this wiki there's a lot of shit going on here uh all right well in

885
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:01,200
any case um i just let you know i've got a voicemail unless uh you guys want to uh let me go for an

886
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:07,120
hour i i got a thing a little little thing to talk about speaking of being a traitor to america

887
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:14,960
to traitor to western values uh i've decided my punk only fans is doing well uh it's really funny

888
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:23,120
um that's there's a brand new image set of punk showing her gourds like you get to see them for

889
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:29,200
real saw it damn how did i see that wait did you post it in a discord server and that's how i saw it

890
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,000
it was that's costing yourself my business yeah costing her my business you're a leaker

891
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:43,600
i did that well it was just you munchy me and kazi yeah but i've decided because most of those

892
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:48,720
people because the only fans is five bucks a month i'm going to consolidate that into my patreon

893
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,800
because patreon takes less of a cut than only fans does only fans is kind of i see kind of a

894
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:02,080
shit kind of an asshole what kind of percentage like ten percent less more um all right it's one

895
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:07,760
fifth i think twenty percent yeah so what so what you're saying is that these images are also

896
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,960
going to be available on your patreon yes at the five dollar exclusively yes good so so if you want

897
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:23,440
that you you got it i must now give i have been pondering this does this do these images inform

898
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,680
pumps uh canon like idea like is this canon pump it must be you know alt universe i don't know it

899
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,360
could be could be just uh um like is all porn of every anime character canon i mean you know i mean

900
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:41,040
if i'm just curious if the creator of the character is making it and it's like all done in character

901
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:46,960
then and i would then i would say i would assume that i would i would assume that it is canon until

902
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,840
notified otherwise well yeah that's why i'm asking the thing about it right is that

903
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:58,560
punk is a vegetable i don't want to follow no slut i don't want to know so cheap ass bitch ass

904
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:06,000
he thought well that's what that's what she is i'm sorry punk is a is a vegetable and and not a

905
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,880
mammal and so uh the things that are attractive about human females and males she doesn't understand

906
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,040
she doesn't care so it's like it's like doing this stuff isn't even sexual she doesn't even

907
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:23,840
understand she's like how these idiots have given me money that is like the the canon character

908
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:29,600
interpretation so she's not being slow that's why she's just doing stuff it seems like she's being

909
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:38,080
a slut but uh in fact we are we are incorrect what does what does constitute a sexual display

910
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,640
spilling your pumpkin guts you know it would be it would be on the inside no no no no showing her

911
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:49,120
stamen no it would it would be it would be things like uh pollination like bees yeah yeah yeah

912
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:56,640
like like plant things like showing her roots the stamen yeah yeah yeah yeah the seed her seed

913
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:04,000
pods she is like if you give her a bouquet of roses she will get like super blush like oh my god

914
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,200
i can't believe you would do this like you fucking pervert she throws them back at you these are just

915
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,560
like a handful of good joker china's you've handed me now remember all those absolutely

916
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:22,320
hilarious bucket jokes in homestack yeah row the potential is this is this is this is the the angle

917
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:27,760
i'm going for okay i got you i got you i mean obviously it started as a joke and it's not going

918
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:35,040
to be like a running thing when punk has her like uh return as a canon character in a comic which will

919
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:42,160
happen punk too uh you hold the camera during my only fan shoot uh yes thank aliex takes the pictures

920
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:49,200
on our phone aliex aliex getting all the money punk's just right yeah but yeah that's that's

921
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:55,200
that's about that go to go to patreon dot com slash give and take yeah probably do that

922
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:04,160
sounds seems like a good idea like a plant um i got some i bought some more worm stuff

923
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:12,720
yeah just yet yesterday yesterday okay i bought like a big shipment of the isomalta oligosaccharides

924
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:19,360
which as you as i've said many times is the main ingredient in my um in my uh fucking uh the worms

925
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:24,720
that i've been making but i have i want to start branching out and using even weirder stuff here

926
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,400
let me tell you i spent like a hundred dollars on some more uh fucked up shit yesterday i'm gonna

927
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:36,240
experiment right because the the the gummies that inspired the the sweet smarts brand that inspired

928
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:41,600
me to like try this they have a bunch of different varieties and they have different textures and they

929
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,080
have different uh uh like ingredients so i wanted to get some more shit and just see what can i do

930
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:55,120
to get like different consistencies so i got um sure uh uh locust bean gum powder

931
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:07,200
uh guar gum uh kappa carrageenan uh agar agar powder um yeah okay what else what uh wait

932
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:16,960
did i buy pectin yes wait i ordered i ordered that yeah okay pectin yes uh citrus pectin

933
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:25,120
and i'm so fucking excited for all these weird powders and goose um i gotta i got a big box of

934
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:32,320
like a big like sampler of like all these different like food colorings i got a new i got new uh uh uh

935

flavorings i got rose flavor dude dude i got rose flavor and i and i i was i wanted to taste it

936
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,400

939
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,240
this is amazing this tastes fantastic i'm gonna make i would make like black rose flavor right

940
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,400
they'd be like rose flavor but i'd dye them black that would be the the the flavor of that worm

941
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:13,040
ah right and it'd be like yeah it's like animal crossing um epic i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i

942
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,680
i guess this is like imagine i guess this is my new thing i guess this is my new like hobby or

943
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,640
whatever is like i i should get i should get different molds i should get more molds it's

944
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:29,120
yeah fish molds because like they have i try make it like hmm how can i make them how can i make

945
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,240
their consistency more like swedish fish how can i make their consistency more like a fruit roll up

946
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:38,400
how can i make their consistency more like this or that or the other thing product we just pecked

947
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,720
and do it just carrageen and do it what even are these things perhaps we could perhaps we

948
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:48,240
collab been and when i finished making my latest plaster mold uh for measuring my you know square

949
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:53,840
inches of surface area for my speedrun categories i thought you were gonna say dick make myself that

950
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,320
too dick will be part of the equation it will be part of the equation okay so you can fill that

951
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,000
up with your goo and we could make a nate mold maybe you know we could like it's you like just

952
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,680
posing like the statue of david or something and i just like fill that yes fill it up with like

953
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,840
pounds and pounds of this weird of this weird shit and then we can all eat it together

954
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,640
we can all like descend upon it and take bites out of it uh devour nate as you reach the dessert

955
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,400
cool what flavor do you want to be excellent uh i guess some sort of like lime yeah lime green

956
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,800
is good you want to be like let like lemon lime maybe yes that would be great maybe i can mix up

957
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,920
some kind of like citrusy like mountain dewy kind of flavor or something yeah i mean my favorite

958
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,320
has always been orange but lemon lime is good for the for the color aesthetic so i like that okay

959
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:45,440
well we can have oh oh oh there's i saw what was that other the the company i was ordering flavor

960
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,360
i've had like a flavor that was like a particular kind of orange but i i can't there is things like

961
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:58,960
blood oranges one i love blood orange wait wait wait wait um um can i i gotta find it i

962
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:05,520
i think it was the product where is the where is the product no uh i'll say while you do that

963
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:13,520
yeah i love blood orange mochi which i have had at Whole Foods uh every other mochi is so much worse

964
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:20,160
than the blood orange mochi including mango which masquerades really if it was the orange equivalent

965
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:25,200
really blood orange is so i mean hey everyone's got their own taste but this is like like there's

966
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:32,640
chocolate lame gay not cool blood orange is the best uh that's my expert opinion if you go to

967
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,280
Whole Foods you get those that's the one i highly recommend sometimes i'll want to be like oh i should

968
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,000
get like you know get like six of them i'll mix and match every time i'm disappointed when i'm

969
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,800
eating one that isn't blood orange just get six blood orange it's the way to go sounds delicious

970
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:55,040
and not highly recommend it at all no not keto at all no no no bur burgamut

971
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,720
burgamut haven't heard of it burgamut orange i hadn't either but it's some kind of like little

972
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:08,400
like green orange it's an orange even though it's green hey go figure am i right imagine that i

973
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,960
should have orange is a green until they should have got oh i forgot i should have got rice flour

974
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,280
because like i think i wouldn't i wouldn't use a lot of it because it's not keto it's not but if

975
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,880
you just use a little bit of it for like consistency next next time i go on a spree of like buying weird

976
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:30,880
shit i'll i'll get like a little a little bag of of of rice flour just just to just to like sprinkle

977
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,920
in just just see what just see what i because that's the main ingredient mochi right uh yes that's

978
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,480
right that's right yeah so you know pounded rice whatever i think i just pound rice or at least

979
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,120
in the old days i'm sure it's more complex i think there's uh there's really just pounded like with

980
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:52,480
hammers yeah i mean back in i mean i'm like a very inefficient way to make flour well this is a

981
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:57,840
historical like like an ancient technique technique of yeah they have like a very deep bowl i mean

982
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,600
mochi it's like it's like an art that people used to there were like artisans who specialized in

983
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:09,200
mochi back in the day yeah sure yeah cool okay indeed i noticed gib left by the way don't know

984
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:14,000
what's going on with that wait he did oh he i mean he yeah he just disappeared i don't know why

985
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,800
maybe um maybe his like he's got a no i was gonna say he's got a thing on his computer that like

986
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,520
turns off his internet at a certain time in the evening it's a little before that i think it has

987
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:30,640
caused him to uh spontaneously vanish from streams and the like before but probably it's not late

988
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:36,720
enough wait no oh yeah yeah well no it would be nine you can reach his like total amount of computer

989
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:42,160
usage time for a day i think and that might be i mean maybe maybe but i don't know but if that were

990
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:48,080
the case he it would be he would be leaving if it were time base he would have left at like

991
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:54,640
nine twenty five p.m. or so which just doesn't seem very like something like that um so probably

992
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:01,040
not that what else would have on my list oh i um i've been making pizza but making keto pizza

993
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,160
why did i put that on the list i did a tweet okay i did a tweet about a pizza image i saw that i

994
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,480
wanted to make and i asked the people to give me their pizza recipes yeah which i will ask for

995
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:15,440
again here i'll link the tweet to people uh because i want to eat this specific kind of pizza uh

996
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,160
because it just looked so good i think it's just like a like a thin crust margarita pizza yes and

997
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:26,960
i uh want to make it it looks like it's great rt some kind of artisanal uh freaking um definitely

998
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,560
a margarita hey what happened uh internet cut out lol we were mocking you as if it was your

999
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:38,080
like oh he reached his time yeah it was it was the it was the time limit it was the the the too late

1000
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,440
to stream the cold turkey it's 4 30 time for your dick flattening sun get in here it's time for

1001
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:54,080
my going to bed flattening my brain flattening that that crust that crust looks really good it

1002
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:00,160
reminds me of papa geno's yeah people were saying did you work at a pizza it's similar

1003
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,600
i'm sure this is better than papa geno's but it's got that same sort of like

1004
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:09,680
bready bubbly crust consistency that's i really like that's my favorite yeah my favorite i want

1005
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,920
this shit i'ma make it one of these days uh when i get around i definitely want to be able to make

1006
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:20,240
that pizza bread that is my favorite right is when when it's like authentic italian um restaurant

1007
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:27,200
like pizza that is like fresh from zeovin like uh like yeah whatever the what do they use the giant

1008
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,880
oh here's the questions and the and the big uh the big like the big like paddles yeah yeah

1009
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,800
have do you guys have any experience with a pizza stone because i think that a pizza stone

1010
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,920
is the answer to getting the crispiness in this kind of way because i need like a hotter amount of

1011
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,200
probably the really fancy boys make their pizza on a pizza stone yeah i was looking around it's

1012
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,960
like 30 to 40 bucks so like not exactly cheap but i might like hit up a thrift store and see if i

1013
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,040
can just find one that's like five bucks or something do you just like take the trays out

1014
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,560
of your oven and put a pizza stone in there no you you put it on i mean okay you just put a

1015
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,960
stone in there and it heats up for a long time and that makes it like i think generally it retains

1016
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,920
heat really well so it gets hotter i think the idea is that it heats evenly or something because

1017
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,200
like of the okay like the the the conductivity of the pizza stone or whatever i think that's

1018
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:21,040
what that's the reason why it's it's different from like a pan and people are telling me this

1019
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,200
is the way to go and i'm willing to invest because i want to give the shot i mean if you want if

1020
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:32,720
you're wanting to make deliciosa authentic italian style pizza i mean indeed seems seems like the

1021
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:39,280
pros use a stone but i don't know could be a could be a spook could all be a scam could be a sigh it

1022
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,920
would be worth trying to just get the dough really good and then putting it in the oven and if the

1023
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,600
oven is the problem then then you get the stone yeah you know that's a reasonable idea i'm gonna

1024
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,000
i'm gonna do some experimenting i want i want this to be a thing i do oh it does this looks so good

1025
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,840
like the i mean i would probably put more sauce honestly because i love sauce but just like little

1026
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,280
bits of cheese the leaves the incredibly crispy thin crust yeah i'm god damn it's driving me wild

1027
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,280
one day one day oh and you know what on this front some people are like nat what about your diet

1028
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:14,800
or something i've actually been so fucking good about exercising the last two weeks and uh well

1029
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,200
not counting my calories every single time but uh been better good on my diet and i counted them all

1030
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,080
today i'm doing it again so shut the fuck up everybody i got it under control i can make a

1031
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,320
pizza once in a while and it will not break the bank feels good though i've been feeling great

1032
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:33,520
like break the bank no need for yoga my my profit margins are so razor thin i can't i can't afford

1033
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:41,440
i can't afford a authentic uh a ball maza mozzarella i can't afford instead of i can't sit

1034
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:46,640
of a grandma's heart surgery i have to get this pizza stone bro it was one of the other and

1035
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,720
she would want me to live well rather than her she wouldn't want to live in a world where i can't

1036
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:57,120
enjoy the authentic break of an experience just like in the old country precisely then

1037
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,720
a grandma you say in front of her tombstone as you chow down

1038
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:10,720
it's like cough coronavirus into her face epic simply epic grand mazinga

1039
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,080
cool um yep so that's my quest i'll get back to you on that so this will be my gummy bear thing i

1040
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:23,760
guess i have one more thing i could talk about from this week which is i played i played dnd again

1041
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:31,600
the further adventures of higgs ozaks the dry um the frog man uh and how's he doing uh the thing

1042
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:38,960
about we we had like a pretty long sesh this was this was on saturday i think and um the thing

1043
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:45,120
about it is that the entire it was like all just arguing it was like we did have a fight but it was

1044
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,760
like the the fight maybe lasted like like 45 minutes it was like three and a half hours of just arguing

1045
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,880
about no we should join the mage's guild no we shouldn't join the mage's guild no we should we

1046
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,040
should go to ice wall no we should go to junction no we should go this other place

1047
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:07,200
or no we should we it was just it was just uh you know that's that's the experience that's

1048
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:15,200
that's what it's all about i guess that's the tabletop life baby uh i mean i guess it was fine

1049
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,640
i guess it wasn't too annoying i'm not i'm not even trying to complain i'm just saying it's funny

1050
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,960
that this is this is what this is what the really the nuts and bolts of it boils down to

1051
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,800
is just like and i'm just and i'm just over here i gotta tell you i gotta tell you i have

1052
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:37,360
this is separate from talking about the the game in in specific but in general i have the

1053
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:43,760
hugest pet peeve and a bunch of my fellow players do it and i it is like really hard for me not to

1054
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:49,920
get like annoyed it is really hard for me not to like say something sometimes and be a dick because

1055
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,120
i know no one wants to hear it because i guess it's just a preference but my preference is better

1056
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:01,200
and everyone who disagrees is fucking stupid and playing the game wrong um i hate it when a player

1057
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:07,600
will like will like want to do something right like they want to like maybe they want to look

1058
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,240
for something like they think they might they think they might like want to look for some

1059
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,400
somewhere because they think they will find something like in a room or whatever and they say

1060
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:24,560
can i roll for perception to find x like if they want to find a clue it's like

1061
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,800
can i roll for perception to find a clue i i hate that so much but what what you're supposed to do

1062
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:36,560
in my opinion and i kind of think that anyone who has a different opinion is just wrong and not

1063
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:44,800
valid is you're supposed to say okay well i'm gonna investigate the room i think maybe i'll find

1064
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,280
this right you might even not have to add that last part i kind of think even that's a little

1065
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,000
bit leading maybe you should just say okay i'm gonna investigate the room i'm gonna look for

1066
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:02,320
stuff what do i find right you don't say when my when my fellow party members pick up the die

1067
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:08,640
on their own when the dm did not tell them to and they say i'm gonna i want to make like a um

1068
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:17,120
i want to make like a uh uh i want to make a insight check like to see if he's lying it's like no

1069
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:26,080
you if ideally the dm would say make an insight check on their own and you would and then you

1070
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,480
would roll and then they would tell you if they're lying or maybe if they don't do it maybe you just

1071
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:36,880
say hmm does he sound sincere do i think he's lying and then the dm would say make a roll

1072
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,000
and then you would do that and then they'd say yes you do or no you don't or you're not sure

1073
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,320
that's the way you do it everything else is wrong and ruins the game okay my favorite is when i you

1074
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,360
just you're like i'm gonna do this instantly rolls dice for anyone can say anything i got a 20 i win

1075
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,680
it should be i will really strongly feel like 100 of the time you roll the dice when the dm

1076
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:05,760
tells you to when the dm tells you a roll is required and at no other time yeah that makes

1077
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:11,760
okay let me get this straight so like if some character's talking and it's never up to you

1078
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,400
what role you're making the dm tells you what role you don't say can i make a perception check no

1079
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:22,160
you can make one of those if the dm says make a perception check jesus christ so so like there's

1080
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:29,760
a character talking and i i'm being in character and i think he's probably lying so i say out loud

1081
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:36,400
i don't trust this guy um and the dm would say well roll to see if you can like how would that

1082
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:42,240
work should i you would say that should i not say a declarative statement no you can you can say that

1083
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:48,720
i mean i guess you could say that it would probably be a little more effective it'd probably be a

1084
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:54,880
little more helpful to say to ask the dm for clarification like do i think he's lying does

1085
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,160
it sound like he's lying or even just even just is he lying because the answer to that is make a

1086
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:06,400
perception check or make an insight check um uh you that's that's how you should do it the there's

1087
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:12,000
just i really think that it is an i just really think it is overstepping a player bounds to be

1088
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,160
deciding what roles they want to make that's not their job and i think then remember when i really

1089
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:24,000
think it's like it's like it's bad i hate it it makes me remember college academy we had that dm

1090
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,680
i think his name was kevin something i mean i'm not going to say his name if i remember it

1091
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:33,120
powers kevin powers okay well there you go it's a common it's not that weird a name so i don't

1092
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,480
feel like we're dodging anyone all right sure this guy had an incredibly deep voice and he was the dm

1093
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:44,160
in like the dnd clever the it was it was it was like a summer program that we did yeah yeah and

1094
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,160
yes and you know ben was older than me so he did it first yes there was a whole bunch of cool stuff

1095
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,680
about that but about this guy specifically i remember there was a class you could take that

1096
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,080
it was the class you could sign up for was called fantasy because it was structured like college

1097
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,840
right you would choose your classes as though where you were picking from a college curriculum

1098
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,080
but they were just you know it was some of them were more like educational and some of them were

1099
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:09,040
more just like kind of like sort of camp activities and it was held on a college campus and you would

1100
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:15,520
go from room to room in like in a call yeah and this it was a stone hill college in massachusetts

1101
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,920
and um oh yeah yeah there were there were ones on like rocketry where you would build a little

1102
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,960
model rockets or i did that one i did that one a lot uh it was really popular and and one of them

1103
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,160
was called fantasy adventures and it was a but it was just you play the indy lol that was the best

1104
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:36,320
one yeah it was the best one everybody and kevin powers was this this like fucking scrawny ass

1105
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:42,400
stork of a man i say man he must have been pretty fucking he must have been like probably like 18

1106
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,280
at the time but you know we were in like middle school so it seemed like he was he was probably

1107
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:52,400
like a college student or something or maybe i maybe a woman is like 20s his voice was so low

1108
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:58,480
it made him seem older i think that he was not i think he was maybe like very early 20s at the

1109
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:05,840
oldest i could see that yeah yeah but he seemed like i just considered him an adult at the time so

1110
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:13,200
yeah yeah um yeah and he was so scrawny but he had this deep booming voice he he sounded like a

1111
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:19,440
a little bit like george tekay but like yeah he had a vibe i don't know he's like

1112
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:28,240
yeah it's the i i do not one time we asked him about like like the subject of like j rpgs came

1113
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,720
up i don't we wouldn't have been in the same class so this is just me but yeah i am the subject of

1114
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:41,200
like j rpgs this stuff came up and he said like mm i do not loathe despise or detest games such as

1115
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:49,200
final fantasy that was the best compliment he could get i do not loathe despise or detest

1116
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:57,280
one time he just showed um the record of lodos war the anime we watch that we watch and in hindsight

1117
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,520
based i don't understand what the relevance is other than that it is a movie that has like dnd

1118
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:09,200
like tropes in it like elves and bards i guess the idea was that it was like a good example of like

1119
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,800
what like adventuring should feel like with like all different like like a character sort of

1120
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:20,640
playing a different role in the party yeah it does feel like a very dnd like adventures sort of

1121
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:28,800
story he also he please he showed us that was where i saw he showed me um um print the princess

1122
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:34,880
bride and the justification for that the justification for that was like this is what combat should

1123
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:40,960
feel like or can feel like it was like yeah making like like incorporating witty banter

1124
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:47,200
into your like it doesn't just have to be the idea was like combat doesn't just have to be a

1125
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,440
dull like dice rolling affair you you can like yeah you throw in some witty banter and then

1126
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,600
he played the fucking sword fight scene he was like this is this is how it ah this is how it

1127
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,520
should be they don't make them like they used to honestly i think he kind of just wanted to show

1128
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,800
us some of his favorite nerd shit uh which is totally which is totally fine yeah and no problem

1129
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:14,160
when i was uh i was briefly a japan like tutor or whatever in college uh where like the people

1130
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:19,360
who were like years behind you would like you just help them practice or whatever on sometimes um

1131
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:27,280
there was uh one time the the the tutors who are tutored me would just play us anime and so i followed

1132
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:33,440
suit by when i was older i think i think i showed everybody um i know he showed us sayonara zetsubo

1133
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:39,440
sensei which actually is a pretty wait that's pretty high-level complex puns wait kevin kevin powers did

1134
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,400
no no no this is when i when i was in college when i was like learning japanese uh from like

1135
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,480
older kids or older young men or whatever uh anyway i think mate what did i show him i don't

1136
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,720
know yeah actually i don't think we didn't show him anything i think i just watched sayonara zetsubo

1137
01:28:54,720 --> 01:29:01,280
sensei and i grilled them in grammar because i was a hard ass as i recall kevin but they learned

1138
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:09,680
kevin powers had a rule okay i maybe i got my like hard maybe i got my my philosophy of dnd from him

1139
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:15,360
i think i must have yeah he like i'm kind of a stickler for the whole for the don't ask the the dm

1140
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,880
to make a role thing clearly i think that is important but nobody else agrees and i just

1141
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:30,240
guess i just got a fucking deal with that um uh kevin had a rule in his thing which i think is

1142
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,200
good like if you if you if you follow the spirit of it i think it is a good rule that improves the

1143
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:42,560
game but like with kids i think it just was like too much of an ask and it ended up derailing the

1144
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:49,120
game yeah a lot but i don't know it i'm not sure if i think its effects were good or bad in this

1145
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:58,960
particular scenario but his rule was not only like never ask can i make a role his rule was never

1146
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:08,080
ask can i do something right you never ask the dm can i do this thing um the appropriate like the

1147
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:14,720
only thing you should be saying is like you you might like you it like it's up to you to gauge

1148
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:19,840
your character's capabilities right yeah like if there's a if there's a 10 foot gap and you

1149
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:26,560
want to know can i jump over it like you should know like can my character clear a 10 foot gap or

1150
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,960
like what sort of a skill role is required for a 10 foot gap how likely am i to do it like that's

1151
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,560
up to you to decide it's not up to the it's not up to the dm to tell you yes if you tried to jump

1152
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:44,640
you would make it so his rule was yep if you say can i jump the gap he in turn he automatically

1153
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:50,720
interprets it as you attempting to do it so if you yes i remember that oh yeah can i do this you

1154
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:57,120
your character you have done it to find out you have done it make a role yeah oh i remember that

1155
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:03,440
and it was pretty it was great it was pretty it had some pretty funny consequences that was good

1156
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:09,120
shit he knew what he was doing i feel like that's i feel like that's a little harsh uh and maybe if

1157
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:16,240
your dm is nice they should say like i don't know what do you think or i don't know can you or do you

1158
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:21,520
want to roll to find out or something yeah i suppose i think if you're a little more but i think he

1159
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:27,440
wanted to really make a line in the sand like that's not how you play you're not asking the dm to

1160
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:32,080
tell you what's gonna happen you're this college academy man you're here to learn yeah you're here

1161
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:37,920
you gotta you gotta either like what do you think or if you don't know are you willing to risk finding

1162
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:44,720
out right mm-hmm but i was gonna say one example that came to mind uh when you when you began this

1163
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:51,360
about his well all the stuff was that um he would ask us uh no no what was it oh god i'm blanking

1164
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,960
there was a very specific thing oh yeah right right that the thing that you started at the beginning

1165
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:01,040
of like um uh like i i searched the room i want to roll to search the room or whatever yeah uh

1166
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,880
whenever we when i someone said that he would always say he would have the same answer or the

1167
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,040
same question he would respond with he would just say it's like i searched the room he would say

1168
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:17,360
where do you look and i'd be like i the the corner there is nothing in the corner yeah the the floor

1169
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:25,520
okay yeah i yeah he was definitely he was operating in like an older mindset under a system that was

1170
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,960
that had less like mechanical complexity and require and like lean more heavily on on role

1171
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:37,040
playing and i think for sure i think yeah like now like dnd like the like fifth edition and

1172
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:43,840
like later editions explicitly you can just kind of have like an investigation skill and you can

1173
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,080
just sort of be like make him kill himself if you heard that shit i bet yeah i'm sure he wouldn't

1174
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:53,600
like and he can and you can just kind of make a role like i i investigate the room and and even

1175
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:59,360
that you wouldn't necessarily even have to be that specific maybe unless yeah depending on the dm

1176
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:06,160
and like i get it on the one hand i get it because like if your character is like a detective right

1177
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,280
like they are they are a like a great detective or whatever they are like an investigator they're

1178
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:16,080
maybe like a rogue that specializes in like perception and like fact finding and like information

1179
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:22,960
they have really had like they would know how to search a room thoroughly in order to like you

1180
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,680
know leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of clues or whatever like they would know how to

1181
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:33,200
do it so to a certain extent i can understand why it shouldn't like the character would know

1182
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:38,400
where to look the character would do a thorough search if they're good at this so i i kind of

1183
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:45,040
get it on the one hand but on the other hand it's like well doesn't it take something away if like

1184
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,720
you're not you if like it's kind of taking the power out of the players hands like the players

1185
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:54,240
not making the decision of like of course what's what they're doing it's just sort of it's like

1186
01:33:54,240 --> 01:34:00,000
sonic running through a loop you know you're not playing the game the game is playing itself

1187
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,160
you know what i mean and you know that's a that i i understand and it's about tradeoffs because

1188
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,800
that's a that's a good example because i actually really love i do not really like the original

1189
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:14,640
sonic games but i love the advanced games where it is simply flow state and there's like no decision

1190
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:20,160
making required you just watch a thing go whoosh and it feels pretty sick well i would never okay

1191
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:25,680
but unlike that you're not you don't get a cool visual of sonic the hedgehog running at san xp

1192
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:31,760
huge when you're when you're uh when you're uh you're uh you're basically just batman dnd character

1193
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:38,880
is like you know ransacking the the the villain's lair for a fucking like whatever you know yeah

1194
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:44,720
you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah yeah no he was good times there's a there's a there's the

1195
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:51,360
older dnd mindset was more like it was like it was kind of like you were the character more so

1196
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:57,760
than like your character your character's like identity defines what they do i don't know one

1197
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:06,320
might say old good new bad who would be so bold there's i think that a lot of the role playing

1198
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,600
like i think that the like the new the newer mechanics that include things like an invest

1199
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:20,400
like a deliberate investigation skill do encourage this kind of like oh i'm uh i'm gonna roll for

1200
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:28,160
perception to find a thing uh here is like bad role playing that and that encourages that kind

1201
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:35,200
of thing even though i understand the justification and i kind of get it but i think i don't have too

1202
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:41,680
much of an issue or i think i think i think i kind of think i would be okay with it if people didn't

1203
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:48,000
then fall into maybe not everyone agrees with me that it is a bad habit personally i think it's a bad

1204
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,320
habit i wouldn't necessarily mind the mechanical the mechanical like option being there if it didn't

1205
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:58,640
lead to these things that i consider to be bad habits and like detrimental to the role playing

1206
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:06,800
experience um but they do in my opinion they do you think that uh like again i don't really care

1207
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,840
what people do they can play however they want but like it makes me wonder that like if that's the

1208
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:15,760
kind of game you want to play it feels like it like a jrpg would be more your your kind of thing uh

1209
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,040
but i mean you know doing things in a group i get it obviously it's gonna be fun however you want

1210
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:24,560
to do it's fine but it's like it's like if you're just if you're if you're saying okay i don't want

1211
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:31,360
to harp on this too much but that's like one less if you're saying like i i invest like i

1212
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:38,720
investigate uh do i find uh i'm like i'm gonna i'm gonna make a perception check to like see if

1213
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:45,680
there are any enemies out like approaching or whatever it's like are are you that's like it's

1214
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:51,040
like a that's like numbers that's like i don't know that's a mindset wherein the game is made up of

1215
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,960
numbers you know yes it is for sure is the wrong i don't it's not the mindset that i want to be in

1216
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:04,400
when i play the the game yeah yeah that's the x factor yeah yes all right well i think that i

1217
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:09,520
think i've said enough about that i made a whole fucking i made a whole fucking video remember

1218
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,040
that d&d that time that that tom made a video about d&d yes i do d&d good and i made the one

1219
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:19,200
saying d&d bad i think that wasn't my whole justification that wasn't my whole reasoning

1220
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:23,520
but i think i went into it more in that video and that video is probably like shorter than

1221
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,480
the like the the rant i just gave about it uh it's not that long was it like 10 minutes i don't

1222
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:38,080
remember go check it out check it out if you feel like it i guess okay but do not listen to tom's

1223
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:46,320
counter argument no don't give him a chance for air no he is a he is a freaking RLL role player

1224
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:52,480
he is a he is a munch he is he is one of those like what's the word uh he's a munch he's a number

1225
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:59,040
munchkin he is a he is a min maxer he is everything that's wrong with the with the genre

1226
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:07,680
damn fuck you tom die from a harsh man all right i got voicemails if you guys want to go to him

1227
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:12,320
they're all lined up ready to go yeah uh speak pipe link you know what it is ladies and gentlemen

1228
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,480
link there it is okay well i got it right here okay so first voicemail there's like uh what do we

1229
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:22,320
got eight total uh oh god the first one here christ don't worry they're not that long okay okay this

1230
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:29,440
first one right this first one is from jelly beaner uh called shaggy is an ass man and there's a there

1231
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:34,720
i received another message or two about this which is just that in the uh the pro anon cast

1232
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:41,440
they're having a civil war that's tearing them apart about uh ass versus tits so okay let's just

1233
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:46,960
hear what they have to say let's hear what shaggy says okay yeah uh we we know we can we can go

1234
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:52,240
let's let's i have okay let's let's play and hear what shaggy says okay go like i've got a serious

1235
01:38:52,240 --> 01:39:02,160
conundrum for you guys ass or tits i'll give you a hint it's ass man it's tits it's always

1236
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:12,560
no fuck you die die that's it that's the full message answers tits next they they they came to me

1237
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:18,880
for a for a statement because i made that twist that said tits are epic recently right right right

1238
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:24,880
um and and what i responded to the exclusion of everything else presumably no that's that's my

1239
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:35,280
stance i let me explain um in the situation like tits i would prefer but tits with no ass combined

1240
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:41,520
is strange if you have it's a bad look if any ever like a flat bored but i was like there's

1241
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:47,040
something wrong there but if you have a butt and you don't have tits that's some that that works

1242
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:54,400
so like in two out of two out of two situations the ass is like the solid foundation upon which

1243
01:39:54,400 --> 01:40:01,360
the tits can rest yeah but overall sure i would like i i am more of the tits man

1244
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:09,120
but then it needs the ass as support i feel like you've just made an ass argument maybe uh i mean

1245
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,760
there's a meme to show we're talking about this the other day uh due to uh this contentious thing

1246
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:20,560
tearing the world apart i uh a point was made that um like asses there is less ability for an

1247
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:26,800
ass to be as horrendous as tits can be in their worst situation so it's something of a situation

1248
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:33,120
where ass is something more of a safe bet and tits can potentially be more spectacular at their

1249
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:37,600
heights i mean i'm sure somebody would agree yeah yeah tits can be more spectacular like there's

1250
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:46,720
only i yeah i i would be i would be more impressed by like incredible tits than i would be by an

1251
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:53,600
incredible uh yeah higher heights higher heights it's because it's the um the uh what's the word

1252
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:59,440
that there's is not a lot of it the scarcity the scarcity of good tits compared to the ease of

1253
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:06,560
having a good ass you know yeah i'm saying yeah i think so yeah i think so uh incidentally uh i i hope

1254
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,120
that the pro anon cast is aware of this because there is a in-depth discussion on this subject

1255
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:16,320
now it is it does have a conclusion but you should go check out the prison uh prison school

1256
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:22,720
manga where they go in depth into the deep biological like pre-human evolution roots did i i generally

1257
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:27,280
disagree with that with that argument we don't okay just because we evolved from that doesn't mean

1258
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,440
we have to stick with that forever okay i don't know if i've heard this the particular thing

1259
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:37,280
you're talking about but i've heard i'm skeptical of like pre-evolutionary justifications because we

1260
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:43,360
don't know we can only speculate and nobody like really knows like what the evolutionary purpose

1261
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:49,200
of like tits or ass or like why exactly would be they we are shaped this way is like in like a

1262
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:55,680
social context we can't say you know man's opinion yeah you know that there was this video by lindy

1263
01:41:55,680 --> 01:42:05,280
beige of all people talking about um the the strange uh fact that women human women do not

1264
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:11,840
have breasts only when they are like fertile in a like a mating season sort of way because other

1265
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,560
mammals their breasts are then you know you can't basically basically can't see them but when

1266
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:22,480
they're having babies they you know expand and then afterwards they go back but humans have

1267
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:28,400
sort of evolved to a point where because it's more visual because we're upright he goes into all the

1268
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:35,440
possibilities of like why it is that humans have like breasts for all the time rather than just for

1269
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:42,400
being pregnant this is an interesting video i'll try yeah okay maybe maybe the moid race was uh just

1270
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,880
getting pregnant consistently so like it wouldn't biologically there was no need to kind of change

1271
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:53,120
it's it's interesting to speculate on why we are different from other mammals but it but again

1272
01:42:53,920 --> 01:43:00,000
we can't like we can't know we can't really know why there is there kind of is no why

1273
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:07,520
yeah yeah or maybe there is rage is on yeah um well we'll leave it to the scholars over the

1274
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,440
pro and on cash to hash out i was gonna say did you see yeah did you see that the this image

1275
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:19,040
you probably did the tectonic improv made a ranking of course ranking the first 100 episodes

1276
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,680
you know what ben let there's a voicemail about that you know i'll just play it out of water right

1277
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,960
okay here let's let's play it and uh here what do you have to say right there go

1278
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:34,640
hello everyone just wanted to call in and mention that i recently made an infographic

1279
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:41,280
ranking the first 100 episodes of the pcp from best to worst and if you haven't seen it check it out

1280
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:46,880
something i want to bring up about it though is the starfleet section i gave each episode that had

1281
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:51,440
a starfleet mentioned a little icon but didn't tally the total amount of times it came up in

1282
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:58,720
the infographic so consider this a podcast exclusive scoop starfleet is mentioned by name

1283
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:06,560
38 times over the course of the first 100 episodes simultaneously a lot and also not as much as i

1284
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,600
thought all right that's all i wanted to say thanks for your time there you go that that means

1285
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:18,000
since starfleet is referenced in 20 he has on this infographic starfleet is referenced in 20

1286
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:25,200
out of the first 100 episodes which means that starfleet is referenced an average of just under

1287
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:34,240
two times per episode that it is mentioned in so most episodes i guess that yeah well no because

1288
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:39,040
there might be like certain episodes okay though the record for most starfleet references was

1289
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:45,840
achieved in weird utilitarianism episode totaling at 12 so 12 out of those 38 are just from a single

1290
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:55,440
episode which makes sense considering the topic of that one yes this is a best guy ever is the only

1291
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:01,200
member of the procrastinators to appear in each of the top 15 episodes he puts some particular

1292
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:07,600
emphasis on these top 15 and lethal aurora mage and mother's basement do not appear in any top 15

1293
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:16,880
episodes damn much dream talking mage too much dream talk that's right you lose you you you

1294
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:24,000
just collapse in the rankings if you talk about dreams it's been proven and there's been some

1295
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,160
debate i mean you know obviously everyone has their opinions the the much contentious uh the

1296
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:33,920
the much lauded yellow episode things we can't get into not making number one has the people

1297
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:39,920
rioting in the streets yeah that someone would defy that seems to be most peoples that seems to be

1298
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:46,160
the most common pick for number one yeah yeah i'd say so it gives the internet just die again

1299
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:52,880
we lost give again we'll see if he rejoins what a jerk what a freaking rube everybody loves the

1300
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,680
virginity episode though so that certainly belongs up there somewhere it seems schools i think i think

1301
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:02,000
tectonic has some weird big connection well not i'm not trying to call him weird but like school

1302
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,520
sucks being this high is unusual i bet he has a some you know maybe he has an opinion on it hard

1303
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:13,120
agree a hard agree with some of the things stated on that or maybe yes or maybe not maybe or maybe

1304
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,360
not i don't know maybe it's good is that is that a good banter episode i don't fucking remember i

1305
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:22,720
don't know you know i he would know he would know um uh well there is check it out yourself people

1306
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:29,280
it's it's there should we should we go on to the next oh he's back he's back yes gib hello welcome

1307
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:35,360
let us i missed the entirety of that voice call and whatever you said afterwards really well it was

1308
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,960
have you seen this that's enough this image from tectonic i i saw the image the rank i can't remember

1309
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,440
so many of the episodes and the contents of yeah i am so i can't i don't really have much to say

1310
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:52,800
about it i guess was this made in the context of the rewatch i do not know i do not know i mean he

1311
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,440
said he just went in no you know i don't think so because i don't i think the rewatch started

1312
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:02,160
way before the pcb was even founded and i don't think they're even to the beginning yet so uh

1313
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:08,160
like maybe that before oh as in they're starting from like pre-pcp yeah yeah that's right that

1314
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:14,800
i i think i think i saw him post this somewhere and said i am just in like you just saying i don't

1315
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:22,480
know why i did this yeah uh here you go and there it is well when they get to this part to the first

1316
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:28,000
100 episodes in the rewatch i guess i'll be interesting to see if people agree with these

1317
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:35,120
rankings or not yeah consider it consider make your rankings folks all right let's move on to our

1318
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:41,440
next one yes i was curious what you two thought if you could briefly oh i mean we were just saying

1319
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:46,560
that like everybody loves things you can't get into yellow episode uh virginity cast is great

1320
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,720
i you know the rest in terms of how they're ranked i don't really have an opinion

1321
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:58,320
yeah yeah no strong opinions uh okay let's go to our next one this is from gay boy scout

1322
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:05,600
babysitter oh yes uh okay listen up here we go go on a recent twitch.tv slash definitely best guy

1323
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,800
ever stream nat told a childhood story about his gay boy scout babysitter who ruined the family's

1324
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:16,000
legend of dragoon for ps1 game nat said he was fuzzy on the details though and would need to ask ben

1325
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:23,200
about it so can we please hear the full story about legend of dragoon for ps1 do you remember this ben

1326
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:30,000
do you remember this incident about the game breaking right there was there was a discus being

1327
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:37,920
thrown uh yes a kid in a kid in our boy scout troupe he was my age this kid jeff right i don't know

1328
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,800
why i think i brought the game to a fucking boy scout meeting just to show it off or something

1329
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:49,360
and this other kid just like took one of the discs and like threw it yeah and it broke the third

1330
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:54,320
disc and i was like what the fuck you just broke fucking my video game and he was like

1331
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:59,680
uh it was the third and three dis before dis and i was he was like oh you'll never get that far in

1332
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:08,400
any way what oh god no are you fucking kidding me this man was not a rpg gamer i don't remember if

1333
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:16,160
like and i think we we did in fact get that far and we oh yeah i did insist like no you broke my

1334
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:22,160
thing give me like fucking pay for it you broke my shit and i think like the they did they like his

1335
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:27,440
mom was made did make him like like you know pay me some money for like a replacement or whatever

1336
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:32,960
which is good but we did never we didn't get it till a way later yeah yeah like we had already

1337
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,240
gotten that far in the game and we're held up by it and so and so and when he finally got around

1338
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:42,320
to like giving us the the money giving me the money for it and like i ordered like a replacement

1339
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:50,000
yeah we had been like stuck for a while i never i eventually never i eventually never finished the

1340
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,760
game uh you you did yeah i think i only got to the end of the second disc and then never

1341
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:03,840
gotten me further in it so he was right no no i got there i just didn't play i just didn't go

1342
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:10,640
any more it's not the same it's a principle i have a i have a memory though it was right but

1343
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:17,920
it was a self-fulfilling prophecy he made that come true piece of shit jeff you i clearly remember

1344
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:23,920
you buying me a copy of the legend of dragoon was it like at this time like for my birthday you

1345
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,320
got it or something like years later because that's what i have in my head of that i bought you

1346
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:40,240
i think that maybe maybe okay i think i thought that i i had the game or or did you was it your

1347
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:46,080
game when when he broke it i thought it was mine yours i think it was yours at that time did it maybe

1348
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:55,520
like he bought me the replacement maybe i just like used that money that he gave me to buy the disc

1349
01:50:55,520 --> 01:51:00,240
and gave it to you because like you had gotten further in the game than i had because like you

1350
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:05,680
know i just don't know this is going back a long time i've lost some of these details yeah or maybe

1351
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:13,280
or maybe that's the best i got or maybe like it was my game he broke it i like got that far and

1352
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:20,080
then quit playing it he eventually paid it back for me you had played the game yes and had and wanted

1353
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:24,960
it again and i hadn't decided like i didn't even really care to replace it that much or had just

1354
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:30,800
forgotten about it but then eventually i got you a copy of the game as a gift because you did want

1355
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:37,520
to continue it i feel like that's the gist maybe or something like that i think by by the way i think

1356
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,960
the reason i was confused and mix things up because like i said like the boy scout troop

1357
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,840
leader whatever i was thinking of the another guy remember it was the i said babysitter mat one of

1358
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,080
the guys from our troop like an older guy came over and he babysat us and i believe we were playing

1359
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:56,720
frisbee with another ps1 discus related you know crisis we were playing frisbee with final fantasy

1360
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:01,680
eight disc why didn't break the disc but i think something else broke because i remember us all

1361
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:06,880
being like oh shit what did we do fuck we broke something i don't know if i was i involved in

1362
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:13,360
that i remember that something like that did happen but the details are very fuzzy yeah long

1363
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:20,480
time ago i don't know why we would do such a thing what a bizarre world boy scout troop

1364
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:27,200
members are the worst people yeah they're reckless they're full hearty fuck them and they're too

1365
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:31,920
cavalier and i don't care for it things cannot be replaced aren't the boy scouts like fucking

1366
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:38,960
disbanding or something because of all the like creepy sex shit uh i heard some talks of bankruptcy

1367
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:44,880
i'm not sure yeah that's it they went bankrupt i think they went bankrupt boy scout association

1368
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:50,480
or something like uh well i think it would be boy scouts of america right boy scouts of america

1369
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:57,440
is its own like entity i'm yeah it's separate it's like a separate uh a thing based on the i don't

1370
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:03,680
change their name to the scouts to not exclude women anymore or something well um try them all

1371
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:13,120
four exclude women it's fine just do it who cares um um um uh boy that's a fucking quagmire it is a

1372
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:20,000
quagmire no doubt about it um all right whatever we got another voicemail over this fucking place

1373
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:28,160
this one is uh from pancakes i am become death destroyer of sound boards uh yes okay take it away

1374
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:36,720
go bruh hi pancakes here listen no one hates sound boards more than me why is that especially if

1375
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:45,520
they're wielded by weak willed and weak minded people uh Nate however i'm 100 for everyone

1376
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:52,240
having a sound board on the pcp because sound boards are like nuclear arms you see if everyone has

1377
01:53:52,240 --> 01:54:03,600
one no one's gonna get a sound board they're flying after easy money they don't have the moral

1378
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:10,880
courage they don't have what i have uh did you did you build your own sound board yeah brick by brick

1379
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:16,480
piece by piece over like months and i mean did you choose what sounds are on it oh yeah of course

1380
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:22,160
of course okay to prepare each one and you know stick it in there and um i i'm with this guy

1381
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:29,520
honestly down bitches i yeah i'm tempted to take it i'm tempted to follow this advice that's pretty

1382
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:50,160
good right um easy money you're very powerful you're very spiteful uh understood uh yes we've

1383
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:59,360
got a new voicemail called attack my titans okay go so i recently found out that about a year ago

1384
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:05,760
there was an attack on titan art exhibition and within this exhibition there was a single room

1385
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:13,040
that was completely black and in the room there was the i guess the artist the mangaka created an

1386
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:19,200
audio experience of what the finale of attack on titan will sound like and you can actually find

1387
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:25,840
this on youtube it's really cool super haunting really fascinating uh i have no interest in attack

1388
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:31,360
on titan until now where i just want to read it all because i'm fascinated at how this experience

1389
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:36,960
can be connected to the manga basically i guess a discussion or question is has there ever been

1390
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:42,720
anything that has just really interested you like one single thing that you heard about from a piece

1391
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:48,800
of media that you instantly wanted to read or watch or experience thanks so much here's about that

1392
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:55,280
question uh boring but the actual the first thing about what this is this like audio experience of

1393
01:55:55,280 --> 01:56:01,520
what the ending of the series will be like by the mangaka that's that's pretty kooky i i googled

1394
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:07,760
it i could not find it on youtube by by the attack on titan guy he made an audio experience of the

1395
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,480
end of attack on titan do i have that right apparently yeah that's just nice soundboard

1396
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:18,080
easy money yeah that's what it sounds like

1397
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:29,200
that's uh shut up that's uh uh very strange is there dialogue i don't know i don't know i don't

1398
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:34,880
i could not find the damn thing i wonder like i want to know like how long it is and stuff i mean

1399
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,640
you're supposed to go there and like sit and listen it's probably like well i don't know i can only

1400
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:43,920
speculate i assume minutes as opposed to hours would be my guess but i don't know i don't know

1401
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:48,800
uh if anyone could find this link it because i couldn't find it and it sounds

1402
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:54,240
at least worth checking out um it's partly on youtube so there you go is there any one thing

1403
01:56:54,240 --> 01:57:03,920
that's made me interested in a piece of media um art uh is good i don't know uh see it's boring

1404
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,920
seeing people with troll avatars on uh something awful made me wonder what Homestuck was lamal

1405
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:16,880
i guess reading sweet bro and hella jeff which i did independently made me then read Homestuck

1406
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,960
you know because i love sweet bro and hella so the real question is what made you read Homestuck

1407
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,560
yeah that's the actual question yeah gibb care to comment

1408
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:31,440
he just not care to comment all right we'll move right along uh maybe he's just gonna think

1409
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:36,400
again i don't know uh all right next voicemail this one is we got two more this is from mozilla

fennekin simply titled oppression go hello it's been a while here in voice jail i've gained the

1411
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:48,640
system enough to acquire a computer with internet access except i can only browse speak pipe and

1412
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:56,720
reddit but i happen to stumble across the capital of reddit r slash small dick problems here i

1413
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:03,360
witnessed the most oppressed minorities in society boys with a small pp with every piece of media

1414
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:08,560
we are deluged by the glorification of big dicks someone does something cool like save a kitten

1415
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:14,960
loot a target high gamer score that's big dick energy right there but bad things racism boolicking

1416
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:21,120
corporate greed watching anime that's small dick energy the board of small dick problems is an

1417
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:27,920
archive of real men who are discriminated against by all of society these men have lost the potential

1418
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:35,040
loves of their lives just for an unfortunate sequence of genes women have it so easy men are such

1419
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:40,880
primitive thirsty creatures that women of all sizes are valued sure there might be a bias towards

1420
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:48,000
larger breasts but they're countless men who prefer the small flat lolly chest but nobody and i mean

1421
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,280
no woman ever i hate this call yeah seven inch dick is cool but i'm all about that three and a half

1422
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:59,200
you know yeah we must take a stand for our stout gentlemen and unite against the common enemy

1423
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:04,800
