1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,300
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,760
I don't know, whatever. Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I got nothing,

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,340
I don't know, I got, did you like that opening jingle? That's all you're getting in terms

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,440
of your intro. Jumping right in, jumping right in, watch out. We're starting off as a Ben

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,840
Cast this week. I am all by myself. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know nobody likes me. I know

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:46,400
nobody likes me. I know, everyone just tolerates me. For Gibb's sake, for poor, sweet, it isn't

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Gibb's sake. But alas, she's not here. And I'm just going ahead. I don't need to explain

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:10,040
myself to the likes of you listener. You don't even have a podcast unless you do. Let me talk

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:19,760
about some stuff. Let me talk about this channel and what I did to ruin it recently. That's

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,280
not true. Well, I was trying my best. I was doing my best. I fucked up. I fucked everything

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:33,560
up. Not really, but a little bit. Here's the story. A while back, maybe we've been talking

12
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,400
about doing this for a long time, but a few months ago, we finally did it, which is Nate

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:50,160
wanted to transfer ownership and management of all the various PCP accounts, like the

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:59,480
Redbubble and the Google AdSense and the YouTube channel and what other things are there. Oh,

15
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:09,640
the Patreon, patreon.com slash the procrastinators, I think, if I've remembered the URL finally.

16
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,320
The Minecraft server, obviously, which is free now, free now to anyone who wants to

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,960
join. Link in the description for the Discord server, which will get you set up with that

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,040
if you want to join that. By the way, I hope we can stream some of that soon. I'm getting

19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,640
new internet. My shitty internet has been a big problem for a while when we've tried

20
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,800
to stream, but I am supposed to be getting new internet supposedly on the 13th, which

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,320
will be, I think, the day this comes out. Will that be this Friday? Yeah, it would be

22
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,920
this Friday. If that happens and it works going forward, I might be able to stream. I'm

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,120
a lot of apologize for how inconsistent that's been and how shitty that's been and how my internet

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,000
has gotten in the way of more regular streaming of the Minecraft server as well as other things,

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,240
but I'm sure that I will want to stream more once my internet is reliable, so that will be great.

26
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:12,560
I'll also be getting way off topic. I'm getting way off topic, but I guess I'll also mention it.

27
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Once my internet is up, I will want to start streaming on my Twitch again, the BenSaint Twitch

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:32,000
channel, which I used to do with some regularity. I had built up a little bit of momentum on there

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
a couple years ago, and then I fell off of it, so I would like to get back into that. My plan for

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,240
that is I'm going to be streaming Mega Man Battle Networks. I've never played them. I'm going to

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
play them for the first time, and I thought might as well do that on stream, so that's what I'll do.

32
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,760
I mean, maybe even starting next week, if the internet thing works out, that would be great.

33
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,400
But anyway, that's all off. By the way, I'll talk more about that, and in regards to Mega Man

34
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,320
stuff and Leicester stuff, I guess I'll mention that I do have a bunch of, I think I have like

35
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,080
14 or 15 unanswered questions for Q&As. I'll probably do another on my personal Patreon Q&A,

36
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:21,040
probably do that soon, actually, over on Patreon.com slash BenSaint, which has, by the way,

37
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:30,320
I said in the video that I would hold a Patreon vote for a lecture, let people decide a lecture

38
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,640
for me to do at 100 Patrons. At the time I had, I think about 35 Patrons-ish. Now I have almost,

39
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,360
I think I had 80, and then I lost like one or two after the end of the month or end of the year,

40
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,240
so I have like 78. So that's pretty good, but not quite at 100 yet. But soon, and a lot of people

41
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,120
have asked me for various, various different lecture topics, some of them are things I had

42
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,680
heard of and some I never had. So I genuinely don't know what I'll end up doing for that.

43
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
Probably will not do it, probably will have to get another lecture out. Maybe it'll be the

44
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Battle Network one, or I'd like to finish a different one. I'd like to finish another lecture

45
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,920
on something else while I'm in the process of playing through all the Battle Network games.

46
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm rambling. I'm so far off the original topic right now. Let me get back to it, all right.

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,480
So the Patreon and the YouTube accounts and the PCP accounts, Nate, you know,

48
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
wasn't really managing them, or he didn't want to manage them anymore. He gave them to me.

49
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,320
And one of the things that needed to be moved was, okay, there was an AdSense account for

50
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,480
Nate's channel. There was an ad, or actually, bafflingly enough, Nate's channels, like all

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,480
of Nate's channels and all the things he uses AdSense for, all used the, the T-Bap

52
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:02,640
AdSense account, the associated AdSense account for that. He, there was another AdSense account for

53
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:11,200
the PCP. And then, of course, I had my own, you know, Ben St. AdSense account. And I guess

54
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,080
YouTube got really, or Google got really finicky about multiple, multiple accounts on AdSense.

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,000
And even though it would make so much more sense to just have separate AdSense accounts for

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
separate channels, I guess it's really picky about like, oh, no, they don't want you having multiple

57
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,840
AdSense accounts. They want you to connect all your, your YouTube channels, all connect them

58
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,080
all to the same AdSense account. Whatever, right? So the P, it ended up, and this might have been

59
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
a result of the, the Garling House hack that might have been what caused the initial, this

60
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,640
situation. But the point is there were $82 in, in ad revenue in the PCP AdSense account.

61
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,320
And Nate had switched to the T-Bap AdSense account and the $82 was just in there. So he

62
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,400
transferred ownership of the PCP, like the email and the Gmail account, the Google account.

63
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,240
He transferred that to me. He gave me that and I, and I was hooking it up to my AdSense.

64
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,000
And it was like, it would, it wanted me not to use its own AdSense account, the one with $82

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,480
in it. It would let me connect the YouTube account, the PCP YouTube account to my AdSense. So now

66
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:39,440
what happens is ad revenue from the PCP, instead of going to its own AdSense, it goes directly to

67
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:49,840
my AdSense. And this is actually annoying because now I have to stretching. I just woke up, by the

68
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,120
way. The AdSense for my account and the PCP account both come and they're not differentiated.

69
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,840
So in the account, I just see one amount that I get every month and I have to manually go into

70
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:10,320
my YouTube analytics and look at the analytics and the views and the revenue and I have to personally

71
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:17,600
sort out how much of that is mine and how much of that is PCP money and then divide it up on that

72
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,720
basis. So it's annoying. I would prefer they just go to separate accounts so I could know this money

73
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,040
is for this, this money is for that, but they won't let me. Oh well. But I was really annoyed. I

74
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:35,600
wanted that $82 of PCP money. So I'm like, okay, well, I'm going to try and do, I'm going to try

75
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:44,640
and hook it up. So I tried to switch, right? I tried to switch back to the PCP account for the $82

76
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,760
and it wouldn't, and it gave me, and it said like, you know, this account is not approved. This

77
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
account, this is a duplicate account. Delete your duplicate accounts before you try to connect this

78
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,400
account. And I'm like, okay, well, I don't want to delete, I don't want to delete my account.

79
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Nate doesn't want to delete the tbap account that he's using through that all of his stuff is

80
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,360
connected through. So no, I won't do that. So it just thinks it's a duplicate account. I'm not even

81
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
sure if it thinks it's me or if it thinks it's Nate, but it knows it's a duplicate or it thinks

82
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,880
it's a duplicate. And so it just said, I tried to connect it and it said, no, you can't do that.

83
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,640
So instead of just not switching accounts, it disconnected from any AdSense account.

84
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,240
And it said, well, now, since you've tried to do this, you can't connect your account for 32 days.

85
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,600
So it disconnected the PCP account from any AdSense account for 32 days. In fact,

86
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
in fact, the channel is no longer monetized for 32 days.

87
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,280
I don't know why the 32 day restriction, but that's what it did. So

88
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,320
so basically for one month, the channel is no longer monetized,

89
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,720
which will cost about so that's about it varies month to month. But generally,

90
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,400
the channel makes about like 120, maybe 150 on a good month dollars in ad revenue.

91
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:21,760
So unfortunately, in attempting to retrieve this $82, I ended up costing us about $150.

92
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,880
Tragic, tragic. So I have to wait until I think like near the end of January,

93
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
because I did this near the end of December. I have to wait until the end of January to try

94
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,360
and fix this back and get the channel monetized again. Costs cost us money. I'm sorry. I did

95
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,200
my best. I wasn't trying to do I didn't know this guy. I didn't know it would do this. I don't know

96
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,520
why it would do this. I did, however, figure out a way to get the $82. The way to get the $82

97
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,720
is I just had to close that AdSense account, which is fine because it would not let me use it

98
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
for anything. So I just closed the account and it said like, yeah, when you close the account,

99
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,480
if there's more than they don't pay out regularly unless there's more than $100 in there. So $82

100
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
wouldn't hit that. But if you close the account, it will send you whatever is in there as long

101
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:23,280
as there's more than $10. So supposedly within the next two to three months, they will send me

102
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,240
because I switched the the associated like bank account to my bank account. So it will send to

103
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:37,120
my bank account $82, probably minus some fees. So at that point, what I will do is I will take

104
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,160
that $82 and I will apply it to the total PCP pay as though it were the money that had been that we

105
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,600
lost due to ad revenue that month. And so I hope to somewhat mitigate that loss with that still

106
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:58,640
will end up losing like, you know, $50, $70 or something. But it's, you know, so that's how

107
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:10,560
that worked out. Very stupid, very dumb, very bad. But what can you do? I'm hungry. I might go get

108
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,600
breakfast. I might just leave this recording on and just go get some food. I'm gonna do it. Fuck it.

109
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,960
Fuck it. A few moments later, I'm back. I put a quarter of a Kirkland brand

110
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,120
Supreme is it a Supreme Supreme cauliflower crust pizza as recommended to me by

111
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,520
by what's her name not a big jerk on Twitter. Yeah, that'll be so that'll be 20 minutes. So

112
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,960
let's see. So how much how much dead air can I feel for the next 20 minutes before I got to go

113
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:55,840
collect my pizza? The I changed my mind about that guy, that guy who moved in to the room

114
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,720
with the girl that lives downstairs in my house, I said in a previous episode,

115
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:11,040
I thought it was a feminine that they they cook all the time. Because it's like, I don't know.

116
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,200
I don't know why I said that. No, I do know why I said that is because I don't like cooking and I

117
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,840
wouldn't like spending cooking. So I just assumed I naively just assumed foolishly that he also

118
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,840
probably didn't like it and that they were just like he was like doing it like, I don't know, to

119
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,400
either as like a thing to do, or as like, I'm doing this for my girlfriend or whatever. And

120
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,280
that was stupid. I've changed my mind. And what I think now is that that guy just likes to cook

121
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,320
because I just see him doing it sometimes with the girl and sometimes but also just by himself.

122
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,720
So I think he just likes to do it because I never see her cook like when it's when it was just her.

123
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,840
So I think that's just his thing. And so I've changed my mind and I've decided that no, he's

124
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,400
he's he's drawn her into his world. It's it's alpha actually. So I salute it.

125
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,000
This is why you should never listen to me about anything.

126
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,360
You know, sometimes I sometimes I just have a sometimes I just I just form an opinion

127
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,680
off of preconceived biases. And then I just go with it. And I just and I just throw it out there.

128
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
I just throw it out there and I let the world tell me what they think about it.

129
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,640
And sometimes I revise it later. And sometimes I don't. And that's and that's

130
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
you know, I'm just drawing every I'm drawing everyone else into my own world. I'm at it's

131
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:51,120
the alpha thing to do. That's that's the that's the plan. All right. I have nothing else to say

132
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,840
about that, nor indeed anything. I used a okay. I don't know if I've ever mentioned this before,

133
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:07,920
but like my dad got me I think he got like everyone one year he got these these rotary tools

134
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,600
which are not drills. I mean, I think you can drill with them. They have drill bits in them,

135
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,040
but they're not really for drilling. They're like a drill but weaker.

136
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
They're just like a thing that you hold and you plug it in. And you can put a little thing on

137
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,800
the end and it'll spin. And it has all these attachments for it. And I think they're mostly

138
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,640
for like grinding or sanding or polishing. And I don't know what possessed my dad to think that

139
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,360
like, people definitely need to have a rotary tool for grinding, sanding and polishing. Maybe

140
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,960
one time he found like such a thing useful. And it came in handy in a pinch. And so he thought,

141
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,720
you know what, people, everyone needs to have one of these lying around. Just just in case.

142
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,080
Well, I use it for something for the first time this week. Because it had some

143
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,200
it has a like a like these like kind of rusty metal discs that are called cutting discs.

144
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,000
So you can use it to like cut stuff. And I just wanted to see if I could do this. And I took one

145
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,560
of the RFCK pins, one of the unsold RFCK pins, one of the ones that had the most one just like

146
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,920
extra ones lying around. Specifically, it's the one like the number one, the the orange and yellow

147
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,400
and white number one design. And I took that and I use the rotary tool just to cut the actual pin

148
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,240
part of it off like the pointy part that sticks into the backing that sticks through whatever

149
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,880
you're attaching it to. So we just cut that part off. And now I just have this little this cool

150
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:51,360
little like metal and enamel number one, I don't know, token or whatever. And I don't know what

151
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,680
utility that has. But I guess it's kind of cool. And I guess I quote unquote made it myself. And

152
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,920
that's neat in its own special way. I don't know. I don't know why I did that. I just did. And I

153
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:18,480
don't regret it. Yeah. Well, I guess I kind of no idea. I guess the reason I was thinking about it.

154
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,080
Part of the idea was to turn these things into into tokens. And the and the reason why I was

155
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:38,320
thinking about tokens is because okay, and I'm hearing from and I just asked Munchie. I just

156
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,040
asked Munchie and whether he minded me talking about it publicly. And he said he would rather

157
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,160
keep it a secret. And I think that's totally reasonable. We can put it in a bonus episode.

158
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,680
It's not you can't go in the main episode. Lamal. Oh, God. Now what do I do? Now how do I fill air?

159
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,560
Okay, Eleazar, but leave in but leave in me mentioning that it's been cut and put and resigned

160
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,960
to a bonus episode. That that stuff can all go in a bonus episode. Leave in me saying that all

161
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
that stuff I just said can only be in a bonus episode because I guess it's it's a secret

162
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,800
for a future project. So I can't I don't want to talk about it publicly, but a bonus episode

163
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,680
is fine, I think. So that's the that's the another plug

164
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,040
for the for the for the PCP Patreon as if as if you didn't already have ample reason

165
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:39,360
to pledge a mere $5 a month only $5 a month keeps us keeps us fed keeps us keeps us bread

166
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,520
whatever that means. And also, you know, will help mitigate that all that ad revenue that I

167
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,880
cost us by trying to get the $82 please please patrons help us save us save us by pledging

168
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,960
to our Patreon mitigate mitigate the ad revenue that YouTube has fucking stolen from us with its

169
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:12,400
draconian 32 days policy why why 32 days why by attempting to link an ad sense account that they

170
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,440
thought should not be allowed is this why then am I for being rejected am I then not allowed to try

171
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:31,120
again for 32 days why 32 all right I got my I got my pizza I got my one quarter of a Kirkland

172
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,040
Supreme cauliflower crust pizza you know it costs a little more it costs a little more but the benefit

173
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,680
is that I can have a quarter of the pizza and it's only like 300 calories instead of being like

174
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:49,120
600 so I feel like that's I feel like that's worth a premium and you know I got my I got my

175
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,760
birch beer so you have a classic combo of brek of birch birch beer and and and and pizza for breakfast

176
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,920
uh try it if you don't believe me uh there's nothing better

177
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,080
truly I've got it it's got a nibble the corner because the center is too hot

178
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,600
I took it out a little earlier I like it usually I like them a little undercooked usually I prefer

179
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
you know cook them cook them at home pizzas I usually prefer them a little softer

180
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,080
rather than being too crispy more flavorful in my opinion

181
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,520
ah shit all right I had shit I had an idea I was gonna there was something else I was gonna bring

182
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:36,320
up um what was it okay oh yeah I still have not I still have not finished the um slime and punishment

183
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,640
uh uh end section the reason why and again maybe you can see this coming is I just it's not the

184
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,840
stuff that I had already done is done I just keep thinking of more I just keep thinking of more

185
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,640
things to put in it um basically if I have not explained this before maybe I will what I'm putting

186
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,880
in I think I have said this before you know I wrote the end notes that explain the pages

187
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,520
because a lot of the pages are references to two things that were going on at the time or are just

188
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,680
rfck in jokes or whatever and then on top of that I wanted to go back and I wanted to put in

189
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:22,240
context in the form of like things chris said because a lot of the many some of the comic is

190
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,600
like directly responding to things that chris said like weird weird takes that chris had about the

191
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,400
story weird takes that chris had about endless war at rfck or and of course her weird insistence

192
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,600
that slime must be destroyed by a storm of bicarbonate soda water rain um so I'm putting in

193
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,040
like her her messages and her tweets and her dms like about that and and I I remembered the other

194
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,240
day a little while ago that she had been in the server and she had interacted with some people

195
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,880
and she had made some posts in there and people and she had people had said like why do you hate

196
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,440
slime chris we love slime it's our it's our life blood and she uh you know was weirdly insistent

197
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,920
and I think that's really funny so I think that's worthy of inclusion so you know this was another

198
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,840
thing like oh you know I should add a I should add a page or two just sort of cataloging that

199
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,920
part of it as a I just I just think that stuff's funny I think I think reading her

200
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,760
you know across all these in tweets and retweets as well as twitter dms as well as like discord

201
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,800
messages in the endless war server you know you read it all in or the idea is that I assemble it

202
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,520
all in order and it all paints a picture it all tells the story of this person who just has this

203
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:50,480
crazy idea that like I like it's it's my job to destroy the slime that like powers this place that

204
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,560
like and and I don't know I I'm not really want to want to provide commentary I'm not really like

205
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,680
commenting on any of it I'm just kind of putting it there and the idea is that you will read through

206
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,600
the footnotes and you will read you know her own words about all of it and you will come to your

207
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:14,000
own conclusion and that conclusion will be like this person is really weird and and I just I just

208
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,120
think that's funny um just really funny that she was on a crusade against slime I don't know I feel

209
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,640
like so anyway uh yeah I keep I keep remembering little bits like oh wait didn't didn't didn't she

210
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,120
say this and she said that wasn't there a moment when that happened and so I keep like going back and

211
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,040
finding uh finding a tweet here or a message there and being like oh that's part of it yeah I put

212
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,440
that I honestly I I bet the point where I should probably start parrying it down and maybe I need

213
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,240
to go back through it and actually pick out things that like maybe that doesn't need to be here maybe

214
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,720
that response doesn't really add anything to the narrative because the point is to build a narrative

215
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
the point is that you read through these notes and it gives you more context and it paints this sort

216
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:04,880
of behind the scenes picture of why what was going on and so I think yeah I started I I I

217
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,680
finished putting everything together and then I started a new I duplicated the file and I started

218
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,640
a new version of the file and the goal of that file was to go through and and cull you know

219
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,840
and edit crop out things that are not necessary but then as I was doing that I remembered the

220
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
like the in server messages and the server interactions and I like that's funny I gotta

221
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,960
I gotta I gotta get I gotta find those so I had to go find them which was a little bit hard because

222
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,480
she's her her discord account well it means she was removed from the server I think her

223
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,000
discord account still exists but it's hard to search for messages from someone who has left

224
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,680
a server I did figure out how to do it um but I don't know I kind I kind of want to find like

225
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,720
because it's it's funny that like she was in there and she got killed right the story is she

226
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,200
joined the server and she postured as though she had all these like powers in the game that

227
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,720
do not exist she said she could exclamation point mock speed dash or exclamation point goddess

228
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,040
protection um and there's a really funny part where like it's it's it's gib gib actually asked

229
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,440
her like hey what's your do you have a slime so now like do you have an rfck character and

230
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,760
chris posts um it's like it's the card it's the twilight sparkle she she secret ship fake folder

231
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,160
card of her like goddess sonichu form like with all these rainbow like beams coming off or whatever

232
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:35,440
and it's like and she's like my goddess body is immune to the slime I uh I use I use the I use

233
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,560
dash and protect myself at will so I am not so I am unkillable and cannot be corrupted by slime

234
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,320
and it's a really funny response by a bunch given a couple other people they're just like cool awesome

235
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:54,240
that yeah nice nice and it's really good so I was glad to find that I would like to find I would

236
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,840
like to find the person that killed her because somebody somebody killed her and a couple and

237
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,680
somebody scalped her um because you can scout and I would like to find those commands I would like

238
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,680
to find like exactly who did that because yeah chris's scalp was like an item that was circulating

239
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,160
through the economy for a while I think there were two of them and there's a part where there's

240
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,440
a part where during a conversation someone like a date date checks her data and it says like yeah

241
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:34,400
she's dead she's riddled with bullet holes blah blah blah um so uh I would just like to I I figured

242
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,600
out how to find a person's uh messages even though their serve their chant their account

243
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,640
is no longer in the server uh I have not I tried to just search for their at to find like

244
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,840
commands directed at them like kill kill at cwc 1982 or whatever um and it didn't work so maybe

245
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,600
there's a way to do it and I just have to figure it out but anyway this is this is the this is the

246
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,800
endless sycophie and struggle that I find myself in constantly thinking of uh hey what about that

247
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,120
one thinking of new things like oh I gotta put that in I gotta put that into the index part

248
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,160
even even as I'm constantly trying to like cut as much as I can because I want to cull it down to

249
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,160
be the most the cleanest and most the cleanest narrative experience of reading through like

250
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:27,520
the this this record as possible I'm trying to cut but I keep thinking of things I want to add

251
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,400
basically okay I've I've said it I've said it enough ways time to take another bite of my pizza

252
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,240
I said a bite but I ate the whole thing delightful all right enough I'm sure you don't want to hear

253
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,480
me talk about my breakfast uh I think maybe I'll just jump right into voicemails I think I've

254
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,120
prattled on long enough and it probably won't even be that long after all that shit I had to cut

255
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,440
there's probably what like 20 minutes what can I what can I say there's just not I'm just I can't

256
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,680
you know uh uh uh uh it's tough you know you you try podcasting you try solo podcasting for uh

257
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,800
you can't do it it's impossible okay whatever uh anyway speak pipe the first message is called odd

258
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,160
I think some messages disappear oh wait I didn't no I don't want to no I don't want to read the new

259
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,080
one piece chat I'll wait until next week and discuss it with gibb now sorry no no one piece

260
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,480
discussion this week because uh I would just be like uh mm-hmm yep and then that happened and then

261
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,040
that happened and then that happened um pretty neat okay well that's all I have to say also great

262
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,240
my internet is uh fucking up did I mention that I'll hopefully have new internet by the 13th

263
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,320
because you know here here I am and it's doing the thing again where it uh it doesn't load the it

264
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,720
doesn't fucking load speak pipe even though here here's a funny thing uh yeah I clicked to download

265
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,920
the message download a speak pipe message and then I clicked to refresh the speak pipe page

266
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,640
and it did successfully download the message the the the message was was downloaded no problem but

267
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
the website itself uh site can't be reached there's no internet you're not connected to the internet

268
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,200
my dude so that's great all right first message is called odd I think some messages disappear but

269
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:28,640
I also almost spam three two one go oops I mean Pokemon ranger they have two they have a that

270
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:36,080
it has a sequel and poke park that has two versions as well they are really good I remember I looked

271
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,680
these up before Pokemon ranger and poke park poke park we Pikachu's adventure Pikachu must engage

272
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,840
in battle with a Feraligator in order to befriend it that's when I that's what I see when I go to

273
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,640
the plot section of the poke park we Pikachu's adventure Wikipedia page is it like an action

274
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,280
platformer like a 3d you can run around a 3d world and just kick the shit out of other Pokemon to

275
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,000
befriend them uh Pikachu sent to the poke park with a mythical Pokemon you tells them the 14

276
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,200
pieces of the sky prism has shattered with his friends Pikachu sets on an adventure to find them

277
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,560
in the poke park blah blah blah blah does it say genre does it just say what's action adventure

278
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,880
interesting um looks kind of neat I mean I don't have a we I guess we can emulate it

279
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,640
but I won't I got other games I want to play I got oh I got Disco Elysium I finally downloaded

280
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,040
Disco Elysium and I will play that soon but I have not played it yet uh

281
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,680
maybe I'll stream it I don't know I don't know if I want to stream that one I feel like streaming

282
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,640
might distract me from the game I feel like I just kind of want to experience that game because

283
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,080
everyone says it's so it's so good and it seems like it's like a very reading heavy like it's it's a

284
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:14,800
it's a from what I gather it's a you know an isometric basically a tech I mean it's I mean I

285
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,080
don't know I guess there are rules but it's sort of like one of those what the fuck do you call

286
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:26,320
games like um like planescape torment uh and I mean it's like an isometric RPG that's very like

287
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,920
dialogue tree heavy so I don't have streaming that game would really be that good of a way to

288
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:42,400
experience it um but anyway uh I'll play it soon next one is called at ask in rules for skin rules

289
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:50,480
I think four skin rules three two one go hello PCB remember that one time Aaron from Game Grumps

290
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,160
floated around the idea of regrowing his foreskin and immediately his bitch wife Susie

291
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:04,640
burst in the room screaming about how if he does that she's getting a divorce so uh yeah

292
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,080
would you regrow your foreskin would you be okay with your girlfriend trying to control your body

293
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,040
like that I mean I don't remember the exact moment you're talking about I have to imagine that Susie

294
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,560
was I mean was she serious like that that would be weird that would be weird if she was serious

295
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:35,360
about I assume she was joking um I don't care I don't care about my foreskin so uh and also I mean

296
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:43,120
let's we're all clear on that we can't regrow it right uh it doesn't it's not me personally

297
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,280
me personally I think it's fine I wouldn't regrow it if I could I would not have any desire to do

298
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:59,760
that it's it uh uh but I mean um uh I hate circumcision you know what we should ban circumcision

299
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,200
just because I hate talking about it I hate that there's a debate about it uh it's like the most

300
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,400
annoying uh subject to discuss in the world so I'm against it just because I don't ever want to hear

301
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:20,480
about it again that's my that's my new take um nice the next one did I download that one

302
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,960
yes I did the next one is an imager link so let's freaking look at it shall we the procrastinators

303
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,600
ben saint hypocrite rebel pixels beska ever I mean yeah those uh I might have mentioned a while ago

304
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,120
this was a go this was a while ago now but Nate had already not been on the the pcb for a long time

305
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,560
and I tried to and I removed him from that list and he got mad at me he got angry I don't know why

306
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,880
so yeah they probably should be removed I think maybe I'll do that again and there's no there's

307
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,480
no good reason for him to be angry if I try to do that again I'll do that at some point um because

308
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:10,960
yeah it's it's me and hippo gibb now uh next one is another imager link uh let's see uh what we got

309
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,520
yes I mean first of all I mentioned this already that our ad is procrastinators 9667 no I don't

310
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,680
know why it's like that might have been for the garlinghouse thing yes I know the descriptions

311
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:28,880
is under construction I think that's also a brad garlinghouse thing no no it shouldn't say that

312
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,600
but like what should it say I don't know what are you pointing this out for I know all this I know all

313
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:48,320
this uh next one is um let's see here r slash the procrastinators the pin okay I see this actually

314
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,920
should probably be changed the pinned link on r slash procrastinators is radcon 17 2017 the playlist

315
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,680
and apparently it's a dead link right because we removed right because we remove the playlists

316
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,400
the radcon playlist they're now linked wait are they is that a dead link let me let me try it

317
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,520
yes the playlist does not exist okay you know what that's fair that should not be that should not be

318
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:21,440
the pinned should not be pinned on the subreddit uh reddit user reddit user rival underscore

319
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:29,840
steven if you're listening uh maybe you could remove that um why is divu a moderator gross

320
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,000
okay next I mean all right all right guy you make you make a fair point you make a fair point

321
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:44,160
next one I'm gonna fucking add the http colon slash slash all right here we go full episode

322
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,520
pcp playlist multiple missing episodes okay well there's nothing I can do about that one buddy

323
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,720
because uh a bunch a couple of them have been removed for copyright or something and I can't

324
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,840
put them I can't put them back on the itunes google play spotify okay okay yeah I know those are out

325
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,040
of date I've been saying for a while that I need to update them I just haven't gotten around to it yet

326
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,000
I I know I've been meaning to so but that's why and if you listened you would know that like yes I

327
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,120
know that those are not up to date and they're missing episodes the google play is apparently a

328
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:29,200
dead link okay that's probably fair join the pcb minecraft server yeah I mean maybe this was sent

329
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:37,040
late I I already I already removed that part of it uh the and I've replaced it with a um a link

330
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:44,080
to the pcb minecraft discord server which is not you don't need to join uh a a patreon to join

331
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,040
now so that part I already fixed and then the pcb wiki yeah the pcb wiki dead link that one

332
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,080
probably should be removed because that is a dead link I guess I was hopeful that

333
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:03,760
the owner might restore that at some point but that's probably stupid so that one's fair okay

334
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:11,120
some of these are valid and some of them are annoying maybe I'm being too sensitive about it

335
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:18,240
um I will I know I have not updated the itunes google play spotify feed

336
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
it's really it it's really annoying to do it's really really annoying

337
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,560
and I know that a few people do want them and would appreciate it and I will do it at some

338
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,760
point but you got to understand from my perspective it's like a really annoying thing to do that like

339
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,320
what like 10 like 10 people like 10 fucking people are gonna listen to it that way

340
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:50,560
or that's how it seems to me anyway um anyway next one is bus girl speaks out

341
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,320
it's another fucking imager link and it doesn't include the http so I gotta add it myself

342
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:12,640
huh okay bus busera autobus kizi in December okay this is this is this is very funny

343
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,800
in December 2022 I was approached by it's also a little waiting for my bus despite

344
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,840
his weird smell and withering hairline I tried to make friendly conversation

345
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,560
unfortunately he preferred to follow me stammer about horse slime and androids

346
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,680
only to make the most pathetic attempt at coming on me I have ever experienced I feel

347
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,600
violated and want to warn every woman on here that he is a sick little freak and a menace to

348
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,640
women around the globe uh this this is some kind of copypasta right I that that line withering

349
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,080
hairline I feel like I've seen that before somewhere um honestly this this picture actually

350
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:55,920
looks not that dissimilar from how she looked so I guess all the Turkish women all look the same I

351
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,040
don't know uh this uh good one you freaking you freaking got me you freaking got me with this one

352
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,440
I have nothing to say but kudos to you sir okay next one spread the cheeks and like the whole

353
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:20,640
ugh the scent so pungent okay three two one go Ben if you actually end up doing the digital

354
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,400
diaspora lecture make sure to mention the sticky piss floor for wiping her teeth with a t-shirt

355
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,520
instead of brushing them in the time she didn't shower long enough for her scalp to form a uniform

356
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,320
mass of dead skin blood hair and puss don't forget the weird philosophy of how she is actually so big

357
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,840
brain mega intelligent that she watches Marvel movies in an avant-garde type of way that she

358
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,840
adopted in the past six months as a part of the ongoing being online is bad actually project

359
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,520
also let's say for the sake of argument that someone was able to reverse engineer the location

360
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,640
of the compound from the videos of bird and trixie petting diseased stray dogs while already

361
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,000
been through the dump that is Corbin Kentucky already done with menace to women Ben saint

362
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,440
hypothetically do that information it's already been done and the answer is nothing uh it would be

363
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:21,920
really weird if i if i like did anything with that uh so yeah don't bother doing don't bother

364
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,280
don't bother trying to reverse engineer her house is it's it's done and i'm not doing anything with

365
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,680
that information just so you know uh but she also doesn't live there anymore i mean i'm convinced

366
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:44,320
i'm i'm pretty convinced that like uh she's been kicked out of that house um because she's

367
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:51,360
been posting she's been posing from california for like a long time now and uh they don't

368
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,600
the ye the yeag posters she's she's taken sucker punch out of her bio so i'm pretty sure she's out

369
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:06,000
of there either either sucker punch is dead and no longer exists or she is just out of it which

370
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,520
would mean that she doesn't live in that house anymore i don't know where she lives i think i

371
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,400
thought she was living with her parents crashing with her parents in california but she i don't

372
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
know recently she's been like on the road again she's driving somewhere i guess maybe she could be

373
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,080
driving back to Corbin Kentucky to live there again i i don't know why she would do that because

374
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,040
like i know that they have this tiny little apartment and call it the Corbin crack house

375
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:36,880
i know that they have this tiny little apartment and like three other people three people live there

376
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,800
and i don't think and and that seems like too many already like five people like his bird

377
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,720
and tricks like that's too many people and they were living there like five people to this one

378
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,520
bedroom uh little hole uh and that must have sucked really bad and so you know if she's going

379
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,640
back that would suck really bad too but the fact that the fact that sucker punch is out of the bio

380
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,800
is what makes me think more than anything that she probably doesn't live in where she's going

381
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,880
or where she actually lives i don't know maybe she's going back there i have no idea i try to keep

382
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,560
my finger on the pulse of these things because i find it because i find it funny to watch her um

383
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:23,600
um nobody nobody understands uh uh the the humor for me is like every single time she says i'm

384
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,840
going to do something and like if i pay attention i can see every single time it falls apart and

385
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:36,880
doesn't happen um like in yeah in the in her i'm quitting youtube video she said you know

386
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,360
you we're starting sucker punch you know we're we're a sucker punch we're on Spotify that's

387
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,080
what we're going to do we're going to be rapping we're a rap group now also uh my day job is going

388
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,960
to be editing youtube videos for mint salad to sub to promote uh mint salads uh only fans

389
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,640
uh right and i know that both things didn't happen because now sucker punch is out of the

390
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:06,320
bio sucker punch is dead um and uh cranberry dave is mint salads editor and there's absolutely

391
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,080
no reason why she needs more than one and i'm pretty sure she's been kicked out of that house

392
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:16,800
that she was intending to make a living and working in her job so all of that crumbled but in a very

393
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,600
in a non-public way in a way that you wouldn't know unless you're a genius like me who keeps track of

394
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,160
everything uh so that's why i do it uh because because i get i get because it always pays off

395
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,720
it's always gratifying in that way um so well anyway these things um yeah i probably would

396
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,000
the poor hygiene yeah i probably would mention that i probably would give the example of like

397
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,160
the gray goo on the head the gray bloody scabby goo on the head the brushing the teeth thing definitely

398
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
um i don't know if i would specifically mention the morrow i mean it

399
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,680
i probably would not devote that much time of such a hypothetical lecture to the the yig era and the

400
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,320
post yig era i would pretty much just because like that pretty much is the end right like

401
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:14,320
the like i mean on the one hand trixie is digi bro there is there actually is no separation

402
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,560
between those two despite what she claims because she was never playing a character she was just

403
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,480
being her the most authentic version of herself that she could on camera and that's what digi

404
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,040
bro was despite the fact that she claims otherwise now uh nevertheless digi bro as a brand did pretty

405
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:40,400
much end it turned out with the um with the yig rebrand because the content dried up or just became

406
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:50,640
worthless uh and unnotable and you know the the the enterprise collapsed monetarily and and then

407
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:58,000
ultimately was uh officially dissolved so i mean i i i mean i would probably touch upon all the

408
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,440
stupid i mean it would touch upon like the weird way that the yig channel was organized

409
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,280
yeah and i probably would talk about like how all her announcements were like how anime is bad guys

410
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,360
if you still watch anime you're addicted to it and anime is an addiction and you have to break it like

411
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:20,160
me you have to figure out that like actually going outside and standing in the woods is like

412
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,040
real enlightenment and if you're online you're a loser actually uh i mean i would probably i

413
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,480
would touch on all these i think i would touch on all these things that you've mentioned um

414
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:40,160
yeah fair fair enough okay next one oh it's just one image um it's it's munchy saying purple is

415
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,280
literally such an ugly color i mean i don't know what the i don't know what the context of uh this is

416
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,960
i mean why would you say purple is such an ugly color that's so dumb i mean i guess it's kind of

417
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,200
funny how munchy would say it because he's a rowdy and killers and rowdies grouties kill

418
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,120
killers and killers kill rowdies they don't like each other you don't like purple i get it i get it

419
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:11,440
um next one is another image link from ibb.co that's an outside the box choice for an image

420
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,520
hosting website let's look at it does anyone have any questions okay career day does anyone have

421
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,800
any questions about being an artist comic artist how much money do you make have you ever had a

422
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,080
useful job don't robots make comics now what would you do if your drawing hand got mangled

423
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,280
does anyone have any questions that won't make me cry on the drive home ha ha ha ha

424
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,640
good one artists poor art worthless ai makes art even more worthless

425
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,840
what would you do if your drawing hand got mangled i mean drawing hand got mangled that one's fair

426
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,080
the other the other three are true don't robots make comics now the answer is just no

427
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:05,200
because uh nobody's ever made a good ai-generated comic like a painting maybe a comic no except

428
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,960
except of course for um that one about the hand drawn boyfriend dating his ai girlfriend

429
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,160
that's the only one that's uh that's good and the only one that ever will be good actually

430
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:27,440
uh okay next one is called ben's annual reminder get a job yeah okay thank you next one is called

431
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:36,560
the great eight-bit debate three two one go so in episode 342 of the pro crass naters podcast

432
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:43,360
one person called in into the voice mills with a little like b-mo sounding ass like ai-generated

433
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:51,360
voice talking about ai art and i'm sorry but like the message was really really annoying um

434
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,640
first of all they go off and they say that people who are like complaining on art station about

435
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,960
like ai art they're just like looking out for their own job security and they're going against

436
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,960
progress who are completely disregarding the fact that like all the current ai models that

437
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,040
produce ai art are completely based on stolen artwork from all across the internet which like

438
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,200
immediately go fuck yourself for saying that and then on top of that they go with the nonsensical

439
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,800
point that like oh you know like it's democrat it's democratizing art because you see uh you

440
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,560
know normally you would be limited by money in order to you know for instance recording you

441
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,920
know for musicians you would have to buy record recording equipment in order to like record and

442
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,960
now with with ai music the shit you wouldn't have to do that yeah of course of course that's

443
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,520
you're right you know we're completely removing the process of having to do anything is is

444
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,440
absolutely the solution to needing money for recording equipment instead of just fucking i

445
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,720
don't know just democratizing access to recording equipment fuck you

446
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:14,080
hmm i think i agree i mean uh hmm it's kind of uh hmm what point what what are the salient points

447
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:23,200
that i can comment on in this voicemail um okay the the thing about uh the thing about like most

448
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,880
ai is being based on stolen art uh i i that seems true to me but i've i've heard people

449
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,160
more and more okay there was a video by shat diversity that i didn't i admit i didn't watch the

450
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:43,440
whole thing but i started watching it and he was art he was saying he was saying pro ai and now

451
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:50,160
you remember that i am amenable to the idea that that ai art can be a an okay thing under the right

452
00:49:50,240 --> 00:50:00,240
circumstances but not that is not the case if the ai if it's like stolen okay if now all right i

453
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:07,280
guess i guess here's he was saying he seemed to be saying it's not stolen or if it is stolen

454
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,680
oh it's not their fault because they didn't know they were stealing oh they just stole by accident

455
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:19,520
it wasn't on purpose and that sounded fucking stupid to me um but i think there was a point

456
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,400
raised that made me ponder and it was like okay okay okay a lot of these a lot of websites

457
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,560
i think there are there are websites where when you post art i think sometimes you post under the

458
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:38,800
understanding that anything you post is considered creative commons it's it enters into the realm

459
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,840
of creative commons and i'm not an expert but i think what that means is that other people are

460
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:51,120
allowed to use it in certain capacities uh maybe in in just non-commercial capacities i don't know

461
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,200
but i i guess if you i think i think maybe ai has changed the game a little bit and that maybe now

462
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,120
maybe people would have been okay posting content under creative commons that now they

463
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:08,800
feel that they don't want to do that because uh ai might take advantage of it and i feel like that's

464
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,360
not necessarily ai's fault and i feel like maybe it's not fair to hold that against it because

465
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,320
like if it if it's available for use in that way i feel like ai ought to be able to take advantage

466
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:26,000
i don't see any reason why i shouldn't so i don't know if there's some if and if ai's are built in

467
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,560
a way that uses stuff that's already like legally and and and in every sense you know ought to be

468
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:40,640
available for people's use um then i think it's good and i don't know if there's any ai's to do

469
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,800
that because like at the end of the day honestly someone who someone who makes ai an ai program

470
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,200
or whatever would probably like to claim that and i genuinely i don't trust the the tech bro

471
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,800
sort of dude who makes a thing like this or what or whatever i don't trust them to tell me oh yeah

472
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,880
it doesn't use any stolen assets everything it uses creative comments because like of course

473
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,440
they would say that and frankly the way that i know that it would shake out is that they would

474
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,840
just say that because they know that it's what they're supposed to say and the onus would be on

475
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:19,600
anyone else to prove that they are wrong so someone would have to it's like it's like innocent and

476
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,480
it's innocent until proven guilty but in like a bad way like really they should have to demonstrate

477
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,240
that like yeah this thing is not stealing art this thing is operating in a in a in a legal way

478
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,680
there's a there's a fine line i guess i feel like if um they they i'm getting a little bit

479
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,440
i'm thinking multiple thoughts at once here um they would have to they would have to

480
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,400
i feel like they should have to prove and demonstrate that like yeah my system does not steal

481
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,680
art my system only uses stuff that's creative commons my stuff does not uh infringe on anyone's

482
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,640
but i think there's not plagiarism there's not a plagiarism machine i feel like they

483
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,720
should have to demonstrate that first but i know that in practice they would just say that it's not

484
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,200
until someone proved that it was and that only then would anyone be like oh this is bad because

485
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,160
because you know if if art theft is the main complaint against ai art now people are going

486
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,240
to start saying well mine's the one that doesn't do that actually does it is that true who knows

487
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,200
they're not going to be honest about it um

488
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
all right i i i guess the long and short of it

489
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,640
i guess the long and short of it is there there are certain cases i'm i'm i'm i'm never okay with

490
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:33,120
plagiarism but i am okay with theft under certain circumstances under certain cases

491
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,880
and so for me to for me to give like an ai my thumbs up i would have to be like really sure

492
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,200
that it steals only to the only to the extent and only in the cases that i think that's cool to do

493
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,080
and i just don't have any confidence even even if i am assured of that i don't have any confidence

494
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:58,240
in the people that would be doing the assuring uh so yeah i have to i have to just i have to mistrust

495
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:06,080
it uh so i think i'm with you on that one okay next one is called final rant i promise three two one

496
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:12,400
go and then one other thing too the this might be a little bit more of a controversial opinion

497
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,360
that i have uh that not everyone agrees with and if they don't that's fine but like for me honestly

498
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,160
like if you have some kind of creative idea some kind of idea for a video game and artwork a song

499
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,680
a painting whatever you have some kind of idea that you want to see right and you

500
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,240
put that into an ai in order to generate it in order to see it provided the ai is created ethically

501
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,480
you know uh that's fine you know you want to you want to create it you want to look at it good

502
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:51,680
i don't care to see it like i genuinely don't care about the creative output of people who

503
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:59,680
just want to make the ai make it for them i don't care because you don't care that's the problem

504
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:06,800
you don't care enough about this idea to even fucking work at making it what this these are

505
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:12,320
just the types of people who are like dude what if the game was like skyrim but it was also like gta

506
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,240
that would be fricking epic and then they don't know how to code they don't know how to do art

507
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,920
they don't know how to do voice acting they don't know how to do fucking anything they just want

508
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,520
to see the idea being created and then like be rewarded for it they're a fucking idea guy that

509
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,720
that's what this this fucking ai craze feeds a idea guys who don't know how to do fucking anything

510
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:40,800
and i am not interested in the least bit in their creative output yeah yeah in in theory i can imagine

511
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,560
like oh what if what if there's a guy who's using ai generation to any and he's generating like

512
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,720
oh really cool wacky things that like nobody's ever seen before what if the computer

513
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,800
is spitting out like some really weird honestly like some of the most interesting ai stuff tends

514
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,480
to be when it goes wrong and you see like the faulty decision making on of a computer on display

515
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,360
and you see like the the problems the unique the unique ways that a computer can fail to understand

516
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,920
how to how to put an image together or or to fail to understand a request usually when a when

517
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:23,680
an ai generates an image that is what the person controlling the the the prompts and stuff wanted

518
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:31,600
it just it just looks like a painting and yeah i've i've never i've never seen and i don't think

519
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:38,000
i ever will see an image that like ooh an artist an artist could never have painted this unless it's

520
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,440
like the computer just the computer fucked up in a way that like a human just wouldn't think

521
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,800
a human wouldn't think like this uh what jumps to mind is that image maybe you saw of the

522
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,240
it's the woman it's like a big titty anime girl but it's like her it's a big titty anime girl

523
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,320
but coming up she's got huge cleavage right but then you look up at the cleavage and the cleavage

524
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:13,520
becomes uh her legs and like her legs uh uh and like her an entire other woman is like sticking

525
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,360
out of the neckline because it interpreted the cleavage of the boobs as like the the cleavage of

526
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,560
like the the the the the crotch and and the legs pressed together and so it like made these this

527
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:30,640
weird fucking chimera um and that's awesome you know yeah i don't know in in theory if someone

528
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,200
were had a really great had really great aesthetic taste and they were generating images that looked

529
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,520
really amazing and they had like lots of visual ideas going on in them ideas that i hadn't seen

530
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:45,040
before and i looked at them and i go oh interesting oh interesting you know that's fine and all in

531
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:54,320
practice that's not what i see out of out of the uh the ai people at at best they generate things

532
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:04,160
that look like somebody painted them uh which is uh fine um next one is uh another image or link

533
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,320
okay and this guy included the http and i appreciate that because that means i don't have to type it

534
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:17,200
hey sugar tits i heard your dog jin artist ghosted you i'll draw one for you for only 500

release content even if everyone hates it in its dog shit as as obviously is the case this week

598
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:44,160
you gotta understand there's legal we gotta set legal precedent um all right but i've said all

599
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:51,680
i have to say this week um read one piece catch up on one piece and then uh we will talk maybe

600
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:59,920
we'll have two chapters to talk about next week um for some of that bonus shit that i can't talk

601
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,520
about that i had to cut from this episode um become a patron patreon.com such that procrastinators

602
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:14,720
get access to what like 52 53 former episodes and a new one at some point in the future um

603
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:22,240
um we will we will be doing some bonus stuff when the last of that rad con shit is finally done

604
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:28,400
which i can't i can't exactly say how soon but much like one piece ending we're closer to it

605
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:36,240
happen we're closer to it happening than we are to the beginning uh hopefully closer than that

606
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,080
that's that's probably still years away i probably shouldn't make that comparison
