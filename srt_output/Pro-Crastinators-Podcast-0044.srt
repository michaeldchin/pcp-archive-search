This program contains dramatic reenactments and material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Viewer discretion is advised.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When two cousins set sail across the Sea of Cortez, they expect the weather to be blue skies and fair winds all the way.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But when an unexpected storm blows in off the mountains, their boat is torn apart and they're dumped in shark infested waters.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh my God! Oh my God!

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are only refugees in uninhabited islands where there is no food, no water, and no shelter from the burning sun.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All they have left is the will to survive and the hope that that will be enough on I Shouldn't Be Alive.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're back again to talk about things.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Woo! Yeah!

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I like things.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was about to say that.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I stole his thunder.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Donnie, how could you betray me like that, Donnie?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Donnie, how could you get your own catchphrase wrong?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I like your own brother, the spicy key chain, Donnie.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I am the best guy ever, as you know.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The coolest cat in the cabbage patch.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's me. That's my new catchphrase.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I'm joined today by my good buddies, Hippocrite is here.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As is Ben Saint.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Distinctly not my buddy, you'll notice.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And my good friend, Jessicaleys.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Endless Jessicaleys.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Jessicaleys, named after my testicles.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You named after your own testicle.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The testicle is cometh before the name.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And Tom Oliver.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, I do.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right, buddy.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, so here's our topic. Let's not fuck around.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Our topic was a suggestion by this guy on Twitter.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He goes by at the Hippocrite.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here's a suggestion.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
At TP Crastinators, I am dying help.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A podcast on when you almost died.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So that's a good question.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, we got to get that guy on here sometime.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We probably should.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey, are we going to get accused of what's the word, nepotism?

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is this not cool to take questions from people that you may or may not know?

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah, fuck it. Fuck you, Twitter.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nobody knows who actually runs the Hippocrite Twitter.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It wasn't me, that's for sure.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And by the way, peeps, make sure that you send us questions

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
about topic suggestions throughout the week.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But especially on Saturdays when we record these things

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
at TP Crastinators.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So go do that because we always need more.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Anyway, we're out of topics.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I mean, we're all washed up.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We're on our last legs here.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You guys got to step up or this shit.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're going to hit the ground real hard.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We're coming in for a real rough landing.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You know Denzel Washington and that movie Flight

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
where he has to flip the plane and they do all this crazy shit

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and then there was a big, there was a big trial about like malpractice

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
as a pilot and I don't want to, I don't want to lose my kids, okay?

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't want to lose my seven sexy daughters.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So please send me your suggestions TP Crastinators.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's what I need to do.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hippo, I'm feeling like you might have some suggestions

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
for times that you were almost dying.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, I'm right now, I'm in the moment of death.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm dying currently on the stream, on live because

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know what I have and it's the weekend so I can't go to the doctors

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and it's something about my throat.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is that how that works?

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, I don't know, maybe.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe they just, they probably go home.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I just assumed I can't access the medical guy.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That can't be right, right?

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I mean, I'm sure hospitals are open, right, because they're always open.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, hospitals are always open.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But like the doctors are only on...

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Doctors appointment, checkup or whatever.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That immediately strikes me as fully retarded, but yeah.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm probably wrong, but anyway.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have been having trouble breathing and for the last few days

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've been trying all sorts of things to try and stop it from making me not sleep

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and cough all night and I don't like it.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So the problem is like your throat is like constricting?

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What I thought it was was that my room was too dusty so I cleaned my room for a whole day

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then I went to bed and I was like all night so I was like, no, that's not it.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So it's like, maybe it's a cold.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So today I woke up really late because I couldn't sleep.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I woke up at 6 p.m. and I put like this weird, like I don't know what it's called, Vicks Vapor Rub.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And you put that in a bowl of hot water and you put your head over it with a towel

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and you just breathe that in for like an hour.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So you don't actually involve rubbing on your body anywhere?

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Vicks Vapor Rub?

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I thought you were supposed to rub it on your chest

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and then let the vapors rise up from the chest?

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's how you do it for like putting it at sleep time.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But you can, like it's more intense to just put a bowl of hot water and drink that up

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
or sniff that up.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How's that working out?

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It didn't do shit so it's obviously not like something in my throat.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It is my throat itself has decided to close and I don't know how to do anything about it.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, I've got a suggestion.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh God, I've got a suggestion.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So you basically, you need to widen up that passageway.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have a tool, a cylindrical tool.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have a cylindrical tool.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, Nate.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's pretty long.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Nate?

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think we can widen that thing up.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Nate, that's enough.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Get that in there.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's enough.

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're gay now, Kim.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're gay now.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I got you.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I got him.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I tried to stop him.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You know, I also, when I've been out for runs over the last, I don't know, like six months

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
or whatever, very occasionally I will get a thing where I just like my lungs don't seem

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
to be absorbing the oxygen I'm breathing.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I have to do these big like, I have to like force my lungs to expand and contract.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's really weird.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I wonder if it's the same thing that you're having right now.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't, I don't know what caused it.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm afraid I might have asthma.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Cause my dad has asthma.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm afraid I might have asthma cause I don't want to be a nerd.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want to carry one of those little things go, and be, you know, the guy who gets beat up on,

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and stand by me.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I already have glasses.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm halfway there.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't want to, I don't want to do that.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You need some headgear too.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hey, did you guys know that I wore a headgear all of like elementary school for one full year?

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was just thinking, just the other day I was thinking about the fact that I completely forgot that you wore headgear for a while.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's like the fun.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I opted in.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And you kept hitting yourself.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's hilarious.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So this was, this was purely a teeth straightening thing.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I was offered a choice to either wear headgear at night for like two years, or just wear it all the time for one year.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I'd be done sooner.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I just, I didn't even register any negative consequences of wearing it, you know, for a whole fucking year in school.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Of course I'll wear a weird apparatus on my head at all times.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't believe I did it, but I fucking wore that thing an entire year straight.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's obviously worked, because you don't have crooked fucking teeth like did you?

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's true.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Did you get some headgear?

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Shout out to Digi's teeth.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I had, I had some weird orthodontia.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I had braces.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Did you get the palette expander?

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I had braces for a while, but before that I had the palette expander, which is a thing that...

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Orthodontia sounds like, like the realm where dentists come from.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sure it is.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It goes on your teeth and it like, it like attaches to your top teeth.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And there's like, it's like a flat thing in the middle, but there's a gap in it.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And there's a little twisty thing.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And you have a little key and you jam this little key up into your roof of your mouth in this apparatus.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And you twist it like a couple of times and it gradually expands your fucking jaw.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And you do that for a while.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I had that.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And I also had another thing where like, it was these like metal things where like bonded to my teeth.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And on the top row were these rods, these metal rods.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And on the bottom row were these metal tubes and the rods slotted into the tubes.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And it was intended so that my jaw would open and close in like a straight line instead of like a curvy line.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And the thing about that is as I got older, I eventually became able to open my mouth so wide

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
that I could unhing, that I could remove the tube, the rods from the tubes.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then I could have, and then I would have these four weird little like, these weird little like straight metal dealy things

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that I could pop out of my mouth and like wiggle around like a, like a, like a, like a, like a beep.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like a metal vampire man.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Like a pencil, like a bug mouth pincer.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But then I would open up again and I would jam them back in because, you know, I wanted to keep my orthodontia working properly.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That would take them out for fun.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Anyway, that was weird.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
On the topic of times I almost died, the orthodontist is a very relevant one.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wait a minute.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Man, it's fucked up the stuff we do to our fucking jaw and skull.

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I mean, it makes sense.

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Like you get good results and all.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's because our bodies suck.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your bodies don't look right on their own.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's just crazy.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's weird because I've never heard of, you know, I mean, stuff like that being done in England.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like the most you would get is braces.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, the whole, the whole T thing in England is a big meme, right?

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sometimes buzzer nature just needs a little help.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think what it's, what the difference is, is that Americans don't like having fucked up teeth, even if it's healthy.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
They just want it to be a certain shape.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We're just insanely superficial over here.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's definitely a superficiality.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
In America, you're expected to have nice teeth.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know I'm superficial as fuck.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like I'm just lucky that my teeth and jaw are just sort of normal.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So there's no problems there really.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, you could be a digi.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh boy.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh boy.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I actually was supposed to get braces and shit from my teeth and I didn't because we couldn't afford it.

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My dentist or whoever, I remember as a kid was like, if you don't do this, when you're old, you're, because I have like a really bad overbite.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're like, your overbite is going to get so bad.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Your bottom teeth are going to start digging into the gums of your top teeth and all your top teeth are just going to fall out.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What the fuck?

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Did, did that happen?

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Holy shit, that's exaggeration.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I've never, I've never.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It did?

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Wait, it did?

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, it had, I haven't been asked if that really happened.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It hasn't happened yet, but I don't know how, how, how far into the future he was talking about.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Times ticking.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I'll definitely, I'll update it on that because like, I never had wisdom teeth removed.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I never had braces.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Never had any of that shit.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So I'm out.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, you can still get it done when you're older, I think.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So it's not like the end of the world or anything.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But they have like the like Invisalign things now.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you want to get braces, but nobody knows.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I do, I do have, I do have in, in Boy Scouts when I was like in high school or middle school, I did have a bike accident that broke my two front teeth.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh yeah.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I remember that.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So now like half of, well half of one of my front teeth and a little part of the other is like, you know, it's like fake tooth and like it's fine.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It looks fine, except I guess it's just, I've had it long enough that like the edges just kind of like the edge of the fake part is kind of starting to get a little dingy looking and it really, it really pisses me off.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It really pisses me off every time I look at it.

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The whole thing about like our vanity in regards to our teeth and making them like white enough, like I've been drinking more coffee recently and I have been getting extremely concerned.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If my teeth will turn darker, get stained because I have always been very proud of my teeth and I've gotten a lot of compliments on my smile and my teeth over the years and it's entirely a vanity thing.

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But I would be very upset if my teeth were to diminish in quality.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know man.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I wonder.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, I don't know.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I worry about that too.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's all kind of pointless.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I do drink a lot of just like Mio.

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah.

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I drink a lot of Mio energy.

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You'll have rainbow colored teeth.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I guess that's why my teeth aren't fucked up because I don't drink soda ever.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But you drink tea.

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Tea's not.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Tea's got to be better than soda.

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tea's not that dark.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Tea's definitely not that bad for you at all.

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I mean like in terms of like teeth rotting because like, I mean they might stay brown with teas, stain, I don't know.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, that's all I meant.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Soda will make them disintegrate.

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Soda's bad.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, that's what they say.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Soda's bad in every way and know what you drink it.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I bought a water today and I got a soda instead.

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, the President of Nintendo RIP.

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Dumped it in the trash because it is trash.

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Wait, what?

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What about Nintendo?

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You said you got a water.

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The President of Nintendo RIP.

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He did, nigga.

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He did.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He is.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait a minute.

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Dig up his grave, you monster.

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I did.

273
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I kissed that.

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This has nothing to do with death dying times and what?

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The death we were referring to.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Nate, we actually said what the topic is.

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I feel like you said the topic before but we never actually introduced what the topic is.

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay, I read the question but the topic is in between.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's right.

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay.

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Times when you almost died or whatever.

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
With Hippo talking about how he's dying right now and then we just tangent into dental incidents.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I do have another time that I actually almost died.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Please.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay, cool.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, maybe I was panicking at the time and I'm overreacting about what happened.

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But there was a time when I was just out on a trek on a hike just around the countryside with family.

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I had a cold at the time and it was kind of cold outside but whatever.

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But there was this moment where I had so much mucus in my throat that I could not sneeze it out.

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I could not cough it up and it completely blocked my air passages and I fell over.

293
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, God.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I just was like, I was trying as hard as I could to gasp for air and it wouldn't happen.

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, my God.

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And I nearly fainted and it was the scariest moment ever.

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That reminds me.

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There is, okay, one of the worst things I've ever read is there's a scene in Infinite Jess

299
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:59,000
where a burglar, okay, a guy, like this rich diplomat, he was going to take a family vacation that day

300
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
but he was sick, right?

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He had a cold.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So his family left and he stayed home because he was sick.

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And a burglar or two burglars knew that his family was taking a vacation and they were going to break in that day.

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But they break in and find that he's still there, sick.

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So they're like, oh, shit, what do we do?

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So they tie him up and they gag him.

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, no.

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And the thing is, he's got a stuffy nose and like, yeah.

309
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This has been my nightmare, my entire fucking life.

310
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Literally this.

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It takes him like an entire day to die.

312
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, God, no.

313
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No.

314
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No.

315
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You don't know how long I've had this exact thought.

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Like, what if I, guys, I've got a stuffy nose.

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They're like, well, just shut up and nobody cares.

319
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What if I get kidnapped right now?

320
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I've had the fear of someone literally putting duct tape on my mouth has been my exact fear my entire life.

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
No.

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why kidnapping specifically?

324
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because I understand.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He spends like the entire day like fucking snorting and blowing his nose and trying to keep the nasal passages clear.

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Trying to breathe.

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And he like sort of manages it for a while.

328
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But like he can't.

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, it's really bad.

331
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Jesus, Jesus, you fucked up, dude.

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You should not have fucked with our lungs that way.

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why'd you make me this way, Jesus?

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I hate you.

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Fuck you, dude.

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Fuck you.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's pretty fucking bad.

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a similar like sort of fear of just being in a place where you can't call for help.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Like, you know, it's something like, you know, the fear of like falling asleep in the bath and just drowning because nobody knows.

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, God.

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah.

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Or you fall over in the shower.

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's like a mundane sort of sort of way to die that could happen at any moment if you're just not able to move.

346
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, I'm with you.

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But for me, it's like even worse if like if you're just like in a crowd, but like I don't know for whatever reason, if you like choke on your own snot or maybe even like a piece of food.

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Like if nobody knows and they're around or even if they do know, but like it's you like fighting against your own body and your own biology and like just no one can like fix you immediately.

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Like they have to rush you to the hospital to if they can like so you can try to reach down and pull it out or whatever.

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But just like that fear of like me being powerless against my own body, I find particularly terrifying, especially for like the suffocation thing.

352
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, God, no.

353
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, that's the worst.

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This is going to be an awkward podcast.

355
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm thinking about suffocating now and I've really got, I've really got the fucking, the fucking, the howling.

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I've got the goose pimples back.

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The howling fantasies.

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Everybody take a deep breath.

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
David Foster Wallace would say.

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This, this, this entire topic is why I'm such a huge advocate of transhumanism.

361
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We need to fucking get robot bodies, fix all this shit.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is the worst.

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The best thing about being a robot.

364
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sure would be neat.

365
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Sure would be neat.

366
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The coolest thing about robots and robotics is that I mean, if you're a cyborg, you can probably like turn yourself off and then turn yourself on again.

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So if you repairs will be easier.

368
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I can already turn myself on.

369
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you very much.

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, sure.

371
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You can make yourself unconscious for sure.

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Whoa.

373
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, it just takes this rock to my head and I'm out.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's great.

375
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But, um, but like also like little robot, like I always like the idea that we're like advancing in like micro technology with robots and stuff and tiny little things.

376
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Cause like in the future, you won't have to have surgery or anything.

377
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If there's something inside you that's going wrong, you can just send a little robot guy in there to dig it out with a spade, you know.

378
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
To dig it out with a spade.

379
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Little lasers or little drills, like just send them in there.

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I just, I just, I want there to be artificial organs, artificial, just like body parts that can easily be swapped out that don't cost like dig.

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's just like, oh, you're having a heart attack.

382
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, let's just put a new heart in there.

383
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I guess that one's fucked up, you know, and just easily fix all that shit.

384
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And then I want like fucking nano machines to fucking like augment your, your organs and stuff that can like repair damaged cells.

385
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And, and, and you can just live forever.

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And, and, and aging is just a different sort of thing.

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I mean, I'm a little more concerned about the technology for micro machines that, you know, enable dick extension and retraction on command.

388
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They just build cells, you know, like I assume that's what everyone was thinking about.

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The ultimate technology.

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, in the future, in the future, you're not going to need to worry about your dick size because you're going to have your robot wife who's perfect in every way.

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And she doesn't care how big your dick is.

392
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's always the perfect fit because she's designed.

393
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And, and plus, once we get the full ghost on the shelf thing, you can just swap into a body with as big a dick you want or whatever.

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Listen, listen asshole, listen asshole.

395
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't want, I don't want a big dick for her sake.

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I want a big dick for my sake.

397
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I want a big dick because I enjoy it.

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I enjoy it.

399
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Because you deserve it, Ben, because you deserve it.

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You think this is for them?

401
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You think I do, you think I do this for them?

402
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You think I jelk every day?

403
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You think I jelk to satisfy a woman?

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You think these kegels are for her dog?

405
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Who satisfies me?

406
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is, this is, this is what I need to feel, to feel like a man.

407
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And god damn it I do.

408
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Ben said gesturing to his physique, just brushing his body.

409
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah, you think all this is for Ben?

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
All this?

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Look at these curves dog.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hippo, did you have any other death defying incidents that you wanted to bring up?

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Or Shelly Moomunda, somebody else?

414
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't think of any. There's been, yeah.

415
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If you think about it, you can always bring them up.

416
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, I'll just, I was gonna mention, Jess, you've been like having a bit of medical stuff.

417
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Also, you're homeless and everything sucks.

418
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh yeah, I have AIDS.

419
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I thought everyone knew, I thought everyone, you saw what happened with me and Action Giraffe at Radcon 2.

420
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You saw the AIDS get transmitted through the docking station into my brain.

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's what Action Giraffe does.

422
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Made of AIDS. I'm not a human being anymore.

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
As Action Giraffe was fucking your ear hole, there was a sudden time stop.

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There was like a freeze frame and then the AIDS crawled out and went inside like a yerk, like a yerk for animals.

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm not really like a human anymore.

426
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And Resident Evil Zero, how the zombies are made out of leeches.

427
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm like a bunch of AIDS leeches, like morphing and swapping around in the form of an AIDS-y human.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Particularly AIDS-y human, more so than any other of my ilk.

429
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I have a time, I wasn't actually nearly dying, but I thought I was and it was bullshit.

430
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This was like, I don't know, I think I had allergies or something. This was in my teen years, Nate.

431
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I remember on this particular Sunday, we were going to church.

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And I don't think you were there, I don't know why, whatever.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Because I'm a goddamn pizza-faced atheist.

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know, you were somewhere, it doesn't matter, you're not relevant to the story.

435
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The story is, yeah I know, fuck you.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The story is that I had allergies or something and I took a Benadryl, right?

437
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like my mom or dad gave me a Benadryl and I was like, I still feel kind of bad.

438
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I took like another one, like I took two Benadryls and I felt weird, like I started to feel tingly.

439
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And I was like, oh, you know, dad, I took two Benadryls and now I-

440
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Just kill me dad, please.

441
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I was like dad, I took two Benadryls because the first one didn't really work and now I feel weird.

442
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And dad was like, oh god, Ben, you took two Benadryls, you could die.

443
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You could die, Ben.

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh my god.

445
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He said like, if you do that, you could die.

446
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I was like, oh god, should we go to the hospital?

447
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Dad, and he was like, nah.

448
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What the fuck, dad?

449
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You handled this situation, you're escalating it as hard as you possibly could.

450
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And you should be like, ah, don't worry about it.

451
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he told me that what I had done could kill me.

452
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And then when I was like, should we do something?

453
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He was like, no, it's fine.

454
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then we went to church and I sat there in the fucking pew feeling weird,

455
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
feeling kind of tingly and thinking I was gonna die.

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Just feeling closer to God than you ever have before, yeah.

457
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Put that fear of God in me for sure.

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He would never strike me down in his own house, would he?

459
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh my god.

460
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You know, dad is like the worst, he assumes the worst in every situation.

461
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You know dad, he's very melodramatic.

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
At least, if you really thought that.

463
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, that's the thing, if he really thought that was the case,

464
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
he would have taken to the hospital.

465
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So clearly, I don't know.

466
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He clearly didn't actually think I was in danger, but like, he still said it.

467
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He said it and then did not.

468
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The seed was planted at that point.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He did not walk the statement back at any point.

470
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What a legend, dad.

471
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I can imagine he just wanted you to freak out so he could laugh.

472
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Maybe he did, maybe he just wanted to scare me into not take doubling up on doses.

473
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But you know, I don't feel like there was any premeditated strategy going on here.

474
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Who can predict the inner workings of a dad?

475
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's impossible.

476
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Well, that's interesting.

477
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, since we're on you, you got any others?

478
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Mmm, yeah.

479
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I was at home jerking off.

480
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, fuck yeah.

481
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What else you got for us, Ben, any other times?

482
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, again?

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, yeah, I actually do have a second one.

484
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was going to save it, but yeah.

485
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We could go around if you want, we could do a round robin or whatever.

486
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
All right, well, I'll tell you the whole story,

487
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
because there's a bit more to it than just the death.

488
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So in college, right, like me and my girlfriend had some friends

489
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that had been going to the same school, but then they transferred to another school.

490
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
This was another couple.

491
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
One of them transferred to another school, they went together,

492
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and we were going to go visit them.

493
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So we rented a car and we drove to New York,

494
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and it was like a several, like four or five hour drive or something.

495
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I remember on the way there, like I accidentally ran a red light.

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And the girlfriend was like, you know, she was really mad.

497
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Like she was really angry that I had like fucked up

498
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and kind of like done this weird thing in this red light.

499
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And like, yeah, it was dangerous and I fucked up and it was bad.

500
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But she was very upset at my driving.

501
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So then on the way back, she drove.

502
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And she was in the right lane,

503
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and there was an 18-wheeler in the middle lane, right, like next to us.

504
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
She got spooked being like sandwiched between this 18-wheeler

505
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and the edge of the road.

506
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is why women shouldn't be able to drive.

507
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Can't handle it, can't handle it.

508
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This is just my fucking data.

509
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm not saying anything, but...

510
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
This is just one data point.

511
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And she, you know, hit the gas,

512
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
she tried to pull out ahead of the 18-wheeler

513
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and then changed lanes to get in front of it.

514
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
She changed lanes too early and fucking...

515
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fucking just rammed into the thing.

516
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes.

517
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And this fucking 18-wheeler, like, crunched into the fucking car.

518
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
All of the windows exploded.

519
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
What?

520
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, there was...

521
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Holy shit.

522
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The windows exploded.

523
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
She was like screaming, she was like,

524
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Ben, Ben, and I was like, oh god, oh god.

525
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And Ben was like, oh, this is why I told you

526
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I shouldn't have let a man drive.

527
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
No, I think I like fucking...

528
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I think I like held her hand or something,

529
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
because we were like...

530
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because it was long.

531
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This was an extended sequence of the windows exploded

532
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and then the car was dragged.

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Like, yeah, the car was...

534
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We fucking were attached to the front of this truck now

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and the truck had to come to a stop

536
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and we were like sideways.

537
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We were dragged the whole way as this...

538
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
as this truck fucking came to a slow stop.

539
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And then, you know, it slowed down

540
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and we were like, oh god, we're still alive.

541
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And like, the windows were everywhere.

542
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There was glass in my pockets

543
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
that I found the next day

544
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
because it had gotten into my fucking pockets.

545
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And...

546
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

547
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They're decaying that Ben, in fact, did not change his clothes

548
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
at that point or any other time.

549
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It was wearing a jacket.

550
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah, all right, all right.

551
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And whatever.

552
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And, you know, we called fucking AT...

553
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's the word?

554
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
AAA, AAA.

555
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, we called AAA and fucking they came

556
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and it was terrible.

557
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And I remember that I had a thermodynamics test

558
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
the next day that I really needed to study for,

559
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but because this shitty thing happened,

560
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I did not get home in time to fucking get my textbooks

561
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and study this shit I needed to study.

562
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Did you get an extension on the exam or anything?

563
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
No, I just didn't feel like it.

564
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I was just like, fuck it, whatever.

565
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll take the test anyway and I didn't do great,

566
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
but who cares.

567
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah, everyone was like...

569
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh boy.

570
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The teachers the next day were like,

571
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I heard you were in a bad car accident.

572
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And I was like, yeah, that was, it's fine.

573
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm just saying women might not be the best drivers around.

574
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That's all I'm saying.

575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Ben was an advocate from that point on.

576
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
In this case, she didn't really hit it out of the park.

577
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Well, Ben, I was curious though,

578
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
what your conversation was like immediately after this accident.

579
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What, you know...

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I mean, I don't know.

581
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think we were both just like really happy to be alive.

582
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You know, that's fair.

583
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's fair.

584
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And also like, you know, just bummed that it had happened

585
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and that we now had to deal with the fall.

586
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It was mostly her, because it was like...

587
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
No, it was her car.

588
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It was her car that she had done this to.

589
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So it was like mostly her.

590
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
She had to deal with the fall out of fucking messing up her car.

591
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So that was sad.

592
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Man, that's a crazy story.

593
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It was a real fucking scary, almost sad.

594
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We both did.

595
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Man, all right.

596
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, cool.

597
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Good story, Ben.

598
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Got any more? Got any others?

599
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think that I just...

600
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Was that the topper?

601
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That's the...

602
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It might be.

603
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It might have been so far.

604
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I don't think I have anything in the topper.

605
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Another successful PCP podcast.

606
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We did it.

607
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
No, we're not...

608
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
28 minutes.

609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
No, we've reached the top

610
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and now we have to plunge back into the ground

611
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
to go below the bottom point.

612
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I think we can talk about,

613
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
unless anyone has another like actual almost died story.

614
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I mean, I'm constantly...

615
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Plunge into the metaphorical.

616
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Like when you...

617
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
When you died inside.

618
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Well, wait a minute.

619
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That's every day of my fucking life, dude.

620
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We can get to that.

621
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's not even worth mentioning at this point.

622
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's just a given for every day.

623
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I died once.

624
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I was run over by a car once.

625
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah?

626
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hang on.

627
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
When people say they got run over,

628
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
a lot of the time I find that the actual event

629
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
is that a car hit them

630
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and they rolled over the top.

631
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, no.

632
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's not what I mean.

633
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I mean, I was literally under the tires

634
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
being ran over by a fucking jeep.

635
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Fuck.

636
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is this why you love Jeep Wrangler so much?

637
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Do you have Stockholm Center for Jeeps?

638
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Is that what's going on?

639
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Is that it, Jesse?

640
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's okay.

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You can admit this problem.

642
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay.

643
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So what happened?

644
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What happened?

645
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
My stupid idiot friend back in high school named Ryan Gentry,

646
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
who I'll say his fucking name.

647
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't care because we all hated him anyways.

648
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We kicked him out of the group

649
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
shortly after this.

650
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But we were driving.

651
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We were in the drive.

652
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We were about to pull out.

653
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And I like wasn't in the car yet.

654
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And I was like getting my seatbelt on.

655
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And he like fucking zoomed out.

656
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I'm like, slow down.

657
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm not in the car.

658
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm out the door.

659
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And I was like, hey, not the door.

660
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And I like got wrapped up in my seatbelt.

661
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And I couldn't.

662
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, no.

663
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I couldn't move myself.

664
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So like, I just like plummeted out of the car.

665
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And like, he kept going.

666
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And like, he didn't have to keep going.

667
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He wasn't going that fast.

668
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He could have stopped.

669
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He knew I was down there.

670
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But he just kept going.

671
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And he ran right over like right up and over my fucking

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
my ankle.

673
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I was like tied up in a seat belt.

674
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And you ran over my leg.

675
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I'm like, well, you're not my friend anymore.

676
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What happened to your leg?

677
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It just hurt a bit.

678
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I mean, I did.

679
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Did you break anything?

680
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything.

681
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But he's still though.

682
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It was a Jeep Wrangler and not a fucking.

683
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't know.

684
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It wasn't a Jeep Wrangler.

685
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You invented that part of the story.

686
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I know.

687
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I like that better.

688
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That's the story now.

689
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That's the story now.

690
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
A Jeep Wrangler showed me mercy.

691
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And now I'm indebted.

692
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Jesse told me the story about how Colt Corona ran over

693
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
with a Jeep Wrangler.

694
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Colt Corona tried to save him.

695
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It was actually the K-Fib commander driving the dreaded

696
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
mobile on a mission to hurt me.

697
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I like to think that it's your friend has his face

698
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and as he was driving this thing, he pulls off the face mask

699
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and underneath is that sheer metal plate

700
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
of the K-Fib commander under the face.

701
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
He's wearing the mask under his human face.

702
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Give a man a mask and he'll show you his true face,

703
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oscar Wilde, K-Fib commander.

704
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
AKA the K-Fib commander.

705
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
As he left me there in the ditch

706
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
with my broken shattered ankle

707
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and zoomed off into the night, I could hear him laughing.

708
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Mustard on my burger.

709
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That phrase has haunted you as nightmares ever since.

710
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Fantastic.

711
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well, I've got one that isn't as dramatic as that,

712
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
but it was a very trippy experience.

713
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So I was kind of tripping.

714
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So there's not much to it.

715
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Not a full-over trip.

716
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
No, I did not trip or fall off a cliff in this case.

717
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, I mean, a quick one was I went skydiving once

718
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and there was nothing crazy about it.

719
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I didn't think I was going to die intellectually,

720
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
but the experience was very much of dying inside

721
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and being reborn as the hero of mankind

722
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
that I knew it would become one day.

723
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So I'd highly recommend everyone go skydiving.

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It was super fun.

725
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But the other time was, so I just had a fever.

726
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Nothing crazy was going on.

727
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I just had a fever one time when I was in fourth grade.

728
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But what was interesting were the side effects of this fever.

729
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Later on, I would find out that I had a temperature at the time

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and I went to the hospital at some point.

731
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
My brain temperature was around, or my body temperature was 165.

732
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
168.5, I want to say.

733
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, something like that.

734
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Are you sure it's not 106?

735
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It was really hot.

736
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Not 106?

737
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Sorry, I think that was it.

738
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
165.

739
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Well, I don't remember the exact number there.

740
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I remember it being 106.

741
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I thought it was like 126.1.

742
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Okay, whatever's the reasonable number there,

743
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
whatever's the reasonable one, that's what it was.

744
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But it was like 6.5 at the end.

745
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like standard human is like 98.

746
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes, okay.

747
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
All right, I think you're right.

748
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I think you're right here.

749
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And the thing is brain death begins to occur at 106.8.

750
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So I was 0.3 away from starting to die.

751
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So it was pretty close.

752
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But nothing bad happened to me that I know.

753
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I remember.

754
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
After this point, I started to like animate.

755
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It was kind of a weird, you know, I don't know what was going on there.

756
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I remember that day because I, again, because of our dad,

757
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
basically told me you were going to die.

758
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh my God, what the fuck, dude?

759
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And I was terrified all day at school.

760
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Understandably.

761
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, because like dad basically said,

762
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
like Nate might die.

763
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And I was like, oh God, what the fuck?

764
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Dad, this is not optimal for my studies.

765
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Just don't tell me until he's actually dead.

766
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It really wasn't optimal for my fucking studies.

767
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Didn't do me any goddamn favors.

768
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So what I remember about that day was that,

769
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
so at this time, I think I was in like, I don't know,

770
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
like first grade I was like really young or something.

771
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I was really into the Power Rangers.

772
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And the Power Rangers like second movie had come out

773
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and it's the one with like Lord Ooze.

774
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Ivan Ooze.

775
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And they got all the Ivan Ooze.

776
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

777
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
All right, all right, my mistake.

778
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The CG in that movie is fucking amazing.

779
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Really?

780
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah.

781
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I have to go watch it again.

782
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And I mean in like the worst way possible.

783
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The CG of like the new zords coming together

784
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
to form the new Megazord is the most embarrassing thing.

785
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like it is so bad.

786
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's incredible.

787
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's fantastic.

788
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Fuck you.

789
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, I want to watch, I'll have to watch it again

790
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because it really left an impression on me due to this story.

791
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So like the point is that like this guy Ivan Ooze

792
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
was like he became like the main character of my brain

793
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
during this day that I was having this bizarre fever dream.

794
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So like, oh, it was weird.

795
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Like I obtained Ooze powers and got my own,

796
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I got my own Megazord.

797
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But the way these worked was you had to turn it to Ooze

798
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and kind of merge into your Megazord,

799
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
sort of like a year merging with the brain

800
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
of the person they're possessing in Animorphs,

801
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
which I was also into at the time.

802
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

803
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm talking about my experience of what was happening

804
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
during this day where I was almost brain dead.

805
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So this was like a fever dream you were having?

806
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This was a fever dream, yeah.

807
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I see, okay.

808
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I mean, just what was interesting about it

809
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
was how like everyone in this fever dream

810
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
was like an Ooze man like me

811
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and I formed a whole Ooze civilization of people

812
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and we all had Megazords.

813
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And Ivan Ooze was our king, I believe.

814
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It was nuts.

815
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I experienced being an Ooze man

816
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
for a while for that day

817
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and I'd highly recommend it to anyone

818
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
who has the opportunity to give it a try.

819
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Being an Ooze man?

820
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Is this a fever dream?

821
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't know whether I've had an actual fever dream before.

822
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Is it different from a dream in that you remember it better?

823
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Well, what was different was that I was...

824
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's just a really crazy dream that comes about

825
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and it was kind of like I was conscious at the time.

826
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So I was conscious of what was going on around me

827
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but it was just really like distorted

828
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and I wasn't like processing information properly.

829
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It was really weird. It was really weird.

830
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't know, that's basically it though.

831
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Like Ivan Ooze, I will never forget.

832
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And I wish I could like paint the picture

833
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
because I have some very specific imagery

834
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that occurred to me on that day

835
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
that I have never forgotten since

836
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and I don't think I ever will forget.

837
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like there's this one of Ivan Ooze's face

838
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
like stretching off the rest of his body

839
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
just like towards me and kind of curling around

840
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
into this like bizarre, disgusting face.

841
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It stuck with me for like 20 years now

842
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
so I don't think it's going anywhere.

843
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's going to be with me till my dying day.

844
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Well, whatever, yeah.

845
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm just saying it was a crazy trippy time.

846
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That's all I'm saying. Really the story isn't that interesting.

847
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I had a crazy dream. That's what happened.

848
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know, I'll tell you one time,

849
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
speaking of...

850
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I mean I assume you were speaking of something, I don't remember.

851
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But I'll tell you some time.

852
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
One time.

853
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I died a time.

854
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'll tell you guys about the time I had appendicitis

855
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
when I was in high school

856
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and nobody believed

857
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that I had appendicitis.

858
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Nobody would take me to the hospital.

859
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, Jesse,

860
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
with your crazy schemes

861
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
with your wildest audience appendicitis.

862
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, come on.

863
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Don't pull my leg.

864
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
To make it to the top, but he's kind of in the middle

865
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
because he's always getting caught.

866
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
God damn it, Jesse.

867
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's me. So I was laying there,

868
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you know, I was like saying to like my mom

869
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and my grandma, like everyone who was there,

870
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
you know, my stomach really hurts.

871
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I think I'm really sick. I think I need to go to the hospital.

872
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
My mom at a certain point

873
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
just like left the state and like went to

874
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
North Carolina during this week

875
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and said, you'll be fine.

876
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So like no one was there to take me anywhere.

877
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Everyone who came in the house

878
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
said that I was just, you know, a big fat faker

879
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
trying to skip school or whatever.

880
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So I'm laying there.

881
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
My fucking, my cousin comes in one day.

882
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
My cousin who's this

883
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
a woman of

884
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
sizeable size

885
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
right, a big fat slut.

886
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
She's a big fat slut, yeah.

887
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

888
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You know, she's like a

889
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
like a 250, like a

890
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
300 pound lady.

891
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
She comes in, she comes in

892
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and she goes, I'm laying on the couch. She goes, oh, you're not sick

893
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and she fucking sits on me.

894
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
She sits on my abdomen

895
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
where my appendix lives

896
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
just like squishing it,

897
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
killing me.

898
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So finally, on like

899
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
the fourth day,

900
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
my uncle Tony came

901
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and he was the only one who believed me

902
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
because he's the only one who ever believes me.

903
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So he took me to the hospital

904
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and the doctor just said, yeah

905
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
you're like a day away from dying.

906
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Your appendix is going to burst.

907
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We have to put you in surgery right now.

908
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So they put me in surgery

909
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and then I woke up and

910
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
they took it out of me

911
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
to like a party and I

912
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
like

913
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I just like showed up at the party like all my friends were there

914
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and I'm like, hey guys, guess who

915
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
just had a surgery and I like looked at my

916
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
shirt and I had a little scar and they were like, yeah

917
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
you're cool. We're all going to suck your dick.

918
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, the girl said that and they

919
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
did and that's how I got well

920
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
laid for 100 years. I had sex

921
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
with every woman I ever met

922
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and that's the moral of the story.

923
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What a great story.

924
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I love a story with a happy ending.

925
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And Colt Corona was there too

926
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and he even got laid.

927
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, imagine that.

928
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And you guys hear each other high fives.

929
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, the K-Fabe Commander

930
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
on an Eiffel Tower. The K-Fabe Commander

931
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
thought he could poison my appendix to put me down

932
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
for the count but it is planned backfired

933
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and it got me and horse boy laid

934
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
a thousand times. All these stories

935
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
just K-Fabe Commander

936
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and Colt Corona.

937
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I was at the party

938
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
having my big fun orgy

939
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
with all my friends and K-Fabe Commander

940
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
was like watching over it from

941
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
he was overlooking it from like a cliff side

942
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
going curse you. You've eluded my

943
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
vengeance again.

944
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And I was

945
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I was yelling back at him. Fuck you.

946
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Who's that guy in the

947
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
WWE? He's like the, he's not the goat guy

948
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
but he like thinks that he can take over the world

949
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
by like winning the WWE championship. Which guy is that?

950
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, Bray Wyatt. The crazy guy.

951
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah, I was thinking like

952
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
instead of, it's like that. The K-Fabe

953
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Commander is like him only it's reversed

954
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
where he thinks by like pulling these evil schemes

955
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
to like defeat you that will get him

956
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
the championship belt. He'll become a wrestling champion.

957
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, that's his plan. He defeats you.

958
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
He becomes champion. Right.

959
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That's his master plan.

960
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He's completely detest from reality.

961
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
He doesn't understand anything. He's an idiot.

962
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
He's a madman.

963
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
He doesn't even know the rules of wrestling.

964
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
He's an idiot but it only increases

965
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
his evil retard strength.

966
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That's right.

967
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
He gets, the stronger he gets.

968
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm like

969
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Corona who gets weaker

970
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
the more he

971
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the more love fills

972
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Corona's heart the weaker he gets.

973
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He's constantly getting weaker.

974
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Aw.

975
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Isn't that nice? He lives a charmed week life.

976
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So, Tom

977
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
you're a man on Death's Door

978
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
every day so

979
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
what's your story buddy? I am he says matter of fact.

980
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I was going to say

981
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm dying inside right now

982
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
because I'm at work

983
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Right. Fair.

984
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Oh my god, that sucks.

985
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Okay, we'll come back. We'll be here.

986
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Fair point.

987
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay, we'll come back. We'll come back.

988
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We should have had him tell some stories

989
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
when he was actually available.

990
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We really fucked up.

991
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That's true.

992
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's true.

993
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That is true.

994
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You, you audience

995
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
you really screwed the pooch on this one.

996
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
At TP Crasinators

997
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
send us good questions

998
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that we can answer.

999
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Okay, so why don't I give, you were going to say something.

1000
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Let's talk about dying inside in the meantime, right?

1001
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh yeah, dying inside, well

1002
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I mean obviously depression

1003
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and all that sad stuff that happens

1004
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
all over the time, all over the place every day

1005
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but I can think of

1006
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
a very specific moment

1007
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
where I was at my lowest point ever

1008
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and it was before I was a

1009
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
YouTuber.

1010
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I had left school

1011
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
because it was ended

1012
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and then I was like, okay, what do I do?

1013
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I want to maybe go to university

1014
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
but I don't know what I want to do at university

1015
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't know what I want to do in my life

1016
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and so I took a year off

1017
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
before I

1018
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
made a decision. Everyone else in my class

1019
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
had made their decision and was going away

1020
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and getting the funny hats

1021
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and getting kids and all that

1022
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
shit and I was like, okay

1023
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm not sure about doing animation

1024
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
it seems scary

1025
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
so I was

1026
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
all sad and stuff and my parents were like

1027
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
well, if you're not going to

1028
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
go to university, you should

1029
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
get a job or go on the dole

1030
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
which is the benefits thing

1031
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
for working

1032
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
for looking for a job

1033
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and so I went

1034
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
to the thing

1035
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and it was really depressing because

1036
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
they really

1037
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
it's like a corporate

1038
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
building with people who hate their job

1039
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
sitting in a stuffy sort of building

1040
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and I have to go in and

1041
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
stamp the thing and files

1042
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and paperwork and all that

1043
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
they had recently changed the law

1044
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
when I got this

1045
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
so usually you would go in

1046
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm looking for work and then you would write down

1047
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
a bunch of things, say, proving

1048
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
links to websites that you were looking for

1049
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
work, obviously

1050
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
nobody had any proof, they just said they did

1051
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and that's how they got money

1052
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
but they changed the law

1053
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I did that

1054
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
on unemployment benefits

1055
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
at one point I got laid off

1056
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
from a job and I had to pretend

1057
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I was looking for real work while I continued

1058
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
while I got unemployment insurance from that

1059
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
it was great

1060
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
it would have been great for me too

1061
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
except for this law change where it said

1062
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
while you're looking for work

1063
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
in addition

1064
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
to proving that you're looking for work

1065
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
you have to do a certain amount of hours

1066
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
of volunteer work

1067
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
at charity shops

1068
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Jesus

1069
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
so I would have to get up

1070
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
really early and get on the bus

1071
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
to this

1072
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
quite far away place

1073
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
across the river, I don't know where it was

1074
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
in the part of time that I didn't understand

1075
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
or knew

1076
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and I think it was because I made a mistake

1077
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
on the paperwork

1078
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
they just sent me far away so I had to get up at

1079
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
like six every morning

1080
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
like three or four times a week

1081
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
probably three times a week

1082
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
to this charity shop

1083
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and the people in there were really

1084
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
no nonsense

1085
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
nobody liked me, nobody would give me

1086
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
any sort of

1087
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
let me get away with anything

1088
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
you have to work for this amount of time

1089
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
the first day I got there

1090
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
it was closed because the owner of the shop

1091
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
didn't turn up because she was sick

1092
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and I didn't get any

1093
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
hours

1094
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
for that day because she wasn't there

1095
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
so I had to go for an extra day and work overtime

1096
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and I was doing this for like

1097
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
two weeks before I decided

1098
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
that I would rather just walk the streets

1099
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and die

1100
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
and it was this one time

1101
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
where I was on the bus

1102
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
you know

1103
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
even my music in my headphones

1104
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
just sort of like

1105
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and this lady

1106
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
at the front of the bus

1107
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
she for some reason

1108
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
at some point and I didn't notice

1109
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
because I didn't hear because I had my headphones in

1110
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
she said alright everyone off

1111
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
this is going not in service bus

1112
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
at the moment and I was right at the back

1113
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and everyone else got off

1114
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and they looked at me and I looked at them

1115
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and they thought why aren't you getting off

1116
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
but they didn't say anything so I was just like

1117
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
everyone wants to get off at this stop

1118
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and then it kept going for a bit

1119
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and I realized wait

1120
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
she's

1121
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
not stopping at any of these bus stops

1122
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
she doesn't know that I'm here, what do I do

1123
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
and then

1124
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
at one point she glanced behind

1125
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
she saw that I was at the back of the bus and she said

1126
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
what the fuck you doing there

1127
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
she was like one of those you know

1128
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
real chevy, real sweary, angry

1129
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
bitches

1130
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
she said get the fuck off the bus

1131
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
you can't you just

1132
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I told you to get off

1133
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I told you to get off I'm like I didn't hear

1134
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
why is she so mean

1135
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
because she works in a bus

1136
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
that's fair

1137
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
wait

1138
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
why were you still on the bus past your stop

1139
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
he didn't hear dog he didn't hear the NS

1140
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I didn't hear that the bus had gone

1141
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
out of service and she was driving to the bus

1142
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
station to put it away

1143
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
so did she just drop you off like in the middle of nowhere

1144
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
yeah she dropped me off in the middle of nowhere

1145
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I didn't know where I was

1146
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I didn't know how many stops I had to go

1147
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and I was like you know what

1148
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
fuck this and I just started walking

1149
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
in the direction I assumed was home

1150
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I went into a library

1151
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I thought I could just stay here all day and then

1152
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
you know the police would get me

1153
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
something they'd file a missing persons report

1154
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
yeah

1155
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but I decided I was

1156
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
going to go on an adventure this was like

1157
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
this is the coolest thing that happened in the

1158
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
worst time possible

1159
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I was so depressed of life

1160
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I thought let's just walk and see if I can

1161
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
find my way home

1162
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
up to this point was this the time

1163
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
lowest of your life when you wanted to die

1164
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
when you were dumped off this bus

1165
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
yeah it was like

1166
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I thought that's what you were building too

1167
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
it was the lowest point in my life

1168
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
but it was the moment that I snapped

1169
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and said you know what

1170
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
fuck going to this stupid thing

1171
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I am just going to walk

1172
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
aimlessly until I can see a bus stop

1173
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
or a bus you know a bus number

1174
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
that I recognize I can get on that

1175
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and I can eventually find my way home

1176
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
and it took like six hours

1177
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and I finally got home and I was like okay

1178
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
time to play

1179
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
video games I guess

1180
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and then soon after that

1181
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I you know

1182
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
applied for university college

1183
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
whatever stuff and I got on

1184
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and all that and it was

1185
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
just a really cool moment where I decided

1186
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
to go on an adventure and I enjoyed it

1187
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
because of everything being

1188
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
terrible

1189
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I think we could all do with a little more adventurous moments

1190
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
like that in our lives

1191
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I condone such things

1192
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
yeah

1193
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and then I made a youtube channel

1194
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and it was up on up

1195
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
that was a mistake

1196
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
alright cool

1197
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
so it sounds like that actually

1198
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
got a little bit better at the end

1199
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
of it so that's

1200
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I wanted to end on a higher note because I don't want this

1201
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
this is like a really dour topic

1202
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
like oh did you almost die you're dead

1203
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and sadness and oh

1204
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
nobody believed that I was going to

1205
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
kill myself

1206
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
it's not a nice topic

1207
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you know it's a really depressing thing

1208
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I know this has been spoken at various times

1209
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
but like you know when you're really upset

1210
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I did just talk about this a couple times

1211
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
but like no one around knows

1212
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and you're just sitting there

1213
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
just want the world to burn

1214
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and everyone else is acting like there's nothing wrong

1215
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
oh that's my least favorite position

1216
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
to be because you can't even say anything

1217
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
you know you don't want to ruin everyone else's life

1218
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
with your shit

1219
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
it's also when you don't realize that you're not

1220
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
looking sad enough

1221
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
because you do

1222
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and nobody pays attention

1223
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you have that moment in your childhood

1224
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
where you realize

1225
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
or childhood or teenage life where you're depressed

1226
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and you realize that

1227
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
nobody's going

1228
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
nobody's looking out for you at the moment

1229
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
or at any point you just have to make sure

1230
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
you tell people things

1231
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
it's sort of like a transition

1232
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
sort of like you know

1233
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
your kid your parents are always looking out for you asking you

1234
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
if you're okay

1235
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and if nobody asks you if you're okay you can't say

1236
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm not okay

1237
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and it's like you got to get over that

1238
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that moment

1239
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and you become a real boy

1240
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
one day I'll figure it out

1241
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
one day I'll be a real boy

1242
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
but until that day

1243
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'll just be the best guy ever

1244
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
until that day

1245
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
like, share, subscribe, comment

1246
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
subscribe

1247
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000

1248
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
patreon.com slash cultcorona

1249
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
is that real

1250
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
this cult has got

1251
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
to heaven

1252
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
oh my god do you think I would

1253
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
get more money if I just made a patreon

1254
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
cultcorona

1255
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
he's the only one we love anymore

1256
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
watch it eclipse all of our patrons in one day

1257
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I think cultcorona is the only

1258
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
member of the PCP that is unanimously

1259
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
like universally

1260
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
by everyone

1261
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
for sure, agreed, totally agreed

1262
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I mean people would

1263
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
all like action giraffe but he's just too successful

1264
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and it really rubbed some people the wrong way

1265
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
everybody

1266
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
everybody hates Jess but they love

1267
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
cultcorona they have no idea

1268
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I taught that horse boy everything

1269
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
he fucking knows

1270
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I don't believe it

1271
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
he's got a pure soul that you could never touch

1272
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
jesse you couldn't

1273
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
you can't teach that

1274
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I gave him that soul I imbued it

1275
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
within him after stealing it from

1276
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
a thousand babies

1277
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
you breathe life into him

1278
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
with a kiss

1279
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I went to fucking china and I took

1280
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
all the dead female baby

1281
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
souls out of maiden astrea's

1282
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
swamp pit and I put them into

1283
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
that horsey body

1284
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
that horsey baby boy

1285
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and I created the perfect

1286
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
person

1287
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
the perfect person

1288
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
the cutest and the strongest

1289
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
the perfect person cultcorona

1290
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
with the soul of a thousand

1291
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
innocent newborn chinese female

1292
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
babies

1293
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
not tainted by the patriarchy one

1294
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
iota, thank god

1295
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
there's no patriarchy in the

1296
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
furnace room ladies

1297
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
everybody come on in

1298
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
it's a safe space for women

1299
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
everywhere

1300
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
women and horse boys

1301
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
so who else is

1302
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
a time I forget even what this

1303
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
fucking subject was like when they wanted to die

1304
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
was that what it was?

1305
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
it sort of merged into that

1306
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
it was times we almost died but there's

1307
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
only so many moments that you can even say

1308
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I was sick once

1309
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I mean I don't know if it's like

1310
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
technically almost dying but I do feel

1311
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
like living in this room

1312
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
for six years has dramatically

1313
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
decreased my life span

1314
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
quite possible

1315
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I feel like I'm generally ten thousand times

1316
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
less healthy than I was before I moved here

1317
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
you gotta run away

1318
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
you gotta escape

1319
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I gotta get all my stuff in like a stick

1320
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
with a little like a

1321
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
a bindle on a stick

1322
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
cause you got so many comics

1323
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
and games

1324
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and most of the only things you have

1325
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
no food

1326
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
no black dust

1327
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
just a raft made out of long boxes filled with

1328
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
comics and I'll sail the seas

1329
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
on them

1330
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
as all the comics get wet and ruined

1331
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
sailing the seas

1332
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
of the man child marsh

1333
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
so

1334
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I had a time

1335
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
that I wanted to die just for fun I thought

1336
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'd bring this up just for fun

1337
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I thought so there was a time

1338
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
when

1339
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I've said before there was a time when I was

1340
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
really into the pickup scene

1341
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and at one point I made

1342
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
a critical error

1343
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I would go out with my friends sometimes

1344
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
in Providence

1345
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and on this particular occasion

1346
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I made the crucial mistake

1347
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
of telling my friend Doug

1348
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
that my plan for the day was to

1349
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
talk to X number of girls

1350
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
just for my own personal checklist

1351
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
to get better at it

1352
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
what Doug did

1353
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Doug you fucking traitor

1354
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I've never addressed this to him because I'm too embarrassed

1355
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
but he then went around

1356
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
telling everyone

1357
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
hey that guy's got a goal of like

1358
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
he's trying to talk to a bunch of girls

1359
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
every girl go talk to him

1360
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
what are you doing over here

1361
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that's fucking helpful

1362
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
he ruined it

1363
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
thank god I'm so charismatic

1364
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I was able to spin it into a positive

1365
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
but he should know nonetheless

1366
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
he eats me up it was the worst thing Doug

1367
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
has ever done to me in his life

1368
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and one day I'll work up the courage to tell

1369
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
him that that's the case

1370
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
you can't trust friends man

1371
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
not with stuff like that

1372
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
anyway not with stuff like that

1373
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
so that was probably

1374
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
the time I was most embarrassed

1375
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
in my life I think

1376
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and would have happily accepted death

1377
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
yeah

1378
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
indeed

1379
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
so

1380
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
if anybody else doesn't have anything

1381
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
we can just go to questions before Tom comes back

1382
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I got one

1383
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
there's one time in TF2 where I got headshot

1384
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and then Pyro got me with

1385
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the fire and I was on fire I was like oh no

1386
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm gonna die

1387
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and then

1388
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
there's a thing where a scout sometimes

1389
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
uses a weapon and if he kills a guy

1390
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
he drops a health pack and he did that in front of me

1391
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
and I got a health and I live

1392
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I almost died

1393
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
there was this one time

1394
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
in League of Legends

1395
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I don't know who I was playing but I went down to 1 HP

1396
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
in this big team fight but I didn't die

1397
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
it was epic

1398
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
god I fucking hate video games

1399
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
if you die in the game

1400
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
you don't die for real

1401
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I think that if you die in the game

1402
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
you should die for real because then

1403
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
fucking people who play video games will all die

1404
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
because video games are gay

1405
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and they're not art

1406
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and they're standing in a crime

1407
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
what if you read a book and a character dies

1408
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
absolutely

1409
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
you definitely should die

1410
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
let me tell you

1411
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
let me go on a totally unrelated tangent

1412
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
that has nothing to do with anything

1413
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
because I have the power to do that

1414
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
and I'm gonna abuse it

1415
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
there's a scene

1416
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
it's a French movie called

1417
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The Rabbi's Cat

1418
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and it's animated and it's great

1419
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
but there's like

1420
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
a Russian guy

1421
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
it takes place in Algiers

1422
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
it's a Muslim city but with a big Jewish population

1423
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
it's kind of Middle Eastern

1424
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
isn't that where from Camus is from

1425
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
who the fuck is clopping

1426
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I think Tom is walking around

1427
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
stop it

1428
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
you damned innocent boy

1429
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
you don't know what sin you're committing

1430
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
okay well anyway

1431
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
so the main character is this Rabbi

1432
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and there's this Russian

1433
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
adventurer guy

1434
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and he's there in the city

1435
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
on some shitty quest

1436
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and they're talking with

1437
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
his Rabbi teacher

1438
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
and this kind of like fucking

1439
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
sort of like Libertine Russian guy

1440
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and the Russian guy is like ah you

1441
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
old man in your religion

1442
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I care about, I don't care about

1443
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
God or any of that bullshit

1444
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
all I care about is like

1445
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
all I care about is like

1446
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
adventure, women

1447
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and literature

1448
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
yeah

1449
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and the Rabbi is like

1450
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
man those are all things for young men

1451
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and I was like oh my god

1452
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
even literature

1453
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
especially literature

1454
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
he threw, he basically

1455
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I mean if literature is for young men

1456
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
then all art is for young men

1457
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
as far as I'm concerned the guy completely

1458
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
threw all artistic endeavor under the

1459
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
fucking bus and you know what

1460
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I was like oh my god maybe he's right

1461
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
in fact to this day

1462
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
to this day I'm not convinced that he wasn't right

1463
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that literature and by extension

1464
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
all art is just kid shit and we're all

1465
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
just fucking fooling ourselves

1466
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
that's fascinating

1467
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
while you're young and you have the information

1468
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and now you don't need anymore because you've got all of it

1469
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
who was this guy?

1470
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I didn't listen to the first half of the story

1471
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
but now I'm intrigued

1472
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
it was a character in a movie called the Rabbi's Cad

1473
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
you know what

1474
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and he was like this fast living

1475
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
kind of like nasty

1476
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
amoral Libertine Russian dude

1477
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
well I can see

1478
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
his point that art is all worthless

1479
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
oh no no it was the Rabbi

1480
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
the Rabbi said that art is for

1481
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
young men

1482
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I think I kind of agree with that

1483
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I agree

1484
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I was compelled

1485
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
from that guy's perspective

1486
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I think this is where he's coming from

1487
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
he's concerned about his community

1488
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
and the people he knows in his life

1489
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
and his relationship with God

1490
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
is what's important to him

1491
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
right so from that perspective

1492
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I totally get it

1493
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm very utilitarian

1494
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
about my

1495
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
usage of art

1496
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I think that art that doesn't

1497
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
do anything useful is basically garbage

1498
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
but if there's art with a good message

1499
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
or is trying to convey something valuable

1500
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
to the people intellectually

1501
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I see a value in it there

1502
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
but it's just like a tool

1503
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
like anything else for

1504
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
the betterment of humanity

1505
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I don't even think God could do that

1506
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I think just maybe

1507
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
doing things with your community

1508
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
or talking to people

1509
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
hey I'm a cool Rabbi in my neighborhood

1510
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
what's up peeps

1511
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
that might just be a better way to spend your time

1512
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I don't know

1513
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
this guy doesn't see any practical value in art

1514
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and you know what he's fucking right

1515
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
man this is a big left turn

1516
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
this is a big left turn of a topic

1517
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
but I really like it it's real cool

1518
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't know he's right

1519
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I think we can all agree art has no value

1520
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
utilitarian value I suppose

1521
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
you know what value

1522
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
is there besides utilitarian?

1523
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
well all value

1524
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
well I'll tell you

1525
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
there's no such thing as inherent value

1526
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I've never

1527
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I've never regretted

1528
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
a moment spent with friends

1529
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
or loved ones

1530
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
whereas I have regretted

1531
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
everything artistic I've ever done in my life

1532
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and everything that's come from it

1533
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
in spite of everything I just said

1534
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I have never regretted

1535
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
any time that I spent making anything

1536
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
but I regret so much of the time

1537
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I spent hanging out with friends

1538
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
making is different from consuming

1539
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I feel a little bit like Ben

1540
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I don't really

1541
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
there's only a few people I enjoy hanging out with

1542
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
in real life

1543
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and even those people it's not like I want to do it all the time

1544
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
yeah no

1545
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
totally

1546
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
but that's the thing there's a balance to be found

1547
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I think

1548
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I think it's like

1549
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
you need

1550
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
you know

1551
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
on a more base level

1552
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
you need human companionship

1553
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
more than you need to be entertained

1554
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
because like entertainment

1555
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
as it is

1556
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
art as entertainment is just

1557
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
to make you

1558
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
escape from reality

1559
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
because reality is kind of shit

1560
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
if you have everything

1561
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
you have food

1562
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
you have shelter you have family

1563
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and friends

1564
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
you don't really need anything else

1565
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
but if you have all that

1566
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
then I think art is a nice little distraction

1567
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
nice little addition

1568
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
cherry on top

1569
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and to your first point

1570
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
how much of the art that we consume

1571
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
especially like anime and stuff

1572
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
how much of that is just made to simulate human relationships

1573
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
to take the place of the hole in our lives

1574
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
that art is just there

1575
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
a ton

1576
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I'm seeing

1577
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm converting to Judaism as we speak

1578
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
like when people

1579
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I don't know

1580
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
like if two people

1581
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
two people are fans of Harry Potter

1582
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
two people love Harry Potter

1583
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
what that means is that the two of them

1584
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
have fucking shared

1585
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
this simulated experience

1586
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
of like fucking being

1587
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
a wizard

1588
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and that's what it is

1589
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
what Harry Potter fucking does

1590
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
simulate for anyone who reads it

1591
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
the experience

1592
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
of being a wizard child

1593
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and like

1594
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I don't know where I'm fucking going with this

1595
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I've got a point to go with that

1596
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
it's weird and bizarre for me to think of it that way

1597
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
but it makes sense to think of art is just

1598
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
all art is just a simulation

1599
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
it's basically no different

1600
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
than just putting on a VR headset

1601
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
it accomplishes the same fucking thing

1602
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
right and in that way

1603
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
you might ask the question

1604
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
why not just with that person

1605
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
just go have an experience

1606
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and then like bam

1607
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
you've just increased your human connection

1608
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
but there is a difference there

1609
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
well hang on

1610
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
one answer to that is that art can give you experiences

1611
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that you can't actually have in real life

1612
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
that's what I was going to say

1613
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and that's fair but

1614
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
are those experiences more valuable

1615
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
than ones that you actually can have in real life

1616
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
that's exactly where I was going to go to

1617
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
because like everything you experience in that way

1618
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
is like there are things that you normally wouldn't get in life

1619
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and you know what

1620
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
to some extent I think they could be useful

1621
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
because what an average human

1622
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
would experience in their life without VR

1623
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
we cannot say for sure that it is necessarily

1624
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
the most optimal way to live your life

1625
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
in terms of pragmatically and enjoyment wise

1626
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
so there may indeed be a place

1627
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
for simulated experiences in real life

1628
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
but we should find out what that is

1629
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
we should find that out

1630
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I just want to say

1631
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
the question for me then becomes

1632
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
for sure art can give you experiences

1633
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
that you can't have in real life

1634
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
but is it valuable to have experiences

1635
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
that are completely removed from reality

1636
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
we need to find that out I don't know

1637
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't fucking know

1638
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I was going to talk about the fact that he didn't like literature

1639
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and it's like not all art

1640
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
because literature is a story

1641
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm just going to say that I think

1642
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
art in terms of like

1643
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
a painting

1644
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
it's not the same sort of thing

1645
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
it's just something that makes you think

1646
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
you need to look at just to experience

1647
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
something to make the place

1648
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
you live in feel more pretty

1649
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
and decorative

1650
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
art as like

1651
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
as an expression

1652
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
of emotion is sort of different

1653
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
from art like literature and animation

1654
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and film and stuff like that

1655
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
well you know I mean that's interesting

1656
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
hang on I just want to say

1657
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I think he's got a good fucking point there

1658
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
fair enough but I was going to say

1659
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
that I was actually just doing a little bit of reading

1660
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I was watching some video I don't read anymore

1661
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
there was some thing I was consuming

1662
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
which was talking about

1663
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
the history of art and it talked about how

1664
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
like classical art work

1665
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
specifically it was like paintings and like drawings

1666
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
and stuff like that was depicted

1667
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
things that we like understand

1668
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
as real experiences that could be had

1669
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
like as human beings like there was

1670
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
photorealistic pictures of like

1671
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
fruit which is you can appreciate the skill

1672
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
with which they crafted it but really it's just

1673
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
a picture of fruit at the end of the day

1674
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
like the experience of fruit

1675
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
hang on I'm making a point

1676
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
and then there was like

1677
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
there's also like depictions of great scenes

1678
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
which capture like a snapshot of human life

1679
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
but again that's basically like a real

1680
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
thing or a story that we can understand

1681
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
and it's not really making any grander

1682
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
point other than illustrating perhaps the value

1683
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
of that thing as a human experience

1684
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
but like modern art and post-modern art

1685
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
are taking that thing and

1686
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
turning it on its head and they're exploring the ways

1687
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
like if that's even a valuable thing

1688
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
by doing things like like showing the

1689
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
absurdity of putting like just

1690
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
a drawing on a pedestal or putting like

1691
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
you know something like a urinal which is like this famous piece

1692
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
from the 30s making a urinal

1693
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
with no special qualities saying

1694
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
that that's art and having people like comment

1695
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
on if that has any inherent value

1696
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
by itself so it kind of raises the question

1697
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
about if any of this is

1698
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
valuable to begin with and like how far

1699
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
does the stack of turtles go before we actually hit

1700
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
like something that we're like

1701
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
learning or like achieving through art

1702
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
you know? You know what I mean?

1703
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I think if an art, if a piece of art

1704
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
can help us to better

1705
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
improve our social life

1706
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
or you know

1707
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
like the base level stuff

1708
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
the social life and the

1709
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
stability of your community

1710
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
and art can help that

1711
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
then I think it does have value in that way

1712
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Personally I really hate

1713
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I feel like art is useful in

1714
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
just making people feel better

1715
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and being able to do things like that

1716
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Personally I really hate the idea

1717
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
that like the purpose of art

1718
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
and the value of art is some like

1719
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
pragmatic like tangible benefit

1720
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
that it has on other areas of what this is

1721
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
What else could there be? What else could there be?

1722
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You're talking about like a pragmatic value

1723
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
So there just is none?

1724
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I don't know, well yeah

1725
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Art can have social benefit

1726
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
but like I don't fucking

1727
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
think, I don't know

1728
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
like if that's what art was

1729
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
if the value of art was like

1730
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
it makes people feel better

1731
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
it makes people not kill themselves

1732
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
it makes people's communities better

1733
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I would not do it

1734
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Kill yourselves fags

1735
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Kill yourselves

1736
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I was only like presenting that as like

1737
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
a reason for art to be

1738
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
cause like personally I think art is just like

1739
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
if it's fun to make then you know

1740
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
it's a fun pastime that's good

1741
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
if it's fun to look at then yeah that's good

1742
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
that's just nice, why wouldn't you make art

1743
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
and have art

1744
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
the act of creating art doesn't have to

1745
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
necessarily be

1746
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
what people get out of it like Ben you could make

1747
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
something just cause like I feel like doing this

1748
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
but people could get something more pragmatic

1749
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
or like deep out of it that you've never intended

1750
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
to do so it really

1751
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
could really not like

1752
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
your responsibility but I need to make this

1753
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
but that's not why I do it

1754
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and you know I don't think that's good

1755
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
personally for me that's not

1756
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
good enough that's not enough justification

1757
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and I would say I do

1758
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
like that idea but what I would do

1759
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
is I would scientifically like

1760
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
study what art form produces

1761
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
the best tangible results and whatever that is

1762
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
that's where I would focus like

1763
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
artistic endeavor if I controlled society

1764
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
cause I am interested in

1765
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
progressing and making

1766
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
cooler shit really I'm talking about making art

1767
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
to make like the iPhone 8 or you know

1768
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
to like get to the next level whatever

1769
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
yeah go to Mars

1770
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
what you would do is you should make

1771
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
sci-fi fantasy

1772
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
so that scientists will be

1773
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
inspired to make new

1774
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I totally agree but yeah

1775
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but I don't care about that as much as you seem to

1776
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I'm curious

1777
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Ben brought up just the concept of

1778
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
value itself and like what we define

1779
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
as having value and I think you were saying

1780
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
that there is no inherent value and it's just what we

1781
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
there absolutely isn't

1782
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I mean it depends on what level you're talking about cause like

1783
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
at the deepest foundation at some point

1784
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
yes we have to decide what we think is valuable

1785
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
such as human life or

1786
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
or currency or you know all those things

1787
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
we have basically decided to place

1788
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
value on so I guess that's your point

1789
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
that is my point that is ultimately

1790
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
what Bob boils down to

1791
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
yeah it depends on whether you think

1792
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I mean I guess you know our nature

1793
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
as humans to procreate and keep

1794
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
the species going is like

1795
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
do you believe that that's you know something

1796
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
that you agree with do you agree with your nature

1797
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
or do you not care and think everything

1798
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
is valueless I just think that

1799
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
at a basic human level

1800
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
we are more or less

1801
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
all able to agree

1802
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
on like the rules of the game you know

1803
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
what are generally winning moves and what are

1804
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
generally losing moves and

1805
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I think what just once we've

1806
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
established that then you can build a society

1807
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and I don't think it's crazy

1808
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
to establish rules like

1809
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
life is generally preferable to death

1810
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and like pleasure or

1811
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I guess lack of pain is better

1812
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
than pain you know like

1813
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
things like that and then from there you can

1814
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
find out ways to

1815
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
pursue all that stuff and that's what I base my shit on

1816
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
here's the point here's

1817
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
what it all boils down to this is a spoiler

1818
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I'm gonna spoil the end

1819
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
of the rabbi's cat

1820
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
it's a good movie you should watch it

1821
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
and don't let me spoil it but I'm gonna spoil it anyway

1822
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
you see the rabbi

1823
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and the Russian guy

1824
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
and like a fucking

1825
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
what's the word for like a Muslim priest is it an imam

1826
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I think it might be an imam yeah I think that's right

1827
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
yeah and an imam and

1828
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
a couple other guys

1829
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
like some painter guy

1830
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
they all get together

1831
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and they embark on

1832
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
they embark on a quest

1833
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
across Africa

1834
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
to find

1835
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
the shared

1836
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
ancestors of all blacks and

1837
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Jews

1838
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
they believe that all blacks

1839
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
and all Jews share a common ancestor

1840
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and they find a tribe

1841
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and they find

1842
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
a tribe like hidden in Africa

1843
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
of these giant

1844
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
they kind of like Aztec looking warriors

1845
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
but like they're so dark

1846
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
that like they're blue like they're literally blue

1847
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
and they're just

1848
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
giant like 10 foot tall dudes

1849
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
and they're all these big like fucking

1850
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
like African warriors living in this

1851
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
in this temple city reading the Torah

1852
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and like fucking giving each other

1853
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
giving each other bar mitzvahs and stuff

1854
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and they're there and they're like hey our brethren

1855
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
but like you know they're so fucking

1856
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
removed from their culture

1857
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that they can't even fucking understand what they're saying

1858
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
they don't even they're just

1859
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
even though these guys come trying to forge a connection

1860
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
they're like oh shit an intruder

1861
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
we're so fucking we're so removed from culture

1862
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
that like we can't understand this as anything other than

1863
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
an intrusion and we must destroy

1864
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and so it doesn't really work

1865
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
they do find the shared ancestor

1866
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
of all blacks and Jews

1867
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
but they do not make peaceful content

1868
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
contact contact

1869
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and it's a really good movie

1870
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I mean isn't I mean so

1871
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
there were like people in Saudi Arabia

1872
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and then Muhammad was born

1873
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and then you know

1874
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
like people became Islamic

1875
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
and the rest is history

1876
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
but I don't think those people were Jews though

1877
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I think they were unrelated

1878
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I don't think that there actually is a

1879
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
fucking common I don't fucking

1880
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I can't speak to the fucking historical

1881
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
veracity of anything that I just said

1882
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
that's just what happens in the movie

1883
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
that's the end of the story

1884
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I don't know

1885
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
does that have any

1886
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
no that has absolutely no bearing on anything

1887
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I just wanted to say it because it's really funny

1888
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I was trying to

1889
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
figure it out

1890
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
this is not going anywhere

1891
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
fair enough

1892
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
like most of Ben's contributions

1893
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
adds nothing to the podcast

1894
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
so thanks again for that Ben

1895
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I was thinking about what the rabbi said

1896
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
what was it, women literature

1897
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
and something else

1898
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
yeah it was something women in literature

1899
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
and that's all he cares about

1900
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
and he said it was for young men

1901
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
the rabbi said those are for

1902
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
young men

1903
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
they have a purpose

1904
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
not for me, I'm old

1905
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
maybe his point, maybe we were totally wrong

1906
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
and he's more like a guy that when you're young

1907
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
pursue these things to develop a life

1908
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
philosophy but when you're old stick with it

1909
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
or something like that

1910
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
if a thing's value

1911
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
eventually goes away

1912
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and you're no longer valuable once you're old

1913
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
was it ever fucking valuable

1914
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I mean maybe his point is just that

1915
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
our brains solidify and we're not as able

1916
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
to absorb new ideas in an effective way

1917
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
but this fucking comes back around to that thing

1918
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
about how I hate to think

1919
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I don't believe that art's value is

1920
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
the fucking pragmatic

1921
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
the tangible benefits that it has

1922
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
unlike it makes us function better

1923
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I don't accept that

1924
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
we need to talk to this guy and get his point

1925
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I think all value in everything is completely subjective

1926
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I disagree

1927
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
of course

1928
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
for me

1929
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I don't think

1930
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
art is valuable

1931
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
because young men read it

1932
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and it makes them better people

1933
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I don't think that's good enough and I hate that

1934
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
if that's what this rabbi believed

1935
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
then I have to say that I'm not satisfied

1936
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
with it

1937
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I think that art just isn't valuable because

1938
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
people watch it

1939
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
and people are dumb and they don't deserve it

1940
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
yeah

1941
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
people who make it dumb too

1942
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I think that art is only worthless

1943
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
so much in that human beings are worthless

1944
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
well that's

1945
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
if human beings are worthless and art is

1946
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
for human beings

1947
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I think that art is

1948
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
for me

1949
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
and I think that human beings just exist

1950
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
to ruin art wherever they go

1951
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
by not being me and not appreciating it

1952
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
correctly

1953
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
but that's not what I was going to say

1954
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
and I

1955
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
one day you and me will pull a Columbine

1956
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
in this whole country Jesse

1957
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and then we'll find out

1958
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
who's the real artist in town

1959
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
and we'll find out who's the real procrastinator

1960
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
yeah we'll get around to Columbining America

1961
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
eventually

1962
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
we all get together

1963
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
we all get together for Radcon 10

1964
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and we're just like

1965
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
and you know Digi's just passing out guns

1966
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and he's like are you with us

1967
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
or against us

1968
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
if we fucking get to 10 Radcons

1969
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I will start killing people

1970
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
not even a joke

1971
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
somebody's gotta start dying by then

1972
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
somebody's gotta die

1973
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
yep

1974
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
to keep the content fresh somebody has to die each time

1975
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
we have to

1976
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
we do like a poem

1977
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I definitely think that we're the critical mass

1978
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
where if we add any new members

1979
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
an old member needs to leave this fucking group

1980
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
yeah

1981
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
hey maybe now's a good time to bring up the fact that

1982
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
hey guys over

1983
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
we've been getting messages every once in a while

1984
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
just saying like hey dude what do I have to do to join the PCP

1985
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
and like oh I can't wait till I can join

1986
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I just want to let everybody know

1987
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
that we are not looking for new members

1988
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
and if you're confused by Munchie and

1989
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Munky's recent addition

1990
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
those are guys that we've known for a while

1991
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
especially Munchie

1992
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and like they were always sort of

1993
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
like there are buddies and they were sort of being introduced

1994
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
after a while

1995
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
a terrible mistake has been made somewhere along the line

1996
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
they accidentally presented the PCP

1997
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
as like a club

1998
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I think giving it a name even

1999
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
was wrong cause we're

2000
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
yeah it was a necessary evil though

2001
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
cause we had to call it something

2002
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
yeah like I never set out to be part of a club

2003
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I don't consider myself part of a group

2004
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I just these are

2005
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
this is a goofy podcast with guys that I

2006
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
kind of like sometimes

2007
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and

2008
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I don't know I just see you guys as friends

2009
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and we're not a fucking like coalition

2010
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
aggression to add people

2011
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
if anymore people get added

2012
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I never

2013
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
saw it that way either but like

2014
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
the people that listen sometimes

2015
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
do seem to see it that way and they love it

2016
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
so I mean

2017
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
if they choose to interpret it that way

2018
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
that's fine and I've wanted to work with you guys

2019
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
for years which is why we started this

2020
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
so that we could do something and there's no

2021
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
avoiding being grouped together

2022
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
when you're making something so

2023
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
it's a sacrifice I'm willing to

2024
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
there's no

2025
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
path to like earning your way in

2026
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
it's just

2027
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
the PCP is just who we all

2028
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
happen to know and like

2029
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
and you know occasionally maybe want to

2030
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
fucking work with on stuff

2031
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
like Mumpy was a guy who we found

2032
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and we all instantly liked and then we got

2033
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
to know him over

2034
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
like a year and then it was just like

2035
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
hey let's just bring him in to do stuff

2036
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
and then it just was perfectly natural

2037
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
to add him so I mean just you know

2038
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
if you're a creator and you are making

2039
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
perfect stuff I don't know maybe

2040
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
all that is is that

2041
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
you know people will just think well

2042
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I mean they say I'm not allowed in

2043
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
but if I'm like a really good content creator

2044
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
maybe they'll just like me and they'll

2045
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
look I have a problem with that

2046
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
if you're a pretty girl

2047
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
if you're a pretty girl and you have sex with me

2048
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
then you can be my friend

2049
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
but you still can't be in my fucking

2050
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
PCP

2051
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I wanted to hear where Hippo is going with that

2052
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
well I mean

2053
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
people are going to like assume they can

2054
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
like if they make good enough content

2055
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
they can get in the group and that's

2056
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
the thing is

2057
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
it's not like we're saying

2058
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
no one will ever be our friend

2059
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
because that's not true we will make friends

2060
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
eventually with other people who are cool

2061
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
it's just that this particular group

2062
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
it's not really

2063
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
like it's not really something

2064
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
you can join and just suddenly be in the chat

2065
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
we'll make friends

2066
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
we'll make friends and make connections

2067
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
and be in like other little groups

2068
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
but it's just this is sort of like full

2069
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
we're just getting a lot

2070
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
of prepositions lately

2071
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
from people that we then have to

2072
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
spurn and break their hearts

2073
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
it's like being a single white woman

2074
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
guys are coming after me sniffing around my cooter

2075
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I just want to focus on my career

2076
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I just want to be a lawyer

2077
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
in the big city

2078
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
in the big city and make it on your own

2079
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
it's like being the only femme boy

2080
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
in the house dance

2081
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
everyone wants your attention

2082
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
and you can't service everybody

2083
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
who comes knocking at your cell door

2084
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
there's only enough booty for one man at a time

2085
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
that's right

2086
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
so

2087
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
stop asking that question

2088
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
that's the fucking point fuck off

2089
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
shut up

2090
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
shut up and fuck off

2091
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
but we love you anyway

2092
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
we do

2093
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
so should we swing back

2094
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
do you have time to tell us your stories now dawg

2095
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I mean I can

2096
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I feel like we've gone off the

2097
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
existential deep end

2098
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
that's true

2099
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I just wanted to give you an opportunity

2100
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
maybe there's one that's particularly

2101
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
interesting or something

2102
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
the only one that was even

2103
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
semi interesting was when I almost killed myself

2104
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
from working too hard

2105
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
that sounds relevant

2106
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I don't think I've heard it

2107
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I think I've heard bits and pieces of it

2108
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
it was back when

2109
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I first got started doing horse stuff

2110
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
and I was working a job

2111
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
and I was working all night on making

2112
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
the picture book

2113
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and I was downing tons of

2114
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
energy drinks

2115
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I had like 3 a day

2116
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and my heart was like

2117
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
tweaking out and I had to go to the hospital

2118
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
and I was there for like a few hours

2119
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I was sitting with my dad

2120
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
he was just like fucking retarded

2121
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and I'm like yeah that's true

2122
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
they had me hooked up to one of those

2123
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
part beat monitor thing

2124
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
am I still in this?

2125
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
and it was weird because we like skip a beat

2126
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
every time you go see it as it did it

2127
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
oh my god

2128
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
it just shut off

2129
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
oh fuck my dad's like

2130
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I gotta get somebody like the equipment

2131
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
fucked up and I'm like yeah I guess

2132
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
and then like 3 seconds later my whole body went numb

2133
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and cold

2134
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and I was just like

2135
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
it's not the equipment

2136
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
at the time I assume you were

2137
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I couldn't move

2138
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
it felt like instantly I was in a freezer

2139
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
cause like my heart stopped so there was no blood circulating

2140
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and I was just dying

2141
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
and for like it was a solid like 15 seconds

2142
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
before it like beat

2143
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
really hard and like my whole body jolted

2144
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and it started again

2145
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
and like

2146
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
the closest I came to death was like

2147
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
when my heart stopped for like a very noticeable

2148
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
amount of time

2149
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
fascinating

2150
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
and on that note thank you for listening

2151
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
to the Procrest days

2152
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
speaking of death

2153
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
did I miss anything?

2154
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
no I mean you can listen back he told a story

2155
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and it was equally traumatic as the first time I heard it

2156
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I missed it

2157
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I missed it

2158
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
listen back god damn it it was the rest of the audience it'll be there

2159
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
tell it again make the audience

2160
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I've never listened to a PCP

2161
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
episode and I won't start now

2162
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
what a hero

2163
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
alright well how about we

2164
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
shift over to questions now what do you say folks

2165
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
let's do it

2166
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
we have run for over an hour

2167
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
we're at an hour and 20 minutes

2168
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
let's see here

2169
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
what do we got

2170
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I think there was some

2171
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
decent ones here

2172
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
fill time

2173
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
somebody fill time give

2174
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
what's your favorite color

2175
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
blue

2176
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
you're fired

2177
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
that's the one

2178
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
what the reference

2179
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
hey here's a fun one to fill a little bit of time

2180
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
ok by

2181
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
at batsling1234

2182
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
would someone take up this challenge

2183
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
describe the PCP to someone who

2184
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
never uses the internet

2185
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
oh man it's a bunch of guys

2186
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
and a girl

2187
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and then mage

2188
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
oh got her

2189
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
who's the girl no one will know

2190
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
it's a loose coalition

2191
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
of gays

2192
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
in a straight world

2193
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
united against the oppressive

2194
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
matriarchy

2195
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
do you remember that one kid in your

2196
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
kindergarten class that ate glue

2197
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
imagine if there were like seven of them

2198
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and they all talked to each other for an hour

2199
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
do you say that was you Gib?

2200
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I didn't eat glue I like putting glue on my hands

2201
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
and peeling it off when it dried

2202
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
oh fuck yeah dude oh fuck yeah

2203
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
that was the shit that was the jam dog

2204
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I'm serious

2205
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I remember doing that a little bit

2206
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
ok here's another question

2207
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
oh shit where'd it go

2208
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
oh Gib this one is directed at you

2209
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
it's actually not specifically but it's for you

2210
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
it's just have any of the PCP members

2211
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
played Fire Emblem Heroes

2212
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
and what are your thoughts in your main

2213
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
teams

2214
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
let me look at my main team right now

2215
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I'm playing this game currently as well

2216
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
oh yeah I'm not playing it because

2217
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I already played too many mobile games

2218
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I got Lisa

2219
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
from Fire Emblem Awakening

2220
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Florina from my favorite game ever

2221
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Kane from something

2222
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
and Faye the dragon

2223
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
and I got their like four and five star

2224
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
characters and they're really good and the game

2225
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
is great and I like it and it's good and I like it

2226
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
so I was just curious oh sorry

2227
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
go on top go on top I was just going to say I only started a couple days ago

2228
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I have nobody good my

2229
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
my summons have been shitty

2230
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I only have three star guys except for one

2231
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
four star ninja dude who's kind of cool

2232
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
the game is really fun

2233
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
yeah you got fucked

2234
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and every time my guy levels there's just like one stat boost

2235
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
and like that's it so like I can't even win

2236
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
the training mission now so I might have just restart

2237
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
entirely

2238
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
the only thing I don't like is the fact

2239
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
and not even that I don't like it but I just find it odd

2240
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
that because they outsourced all the art to a bunch of different people

2241
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
like there's like 15 different art styles in the game

2242
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
and it doesn't really match very well

2243
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I thought they were recycling art styles from like the original

2244
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
games for some is that not true

2245
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
no they're all different

2246
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
but some of them definitely look more interesting

2247
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
what's annoying

2248
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I can see why that would clash

2249
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I would at least expect it to be like one

2250
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
by the way the voice actor

2251
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
for Florina is the cutest

2252
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
ever and if you get her you will enjoy

2253
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
the fact that she goes um

2254
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
when you look on her

2255
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
please make a video where you document

2256
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
these audio sounds because they're not on the internet

2257
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
and I want to hear that

2258
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
yeah I will I'm going to make a miniscule review

2259
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
oh excellent fantastic

2260
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I'm looking forward to it

2261
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
what was I going to say

2262
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
the only reason I'm at all tempted to play that game

2263
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
is because I'm sure it's the reason 99%

2264
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
of people play because I want to see

2265
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Camilla and Lynn and just

2266
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
you know just be around them because they're the hottest women

2267
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
you know ever that's it

2268
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
that's the only reason

2269
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
there's like a 3% rate of getting

2270
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
like one of those 5 star characters

2271
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
so you have to grind to infinity

2272
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
yeah I'm very lucky in that

2273
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I've already got two 5 stars

2274
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
so that's cool

2275
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
here's a question

2276
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Jesse this one's for you

2277
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
how do I become a sweet shirt

2278
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
first of all does he even want to be

2279
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
a sweet shirt

2280
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
sweet shirts good yeah you just got to wear

2281
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
sweet shirts yeah it's a combination

2282
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
of the sweet boy and the shit shirt

2283
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
but it's not like actually a combination

2284
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
it's just a combination of the word

2285
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
well no a sweet boy is bad

2286
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
the shit shirt is definitely bad

2287
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
a sweet probably the worst

2288
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
but a sweet shirt

2289
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
is like right in that happy medium

2290
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
of traits for a human to possess

2291
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
damn

2292
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
all you got to do is describe yourself as a sweet shirt

2293
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
what about a shit boy

2294
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
oh the best

2295
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I haven't quite cracked the code on shit boy yet

2296
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I think I'd like to give that one a spin

2297
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
you know all you got to do to be a sweet shirt

2298
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
is just just wear sweet

2299
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
shirts damn

2300
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and uh you know

2301
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
yeah but I mean it's

2302
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
like a fellow it's a minute to learn a lifetime

2303
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
to master yeah that's right

2304
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
you know it's more complicated people think

2305
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I mean people don't realize you know what

2306
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
constitutes a sweet shirt you can't just throw

2307
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
any old rag on you can't just have some

2308
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
shirt with some shit you like on it because

2309
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
some shirts are cluttered the designs are too

2310
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
complicated some shirt you know

2311
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I'll give you I'll give people some advice for

2312
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000

let's talk about about selling these

2334
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
things why don't we have that

2335
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
that's because it takes effort and I'm the

2336
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
only one who does anything besides Jesse besides

2337
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Digi who edits them together I'll do that

2338
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000

01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
fucking step up to the plate I know someone

2340
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
does oh by the way I'm sorry

2341
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I wanted to say the names of people after

2342
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
these questions I forgot to the fire emblem

2343
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
question was by at hooded lefty

2344
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and the

2345
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
fuck where those good fucking question

2346
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I can't remember what it was

2347
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
the the sweet shirt was by at track

2348
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
master track so thanks guys and

2349
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
one more question here and this was actually

2350
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I'm taking this one because this is personal

2351
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Jesse this is sort of a question for you

2352
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
this actually wasn't a question at all it was

2353
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
just I'm taking it because I have

2354
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
a personal interest because I watched a video about

2355
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
it even though I didn't watch it

2356
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I only the only good royal rumble

2357
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
this year was by at TP

2358
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
crashed by the procrastinators

2359
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
fuck Roman those by Jen is

2360
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
maku do Mario and I

2361
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
was just wondering I I tweeted before

2362
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
there was this compilation of everyone

2363
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
disappointed that the 30th Royal Rumbleman

2364
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
was fucking Roman Reigns

2365
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
and I was just wondering how that worked out what

2366
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
went down well they just they just

2367
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
won't they just won't quit

2368
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
they won't give up on the Roman Reigns they won't

2369
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
accept that like Roman Reigns is not going

2370
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
to happen they they can't accept it

2371
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and they keep trying it's been like

2372
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
like three years of him getting boot out of

2373
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
the building and he just won't stop

2374
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
did he win did he

2375
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
win the thing thank God but it's like it was

2376
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
especially dumb because like he had already

2377
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
had a match earlier in the night

2378
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Oh for like

2379
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
okay and like the match earlier in

2380
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
the night was for the championship

2381
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
and he lost and

2382
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
the good like the prize

2383
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
of the Royal Rumble is a chance

2384
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
to get a championship match

2385
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
so it's like

2386
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
if he was already in a championship

2387
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
match that night and lost how

2388
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
in the fuck did he get a spot

2389
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
in the Royal Rumble that's a great 10 minutes

2390
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
like you assume that the spots are

2391
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
filled up before the fucking show starts

2392
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
like did he go up did he go

2393
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
after his match and like assassinate

2394
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
whoever was supposed to be number 30

2395
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
and take this spot if he if he did if they

2396
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
had showed that it would have been okay

2397
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
but they it's just a weird I hope dumb

2398
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
plot hole

2399
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
it was glue man it was gonna be the

2400
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
glue man glue man who was finally

2401
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
about to make his debut and Roman took him out

2402
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
that monster

2403
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I was gonna say that

2404
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
there was there was another new contender

2405
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
was gonna take that 30th spot

2406
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
but he was assassinated and the crowd could just hear

2407
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
the faint

2408
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
from backstage

2409
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
during the

2410
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000

2411
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000

stuff there was not made by us so there's

2461
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
totally possible there's tons of inaccuracies

2462
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
whatever there is it's terrible I

2463
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
definitely want to die looking at it

2464
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
the only good page

2465
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
is the one that munchie made

2466
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
for the undertailer 587 which has

2467
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
extensive lore

2468
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
that lore didn't even exist until he started

2469
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
writing that page and he's just going ham

2470
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
feel flushing out

2471
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
that's the only

2472
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
he's been established that the undertailer

2473
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
is a code red threat

2474
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
that's right

2475
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I forgot about that

2476
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
watch out for that guy

2477
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
that's my favorite part

2478
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
code red threat

2479
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
we need to establish a whole system of codes

2480
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
based off that the implications are far

2481
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
reaching

2482
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000

01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
to be working

2495
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000

2496
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
but I'm not working

2497
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I'm doing nothing

2498
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
my dick I'm jerking

2499
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
myself I'm

2500
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
sucking

2501
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I am an asshole

2502
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I am a stupid

2503
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I've got a

2504
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
deadline

2505
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
don't want to do it

2506
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
what the hell is wrong

2507
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
with me

2508
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I'm supposed to be

2509
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
making money

2510
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I'm supposed

2511
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
to be creating

2512
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
funny

2513
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
things that the people

2514
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
gladly will pay

2515
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
for

2516
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
artistic genius

2517
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
that's what they came

2518
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
for instead I'm

2519
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
tweeting

2520
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
hashtag repeating

2521
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
that's why there's no

2522
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
weed and holes in the ceiling

2523
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
yeah

2524
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
it's quite the burden

2525
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
it's a hard knock life

2526
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
being

2527
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
a genius
