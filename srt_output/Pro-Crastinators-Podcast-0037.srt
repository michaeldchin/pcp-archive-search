1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
A boy was wandering far from home with his loyal growlith, Growly.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,600
They were both freezing and they hadn't eaten in days.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,600
Growly, I'm not going to make it.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Leave me alone and save yourself.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,000
The angels have come for me.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Farewell, I leave this cruel world for a better place.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Remember me, Grow...

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,200
Ugh.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Growl...

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,200
Growl...

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,000
Growl...

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Growl...

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Yay!

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Yeah, we're back.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
We're back.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Even better than it was the last time, baby.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Mm-mm-mm.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm good and we're back.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,000
And it is me, the best guy ever, joined by a whole cast of deplorables.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
First up, we got...

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
A whole nation of them.

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
A whole nation of...

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,000
A whole nation of basket.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
A basket, that's right.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
That's the one.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,200
So hey, there's Digibro over there.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
Hey, what's up buddy?

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Over there is Ben Saint.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, that's me. That's me.

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
We got Lethal Aurora Mage.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm back.

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
With a much improved mic to my delight.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, that's right.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
That's right.

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Here's Hippocrite.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Gotta catch a mole.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
And, uh...

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Throw me off there.

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
And, uh, uh, Monkey Jones.

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Well, if it isn't that motherfucker Ben Saint.

44
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,400
You son of a bitch.

45
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, but before things get too crazy here.

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
My mortal enemy.

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Fucking hate this bastard.

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Now, hang on guys.

49
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
We have to establish this.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is an official...

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sputtering with rage.

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Sputtering, I tell you.

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,600
This is an official government sanctioned safe space.

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,000
This is a safe space between the nations of Ben Saint and Monkey Jones.

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Have you provided Legos and Play-Doh for constructive, non-critical play?

56
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
I need a coloring book, dude.

57
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
That's right.

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
There are looping videos of cute puppies and cats.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So don't fret.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm allergic to cats.

61
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
You're free to excuse yourself.

62
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Monkey hates dogs.

63
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
This is triggering.

64
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
You're triggering.

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Whee!

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
I hate being relaxed.

67
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I hate not being triggered.

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,600
It triggers me.

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, no.

70
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
What do we do?

71
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
All right.

72
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, okay.

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Now that's out of the way.

74
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,200
So, so this is, uh, uh, quite a fortuitous time to be alive.

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Cause as you know, folks, uh, if you're not already following the glorious battle

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,800
between Ben Saint and Monkey Jones.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Actually, we haven't seen your battle yet, have we?

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It hasn't gotten to that point yet.

79
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
It has not aired yet.

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
It'll be out on December 1st, I think.

81
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, it's really December 1st.

82
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, so that's it.

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
It's coming.

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Um, yes.

85
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Well, that'll, that'll be hype as fuck anyway.

86
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,400
So we're here to celebrate not only their great battle, uh, but, but the,

87
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,800
the field upon which that battle is taking place, the release of Pokemon Sun and Moon.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
The new, new, that's the, that's the hot topic.

89
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
I mean, it's hot for me.

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
It's hot.

92
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,000
But it's called for monkey because he's using these moon instead of sun.

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Yeah.

94
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,200
Yes.

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes.

96
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
So let's, uh, we're going to talk about, about Sun and Moon and our thoughts on it

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
and stuff, um, and also Pokemon in general.

98
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
And then I think we'll probably spend more time on that because a lot of the things

99
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,800
that I personally have to say about Sun and Moon are specifically in the context

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,800
of the whole series and how kind of just ways that they could be improved

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
or my personal vision for what it could be.

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
And I'll be interested to hear what you guys all have to say.

103
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,200
So who's got a hot opinion about Sun and Moon?

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
I got a hot opinion.

105
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,000
I got a hot opinion.

106
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,800
I got to say that I've thought a lot about it and I see the pros.

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
I see the good points of Pokemon Ride.

108
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
I really do.

109
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,800
There's some things about it that I like, but overall I hate it.

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
About Pokemon?

111
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Pokemon Ride.

112
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Oh, Ride.

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
Like, like I get the advantage.

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Oh, come on, you fucking baby.

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,800
No, you're the baby.

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
You're not even a human.

117
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Get out of here.

118
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,200
It's OK.

119
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
It is kind of cool, but all right.

120
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Just OK.

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Everyone's like, oh, now now there's no more HMS.

122
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Thank God.

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
Now we can just ride them.

124
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,200
I mean, I've complained about HMS before and I didn't like them.

125
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,200
But but the chains that they have made, they didn't fix them in the way I wanted

126
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,600
them to, I wanted them to fix them in a way that made Pokemon feel more like real

127
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
things that like I have.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Wanted it to be like your Pokemon can just surf if they're a water Pokemon.

129
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,400
You don't have to.

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Right.

131
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,800
They made it even less like that.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Now no Pokemon can surf.

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
No Pokemon that you catch.

134
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Can you ride on now?

135
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
Only this one lapras.

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Yeah, but can you imagine that actually going to the process of having every

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,600
water Pokemon have its own sprite?

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
How are you going to ride on your tent to cruel?

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
What's that going to look like?

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,600
I don't.

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
It doesn't matter.

142
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, it would be easy.

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Here's where you're fucked up, Ben.

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Go ahead, Hippo.

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Well, I can imagine it being easy if they just if they just swap out a model of

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,800
like the idle animation for like for swimming.

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
I mean, you know what that look like?

148
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
You know what that look like?

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
You know when I was just using my two cannon who's using his his Z attack of

150
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
which is another topic that we can talk about.

151
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,000
But like when he does his Z attack, it's it's sort of a generic

152
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,000
like he's just doing an idle animation.

153
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,400
He's put through this big.

154
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
He's put through this big sort of attack thing.

155
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
But the thing is he flies up and he dives down to do this attack.

156
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,800
He is a perfectly stationary bird with his wings folded at his sides.

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
While he is doing this attack, it looks ridiculous.

158
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,200
It looks.

159
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,000
It doesn't have you seen that one of way Lord doing the like the spin attack?

160
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,600
No, I think did you didn't you retweet it?

161
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Is it the steel one or something?

162
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,600
I have no idea.

163
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
There's I don't know.

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Yeah, because it was some weird music.

165
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
The point is this way.

166
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
He just does this incredible like fucking disco spin.

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,400
It's like it's a whale.

168
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, that sounds awesome.

169
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,400
OK, but my point is just that I think that practically if they did some sort of

170
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,400
generic like use a ride animation thing, it would it would be similarly.

171
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, for water, I think it could work.

172
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't think it could work for ground type because they wouldn't be moving.

173
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah. And here's where Ben fucked up.

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,800
I think the reason why he doesn't like this is because you picked the male

175
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
character, the female character when you ride a Pokemon.

176
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
She like puts on different outfits.

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
And when you're surfing in particular, you get to see her mid rift.

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's really fucking cute.

179
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,400
I mean, I mean, I do think that the Taurus riding uniform is pretty dumb looking.

180
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,200
I don't like it.

181
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,200
But they're all you surf as a girl, dude.

182
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,800
All right.

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
You haven't even gotten to you haven't even gotten to when you get Machamp

184
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
and you get to be you get to be cradled.

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, my God, I was going to say Machamp.

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
It's like the creative.

187
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
It literally princess carries you.

188
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Someone should go to jail for including that.

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
I was going to that part.

190
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, what the fuck did he?

191
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,600
Well, I think differently from you.

192
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't think of the ride Pokemon as a replacement for HM.

193
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
But that's what they are.

194
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,600
That's what they are.

195
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,400
They are, but rather than that,

196
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,200
what's cool about them is that they're a replacement for like the fucking bicycle.

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,200
You know, like you can play in Pokemon for all this time and you've been riding

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,880
a bike as opposed to a Pokemon like it just like I see the Taurus as hey,

199
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,400
instead of a bike for getting around quickly, now you get to ride a Taurus and

200
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,440
like charge through shit and is way cooler, you know, ride on a Taurus.

201
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,880
But I just don't see why it had to be only a Taurus.

202
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,880
I don't understand why because they would have had to build models for every

203
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,880
thing.

204
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,920
There is there is a third option.

205
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,760
It's not the models, it's the animations.

206
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
There is a third option here.

207
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,280
They could do some sort of like for all this time.

208
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,680
You're the one crying.

209
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,360
The Pokemon company can't afford to fucking do it.

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
You know, I don't know.

211
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,880
They make this game so cheaply and they cut so many fucking corners.

212
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,480
Like, I mean, with this game and this is maybe Nate will comment on this as well.

213
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,320
This vision for what the Pokemon games should be.

214
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,800
And I sort of addressed this in my own video that like I think the funniest

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,680
thing about Pokemon is that even though there's like this,

216
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,840
there's very complex systems in place, like I think probably most of the time

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,200
they spend making the game goes into just balancing it.

218
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,000
But like if you look at any other RPG, there's so much more complex with what

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
like NPCs are doing, dude, you know, where you've got games like fucking

220
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,720
Xenoblade where like every NPC has an entire life and like they're only around

221
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,840
at certain times a day.

222
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,760
You know, the number one representation of that,

223
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,400
the number one thing that tells me that is just the facial animation of your

224
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
character, which is to say there is none.

225
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,760
There is exactly one expression and it never, ever changes.

226
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,640
It honestly is the worst thing about the entire game.

227
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,400
It pissed me off so many times.

228
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
Stop smiling. Stop fucking smiling.

229
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,000
Actually, I kind of disagree because of the fact that I was my character was

230
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,320
wearing sunglasses and I really liked the idea that my character was just so

231
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,440
disaffected that nothing mattered.

232
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,360
I got the impression that my character was like, I'm so powerful and like none

233
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
of this matters to me.

234
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
Like when they attack me, I'm just going to beat them.

235
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,880
I'll give you that.

236
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
Getting those sunglasses was a massive upgrade to my enjoyment of this game

237
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,480
because those vacant, soulless eyes staring at me every fucking second of every cutscene,

238
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,960
no matter what was happening, not a fan.

239
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,040
I just enjoy it.

240
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,160
I hear people praising the ride system and like, yeah, I do think it is.

241
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,200
I think that what it lets you do is cool.

242
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,920
But the fact that it has moved away from like a relationship you form with your

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
Pokemon, it's it's the opposite of what I wanted.

244
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,120
And overall, I really hate it.

245
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,680
And I really think that people are being or just fucking letting Nintendo off the hook

246
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,440
for this one. I think they have the fucking resources.

247
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,960
They could animate.

248
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,320
They could animate every, they could animate all 700 Pokemon in a riding

249
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,520
animation if they wanted to.

250
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,480
They could do it.

251
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,720
Why don't they do it?

252
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,920
But everyone is just like, everyone's happy with this.

253
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,240
I don't disagree, Ben.

254
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
We should not be happy with it.

255
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
This is not good enough.

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,920
When it comes to Pokemon, like if I got everything I wanted out of it,

257
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,560
it would be a totally different game.

258
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,880
It would like every, I mean, every generation, like when Pokemon X and Y came out,

259
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,640
it had tons of problems with the fact that like it was 3D graphics.

260
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,440
The level design didn't make sense with the 3D graphics.

261
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
There was chugging and slow down.

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
It was not optimized well for the console.

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
This game was not optimized.

264
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
It's a nightmare.

265
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,400
It is like every valley just doubles battles.

266
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,160
It's a shiny new 3DS XL just very recently.

267
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,760
And it lacks for me on double battles.

268
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,400
That's weird.

269
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,280
There you go.

270
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
Yeah, yeah, it's even on the new one.

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
So double battles are still laggy.

272
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,200
In X and Y, it was even worse, though.

273
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Even normal battles could lag if you had too many big Pokemon.

274
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm not quite done with the ride thing.

275
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm not quite done ranting about ride.

276
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
I just have one ride cake, which is simply that I have one more point to make.

277
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,640
In X and Y, they upgraded to 3D and it was like there was a whole ton of problems.

278
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,720
And the way that people talked about it, anytime you brought up the 3D,

279
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
like how these, you know, there's all these graphical failings,

280
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,240
people would always say, well, it's the first Pokemon game in 3D.

281
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,720
So there's bound to be some stumbling blocks.

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,600
But it's not the first 3D game ever.

283
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,960
1995, it's not.

284
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,560
Yeah, it's not like they had to invent 3D and like, you know,

285
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,560
they should have just held off if they didn't understand the principles of how

286
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,840
the graphics work, then they should have held off until they did before they released the game.

287
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,560
And I do think like Sun and Moon shows a lot of lessons learned from X and Y

288
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,080
about how to 3D, but then like, still, it feels like Pokemon makes progress

289
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,480
so incredibly slowly and the fans are just kind of used to it because I mean,

290
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,840
people have complained about HMS for fucking 20 years now and it just now finally got changed.

291
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,640
So not enough.

292
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I'm honestly surprised that they changed it because I felt like no one was really

293
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,120
mad about it the way I was mad about it.

294
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
I've heard people complain about it all the time.

295
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,640
Were you?

296
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,440
Yeah.

297
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,720
Well, I'm not the vocal about my anger, I guess.

298
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
OK, OK.

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
The thing about Riot, here is a compromise that I would be willing to live with.

300
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,120
And everyone's going to hate this, but this is a compromise that I would accept.

301
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,400
If it were exactly the way it is now in Sun and Moon only,

302
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,360
you had to catch a Taurus and have it in your party to do the thing.

303
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,760
If you had to catch a Sharpedo, if you if you just if it's like

304
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,720
hey, you can't you can't ride around with our Taurus, here's how this compromise

305
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,600
will work for me, because I think the problem with that is that I would hate

306
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,640
it would only be the one, but but even if it were only the one, I would still

307
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,160
think it would that is that it would force you to have it in your team.

308
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
And that's why I know it would be obnoxious.

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,640
I know it would be obnoxious in the pain and then I'm going to give you a solution to that.

310
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,680
I want that.

311
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,720
I'm going to give you a solution to it, though.

312
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,720
I don't maybe I don't want solutions.

313
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,800
Maybe I just want to think about what if it's actually what if you can catch

314
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200
a Taurus, hold on, I want to do my solution.

315
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
What if you can catch a Taurus and assign it as the ride Pokemon and then you

316
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,160
don't have to have it in your party, you just use it for rides.

317
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,760
Yes, OK. Yeah.

318
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,160
Yeah. As long as it's the one you caught.

319
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,320
Yeah. Ben, we do Nuzlocke.

320
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,920
So you if you didn't have a water Pokemon, you could literally just not be able

321
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
to progress in the game at some point.

322
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,280
Yeah. Yeah. So why would you like that?

323
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,520
That's fucking stupid.

324
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,880
What is that already? You just have to make sure you just have to make sure you

325
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,120
catch a water Pokemon.

326
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,040
It is already true.

327
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,160
I mean, I've always thought that probably provides you an area where to catch

328
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,720
the Pokemon you need anyway. So.

329
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,520
Well, yeah, but with Nuzlocke, nothing is nothing's guaranteed.

330
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,000
But like that, you just have to be careful and just make sure I'm going to need

331
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,560
a water Pokemon.

332
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,360
This is kind of a tangential point.

333
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,760
But I always thought it'd be reasonable in something like a Nuzlocke to to catch

334
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,040
a Pokemon specifically just to advance beyond a certain point.

335
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,960
And then you don't let it go or whatever.

336
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,080
Why would that be cheating? Why is that if the game is like if.

337
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,920
I don't know if the game have to have a water Pokemon to let you progress,

338
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
then maybe, I don't know.

339
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,320
I mean, I think that if you if you're all your surfers die,

340
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,920
then I think it's fun to be like, well, I can't win now because I let all my

341
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
surfers die. I think that's cool.

342
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,240
But by the way, let me just say about the ride thing.

343
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,120
I basically agree with you guys, which almost happened to me in white, too.

344
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
But anyway, yeah, I did.

345
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,040
I have one left.

346
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,640
I definitely am leaning on your side here, Ben.

347
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,800
I think I consider it a massive loss to lose the kind of personal connection

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,800
you have by using a Pokemon that you personally have captured and trained in

349
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,280
whatever degree that you have.

350
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,440
I consider a huge loss to not have that kind of connection with the thing.

351
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,440
Instead of some sort of like corporatized, like mass bred Pokemon like who gives a shit?

352
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,240
I feel I just I like that they're trying a new thing.

353
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,080
But I feel like it went in the exact opposite way that I wanted it to.

354
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,680
I wanted I want the games to demand

355
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,560
that like I I harness the power of my Pokemon.

356
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,440
Yeah, and that's the and that's not at all what's going on here.

357
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Even though I think it's cool, it's cool to ride around on the Lappers.

358
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,240
It's cool to ride around a Sharpedo and and be and be cradled in the strong

359
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,720
manly bosom of a champ.

360
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,880
Yeah, there's a Sharpedo later, but my favorite guy.

361
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,120
It's radical. It's riding the Sharpedo was fucking dope.

362
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,280
It's my favorite thing.

363
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,000
Can we move on from ride Pokemon?

364
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,760
I want to say one more thing.

365
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,360
OK, I from for my part, I'm satisfied.

366
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,840
OK, I generally agree with you about the whole thing.

367
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,000
And I would and I think it would be cool if you could, you know, catch your own

368
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,280
rideable Pokemon and stuff, but this ride function, as it is now,

369
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,760
it kind of endeared me to a few Pokemon I didn't particularly like or didn't

370
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,080
usually use on my team, like Stealthon.

371
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,240
I don't particularly like Stealthon, but then I got one and I started riding it

372
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,720
and it's just kind of so cute when it sniffs the ground and I was so happy

373
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
when it finds the item. It's I kind of like it now.

374
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah, I can see that.

375
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,560
I consider that a small game, though.

376
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,800
And I think I don't think there's any negatives to the ride system.

377
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
And I think you're all fucking insane.

378
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,160
Stop talking about it, because it's been 15 fucking minutes to talk about the ride system.

379
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,760
If there were maybe if there were maybe a dozen different Pokemon.

380
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,920
This is what my fear was about this podcast.

381
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,200
Yeah, let's do a Pokemon podcast with six people.

382
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,400
That was like any one tiny thing you could say about Pokemon, we could do a whole

383
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,000
podcast. Yeah, they could like they could animate a dozen different Pokemon.

384
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,880
All right, Ben. All right, we get it.

385
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,400
I want to say I want to say that the Pokemon rights is not about writing,

386
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,960
but it is about animation.

387
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
I got a grubbin and I evolved him into a fucking battery bus little guy.

388
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
He's a cuboid. I love him.

389
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but he for some reason, he can learn.

390
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,720
He can learn acrobatics, which is a flying move.

391
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,360
Yeah. And I and I kept that with him.

392
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,000
So now he is is basically a little bus

393
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,360
that flies through the air and beats the shit out of him.

394
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,000
That is awesome.

395
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Oh, speaking of animations, did you know that some Pokemon can high five you?

396
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,120
Huh? What? How?

397
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,880
Yeah, like friendship all the way up or just no one.

398
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,840
No, no, no, all you have to do is like

399
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,680
was I think starters have this except for Rala because he doesn't really he can't

400
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,560
really high five you. But basically, like if you hold your

401
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,600
mouse, I said, I'm sure mouse and whatever cursor, yeah, near them,

402
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
they kind of start pawing at it.

403
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,560
And you hold them close enough near them, not on them.

404
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,120
And they start pawing at it.

405
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,640
Only some Pokemon can do that.

406
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,800
And if you're close enough, they kind of high five you because they can reach

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,520
your cursor, you're talking about when you're doing like the combing thing.

408
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, in general.

409
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,800
Yeah, yeah, in the Pokemon refresh thing.

410
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

411
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,200
That's pretty neat.

412
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Oh, and like let's talk about I give give tip

413
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,800
me out to a bunch of the little touches, like if you spin your character a bunch,

414
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
they just do a twirl.

415
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Yeah, let's talk about the main improvement that Sun and Moon offers,

416
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,200
which is the twirl. The twirl is I love the twirl.

417
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Honestly, my opinion of this game was as if you were following my Twitter was

418
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,680
extremely low going in and then it got steadily better because the game,

419
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,600
like it front loads all the bad bullshit and then it gets much better because it

420
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
just lets you play.

421
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,640
I think I caught my first Pokemon, like half an hour in.

422
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,520
It was two hours.

423
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,120
It was at least another half an hour before I caught another one.

424
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,840
The opening. I don't know why people think it's too long.

425
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,240
It's really fucking long.

426
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,040
It's really bad.

427
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,920
Well, you know why? OK, you know why.

428
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,760
There's a very simple reason for why it was so long.

429
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,040
It's because the every cutscene and there are a billion of them in the beginning.

430
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,360
I haven't even deployed content that it's and by that,

431
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,080
I mean that like the lead in to like the thing, like they have to fade in and like

432
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,600
set the scene and then like all the transitions.

433
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,240
But there's so much about that because it makes me care about the world and

434
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,520
characters. I don't even I don't even think it was bad.

435
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,200
They were about an actual RPG almost.

436
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,200
But the first island took me eight fucking hours.

437
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, that means you play slow.

438
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,240
If it's the full island.

439
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,120
Well, yeah, I'm just saying that it takes it takes you.

440
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,840
All right. I mean, OK, so not everybody has to agree.

441
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,600
But I think that this game continued a trend.

442
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,880
I don't like of taking things like loading up too much bullshit.

443
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,400
You have to sort through until you can actually just play the game.

444
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,880
And this was the worst defender of the actually just to jump back to what

445
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,960
monkey said. I mean, you said the first island took you eight hours.

446
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
But that's a fourth of the game.

447
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,880
That's not a four.

448
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
The first island does not have the same.

449
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,760
The first island is only one of the seven challenges.

450
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,040
It's seven. Yeah.

451
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,760
But well, yeah.

452
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,600
But the other challenges don't have three hours of cutscenes before them.

453
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,880
So like you've played like you've played a fourth of the runtime of the game

454
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,640
at this point, like if you're off the first island, you know, it's the game.

455
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,600
40 hours, you know, it was bullshit that you guys, I think, liked, you know,

456
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,160
that ceremony, that piece of shit, retarded ceremony where your Pokemon that you

457
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,800
chose chooses you back.

458
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Oh, yeah, I really feel, I really feel special being chosen by this Pokemon

459
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,920
that has no option by this cutscene.

460
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,160
Feels right. Yeah, I've been chosen by this cutscene.

461
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,320
Yeah, I was a little dumb.

462
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
OK, I like the game.

463
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
I'm babing you guys, you guys.

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,800
It's a fucking Pokemon game.

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,800
I don't know if you've noticed the plots of these games and really are going to

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,400
help us at some point.

467
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,200
My argument is that it was cute and I like I like the little clown boy.

468
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,160
And he's my favorite guy and I love him in my arms.

469
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,400
I don't mind cute.

470
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,880
I love the Pokemon refresh mechanic.

471
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,480
I love petting my Pokemon.

472
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,400
And in fact, honestly, I think my favorite thing about this game,

473
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,040
a new change is the the way that after a battle, you can treat your Pokemon status

474
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
ailments and Pokemon refresh.

475
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,880
I love that so much.

476
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
It makes so much sense to me.

477
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,480
And you can bond with them and pet them and stuff.

478
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,000
That's great.

479
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,360
And I can rub my Machoke's dick and he's like, yes, yes, this is what I saw that.

480
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah, it's the greatest.

481
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,440
It's the greatest.

482
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,480
That is a great mechanic that makes all the sense in the world.

483
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,000
And it should have been there all along.

484
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,240
If it was the Machoke dick rubbing, you mean?

485
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
Yes, curing status ailments is great.

486
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,480
I think Nate that Pokemon has always been incredibly patronizing.

487
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,080
That's every all this is like 80 percent of all dialogue in every Pokemon game.

488
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,120
Wow, you and your Pokemon get along so well.

489
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,440
You're such a good trainer.

490
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,880
You treat Pokemon better than everyone else.

491
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,160
But here's the difference. Everyone loves you.

492
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,760
You're great. You're amazing.

493
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,240
All right, no trainers ever been so connected to their Pokemon.

494
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,800
You've defeated me, the ultimate trainer, Lance, the dragon master,

495
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
that's fucking shatter of universes.

496
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,280
It must be because you and your Pokemon are just have such a strong bond.

497
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,640
That's so much about the six guys you kept in a box for half the game.

498
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,360
That's perfectly reasonable that you beat Lance because you trained with your Pokemon.

499
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,640
OK, look, the difference is that this game and this was this was the worst.

500
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
This was the worst it's ever been by far.

501
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,560
And this is the biggest problem with the game.

502
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,560
This continues the trend of babying you so fucking hard.

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,200
And that is the biggest difficulty with the game, Nate.

504
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Yes, that's that's correct.

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
It is a tone problem.

506
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,920
It is a massive tone problem.

507
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,080
You're a tone problem.

508
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,200
I'll tell you what I'll tell you if you let me fuck Pokemon is a baby game.

509
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,120
It is a baby game.

510
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,440
OK, you guys are bringing up all these things about how

511
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,760
Pokemon's a baby game and how we shouldn't have standards of quality.

512
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,400
And we're very bad because always just Pokemon.

513
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,680
But no, I refused to to lower my standards

514
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,960
because other games didn't fuck up in the way that this game did.

515
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,400
You're such an idiot, Nate.

516
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
It didn't fuck up anything.

517
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,560
You're just being when it added one extra second of cutscene.

518
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,240
No, I'm not talking about that.

519
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,520
You're not letting me get to my point.

520
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, Nate, I know what you're saying, but you're implying that this is

521
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,920
inherently a bad thing that like no one wants a game like this.

522
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,880
When the reality is that for a lot of people, this is fine.

523
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,760
And you chose to play a Pokemon.

524
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,680
Dude, all right.

525
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:06,240
Tell me, tell me, tell me that you enjoyed how just eating your fucking

526
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
dick after you beat him every time.

527
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,440
Like how rewarding was it for you to defeat how?

528
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,080
And he's like, well, that was a great fucking battle.

529
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
I sure love getting my shit kicked in.

530
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,840
Let's do it again.

531
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,160
That wasn't the point that I'm making.

532
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
Everyone hates how everyone doesn't like how.

533
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,560
Why do we have to have a city rival?

534
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
Major, I'm glad somebody like that.

535
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,360
You have like five rivals and half of them hate and all of them are terrible.

536
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,440
All of them are bad.

537
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
None of them are good.

538
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,560
You don't like the blonde kid?

539
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,440
That guy was awesome.

540
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,600
He's all edgy and shit.

541
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,520
Yeah, I did like him.

542
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,400
I didn't he legitimately hates you.

543
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,720
He's like, especially hates how he hates how so much that I was like high

544
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,680
fiving him when you know, it was good.

545
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,160
You know, it was good about that character.

546
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,880
He had an actual motivation.

547
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,640
He was protecting this this null Pokemon.

548
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,600
It was this whole big fucking thing that was cool.

549
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,000
That made him an interesting.

550
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,960
How it doesn't have a motivation when he wants to become the he wants to surpass

551
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,320
his father and become a kahuna because he sees his self as an inferiority complex

552
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,400
because his father's been a great trainer his whole life.

553
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
He did nothing to make me care.

554
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,680
I knew all those facts, though.

555
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,080
You don't have to care about if he has some motivations.

556
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,960
Look, it's not about his action.

557
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
Your motivation at all.

558
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,960
So fucking vague is pissing me right the fuck off.

559
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,080
All right, I think I don't even know what I mean.

560
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,840
I don't think you even know what you mean.

561
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,120
Let hippo talk.

562
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,120
All right.

563
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,680
What? Oh, well,

564
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,640
I was going to say,

565
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,000
I think Nate is like it's just just a simple point that is sort of blending into

566
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,480
other points that he doesn't like how he doesn't like how how how's is is so happy.

567
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,120
He prefers Gary, who's like, eh, fuck you for beating me.

568
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,320
Or like the redhead from Crystal.

569
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,760
Like an actual rival.

570
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,360
And when you fight Gary,

571
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,480
one game doesn't really have a rival as far as I know.

572
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,400
When you defeat blue, blue is fucking pissed and it makes you feel good that you

573
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,360
overcame someone who wanted to win.

574
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,320
I actually gave a shit.

575
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,320
But literally every other rival in this game is like that.

576
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,560
And how what are these other rivals?

577
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,360
There's there's him and there's the blonde kid.

578
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,360
There's the blonde kid.

579
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,280
There's the girl who's part of Team Skull.

580
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,120
They both hate you.

581
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,560
She's not a fucking rival.

582
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,040
She's an enemy executive.

583
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
Nate, Hugh, what?

584
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Hugh in black and white, too.

585
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
Every single time you beat him,

586
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,280
he tells you you're a cool guy and congratulates you on being so strong.

587
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,960
Same thing in black and white one.

588
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
Your rivals are just these like real nice,

589
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,720
chummy guys who just tell you right.

590
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,200
And I don't like to fight in all the newer games than your rivals are your

591
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,960
friends and like the yeah, it's always been bad journey.

592
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,520
It's been bad the whole time ever since Diamond and Pearl.

593
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,320
It's been a mistake.

594
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,560
They need to fix that.

595
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I don't I don't like.

596
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,120
OK, think about just what does it imply?

597
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,920
They've got that.

598
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,560
They've got that in these other characters that are dicks to you.

599
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,600
And they've got this other guy.

600
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,760
Who's nice to you?

601
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,120
Just think about having both.

602
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,920
Think of think about this for one second.

603
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,440
What do we make of the fact?

604
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,080
What do we make of the fact that our rival now used to choose the Pokemon

605
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,160
that was strong against us now picks the Pokemon that we are super strong

606
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,320
and we can wipe the floor with all that is done.

607
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,480
What are we to make of the night?

608
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,760
I don't know. It's made me feel like I'm now Gary Oak.

609
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,920
That's a good boy.

610
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,840
Yeah, yeah, we're the villains.

611
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
And I'm the cool one and I'm getting all the girls even though I am a girl.

612
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,080
You know, hypocrite, you just changed my mind on this.

613
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
Now that I'm the villain, I think I love this a lot more.

614
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,000
You guys are being mean to me.

615
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,000
Like again, you have other rivals who hate you and do have Pokemon you're weak to

616
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,280
and how later does get an EV Lucian that is whatever your your starter is weak to?

617
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
So he doesn't get on page.

618
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,200
And what are you talking about? No, he doesn't.

619
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,040
Yeah, he does.

620
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,480
When you fight him, when you get into the Third Island,

621
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,640
when he like just fucking springs a battle on you right off the boat,

622
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,240
then he picks whatever EV Lucian your guys weak to.

623
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,200
So I had, you know, my grass starter.

624
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,280
He had a Flareon and his fucking Raichu and his in his pop or yeah,

625
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,400
probably a third ever and all of them were super fucking strong.

626
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,720
And it was like out of nowhere.

627
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,360
He was suddenly a hard battle and he fucking wiped me.

628
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,520
Oh, there's a real point.

629
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,240
There's a point I want to make.

630
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,320
Everyone shut up.

631
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,280
Yeah, Mage, what do you want to find about the rivals and that?

632
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Yeah, well, not an hour, but yeah, about the rivals saying like in the past games,

633
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,640
maybe I didn't pay attention much or whatever, but like all the nice guys,

634
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,000
they didn't really have much to their character and they were just nice to be

635
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,760
nice with how, though, I haven't really gone farm the game, but already can pick up

636
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,480
that, you know, he has a bit more to him rather just being nice.

637
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,440
You've been tricked.

638
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,440
It's a fake.

639
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,360
After the first battle of the blonde edgelord,

640
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,240
he kind of says like, oh, he's strong, but I can tell that, you know,

641
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,480
he's not trying or whatever.

642
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,000
So he kind of gives the vibe that how's just kind of putting up putting up a

643
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,040
happy face or whatever.

644
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,800
Yeah, yeah.

645
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,560
Yeah, he has a bit of dialogue up to that way, where you can like you can put

646
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,960
how down or something and then how scowls at you.

647
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
I kind of like that.

648
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,280
Well, he, he like how constantly never stop smiling for me once the entire game.

649
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,040
He never stopped.

650
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,440
I told him attention and he's always like he's always trying to get you to react

651
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,040
to his jokes and stuff and he gets real pouty when you won't react to his jokes.

652
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,880
And like it's kind of implied that he has some fragility to his ego.

653
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,800
And then later in the game, like some stuff happens and he feels all bad that

654
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,160
he was like not strong enough.

655
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,000
And he's like, man, maybe I've been fucking goofing around too much.

656
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,320
And I'm not like taking things seriously enough.

657
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,600
He really is the catch him to to to my to my gary oak.

658
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,480
OK, all right, guys, you know what?

659
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,680
That's that's fine.

660
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,000
And I don't actually I don't hate the character of how my problem is simply

661
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,720
thus, I don't care for the increasingly infantile tone of the game is you leave

662
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,360
how alone, you big bully, I am living alone.

663
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,920
I just don't feel enough.

664
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,960
Oh, I don't know.

665
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,640
Like like the game is really trying to challenge me with anything.

666
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,960
Even when I was a little kid, I thought Pokemon was like condescending to me.

667
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,160
Like I always thought it was a baby game.

668
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,440
Like in terms of the way it talks to you, you know, like it constantly reassures

669
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,640
you and like tells you everything to do.

670
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,360
You've got I mean, from the second game, you have your fucking mom calling you

671
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,480
everywhere you go, making sure you've got enough money and just giving you money.

672
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,840
You know, like well, that happens in Earthbound as well.

673
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,240
And, you know, that's not.

674
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,000
That is a real game.

675
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Earthbound is a baby game, kind of like the tone of Pokemon has changed

676
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,080
in any particular way.

677
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,040
It has or out of your fucking mind.

678
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,720
You guys are out of your fucking mind.

679
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
If you don't think that has definitely changed.

680
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,560
But I think that it's just that they have more features.

681
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,120
They've added more features.

682
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,880
They I think they've just made the Pokemon games more what they were always meant

683
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,040
to be in that they're a friendly, fun time that you have a nice leisurely

684
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,800
stroll through tells you you're doing by the way, this is like the hardest

685
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Pokemon game ever.

686
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So absolutely not.

687
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,080
It was a complete joke.

688
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
I never died once, not once.

689
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,920
I had 10 full party wives and I ended almost every major battle with all my

690
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,120
Pokemon dead, but one way I just I never overleveled.

691
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,800
I was always the same levels as what I fought and we're fucked.

692
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,400
I do.

693
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,440
I didn't overlevel.

694
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
I just might be a little game.

695
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,160
And yet I walked through every time.

696
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,680
I never did you only have like one team, the whole game or something like me.

697
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,240
Me and Mumpi are listening to this.

698
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,760
Like, well, why would I switch?

699
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,720
Everyone shut the fuck up.

700
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,360
Me and Mumpi's lives are hanging in the balance as we listen to this.

701
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,160
We're sweating bullets hearing all of it.

702
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,640
Yeah.

703
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,200
Well, I've got plenty of plenty of hints on how to deal with it.

704
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,560
We've got donators.

705
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,240
We have to please.

706
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,560
But we haven't even really touched about the the spiderweb of what I would

707
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
call casualization of this game.

708
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,520
How about the railroading, which I know has always been a thing,

709
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,440
but really was worse than ever.

710
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,640
You mean the railroading?

711
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,280
Every fucking Pokemon game is completely linear.

712
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
Every single one.

713
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,640
I'm aware of that.

714
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,280
But I think that not only do that, it wastes your time with cut scenes now.

715
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,080
Actually, I disagree with you.

716
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,640
Because when you put this up with who, with whom age, who do you disagree with?

717
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,080
Nate. OK.

718
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
Yeah, OK, so every game has been on a railroad.

719
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,720
But for the first time, I feel like, you know, this game,

720
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,760
this Pokemon game is kind of like an actual sort of close to an actual RPG in a way.

721
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,000
Well, yeah, you don't really have choices and it's a railroad,

722
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,240
but it's telling a story and I feel a bit more invested in it than with other games.

723
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,760
I mean, I hear I hear a lot of praise for the story in this game.

724
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,920
So good. The story is not actually good.

725
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,200
Like, yeah, you're completely reasonable for what it is.

726
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,120
Complaining about the amount of cut scenes.

727
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,080
And yeah, I feel like there are more, but a lot of people seem to think

728
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,560
that they're good cut scenes in the story.

729
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,800
Those people are wrong.

730
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,720
And they've been.

731
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,920
They've been. Skull.

732
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,840
What? By their own brain.

733
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
They think they're enjoying it.

734
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,240
By far the best team that's ever been in one of these games.

735
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Yes, teams are miles greater than any of the previous teams.

736
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
That's not true. You're not thinking clearly.

737
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,760
I really want to get to know Team Rocket.

738
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,240
Team Rocket did nothing. Team Rocket is bull.

739
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,560
Team Rocket is the coolest.

740
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
Every Team Rocket guy.

741
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,960
Oh, I sure like hurting Pokemon.

742
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm they were just they were just.

743
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,120
You know, when you say it like that, Digi, they actually do sound pretty cool.

744
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,320
Well, all right, I don't I like Team Skull, too.

745
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,280
I think Team Skull is great.

746
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,880
And by the way, punk girl, when she's not wearing her Team Skull outfit,

747
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,120
is probably the hottest Pokemon girl there's ever been.

748
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,840
So I'm big into Team Skull.

749
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,800
They're perfectly great.

750
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,200
Team Skull has so much pathos behind them.

751
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,040
And when you fucking I'm not going to I don't want to spoil it.

752
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,800
This really isn't, by the way, this is not a counter to my point.

753
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,040
This is just something else entirely.

754
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
Team Skull is fine.

755
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,560
I have no gripes with them there.

756
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,600
That doesn't have anything to do with the casualization.

757
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Cut scenes.

758
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,720
Like, yeah, but that just is such a.

759
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,840
I mean, I cannot think of a single time in a Pokemon game

760
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,320
until this one where I ever gave a single fuck about anything.

761
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,200
I never cared about any of the characters.

762
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,400
Well, that's your problem.

763
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,720
I thought they all retarded, you know, like when I was growing up,

764
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,280
I was just like fucking mash a through Lance talking about whatever bullshit

765
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
he wants you to do at the stupid power plant.

766
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,160
I don't care.

767
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,000
But in this game, I was like, oh, my God, this character, Lily,

768
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
she has a fucking arc.

769
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,000
She develops, she changes, and I could see the hints

770
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,320
from the very beginning of how she was going to change.

771
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,720
And I was like, huh, this is an interesting little character.

772
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,080
And then there's like this huge moment of growth.

773
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,800
And I'm like, whoa, this is literally the plot of Killluck.

774
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,760
You don't fucking think Silver develops over the course of Pokemon Gold and Silver.

775
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
You're out of your fucking mind.

776
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,840
You don't remember the very end.

777
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,040
At the very end, he's like, wow, you beat me so many fucking times

778
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,760
that maybe I'm doing something wrong and Lily changes exactly once

779
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
at like three quarters through the game.

780
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,240
No, no, she changes gradually when she realizes

781
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,720
a whole bunch of different things at the beginning.

782
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,600
She's like, I never had to.

783
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,800
She's like telling you, oh, I've never dressed myself before.

784
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
You know, my mom's always picked up my clothes for me.

785
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,160
And then every time you go to like a clothes shop, she's like, you know,

786
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,280
maybe I'm going to try on something different.

787
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,160
Maybe I'll try something new.

788
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,840
And then at one point we buy her an outfit that's already established.

789
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,160
That doesn't happen over the course of the game.

790
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,000
That's just from the start.

791
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,080
No, she likes shopping, but she's never bought her own clothes before.

792
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,880
With the first time she buys something, she's like, oh, I bought this outfit

793
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,760
even though I'm sure I don't have the courage to wear it.

794
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,200
Yeah. And she won't put it on until after like a big character moment.

795
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,400
And then she gets it. And then we're done.

796
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,880
And then she's the same character the rest of the game.

797
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,640
All of my only point, she's fine.

798
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,480
I like it. She's not bad.

799
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,160
You guys are just making it out like this is so much better than the other games.

800
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,240
And that's I don't even have an opinion because I haven't played that far.

801
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,320
Nate, I hate I hate listening to you about this.

802
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
You're dumb. You're dumb.

803
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
You're about to fucking cut scenes.

804
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,600
You've been you've been through a million cut scenes.

805
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,560
And I think the solution that will make everybody happy

806
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,520
is just make the cut scenes fucking skippable.

807
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,200
So if we're retired like this stupid shit, you can watch it.

808
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,720
And if you just want to kill some Pokemon like me and Ben,

809
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,800
you can just go fucking kill Pokemon.

810
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes, I mean, this is not being able to skip cut scenes

811
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,040
is one of the biggest problems I hate.

812
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,600
I hate this is a huge problem with every Nintendo game.

813
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,920
Lack of options.

814
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,520
They for some reason, they just can't get it through there.

815
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Like even if it was just busy, honestly, I wouldn't accept your opinion yourself.

816
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,640
Yeah, I know. Well, OK, well, I would even accept that it was just on the second round.

817
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,760
Like, even if it was just the second time to the game,

818
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,600
if you could skip the cut scenes, like, I mean, I hate that you can't skip them ever.

819
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,000
But like, at least make it so when I go through again,

820
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,880
because the thought of trying to play this game again

821
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,400
and watch 30 minutes of cut scenes at the start and end of the game

822
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,840
is just like, I don't want to do that again.

823
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,160
The other games don't have that.

824
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,720
The other games don't have all that shit.

825
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,480
That's because I have no ties or anything.

826
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,480
But there is there is no way to you.

827
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,560
Oh, God, there's no there's no new game.

828
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,760
Plus and may I remind you all that at the beginning of gold and silver,

829
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,440
you have to walk all the way to the next town to pick up an egg

830
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,480
and then walk all the way back to the previous town

831
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,480
before you can get your running shoes

832
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,920
and before you can really catch any Pokemon.

833
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,480
Yeah, but you still get to play how it takes like 20 fucking minutes.

834
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,920
There's no cut scenes in that whole.

835
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,160
There's well, there's a couple like talk.

836
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,120
Yeah, but it's the worst thing ever.

837
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,400
It's the by far that was made.

838
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,920
That's worse than half an hour of waiting for the game to start.

839
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,280
No, dude, there were so many times as I went back to gold and silver

840
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,280
and I literally just like played through that little segment

841
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,680
and then just gave I was like, I don't you just said that you don't want to play

842
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,360
this one again. So at the worst, it's the same level of bad

843
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,600
from that one game in the game. Yeah, I'm not talking about the same level.

844
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,720
All right. Well, what about I just want to say, OK,

845
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,720
though, Nate, you said we're making out this game is like so much better

846
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,760
than all the other ones. I was actually arguing.

847
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,920
I was actually arguing that all the things you're complaining about

848
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,640
were in the previous games, so it's not like things got worse.

849
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,680
OK, they're just one example of something that is unquestionably better.

850
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,320
I think that stuff is just more of it. Yeah.

851
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,160
But OK, just just this one thing that I think is

852
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,720
and this is when I was going to say like my ideal Pokemon game.

853
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,360
This is what I'm talking about in Pokemon Red and Blue,

854
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,160
everything to do with the story of Mewtwo, which is which is the story of that game.

855
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,360
There's there's, you know, Team Rocket is doing their shit

856
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,240
and and Mewtwo was made and caused problems on Cinnabar Island.

857
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,440
That's pretty much it.

858
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,680
And is all that in the actual narrative of red and blue?

859
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,080
Well, that's the great thing about it.

860
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,320
That's the great thing about you find out that information by going into the

861
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,440
like that the smash up laboratory on Cinnabar Island.

862
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,840
Yeah. And you read the logs and you learn by playing the game voluntarily.

863
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,040
You're not forced into a cut scene where you find out what Mewtwo's

864
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,200
backstory is all the back story elements you can learn that way in X and Y.

865
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,720
You never have nobody tells you about Type Null,

866
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,080
but you can read up all these data files about great if only every part of the story

867
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,600
was like that. It'd be a thousand times.

868
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,200
But there's nothing wrong with a cut scene.

869
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,560
But there's something wrong with a bunch of cut scenes to take a half a run time.

870
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,800
Does every fucking part of every game have to be delivered environmentally?

871
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,960
Does every game have to be some dark souls?

872
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,720
The end thing where you told me you think there's too many cut scenes.

873
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm giving you a solution.

874
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,200
I don't even think there's too many cut scenes.

875
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,800
I think no, I think it's pretty long.

876
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,240
I didn't dislike it.

877
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Yeah, I mean, I like the cut scene.

878
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,600
I think I think they're too long, but I had no problem with them.

879
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,640
And like the way the way I played it, like, I mean,

880
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,280
I sat down with the game and played for six straight hours.

881
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,360
And those first 30 minutes very quickly no longer were a factor

882
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,880
because I just, you know, I just kept playing.

883
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,600
And I just thought I was I was glad to be invested in the in the world

884
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,720
and characters because if I'm going to play a game with a lot of story,

885
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,200
I'd like to care about the things that are going on, you know, as I played the game.

886
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,280
It absolutely got much, much better as I played more.

887
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,680
And what I didn't think was a very good start became less and less important.

888
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,440
But that does not. I'm really just I'm emphasizing things

889
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,720
that bothered me a lot at the start that don't really.

890
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,440
I don't think they matter that much over the course of the game.

891
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,840
Like you get less scenes as the game goes on.

892
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,600
I'm just being strongly emphasizing what those points are.

893
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,200
OK, Nate hates cutscenes.

894
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,360
That's it. That's all that's all there is to it.

895
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,440
And that was only part of the game.

896
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,200
Well, whatever. All right, let's move on to something else.

897
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,000
I just think it's really funny to hear this argument

898
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,720
from a fucking Kingdom Hearts fan where you get to start off the first game

899
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
spinning you can skip those cutscenes.

900
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,240
You can skip those fucking cutscenes.

901
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,160
Yeah, but you can't skip that stupid race.

902
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Also, they're great.

903
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,760
Hey, guys, do you know what's the story that is delivered through cutscenes?

904
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,560
Like the the NPCs you fight,

905
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,600
sometimes they throw out pokemons in different types of pokeballs.

906
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,480
It's a neat little. Oh, yeah.

907
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,040
Yeah, I haven't heard that before.

908
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Oh, that's been other versions.

909
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,240
The Kahuna's Crabrawler, I think, was in an old.

910
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,440
Or I think all the Kahuna's Pokemon were in.

911
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,960
But it just rounded NPCs like some guy used, I think, a premier ball.

912
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,360
I don't remember for the collector guys.

913
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,680
The collector guys use premiere balls for their body.

914
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,080
I have said before, I love I love getting all my Pokemon

915
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,720
in different colored balls and just they all have like a look at my one guy.

916
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,600
My starter here is in his little red ball.

917
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,880
Oh, this one, I found this diglet in a cave.

918
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,400
He's in a little black, green, deep ball or whatever.

919
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,720
Oh, and this fish is in a dive ball.

920
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,840
It's great. Yeah, your your Pokemon should all be in blue balls, Ben.

921
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,640
That's for sure.

922
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Hey.

923
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,920
Got him.

924
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,840
Yeah, I really, yeah, I really like surfing.

925
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,640
Really like all those water Pokemon.

926
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,800
Can we talk about the elimination of gyms?

927
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,080
Yes, we can really in elimination.

928
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,520
It was just. Oh, no. Oh, no, it absolutely was.

929
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,080
This was a big deal.

930
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,160
Well, I don't know.

931
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,600
It's exactly the same.

932
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,720
Oh, how far are you in the game?

933
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,400
I mean, how many trials have you done?

934
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,200
I've done two and I'm back to the third one.

935
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,040
I mean, I know they're very different.

936
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,640
I'm pretty much completely spoiled on where it goes with it.

937
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,880
I don't think Mumki is.

938
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,640
I am not. Yeah.

939
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,520
So, I mean, I'm not.

940
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,840
It seems to be the instead of trainers in the places,

941
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,840
you just fired a bunch of the Pokemon of the type that the crystal is.

942
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,200
The just like it would be in a gym

943
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,000
and then you fight the big main one and then you beat him

944
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
and then you get the same.

945
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,400
The the Cajunas are basically gym leader battles.

946
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,440
The the trial leaders, I guess, are the trial captains are to kind of,

947
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,800
I guess, I know it didn't it didn't feel like it with them as much.

948
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,880
Yeah, well, you don't really like like, I mean, the trials of them,

949
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,440
the new versions of gyms, but the actual gym leaders are more like the Cajunas.

950
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,280
It's such they basically made two different strands of

951
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,640
I've always thought the Cajunas would like the elite four

952
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,920
and there's one elite four on each island.

953
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,600
Well, yeah, but I mean, the elite four ordinarily would not be fought on each island.

954
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,960
It seems like you fight the trial captain, then do the trial,

955
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,360
then trial captain and then sometimes you don't find a lot of trial captains.

956
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,080
Yeah, I didn't I didn't fight the water one.

957
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Fight Elima. That's like the only one.

958
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,880
Well, you fight a couple of them.

959
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,520
I think I don't know.

960
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,200
The point is, I think Elima is the only one they train the totem Pokemon

961
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,680
and they that's their place that to show how good they are at making the Pokemon really fast.

962
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,200
And the totem fights are cool because they're like you have to fight.

963
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,680
You usually have to fight two Pokemon at once and it makes it a much more strategic.

964
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,840
Oh, God, the two at one.

965
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,720
We have to talk about that.

966
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,520
You always have to fight two at once.

967
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
But yeah, it makes it man.

968
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,360
The most hilarious fight I ever had is against the electric one.

969
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,280
And like, yeah, I had like only one Pokemon that had enough resistance

970
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,840
to deal with it, which is my sandy gas and like he couldn't do it.

971
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,000
Like it was like he couldn't damage it because it was a flying electric

972
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,600
and it couldn't damage me very much because it was you know, I was a ground type.

973
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,080
So like all I had was to trap it in a fucking sand tomb

974
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,720
and like just wait, wait out turn after turn until it fucking died.

975
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
And it took forever, but it was so funny because he couldn't hurt me.

976
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,040
And it was just like this battle of attrition where he just kept increasing

977
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,960
his speed or whatever it was totally pointless.

978
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,320
Well, you know, I love I liked one aspect of those of the trials.

979
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,880
And that was the totem fights were cool.

980
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,680
There's the buffed up Pokemon that's stronger than normal.

981
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,920
And he summons guys to fight him.

982
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,760
That felt like kind of like a proper boss fight.

983
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,680
I didn't enjoy that aspect, but there was a huge problem.

984
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,200
I do like I do.

985
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,320
I do like the idea that a Pokemon can be a boss battle.

986
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,880
Yeah, I don't know if I'm that impressed really with the totem Pokemon.

987
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,160
I don't I don't think they're that interesting, honestly.

988
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,120
I mean, the most interesting thing about them is that they summon,

989
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,840
which is not even a thing that's unique to them.

990
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,560
Well, see, see, and that's that's the thing.

991
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,880
OK, so when I when I did the first trial

992
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,360
and there was a summoning thing for the totem in that, you know,

993
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,600
in that area in the trial area, I was like, oh, that's cool.

994
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,680
This is a challenging place.

995
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,200
So I like the concept, but I think they could do it better.

996
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,520
The problem for me is that that happens outside of trial areas

997
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,480
and was probably the most frustrating thing just about doing normal battles.

998
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,000
When I'm trying to not even when I'm just trying to catch something.

999
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,640
Yeah, I'm trying to catch something to keep so many guys

1000
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,920
and you can't throw a Pokeball.

1001
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,360
It's a nightmare. It's a nightmare.

1002
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,760
It is a kind of a nightmare.

1003
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,520
I haven't had a really terrible experience with it, except for one time

1004
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,080
where none of my Pokemon were particularly effective against this rock guy.

1005
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,720
Yeah, well, I think they were.

1006
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,120
But I was just fighting it with one Pokemon.

1007
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,920
I was just trying to get it low enough so I could catch it.

1008
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,040
And then you summon another one.

1009
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,640
And the worst thing about it is that they can summon ones

1010
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,360
as soon as you kill the second.

1011
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,520
Yeah, they don't even have to like use a turn or anything.

1012
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,360
I mean, I think it's a cool like idea to have that happen,

1013
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,880
but it just happens way too often.

1014
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,720
It's like every wild Pokemon battle.

1015
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,760
If you get them to low health because you're trying to catch them,

1016
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,840
they're going to summon something.

1017
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,720
I was keeping track.

1018
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,200
Turn into this fucking I had a record of five times.

1019
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,440
I had a Pokemon at one HP.

1020
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,320
I was used false white.

1021
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,240
It was like stunned five turns in a fucking row.

1022
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,960
I want to kill the enemy.

1023
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,080
It's summoned another one.

1024
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,200
Five turns that that's the thing about it is that it's also meant

1025
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,880
to be a method for catching better Pokemon because the more they summon,

1026
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,040
the higher the IVs will be of those Pokemon.

1027
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,360
And we can get like if you want to have a really solid team,

1028
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,160
you just keep sidechaining those things until you finally get like

1029
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,440
and they'll also summon like their own evolved form sometimes or like Pokemon.

1030
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,320
There's a lot of Pokemon that can only be caught that way.

1031
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,840
Well, all right, that's cool.

1032
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,320
But it's an issue of balancing.

1033
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
And I don't think the balance is correct for that.

1034
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,520
No, there's too much of it.

1035
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,600
But like wouldn't it be great if that only happened in like trial areas

1036
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,240
or just some designated place?

1037
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,120
Yeah, that would be cool if it only happened for cool Pokemon.

1038
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,080
All right.

1039
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,360
I think, you know, I actually think it's kind of cool

1040
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,000
that you can catch Pokemon with their hidden abilities that way.

1041
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,360
But I don't like that some Pokemon can only be encountered at all that way.

1042
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,560
I think that means that a lot of people, myself included,

1043
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,000
would go through the game just without seeing a lot of Pokemon.

1044
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,720
Like I think that is a huge issue.

1045
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,160
I think Toxopex can only be encountered

1046
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,920
if you have like all these long ass chain battles

1047
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,480
where they summon a series of Pokemon.

1048
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,960
And like I think there's a high probability

1049
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,120
that that just might never happen and I might never see a Toxopex.

1050
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,800
I'd beat the game if that were a Sabeline.

1051
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
Hippini.

1052
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,840
Yeah, Hippini.

1053
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,240
On the first island, you can only get it by when it calls

1054
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,680
like when baby Pokemon call for help like Bonsley or Pichu.

1055
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,080
Yeah, or AigliBuff.

1056
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,000
I mean, I guess it was the case before that you could go through an area

1057
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,320
and never encounter certain Pokemon.

1058
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I mean, I don't know.

1059
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,640
It's just a little extreme.

1060
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,040
I think there's too many of them.

1061
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,080
Something is hiding something esoteric, like a hidden ability.

1062
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,000
I like that.

1063
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,480
I think hiding the Pokemon period is too much.

1064
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,600
I mean, it's always been one of the cool things about trying to catch

1065
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,120
all the Pokemon in a game is that they usually have whatever new mechanic.

1066
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,720
There's some Pokemon that you can only catch through that mechanic.

1067
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
But this is like way extreme.

1068
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,680
Like there's a lot of Pokemon you can only catch that way.

1069
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,400
There should not have been.

1070
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,720
I think it's yeah, they overdid it.

1071
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,360
It's funny to me.

1072
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,240
I actually I kind of disagree with you guys.

1073
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm actually inclined to be more charitable about this

1074
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,440
because I'm a man who loves the grind as as you all know.

1075
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,480
And I don't really mind like if you go through the through the game

1076
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,680
just playing normally, which I just finished this morning.

1077
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,560
And I never find Pokemon.

1078
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,840
That's fine because I'll really enjoy if I'm inclined to go back

1079
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,360
and try to fill my Pokedex, taking the pains to go and find them out

1080
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,240
through whatever method it makes me.

1081
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,160
It makes me appreciate it more when I have to work hard to get a Pokemon.

1082
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,200
You know, I mean, that's yeah.

1083
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,680
That's the part I do like is that like sometimes you're trying to catch a

1084
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,400
Pokemon and it becomes like, all right, now I really got to like,

1085
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,400
you know, put a lot more effort into strategizing how I'm going to do this.

1086
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,160
But it's just too fucking much.

1087
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
There's 300 Pokemon in this game.

1088
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,240
You know, I don't want to do this in every fucking battle.

1089
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,640
So just recently, I was I was having a bit of an issue with the fee bass

1090
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,280
in that one, the only one place that it can spawn in that in the water trial area.

1091
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,000
And you get the fishing rod and it seems like the first time you see it,

1092
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,600
it's like a high probability.

1093
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,080
But if you miss your chance like I did, it drops drastically.

1094
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,680
And then I was just sitting there for two hours fishing

1095
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,120
because I hated the idea that I let it get away.

1096
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,720
I didn't realize how rare it was.

1097
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,960
But don't you feel great when you finally catch it?

1098
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,240
I don't know, because well, there's a thing with that,

1099
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,680
because when I get fucked by a random number generator enough,

1100
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,720
yeah, finally winning after, you know, finally getting the thing.

1101
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,320
There's a threshold beyond which I don't feel as good.

1102
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,120
I just feel Pokemon I sigh.

1103
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,360
And I'm like, finally.

1104
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,120
And I was like, when you fought, Pokemon on every level

1105
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,840
is just all about that RNG.

1106
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,440
Yeah. And I don't love RNG.

1107
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,880
Like like something like in King of Hearts,

1108
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,920
I haven't been getting better at the fights lately.

1109
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,520
I lately I have been playing lots and lots of Pokemon showdown.

1110
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,760
And you just you just have to learn to love the RNG.

1111
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,040
It's the only you have to you have to accept and embrace the RNG.

1112
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,400
That's like a Dark Souls meme.

1113
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,760
Hey, guys, something random.

1114
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,320
Did you all get your event much like Stingy?

1115
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Yes, Rolex has been a staple of my team.

1116
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,040
I did. I did not get it because it seemed cheap.

1117
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,160
I thought I thought I'm never going to use it.

1118
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,440
It's perfect to I caught one.

1119
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,880
Metronome is lots of fun.

1120
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,760
It's just it's hilarious.

1121
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,280
No, it's cheap.

1122
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,200
Guys, his attack would definitely be cheating for Ben's Nuzlocke.

1123
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,080
He can't over as you pancake is the coolest attack in all.

1124
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,200
Oh, hey, you know what?

1125
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,400
Let's talk about that real quick.

1126
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,080
Z moves. I think I think I just completely love them.

1127
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,120
And they're they're basically final smashes for Pokemon.

1128
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,120
And I just don't like that they have long cut scenes.

1129
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,160
That's the only thing I don't know.

1130
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,880
You can only use them so much.

1131
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,840
I do love you don't love final smashes.

1132
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,480
Yeah, you know, okay.

1133
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,240
Yeah, I think I think they're balanced enough

1134
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,440
using one per battle, you know, seems reasonable.

1135
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,840
I don't think you could use them all the time.

1136
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,240
Then you would feel like you need to use them all the time.

1137
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,560
And then you'd be terrible that they were really long.

1138
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,000
But if you're like, you know, you're fighting a Cajun and you're like,

1139
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,960
all right, they got half the health.

1140
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,160
I can't do it.

1141
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,400
Well, explosion.

1142
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,960
Z moves are Z moves are good.

1143
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,120
Like they're always good to use.

1144
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,840
So like strategically, you probably should use them every single battle you're in,

1145
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,440
which is well, I'm not going to spoil.

1146
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,240
You can usually kill them in one hit if you're good.

1147
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,360
Mom, can you say I'm not going to spoil anything?

1148
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,040
But the battle between me and Ben, the Z moves are some of the

1149
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
I mean, it's the best fucking parts of the video.

1150
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,560
The Z moves did the Z moves did become.

1151
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,240
Yeah, I think they're a lot of fun.

1152
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,920
That's cool. That's what's cool about like.

1153
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,080
Yeah, acts like in the city in that case, in that case,

1154
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,200
the the cutscene definitely added something.

1155
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,040
Yeah, that was fun.

1156
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,080
It makes it more anime.

1157
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,240
Yeah, it's like it's like me and Ben were actually fighting in an anime.

1158
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,320
It was awesome. Yeah.

1159
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:14,440
Yeah, we like we called out our attacks and then we charged them up and released them.

1160
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,920
Did you do the pose as well?

1161
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,320
Yeah, you better have done that dance.

1162
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,960
Oh, in real life, we do in real life.

1163
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had face cam on and everything.

1164
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,280
Wait, OK, Generation 8, Generation 8,

1165
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,920
keep the Z moves, but have a motion controller built into the DS.

1166
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,280
You have to actually perform the dance.

1167
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,280
If you do it wrong, then the attack doesn't work.

1168
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,080
I would be so down.

1169
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,480
You know what? Quick, quick, caviar.

1170
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,480
One of my biggest problems with this game was that there's a couple times

1171
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,000
you get a a Z stone or a Z crystal or whatever,

1172
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and then you can just use it without learning the dance.

1173
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,960
How the fuck did I learn that dance game?

1174
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,200
How the fuck did I do it?

1175
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,800
I don't know. That's so shit.

1176
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,120
That actually really pisses me off.

1177
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,640
Like, they make a big deal about, oh, you have to do the dance to do the thing.

1178
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,160
And then sometimes they just ignore that rule.

1179
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,360
That sucks.

1180
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:06,080
I would say as often they ignore the rule because there's 20 fucking crystals

1181
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,800
and there's only like eight people who teach you dances.

1182
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,000
Did you? The first thing I did when I got to end game was go down.

1183
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,920
Make up your own dance.

1184
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,880
There you go.

1185
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,840
Maybe I don't even think the dance is about here.

1186
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,760
If you can make up your own dance, then why does why does Ilma have to teach you the dance?

1187
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
Tradition.

1188
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,800
Wait, if there's 18 crystals, surely some of them are the same type,

1189
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,920
like same move type, like water.

1190
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,880
No, there's actually way more than.

1191
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,280
There's 18 types, but then there's like unique.

1192
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,040
There's there's Pokemon specific crystals, too.

1193
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,600
Oh, fuck.

1194
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,120
Forgot about that.

1195
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
I'll say this much.

1196
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,360
I kind of like the Zmos.

1197
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,680
Actually, I like them a lot more than I do mega evolution.

1198
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,160
Yeah, dog. Yeah.

1199
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,560
No, I like I like mega mega evolution.

1200
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,200
Yeah, but make a little you grow up and accept it.

1201
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,600
Make up a whole thing.

1202
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,240
What do you mean they take up a whole thing?

1203
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,800
They do they take up a whole move slot?

1204
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,600
What? No, no, they take up a turn.

1205
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,240
No. OK, forget it.

1206
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,840
Then I've never really used them.

1207
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,000
I just heard about a man.

1208
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,320
Let me tell you, maybe evolution.

1209
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,840
Mega evolutions do not take up a turn, you dingus.

1210
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,760
They don't. Oh, OK.

1211
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,600
Well, I still like it.

1212
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,160
But I got through this whole game like Z moves a lot.

1213
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,920
And let me tell you, I'm in the end game now.

1214
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,960
Well, I went to do a thing in a certain place.

1215
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,760
And what do I find?

1216
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,640
But the guy's like, hey, congratulations on becoming champion.

1217
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,320
How would you like to learn about megas?

1218
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,440
And I was like, no, please, we were so close.

1219
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,040
Megas are cool.

1220
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,360
No, I'm that's it.

1221
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,800
I'm a mega I'm a mega fag.

1222
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
I'm totally on board with megas.

1223
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,400
Then you are a mega fag.

1224
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,600
I am a mega evolution.

1225
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,320
I mean, I know I literally just said that about myself.

1226
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,680
Um, I I played the whole game and I never used a single Z move.

1227
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:51,240
What? Oh, yeah, I died all the time.

1228
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,360
I can't wipe in this game.

1229
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,160
I wonder why the idea of having to like give things to my Pokemon

1230
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,360
never been a fan.

1231
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,680
Say you don't even give them items.

1232
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,760
You've got to micromanage at least a little bit.

1233
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,520
Jen, too.

1234
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,280
Managing, too.

1235
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,960
I hate because I constantly switch Pokemon in and out of my party.

1236
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,720
So I've always felt like I have to, like, remove all the items from each guy

1237
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:19,040
and then put them on the next guy in Spanish by the part of the game

1238
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,200
where you're on the second island and you've just got to the Royal Rumble.

1239
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,880
How many times have you completely wiped?

1240
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,760
I'm just curious.

1241
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,640
He said ten minutes.

1242
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,640
Rumble.

1243
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,880
Yeah, I don't know if at all.

1244
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,000
Maybe once.

1245
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Digi, I got a question for you.

1246
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,360
Me and Ben are having a little debate about this.

1247
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,360
Do you think when you get thrown into that first Royal Rumble,

1248
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,080
if your Pokemon dies in a Nuzlocke, is that is it dead

1249
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,240
or does the Royal Rumble not count because it's fucking horses?

1250
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,680
I would say it doesn't count because it's so fucking weird.

1251
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah, I'd say it doesn't count either.

1252
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,840
Ben's trying to kill my Pokemon.

1253
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,440
Do you remember the four-way battles?

1254
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,520
If the story puts you in a battle, I think it's part of you.

1255
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,480
But it's not a real battle because it's three on one pretty much.

1256
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
And it's the only Pokemon in your party.

1257
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,080
So when it dies, it counts as a full party wipe and that's game over.

1258
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,320
But someone...

1259
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,920
The biggest problem with it is they don't even warn you it's going to happen

1260
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,400
and it automatically selects your first Pokemon.

1261
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,480
There's all kinds of things that happen without warning.

1262
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,680
Yeah, but you don't have your whole team.

1263
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,080
It just picks the first guy you've got and then just throws you in.

1264
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,080
And it's like you just...

1265
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,920
It counts as a full party wipe and that's game over.

1266
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,680
I don't know, it sounds like it should maybe

1267
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,160
kill the death of that Pokemon but not necessarily.

1268
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,760
I mean, I just played...

1269
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,040
It does look like community Nuzlocke.

1270
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,360
Rumble and it was full.

1271
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,840
We are the Nuzlocke community.

1272
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,280
It wasn't really three on one.

1273
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,720
Like, most of them didn't attack me at all.

1274
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,600
They guys, they fucked each other up.

1275
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,720
I almost wanted it, but then the thing is that there's one guy

1276
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,640
who was constantly using Reflect and he was the only one who was weak type-wise

1277
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,680
to my guy.

1278
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,880
So I just kept attacking him, but it wasn't working, you know,

1279
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,200
and he kept reflecting.

1280
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,840
And then eventually I was the first to die in the end.

1281
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,200
Like, eventually they all killed me and I was like,

1282
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,840
there was no way I could have known this was coming and had the right...

1283
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,600
Like, there's no way to know what Pokemon they're gonna have

1284
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,520
or what would be the best, you know, front-runner for your party.

1285
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,960
So, yeah, it was just kind of...

1286
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,160
So I think Ben, for the sake of our Nuzlocke,

1287
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,720
I think we should have a vote.

1288
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,120
We have six Pokemon experts.

1289
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,960
We've all played the game out, but we put it to a vote.

1290
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,960
And then the other side, my Pokemon is dead.

1291
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,880
But I'm just saying, I'm just saying,

1292
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,280
if the vote comes out that it doesn't count,

1293
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,400
I'm still gonna do it.

1294
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,680
And if I manage to win, I'm gonna pretend that it's legit

1295
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,000
and I'm gonna pretend that I'm superior for that reason.

1296
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,520
You're probably gonna be superior regardless.

1297
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,000
In a Nuzlocke, I don't think it counts as a full party wipe if you die,

1298
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,280
but that Pokemon should die.

1299
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,720
I kind of agree with that.

1300
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,160
God damn it.

1301
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,360
Fuck you all.

1302
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,160
Let's vote on it.

1303
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,920
Let's vote on it right now.

1304
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,840
I think it should count for that, yeah.

1305
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,360
So, okay, all in favor of it counting for a full game over wipe,

1306
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,000
if you lose, say aye.

1307
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,920
No votes, okay.

1308
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,720
All who think that it should count as the death of that Pokemon,

1309
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,400
but not necessarily a full game over, say aye.

1310
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,840
Aye.

1311
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,800
That's what, four?

1312
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,760
And okay, and everyone who thinks it shouldn't count whatsoever, say aye.

1313
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,440
Fuck you.

1314
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,360
Well, the majority says that Pokemon must die.

1315
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,800
Ugh.

1316
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,520
I should probably have voted the other way,

1317
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,480
because I don't know what you were thinking.

1318
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,160
It's fun.

1319
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,360
It's fun to die.

1320
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,240
It is fun to die.

1321
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,680
That's what makes the, that's what makes the game fun.

1322
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,360
It's almost like it's fun when a Pokemon game challenges you

1323
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,480
and gives you shit and you don't do everything perfectly,

1324
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,800
instead of sucking your dick the whole time.

1325
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,800
Wow, what a concept.

1326
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,480
What is that?

1327
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,040
Throwing my level 15 Pokemon that I'm training

1328
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,280
into a fucking four way.

1329
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,280
That's so fun and challenging, Nate.

1330
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,840
Well, you could try not to throw it into a four way.

1331
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,280
I didn't know they were gonna throw me

1332
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,880
into a fucking battle, hippo.

1333
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,560
It's completely out of nowhere.

1334
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,880
Wait, is it already happening for you?

1335
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,200
Yeah, it fucking happens.

1336
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,840
I changed my vote.

1337
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,080
You're too late, bitch.

1338
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,920
Three to three.

1339
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,320
It's time.

1340
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,160
What the hell?

1341
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,000
And Dizzy counts us too,

1342
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,440
because he has more subs than us.

1343
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,280
That's bullshit.

1344
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,280
Fucking cowards.

1345
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,120
You are cowards.

1346
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,760
Well, I do make your own decisions.

1347
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,880
You guys, since it's a tie,

1348
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,440
you two will have to decide amongst yourselves.

1349
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,280
You're the ones doing it.

1350
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,200
But we both just agreed.

1351
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,280
So, hey, what do you know?

1352
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,240
Okay, well, there you go.

1353
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,720
All right, get out of jail free.

1354
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,680
Yeah.

1355
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,520
Congratulations, everyone.

1356
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,080
Ben's gonna fully make up his mind once he plays it

1357
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,920
and whether or not he's gonna play it.

1358
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,240
Yeah, that's right.

1359
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,680
No, yeah, I have to, let's confer on this after.

1360
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,840
Once he sees how bullshit it is,

1361
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,400
I think he's gonna agree with me.

1362
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,280
Let's wait for me to win,

1363
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,320
and then so I can say it definitely should count as a death.

1364
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,160
Yeah, that sounds good.

1365
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,960
Maybe if your Pokemon died, Momki,

1366
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,800
you should just constantly let it have paralysis.

1367
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,760
So it's like it's a cripple now.

1368
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,600
That's still alive.

1369
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,280
Hey, let's talk about something else now.

1370
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,480
And I think this was an X and Y.

1371
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,760
I can't fucking remember, but I know it was in this game

1372
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,600
and it was pretty cool.

1373
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,080
Let's talk about dressing up your Pokemon, man.

1374
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,040
Maybe all pretty, looking fly is fun.

1375
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,880
I loved it.

1376
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,720
I loved it.

1377
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,400
I mean, I haven't seen that much of it,

1378
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,840
but what I've seen, I like,

1379
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,400
I want there to be lots more options.

1380
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,520
Me too, I'm not dressing up your character, right?

1381
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,120
The way you raised that was odd.

1382
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,680
You're talking about the Pokemon or the character?

1383
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,520
The character.

1384
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,840
Oh, that's good.

1385
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,320
Well, yeah, I'm on a quest

1386
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,160
to find a really nice big summer hat

1387
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,520
to go with a white dress.

1388
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,640
That's weird.

1389
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,160
There's only one big summer hat in the game

1390
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,120
and it is $145,000.

1391
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,960
I'm getting it.

1392
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,560
See, I could buy it now.

1393
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,560
That's the one thing I hadn't bought yet that I wanted,

1394
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,040
but you can only get it in that mall in the first island.

1395
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,320
So you're already past it.

1396
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,600
There's nothing more fun than giving yourself a quest

1397
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,960
and then going on it and completing it.

1398
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,480
Well, the items changed day to day in the shop.

1399
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,560
And I'm asking, do they?

1400
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,040
Do they do what?

1401
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,440
I didn't see the big summer hat when I was first there,

1402
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,760
so I guess it gets a lot.

1403
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,880
No, there's no changes.

1404
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,480
The one in the mall is the super fancy store

1405
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,280
where everything's crazy expensive

1406
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,960
because there's two stores in the first town.

1407
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,760
There's the one that's like the basic bitch store

1408
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,960
and then there's the crazy high quality store.

1409
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,240
Where the hell is the crazy store?

1410
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,120
Are you talking about at the mall?

1411
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,280
It's in the mall.

1412
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,840
You have to go on the mall.

1413
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,400
No, I'm talking about Sun.

1414
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,880
There's a mall that me and Ben both completely missed

1415
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,600
our first time through the first town.

1416
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,800
I'm guessing I missed it as well.

1417
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,680
And then we went back and it's, yeah,

1418
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,240
it's like a huge, they've got, yeah, it's a big ass mall

1419
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,400
and they've got like a clothes store

1420
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,880
and then a couple of other little shops.

1421
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,240
And then there's like an event area

1422
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,480
where like depending on time of day and what day it is,

1423
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,040
there's different events going on there.

1424
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,960
There's a guy who makes you literally pick up

1425
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,000
a bunch of shit and feed it to a grimer.

1426
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,320
It's hilarious.

1427
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,800
You literally pick up shit.

1428
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,880
It's Pokemon shit is everywhere.

1429
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,840
And you have to feed it to a grimer.

1430
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,920
It's the best.

1431
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,760
Shall we?

1432
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,240
I like the Alolan grimer

1433
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,080
because he's like he ate a cheeseburger

1434
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,800
and he's got cheese around his lips.

1435
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,240
Maybe that's why, maybe that's why Alolan grimer is-

1436
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,200
Actually I like Alolan muck.

1437
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,600
That's why who I like.

1438
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,640
Maybe that's why Alolan grimer and muck are all gross looking

1439
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,200
because they eat poop unlike regular grimmers.

1440
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,920
Well, yeah, that's, it's established in this game.

1441
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,040
Well, grimmers in the previous generations ate like sludge

1442
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,800
and like industrial waste.

1443
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,600
And now they just eat human trash

1444
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,200
because there's not enough waste.

1445
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,320
There's not enough industrialization in Alola

1446
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,160
for them to eat.

1447
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,320
I feel that's why he has the yellow

1448
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,200
because I just assumed it was cheese from a cheeseburger.

1449
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,360
Yeah, they also eat poop.

1450
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,920
That's pretty fucking disgusting.

1451
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,440
But doesn't muck have like diamonds in its mouth?

1452
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,640
Maybe.

1453
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,960
He's got like, he's got like these like

1454
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,520
crystalline looking stones for teeth or something.

1455
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,480
Could be glass shards or something.

1456
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,640
Yeah, it could be glass.

1457
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,040
You never know, you never know.

1458
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,200
But anyway, let's talk about forms and how cool they are.

1459
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,160
Grimer, when you rub them, your hands goes all sticky

1460
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,200
and it's like, it's real funny.

1461
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I've got to try it.

1462
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,200
I've got to try it.

1463
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,200
Who would ever pet that disgusting sack of garbage?

1464
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,040
I'd never touch it.

1465
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,080
He's gross, but I love the fact that they added that.

1466
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,440
I've got to take my, I've got to take my little comb

1467
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,640
and just gently, just gently clean off

1468
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,160
my little pile of, of my little pile of garbage.

1469
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,360
My little piece of living feces.

1470
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,360
So let me, yeah, let me just ask guys,

1471
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,200
does anyone have a problem at all with the Pokemon forms?

1472
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Cause I think I pretty much just love them across the board.

1473
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,040
What do you mean forms?

1474
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,800
I mean, Alolan form versus Kanto and you know, the other.

1475
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,440
Some of them suck.

1476
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,120
Well, they can like, okay, Persian is a nightmare.

1477
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,320
Persian is a nightmare.

1478
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,400
There's no doubt about it.

1479
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,400
I don't really like Alolan Dugtrio,

1480
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,240
even though I think he's funny.

1481
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,080
Yeah, I don't get the, I don't get it.

1482
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,440
As stupid as Persian looks,

1483
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,080
I think it's a thousand times better

1484
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,520
than the original Persian.

1485
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,840
What?

1486
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,080
I mean, Cat's Persian was boring and stupid

1487
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,400
and I never cared about it.

1488
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,520
This is not an upgrade.

1489
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,360
This is a downgrade.

1490
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,320
This is hilarious.

1491
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,840
This is a great downgrade.

1492
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,520
Do you not think that it looks like a one piece character?

1493
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,200
I think it looks like a one piece character.

1494
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,040
Okay, but that's not always good.

1495
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,760
Oh guys, we lost Mage.

1496
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,720
Where'd Mage go?

1497
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,880
She was triggered by my hatred of Persian.

1498
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,000
I'm sorry, Mage.

1499
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,320
Forgive me.

1500
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,160
Oh yeah.

1501
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,080
I think the original Persian looks like a normal cat.

1502
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,920
Kept her recording.

1503
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,000
I hope she, yeah.

1504
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,840
She's a big girl.

1505
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,280
She can take care of herself.

1506
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,280
Well, anyway.

1507
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,360
We'll see how that plays out.

1508
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,560
Yeah, I think forms are cool.

1509
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,160
And I mean, I've recently found,

1510
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,960
I guess I won't say it because I want to spoil you guys.

1511
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,960
Oh, I like fat face, Rattacate.

1512
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,160
Oh, I love fat Rattacate.

1513
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,000
No, I don't.

1514
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,840
Cool.

1515
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,920
Well, you know, I kind of like Alolan Rattacate.

1516
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,760
I do not like Alolan Rattata.

1517
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,600
He is stupid enough.

1518
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,840
Rattata is always in every universe,

1519
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,680
every timeline.

1520
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,960
Rattata is a piece of shit.

1521
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,120
No, well, I mean, I don't mind the,

1522
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,200
they just gave him a mustache.

1523
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,320
It's so stupid.

1524
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,960
Like there's no substantive change.

1525
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,560
My biggest problem with the Alolan forms

1526
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,720
is that there's not nearly enough of them

1527
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,280
and there are still old fucking Pokemon,

1528
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,040
like Caterpie in this game.

1529
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,720
Yeah, there's no business being there.

1530
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,040
Yeah, there needed to be way more.

1531
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,040
It should have been,

1532
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,760
it should have been every old Pokemon is different here.

1533
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,080
I mean, do you guys feel,

1534
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,200
it's going to be from Gen one.

1535
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,080
It should have been different.

1536
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,320
Cause like it kind of implies the game.

1537
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,520
Hi, sorry, internet.

1538
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,640
Just did your, did your, did your recording survive?

1539
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,920
Yeah, my recording was just the internet.

1540
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,720
Yeah, it's kind of implied throughout the game

1541
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,160
that Alola is like closer to Kanto

1542
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,720
and that there's like a lot of immigration

1543
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,200
between the two and Kanto is like kind of important.

1544
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,280
So I feel like it made sense

1545
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,800
whether there'd be lots of Kanto Pokemon,

1546
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,440
but they should all have different forms.

1547
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,000
I should not in any Pokemon game ever

1548
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
have to catch into the fucking Caterpie

1549
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,640
and then, and have a butterfree.

1550
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,800
That's not even any different.

1551
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,440
Like, I mean, even in X and Y,

1552
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,920
they made their own bug Pokemon

1553
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,520
and it evolved into a butterfly

1554
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,040
that had four different forms.

1555
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,120
It was like different depending on where you were.

1556
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,080
That's cool.

1557
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,360
Why was that not the case here with butterfree?

1558
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,280
Well, I mean, I, I feel you on that.

1559
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,640
That, that's a, that's a fair point,

1560
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,320
but let me ask you guys something else.

1561
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,160
Do you feel it all?

1562
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,560
I feel a bit of this.

1563
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,360
Like these are kind of a cop out

1564
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,440
to avoid having to put in the work to make new Pokemon.

1565
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,280
This is sort of a, the easy way.

1566
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,560
I think they are kind of an effort saving measure,

1567
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,440
but they're one that I'm okay with.

1568
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,280
Yeah.

1569
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,120
I don't, I don't like it.

1570
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,320
I mean, I'm sorry for them.

1571
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,800
I wouldn't say Alola forms are bit just like

1572
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,240
Digglet is basically just the same with hair.

1573
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,080
Yeah.

1574
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,920
Digglet is lazy as fuck.

1575
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,240
Digglet's obviously meant to be a joke.

1576
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,440
He doesn't even have a metal nose.

1577
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,760
Even when you get,

1578
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,760
when you get into battles with him,

1579
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,520
have you noticed that when you fight

1580
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,480
Doug Trio sometimes, then it like,

1581
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,120
it has like this dramatic camera shot on it.

1582
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,960
Like, like all these like action lines show up

1583
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,120
and it's like, would you like fight one?

1584
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,600
And well, I mean, I do see that when you're in battle,

1585
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,800
like the camera does pan around and do shots like that.

1586
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,640
No, no, no.

1587
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,040
I mean, when you first get into the battle

1588
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,920
and like it reveals Doug Trio,

1589
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,360
then like sometimes it did like a weird dramatic,

1590
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,200
like look at this fucking thing.

1591
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,240
Like.

1592
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,080
I don't know, man.

1593
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,720
Are you sure that it's just a normal battle?

1594
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,560
Well, whatever.

1595
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,600
I'm not sure that's unique.

1596
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,200
What do you guys think of the Alolan form?

1597
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,320
Maybe that could be like a,

1598
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,640
maybe that's like an evolved form special look at this.

1599
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,720
I have no idea.

1600
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,560
Monkey, what were you saying?

1601
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,280
Yeah, but what do you guys think of the Alolan form

1602
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,080
of Ben Saint where like they have a new militarized skin

1603
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,640
and he thinks he's like a general and stuff?

1604
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,480
Not a fan.

1605
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,520
I think it's pretty fucking stupid.

1606
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,920
I've really not.

1607
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,600
It's a form change before I was a petty terrorist

1608
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,440
and now I'm a petty dictator.

1609
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,280
Yeah, like Fidel Castro.

1610
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,960
That's like a tight change.

1611
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,240
The pettiness is a constant.

1612
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,920
Oh, rest in peace, Fidel Castro, my comrade.

1613
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,760
Did he die?

1614
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,280
He died fucking today.

1615
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,280
Whoa, why are we doing a PCP about that?

1616
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,800
Holy shit.

1617
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,480
Wow, I had no fucking idea.

1618
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,880
What happens when you guys sleep until 3 p.m.?

1619
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,760
Yeah, I didn't know that Fidel Castro was alive

1620
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,600
until today when I found out he was no longer alive.

1621
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,880
I didn't know who Fidel Castro was.

1622
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,200
He let Raul run things for a while, but he was still alive.

1623
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,240
But he's like 90 years old.

1624
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,600
Yeah, he's an old ass bitch.

1625
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,480
Well, rest in peace, my friend.

1626
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,320
My comrade.

1627
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,240
You'll be partying with Che soon up there.

1628
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,520
My friends, here.

1629
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,640
My friend, who up there?

1630
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,480
Che, come on.

1631
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,560
Okay, okay, I won't spoil anything,

1632
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,800
but what I've heard mostly from you, Digi,

1633
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,680
about like, how do I say it?

1634
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,520
The sort of Alolan analogy,

1635
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,520
like the Alolan version of the Pokemon League is awesome.

1636
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,440
Oh yeah, it's the coolest thing ever.

1637
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,280
Everything I have heard about that is great.

1638
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,640
The Pokemon League is a thousand times better

1639
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,680
than ever before.

1640
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1641
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,680
Okay, I really, maybe this isn't the right place

1642
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,720
to talk about it, but I really want to hear these reasons,

1643
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,120
because I don't know why you think that.

1644
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,960
First of all, there's the context of like, why it exists.

1645
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,120
Right, I got you on that.

1646
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:47,960
I got you on that.

1647
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,800
And then there's just how it plays out.

1648
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,000
You know about what you get to do

1649
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,880
after you beat the Pokemon League, if you fight it again?

1650
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,160
Yes, it's amazing.

1651
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,440
No, okay, I only beat it once, so I'll go do that.

1652
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,840
I don't know if this is considered a spoiler, so.

1653
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,440
Yeah, it would be a total spoiler.

1654
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,440
Do you think so?

1655
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,600
I'm gonna go do it immediately.

1656
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,440
Yes, I do.

1657
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,280
Don't tell me.

1658
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,120
You say it's cool, I'll go do it.

1659
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,560
Guys, Nuzlocke's end after you beat the Pokemon League,

1660
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,840
in my mind, so you can spoil what happens post-game.

1661
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,680
I don't give a fuck.

1662
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,280
I don't really think of it as a spoiler.

1663
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,480
It's just, I'm telling you, I don't want to know.

1664
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,400
You say it's cool, but guys, I won't go do it.

1665
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,160
Maybe it won't be as cool as you think it will

1666
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,000
until I fuck, like.

1667
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,840
No, no.

1668
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,040
You're gonna go through all the trouble

1669
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,880
of being in the Pokemon League,

1670
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,360
and be like, that's all it was?

1671
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,200
Fuck you, Digi.

1672
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,680
No, I already know, and I know that if you tell me.

1673
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,200
You get to date me, too, okay?

1674
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,120
You're like, yeah, I wish I did, you know that.

1675
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,400
You're gonna date me, too?

1676
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,240
Spoiling.

1677
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,600
Do I spy Dan Green?

1678
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,800
Do I spy?

1679
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,560
Oh my God, he loves this one.

1680
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,720
Well, fuck.

1681
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,560
Whatever, it's cool.

1682
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,280
That's exciting, and I'll go do that,

1683
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,720
and I'm looking forward to whatever it is

1684
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,240
without my expectations to I.

1685
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,080
So, cool.

1686
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,160
Awesome, I'll do that.

1687
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,920
I guess we need to talk about Ultra Beasts.

1688
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,280
You know, we don't have to talk about anything,

1689
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,840
because it's supposed to be a general Pokemon podcast,

1690
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,680
and not a sudden note.

1691
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,160
I don't actually have anything to say

1692
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,520
about Ultra Beasts, because I haven't encountered any.

1693
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,040
What's Ultra Beasts?

1694
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,680
I mean, it's weird.

1695
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,400
I have been in the game now,

1696
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,600
and Ultra Beasts were only relevant at one time,

1697
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,600
and I'm doing a thing now that has something

1698
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,960
to do with them.

1699
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,160
I don't know what's going on.

1700
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:23,400
I don't know where the mission is catching Ultra Beasts.

1701
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,160
Are they mostly a post-game thing?

1702
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,240
Yeah, they're mostly post-game.

1703
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,160
Like, I mean, they're relevant.

1704
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm glad.

1705
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,040
The story is kind of based around them,

1706
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,720
but you only really interact with them post-game.

1707
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,560
I mean, that's weird.

1708
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,880
Okay, because I don't really want

1709
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,800
to interact with them very much.

1710
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,480
Okay, yeah, let's just talk about them design-wise.

1711
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,680
I mean, it's kind of important.

1712
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,760
If they are going to be captured like regular Pokemon,

1713
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,080
and we just have them in balls,

1714
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,000
that seems very strange to me,

1715
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,200
because they are not like normal Pokemon,

1716
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,040
but if we just like maybe.

1717
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,680
You mean Legendaries?

1718
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,520
Yeah.

1719
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,960
They don't look like, like, look at that muscle dude.

1720
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,160
You know, he does not look like a normal Pokemon.

1721
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,120
Ultra Beasts are pretty fucking different,

1722
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,240
but they're also like from another dimension, so.

1723
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,640
Right, it makes sense.

1724
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,280
I don't know what this is.

1725
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,000
Well, you'll find out when you get later into the game,

1726
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,160
and we're going to stop talking.

1727
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,400
I can't wait.

1728
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,760
Yeah, okay, okay.

1729
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,480
I guess I feel okay about them.

1730
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,840
I don't know whatever.

1731
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,360
You know who I like?

1732
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,000
I wish I could say more,

1733
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,440
but I guess I shouldn't for Star Wise,

1734
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,320
but Kukui is cool.

1735
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,160
I like the professor.

1736
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,000
Yes.

1737
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,840
I like him a lot.

1738
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,800
He is the coolest professor.

1739
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,920
He is probably the coolest professor.

1740
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,200
He's the sexiest professor.

1741
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,800
And I really like, I don't know if you guys have gotten this,

1742
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,080
but it's implied later that he trains his body really hard

1743
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,480
because he's a move guy.

1744
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,320
He's into moves.

1745
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,160
That's his thing as a professor.

1746
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,400
We also know everything about moves.

1747
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,600
So he has trained himself

1748
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,960
so that he can endure being hit by moves

1749
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,280
so he can learn about them.

1750
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,640
How badass is that?

1751
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,880
That's fucking legit.

1752
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,440
I caught my fucking Dragonite,

1753
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,240
and I told him to outrage on me,

1754
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,520
and he wouldn't stop.

1755
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:58,720
He spent three entire turns just tearing me to fucking shred.

1756
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,400
Luckily, I had my Alomomola nearby

1757
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,360
to cast Wish on me to repair my shattered body.

1758
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,240
Yes, Wish that you wouldn't be crushed.

1759
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,080
Wish that I wasn't dead, and it worked.

1760
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,160
So here I am.

1761
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,440
When you said your Dragonite was using outrage on you,

1762
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,480
I thought you were gonna say it started a Tumblr account.

1763
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,920
Oh, good.

1764
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,680
Is that like a fat dragon joke?

1765
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,520
Sure.

1766
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,600
No, it's because he was outraged by Trump being elected.

1767
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,440
Sure.

1768
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,280
Make my joke funnier for me.

1769
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,600
I'm envisioning that, you know,

1770
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,040
that butter dragon thing that was in Undertale?

1771
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,360
Oh, God.

1772
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,720
Yeah.

1773
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,600
Yeah.

1774
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
So everybody.

1775
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,600
He's got some outrage.

1776
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,440
I know half of you haven't gotten very far in this game,

1777
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,400
but what would you say is your favorite new Pokemon?

1778
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,480
I've seen all the Pokemon.

1779
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,680
Definitely Grubbin.

1780
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,480
Grubbin is really good.

1781
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,560
Grubbin is really good.

1782
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,920
Grubbin so much.

1783
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,440
He's fucking adorable.

1784
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,280
Yeah, he's kind of cute,

1785
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,640
but Raul is way cuter.

1786
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,160
His evolved form is really cool.

1787
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,000
Little bird.

1788
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,840
Owl bird started.

1789
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,360
I like male Primarina.

1790
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,360
I bet you do.

1791
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,480
Primarina is cool.

1792
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,520
Primarina is the coolest design of the three.

1793
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,360
I don't know what that is.

1794
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,200
No, no, no.

1795
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,240
The grass final is by far the coolest.

1796
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,280
Have you guys tried Petty?

1797
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,360
If you actually play with the grass final,

1798
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,640
like he is, like his moves and everything,

1799
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,960
he looks, first of all, he looks cooler from behind.

1800
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,640
So like when you've got him on your team,

1801
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,960
you're like, yeah, yeah.

1802
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,880
And then you fucking use the arrow move

1803
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,800
and you're like, yeah.

1804
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,640
Yeah, that's the best.

1805
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,480
He swings anointing, though.

1806
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,840
Guys, when he pulls the two little dangly leaves

1807
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,880
on the dangle down from his neck,

1808
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,400
his mask thing closes because it's a fucking hoodie.

1809
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,160
He's wearing a grass hoodie.

1810
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,400
How sick is that?

1811
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,600
It's pretty sick.

1812
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,440
It's the best.

1813
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,280
It's pretty sick.

1814
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,120
It's the best.

1815
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,440
I'll give you that much.

1816
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,280
All right.

1817
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,320
I also like Mimikyu,

1818
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,960
but I don't think everyone likes Mimikyu.

1819
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,800
Yeah, Mimikyu's great.

1820
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,360
I mean, Mimikyu's the best way

1821
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,320
to do another fucking Pikachu for sure.

1822
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,280
But he didn't already.

1823
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,280
Another Pikachu was.

1824
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,840
Yeah, there's another new one this game, too.

1825
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,120
Wait, like aside from Mimikyu?

1826
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,560
Yeah, there's like this little fat mouse thing.

1827
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,840
It's like a Hedgehog.

1828
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,920
It was a Pikachu original.

1829
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,080
A Hedgehog.

1830
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:10,920
I don't know.

1831
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,000
He has a long mask thing.

1832
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,840
Super Sonic.

1833
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,680
And it's like a steel electric type.

1834
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,280
Wait, Tota Gamaru?

1835
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,120
Yeah.

1836
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,560
Wait, is he new this game?

1837
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,400
Yeah.

1838
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,960
Oh, he's...

1839
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,600
I mean, I don't understand the point

1840
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,480
because we already had a steel electric,

1841
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,160
but I guess he's a fast steel electric.

1842
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,400
The point is they need a new Pikachu

1843
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,880
because it's a new Pokemon game.

1844
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,080
God, why do they do that?

1845
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,440
It's so stupid.

1846
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,280
I don't know.

1847
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,480
They always got a bird and they've always got a grub.

1848
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,240
One thing they're not always annoyed about

1849
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,320
is like the insistence that Pikachu is the best one

1850
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,880
and he's got better voice acting in this game.

1851
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,080
And it's always about Pikachu and I don't care.

1852
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,080
Pikachu's voice acting in this game is a trainer, too.

1853
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:52,920
I actually...

1854
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,760
Oh, really?

1855
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,600
Wait, is it a trainer?

1856
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,800
There's a trainer you can fight in the graveyard

1857
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,560
named Ikue and she only has a Pikachu.

1858
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,480
And when you beat her, she's like,

1859
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,080
Pika, pika!

1860
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,040
I remember that.

1861
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,360
Oh, well, she is the voice actress of Pikachu.

1862
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,880
That's a cute reference, way to go.

1863
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,680
And she's standing over a grave of a Pikachu also,

1864
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,640
which I, oh my God, what does this mean?

1865
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,200
The symbolism was haunting me.

1866
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,280
Dude, what if she had just been fired from the role,

1867
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,680
standing over the grave of Pikachu?

1868
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,360
That would have been a half of the play.

1869
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,840
She says like, I'm speaking in the language

1870
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,280
of this dead Pikachu that I'm here to visit or something.

1871
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,120
Yeah, she's channeling it.

1872
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,520
She's definitely the most recognized voice actress

1873
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,120
in the world, because it's the same voice

1874
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,320
for Pikachu in every country.

1875
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,640
They never change it, you know?

1876
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,940
So we all know Ikue Atani as a voice Pikachu.

1877
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,280
I heard a story from a friend of mine

1878
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,560
who knew someone who met her.

1879
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,440
This was in like 2001

1880
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,560
and apparently she like has a tick

1881
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,200
of just like inserting pikas into her speech.

1882
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,040
Oh my God.

1883
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,880
She's broken.

1884
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,200
She's been fully broken.

1885
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,120
That was only four, that was only like four or five years

1886
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,280
into Pokemon being out.

1887
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,040
Imagine it must be like now.

1888
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,320
Her mind would be absolutely shattered.

1889
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,320
She's yellow.

1890
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,560
She's even yellower than she was before.

1891
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,400
Sorry.

1892
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,720
I want her to get surgical alterations,

1893
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,320
become that which you love.

1894
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,800
Guys, I didn't say what new Pokemon I like.

1895
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,400
Oh, please, monkey, please.

1896
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,400
The one that gave me the best reaction was Crab Roller.

1897
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,760
Yeah, I love that guy.

1898
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,760
Hey, what do you mean, buddy?

1899
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,960
You're fucking great.

1900
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,600
Can we also say what our least favorite new Pokemon is too?

1901
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,440
Yeah, yeah.

1902
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,800
I haven't said my favorite yet,

1903
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,640
but I don't really know.

1904
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,280
I'm trying to decide if I should base this on design

1905
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,280
or on like usage.

1906
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,200
You can specify, you know.

1907
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,280
I mean, there's a lot of good designs,

1908
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,480
like Ribbon Bee is fucking adorable.

1909
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,320
Ribbon Bee has been a staple of my team

1910
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,720
and I love him so much.

1911
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,480
I really like, God, what's he called?

1912
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,560
Meteor.

1913
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,680
Oh, the Meteor guy.

1914
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,680
Yeah, he's awesome.

1915
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,840
Meteor is really cool.

1916
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,160
That asshole never saw one in the whole game.

1917
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,280
I was trying to catch that guy.

1918
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,440
He kept self-destructing.

1919
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,040
It was a big problem, so I gave up.

1920
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:13,880
Never saw him.

1921
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,280
No trainers had him.

1922
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,160
Turton Nader's pretty all right.

1923
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,160
Oh, I hate that guy.

1924
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,160
I like Trampa's dumbass face.

1925
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,720
Oh, I really like Trampa.

1926
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,040
The one that I expected to totally hate

1927
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,280
and then absolutely loved.

1928
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,480
And I think the second form has the terrible design,

1929
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,720
but fucking Mudbray and Mudsdale are just so good

1930
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,880
as like teammates.

1931
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,120
Like, he was the only one who's like an absolute mainstay.

1932
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,680
I mean, like the donkey?

1933
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,840
Yeah, the donkey's adorable.

1934
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,680
And then it evolves into this hideous fucking horse.

1935
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,360
Very underwhelmed, very underwhelmed by their designs.

1936
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,200
Yeah.

1937
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,040
Not excited about them.

1938
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm okay with the first form,

1939
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,680
but the second form is just hideous,

1940
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,120
but like, he's so fucking good.

1941
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,840
I really came to like him

1942
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,880
because just because we met like a trainer,

1943
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,240
you know, that girl, whatever her name was,

1944
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,120
who would know her or something.

1945
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,120
I was like, that guy was like her, her rock, you know?

1946
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:11,960
He was cool.

1947
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,560
And you get to like those guys.

1948
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,160
I like, I respect for that Pokemon.

1949
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,520
He's a hardworking dude.

1950
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,400
I also, have any of you seen Pu-Ku-Mu?

1951
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,440
Pu-Ku-Mu?

1952
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,360
Which one's that?

1953
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,200
I have.

1954
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,120
I don't know the name.

1955
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,440
Pu-Ku-Mu-Ku.

1956
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,160
Oh my God, that thing is disgusting and I love it.

1957
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,760
It's this little black ball with like red spikes on it

1958
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,920
that's got like an anus for a face,

1959
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,800
but like, it's basically like,

1960
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,400
I think it's meant to be kind of the Wabafet of this game

1961
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,760
where it does like weird fucked up things

1962
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,440
and has weird attacks and like it's...

1963
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,280
It gets cursed.

1964
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,600
Dude, it literally spews out its organs to attack every turn.

1965
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,440
It's revolting.

1966
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,040
Oh, there's an actual animal like that in real life.

1967
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:54,880
Yeah.

1968
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,160
There's a little mini game you can play

1969
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,320
when you get to this resort hotel where you can like,

1970
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,680
you have to, they basically pay you

1971
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,280
to chuck Pu-Ku-Mu's back into the sea.

1972
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,120
Yeah.

1973
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,280
You just walk around the beach picking up Pu-Ku-Mu's

1974
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,680
and throwing them back into the ocean.

1975
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,440
Sadly, there's no animation for it.

1976
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,480
Excuse me, trainer.

1977
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,320
There are Pu-Ku-Mu's horrifying our beach goers.

1978
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,640
We would appreciate it if you could get them

1979
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,960
the fuck out of here.

1980
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,240
It said that people trip over them, so.

1981
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,080
Oh, God.

1982
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,720
Just imagine like tripping and like falling

1983
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,480
on a sack of organs and it bursting in your face.

1984
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,320
Oh, God!

1985
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,480
Ah!

1986
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,600
Hey, was it Barakamon that has the episode at the beach

1987
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,680
where they like grab sea cucumbers

1988
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,440
and they like squirt their gross white in it all over?

1989
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,280
Yeah.

1990
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,120
I believe that's the one.

1991
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,960
What kind of a defense mechanism is that?

1992
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,160
Who does that?

1993
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,280
Oh, whatever.

1994
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,120
Oh, yeah, it was Barakamon.

1995
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,480
I mean, don't ask me.

1996
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,320
Barakamon?

1997
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,160
Yeah.

1998
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,480
Yeah.

1999
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,480
One of the only animes I've ever seen.

2000
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,080
I don't think I have any particularly Pokemon I disliked.

2001
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,360
I will say that I did like that Meteor Pokemon a lot.

2002
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,600
I wish that had a chance to use them in my team,

2003
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,280
but I just got so frustrated by his self-destruction.

2004
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,600
But I like that guy a lot.

2005
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,440
His design is cool.

2006
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,920
He's a Meteor boy.

2007
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,800
Awesome.

2008
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,480
I was like Bruxish.

2009
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,000
Wait, which one's Bruxish?

2010
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,560
Bruxish is the idiot's fucking fish.

2011
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,280
That ugly ass fucking di-dive monstrosity.

2012
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,640
It's uglier than wishy-washy?

2013
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,160
It is uglier than wishy-washy, by the way.

2014
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,000
Hey, you know what?

2015
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,840
I'm trying.

2016
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,680
Did you see it's like...

2017
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,240
I have absolutely no idea what any of you

2018
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,120
have been saying about these Pokemon.

2019
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,120
Because most of them are like,

2020
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,040
most of them you won't even fucking see.

2021
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,240
Like so many of the new Pokemon never even show up.

2022
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,880
Guys, look at the shiny of Bruxish.

2023
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,240
Hey, he looks cool.

2024
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,920
No, he's fucking ugly.

2025
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,440
Another pick for my favorite is a cutie fly in Rybon.

2026
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,280
Those guys are really great.

2027
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,680
Yeah, cutie fly is great.

2028
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,560
You know what this Bruxish reminds me of the game

2029
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,160
Amazing Island, where you make your own monsters

2030
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,200
to do mini games with?

2031
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,280
It looks like something a child would make.

2032
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,720
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2033
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,440
It looks like something that my fucking brother,

2034
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,200
when he was eight, would have made an Amazing Island.

2035
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,120
By the way, guys, here's a substantive point

2036
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,160
about something that I love about this game.

2037
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,800
And it is by making the transition of Pokemon to 3D

2038
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,600
and adding something like the Pokemon interaction thing,

2039
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,880
refresh or whatever, and the petting stuff,

2040
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,840
what that's done is it's forced Game Freak

2041
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,880
to add more personality to their Pokemon

2042
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,400
than would have been visible before.

2043
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,920
Like what I said before about how the Drake,

2044
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,320
Drake, the Grass Starter Final Evolution,

2045
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,080
how it pulls its little things.

2046
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,240
City-wise.

2047
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,480
Yeah, yeah, just city-wise, that's right.

2048
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,960
How it pulls the leaves to shrink its hoodie self.

2049
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,360
Like having something like the Pokemon refresh thing

2050
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,480
that lets you interact with them personally

2051
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,960
and having a 3D model that can do these extra animations

2052
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,920
way easier than a sprite would be animated to do,

2053
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,240
it lets you learn things about the Pokemon

2054
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,200
and the way they act and more details about them.

2055
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,040
And I think that is great.

2056
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,880
I do like that.

2057
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,520
In White 2, I was really,

2058
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,120
I really liked when I encountered a Jolteon

2059
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,600
and it's animation, it has like a really fast animation.

2060
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,720
Like it's just sitting there,

2061
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,200
but it's like jittering back and forth really fast.

2062
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,280
Yeah, it's personality.

2063
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,440
In the old games that they never could have done that,

2064
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,080
but the fact that like it had better graphics

2065
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,400
and this one, it gives it this weird movement

2066
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,040
that like really gives it more.

2067
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,080
Yeah, I do really like that stuff.

2068
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,440
One thing I've noticed about the models in particular,

2069
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:33,200
the first gen one is that they're exactly the same

2070
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,120
as the ones you can see in Pokemon Go,

2071
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,440
which is pretty cool.

2072
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,560
Are they the exact same models?

2073
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,560
Yeah, I've checked a lot of them, they're all the same.

2074
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,960
Oh, that's, I have no problem with that.

2075
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,080
They definitely have a standard 3D model

2076
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,760
that they're using henceforth.

2077
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,600
Cool.

2078
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,920
Cool.

2079
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,600
Part of the reason I really like Pokemon Go

2080
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,720
is just being able to look at a Pokemon in 3D

2081
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,960
and tap them and make them do a funny thing.

2082
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,240
And it's like you can do that in this game

2083
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,720
and it's just good.

2084
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,480
I like that.

2085
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,320
I'm good.

2086
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,040
Oh.

2087
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,360
So anyone have any other topics regarding the sun and moon?

2088
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,200
They want to talk.

2089
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,040
I have one.

2090
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,280
I have some way of do ranting I could do.

2091
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,920
Monkey, you go ahead.

2092
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,440
Okay, okay, listen boys.

2093
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,360
I don't want to stay on this too long.

2094
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,960
It boys ain't girl.

2095
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,640
But here's the thing.

2096
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,520
Mage, I just met you, nothing against you.

2097
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,120
But otherwise, the only person here who I like is Hippocrite.

2098
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,560
I don't give the fuck about the rest of it.

2099
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,400
Right, sure.

2100
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,040
So Hippocrite, I need to know.

2101
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,960
This is your Spider-Man in the Civil War moment.

2102
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,320
Are you team Ben Saint or team Monkey?

2103
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,000
I need a definitive answer.

2104
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,480
Right fucking now.

2105
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,320
Yeah, me too.

2106
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,160
You know what?

2107
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,000
Uh-oh.

2108
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,520
I don't know.

2109
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,000
I'm rooting for both of you

2110
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,920
because I haven't seen your first battle.

2111
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,240
I don't know.

2112
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,080
I don't know.

2113
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,600
The world hasn't seen it.

2114
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,480
Hippo, Hippo, by trying to please both of us,

2115
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,560
you've pleased neither of us.

2116
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,400
That's true.

2117
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,240
You're now under your worst.

2118
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,040
Hippo, you're shunned from being untimely.

2119
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,680
I'm throwing you under the bus.

2120
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,880
Let me make an educated decision.

2121
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,320
No, no, I won't allow that.

2122
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,520
Let's see who wins the first battle so we can play it.

2123
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,680
Oh, okay, this is the stronger party.

2124
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,040
You've got to go with the stronger side.

2125
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,680
You've got to choose now for your decision to mean everything.

2126
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,680
Based on your videos,

2127
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,600
I think

2128
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,840
it's going to be Momke.

2129
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,680
Yeah!

2130
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,520
Oh, no!

2131
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,840
Fuck you, Ben.

2132
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,680
Oh, my God.

2133
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:32,280
I just enjoy the chipper attitude.

2134
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,120
Yeah.

2135
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:33,960
Oh, wow, Ben.

2136
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,800
I can be chipper.

2137
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,640
Wait.

2138
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,920
I feel the opposite.

2139
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,720
I felt like Ben was way more chipper,

2140
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:44,000
whereas Momke, at least in the first three,

2141
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,920
was like, oh, this game is not friendly to Nuzlocs.

2142
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,160
I can't get enough Pokemon.

2143
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah, you know what?

2144
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,840
I don't know.

2145
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,440
I actually can't remember anything

2146
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,080
that I've seen in my review videos.

2147
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,840
I guess you have to have a chipper off

2148
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,560
so that the most chipper will gain my affection.

2149
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,000
We'll put you both into a wood chipper

2150
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,680
and whoever crawls out is the winner.

2151
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,840
Yeah, let's go fargo up in here.

2152
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,680
No, I'm on Team Momke.

2153
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,000
Well, Ben, we know that your goal is to enslave,

2154
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,240
you know, dominate all the Pokemon.

2155
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,280
Momke, do you have any goal of this nature?

2156
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,320
Are you just trying to be the best boy you can be?

2157
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,720
Yeah, my goal was to dominate all the Pokemon, too.

2158
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,240
OK, so it's a real clash of the superpowers here.

2159
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,720
But Momke's doing it sexually.

2160
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,720
Yeah, baby.

2161
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,720
I'm tempted to.

2162
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,200
I had like a little weeaboo revelation

2163
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,520
in the course of this conversation,

2164
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,280
but I don't think anybody will know.

2165
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,000
Nobody will know what I'm talking about.

2166
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,880
So I will only do it if you guys give a proof.

2167
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,160
Throw it out there. I want to hear it.

2168
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,120
I just want. OK, I go for it.

2169
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,840
All right, well, there's this.

2170
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,440
Actually, Ben, you'll know what I'm talking about

2171
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,000
because you've seen this show.

2172
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,120
The anime series Katana Gattari.

2173
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,200
Katana Gattari is a show about like there's 12 different

2174
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,160
like guys who all are like they have a special sword

2175
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,000
and they're all like crazy weird designs.

2176
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,320
And each one is like you there's like some kind of weird way

2177
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,280
that the main character has to fight them in order to,

2178
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,920
you know, to get their sword.

2179
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,440
And they're all these like really different,

2180
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,200
interesting types of fights.

2181
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,120
And the guy who did the character designs

2182
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,560
for Katana Gattari like I think did like the designs

2183
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,160
for this game because I was saying, man,

2184
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,880
the characters in this really look like Katana Gattari.

2185
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,200
They're all like weird hairstyles

2186
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,040
and really out there stuff.

2187
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,840
And then someone told me, yeah, that the character designer,

2188
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,720
his name shows up twice in the credits.

2189
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,880
And I was like, oh, shit, he actually worked on it.

2190
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,040
Then I thought about it.

2191
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,840
And the way that the trials are in this game

2192
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,440
where each one is like a really unique,

2193
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,600
different kind of way to get your stone

2194
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,760
is kind of like Katana Gattari.

2195
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,280
And then the entire Aether Foundation plot

2196
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,000
is just literally the story of Kill, Lock, Kill,

2197
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,880
like exactly the same story.

2198
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,760
So this game is basically Katana Gattari

2199
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,240
and Kill, Lock, Kill combined.

2200
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,920
You know, okay.

2201
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,360
Sure, that's reasonable.

2202
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,200
But you know what?

2203
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,360
Katana Gattari was very disappointing.

2204
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,360
It was.

2205
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,000
I disagree.

2206
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,920
Though it was like more talky than I would have liked to be.

2207
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,320
Well, of course it's talky.

2208
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,400
Dude, the ending was the fucking best thing that ever happened.

2209
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,400
The last episode was pure orgasm.

2210
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,720
That last episode made me want to kill myself.

2211
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,560
I hated it more than anything in the world.

2212
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,400
Just tell me why.

2213
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,720
Real quick, why?

2214
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,120
Dude, I have a 4,000 word post on my blog about that,

2215
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,280
if you want to read.

2216
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,920
Sum it up in five words, did you?

2217
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,320
Just tell me why.

2218
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,240
Gay, gay, gay, nigger dick.

2219
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:37,520
The final fight up the tower was fine.

2220
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,160
It was the girls.

2221
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,240
That was terrible too.

2222
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,080
I don't know, whatever.

2223
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,400
It was the girls.

2224
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,440
Guys, guys, guys, let's keep on topic.

2225
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,600
No, I don't want to say that it was the girls.

2226
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,360
Get away from the anime.

2227
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,200
Shut up.

2228
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,680
It was the girl being like, yes, I was only,

2229
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,280
I only, I tricked myself into loving you

2230
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,000
as a part of my scheme to use you.

2231
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,560
I didn't care about that at all.

2232
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,880
I didn't care about that.

2233
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,120
But okay, I did have something Pokemon related about that.

2234
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,120
Wait, I just want to make a note

2235
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,600
that the Ben St. Army and the Ben St. Fascist regime

2236
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,840
coming to a store near you takes a hard line stance

2237
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,240
against human Pokemon sexual relations.

2238
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,480
I take the exact opposite stance.

2239
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,280
I knew, I thought so.

2240
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:28,720
You know, Ben, I was about to say that I am

2241
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,960
I'm very against that and I won't allow it.

2242
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,160
I'm going to have my own, I need a Magi-Chan to monitor

2243
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,400
How do you all feel about the whole of being

2244
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,000
a Pokedex occurring?

2245
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,520
How do you feel about there now being

2246
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,480
a dominatrix Pokemon?

2247
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,320
Is there?

2248
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,160
Who's that?

2249
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,000
There's a Pokemon called Serena.

2250
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,840
It's the final.

2251
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,160
Oh yeah.

2252
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,000
Of whatever.

2253
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,960
It literally is just like a dominatrix.

2254
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,480
I was hoping you were going to say it was

2255
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,360
the Alolan form of Mr. Mime.

2256
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,120
Ben, I was going to say, Ben,

2257
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,240
that I'm going to put my flag down

2258
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,600
and say that I am firmly on Team Ben St.

2259
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,160
But this sexual relations clause has blown out.

2260
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:11,120
Oh no, I'm driving away my core constituency.

2261
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,040
The fact that no one still exists, Ben,

2262
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,080
means that I can never adopt this philosophy.

2263
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,160
So you're done.

2264
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,000
You're done for all time.

2265
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,720
Are you on Team Humpty then, Nate?

2266
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,760
I have no choice.

2267
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,600
It's the only option.

2268
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,680
I'm firmly on Team Humpty.

2269
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,640
You're all sinners.

2270
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,840
I got you're own fucking brother, dude.

2271
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,160
Sinners!

2272
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,840
You did this to yourself, Ben.

2273
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,760
You made your bed.

2274
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,600
Okay, by the way, substantive point,

2275
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,760
by the way, I was going to say,

2276
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,560
I hated every single trial.

2277
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,400
I think gyms being sacrificed for trials

2278
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,600
was a huge mistake.

2279
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,960
Why did you hate the trials?

2280
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:40,800
The trials?

2281
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,600
See, well, okay, let me respond to that.

2282
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,920
Okay, the trials already,

2283
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,600
or the gyms before, they were the battles,

2284
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,200
but they also had like a puzzle,

2285
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,480
some of which were really dumb.

2286
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,720
So it seems like the trials are kind of just like the puzzle

2287
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:57,200
that used to just be incorporated into the gym.

2288
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,680
Yeah, only with random battles, so.

2289
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,000
The trials I've seen so far.

2290
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,240
I did the thing where you have to find the Zangus,

2291
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,960
or not the Zangus, the young Goose.

2292
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,320
It was pretty minimal.

2293
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,160
It didn't bother me that much.

2294
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,680
It was kind of dumb, but whatever.

2295
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,160
I know that there's one, or the one in the demo,

2296
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,840
and I feel like there's probably one coming up

2297
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,320
that involves the Pokefinder,

2298
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,920
and I hate the Pokefinder.

2299
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,320
Nope, never have to use it.

2300
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,160
Oh, thank God.

2301
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,160
The young Goose one is like the most.

2302
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,000
In the demo you had to use.

2303
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,760
I think the young Goose one took the longest

2304
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,440
out of like any of the trials.

2305
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,160
Well, that are like the grass one.

2306
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,480
They're all like the grass one.

2307
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,720
You can think that the trials,

2308
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,520
you just have to chase it down the normal ones.

2309
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,320
You have to go to the holes and find them in their holes,

2310
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,320
and then you gotta get those.

2311
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,320
For me, that's a Redditor one.

2312
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,160
Oh, really?

2313
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,560
Yeah, yeah, it's different between Sun and Moon.

2314
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:42,880
Ah, interesting.

2315
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,080
Well, okay, you can find them inoffensive.

2316
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,440
I didn't really hate them.

2317
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,760
Yeah, I agree with Ben.

2318
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,200
They kind of felt like the puzzles from gyms

2319
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,560
that I also didn't give a shit about,

2320
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,960
and could do without, frankly.

2321
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,800
But that still leaves you with what I consider a big loss,

2322
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,800
and that is,

2323
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,520
the lead up of fighting all the elementally,

2324
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,320
or the type-themed trainers in one condensed space,

2325
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,200
and then lead up to a big gym fight,

2326
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,320
because one of the most valuable things about that,

2327
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,160
in my opinion, is that it does what Digi said,

2328
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,560
or what Digi was talking about before,

2329
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:14,000
and it encourages you to switch up

2330
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,840
the Pokemon they're using,

2331
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,320
because you know that you'll want a certain Pokemon

2332
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,320
with a certain type to be used for that gym currently,

2333
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,320
with the way you work with trials.

2334
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,320
I don't think that, I don't think that's the case.

2335
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,320
I don't think that, I didn't feel that pressure at all.

2336
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,320
The different trials have different types of Pokemon anyway,

2337
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,320
so you change the moves anyway.

2338
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,320
Dude, just tell me,

2339
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,480
did you really feel a sense of satisfaction

2340
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,240
clearing a trial versus beating a gym?

2341
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,240
Because I felt it was way less.

2342
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,080
Yeah, I felt it was exactly the same.

2343
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,080
I don't care about gyms.

2344
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,920
I had more fun, honestly.

2345
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,080
This isn't about fun, Mage.

2346
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,240
It's about extracting as much percentage of gratification

2347
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,240
as you can.

2348
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,240
I mean, it's satisfying to beat a book.

2349
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,240
It's fun.

2350
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,520
Yeah, I thought the trials were,

2351
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,840
I thought all of them were cool.

2352
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,240
I like how they were so unique from one another.

2353
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,760
And the trial Pokemon are harder than gym leaders,

2354
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,160
because with gym leaders,

2355
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,240
you only have to fight one Pokemon at a time,

2356
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,040
and in this, you have to fight two.

2357
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,400
Well, like I said, I don't dislike the totem battles.

2358
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,640
I think the totem battles are fine,

2359
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,440
but you have to admit, there is something lost here.

2360
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,200
Like, the way that gyms work is the only thing

2361
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,040
I thought was, sorry, Hippo.

2362
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:19,040
Well, for me, the thing that is lost is the trainers,

2363
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,560
but I don't care really about the trainers.

2364
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:26,280
I guess I missed that a little bit, but it's not.

2365
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,240
I think there was a simultaneous gain and loss

2366
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,080
in the trial areas versus the gyms,

2367
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:34,320
because on the one hand, I thought the gyms,

2368
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,760
there's a lot more memorable ones.

2369
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,440
In X and Y, there's one where you fucking swing

2370
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,800
across these vines and you're climbing this tower

2371
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,440
to go fight a grass guy.

2372
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,200
There's one where you're navigating a spider's web

2373
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,560
to go fight the bug guy.

2374
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,400
There's nothing in this game that's like that.

2375
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,440
There's something that's so different and out there

2376
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,920
that it really sticks out.

2377
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,200
But on the other hand,

2378
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,560
going to fight the first kahuna is just like,

2379
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,440
I just went into his hut and fought him.

2380
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,280
But on the other hand, with the trial areas,

2381
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,000
they are places you can go back to

2382
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,520
and they're actually integrated into the world

2383
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,640
and they feel more like a part of the world

2384
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,560
whereas the gyms are just these totally isolated things

2385
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,560
that have nothing to do with the rest of the game.

2386
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,880
Well, yeah, but they're sitting that way.

2387
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,840
It's not like that's out of place, they're done.

2388
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,080
But both the gyms and the elite four

2389
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,520
are kind of like that in the other games

2390
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,720
where it's just like you just kind of show up at a place

2391
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,160
where it's like, okay, now it's time

2392
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,200
to just have this radically different experience.

2393
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,920
Whereas in this game, all of the captains

2394
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,640
are like introduced way beforehand.

2395
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,840
You already know who they are.

2396
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,480
Well, I'll just say that experience was, in my opinion,

2397
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,240
the best part of Pokemon games.

2398
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,680
So obviously for me, I'm not going to like that.

2399
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,480
In Gen five, at least,

2400
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,320
like I know in white two, like the champion

2401
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,680
and like previous champions and the elite four

2402
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,480
and the gym leaders, they will,

2403
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,040
I think it's mostly in the post-game,

2404
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,160
but like they show up and like you encounter them,

2405
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,920
like if you go to fight in the Pokemon World Tournament,

2406
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,360
the gym leaders and the elite four

2407
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,240
will be your opponent sometime.

2408
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,080
And there's like a place, I think they like,

2409
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,080
I think some of them like rents-

2410
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,680
I think that's why I did that with the battle shateau.

2411
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,000
Like they rent summer homes in Undellatown, I think,

2412
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,800
or at least one of them like has a summer home

2413
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,600
in Undellatown and like they kind of do things

2414
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,840
around the world.

2415
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,200
This isn't the first game to have the gym leaders

2416
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,280
sort of be more integrated into like the workings

2417
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,360
of the world, but it is definitely feels,

2418
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,960
I feel like they pushed it a lot more,

2419
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,760
kind of like I feel the way that they pushed like Pokemon

2420
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,440
as a part of daily life.

2421
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,280
Yeah, sure.

2422
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,120
Ride Pokemon.

2423
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,480
Let me just tell you, like, I mean,

2424
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,680
when you first meet Elima,

2425
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,000
I wouldn't have even known he was a gym leader.

2426
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,320
It was just like a guy you kind of knew.

2427
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,600
I wouldn't have even known it was a he.

2428
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,440
Yeah.

2429
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,280
Yeah.

2430
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,400
I could tell it still, yeah.

2431
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,920
I could, yeah, same.

2432
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,480
I was lying.

2433
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,960
Well, I mean, I was just gonna say,

2434
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,120
my favorite part of any Pokemon game ever

2435
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,840
is in Heart, Gold, and Soul, Silver

2436
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,320
at the end of the game in the post game

2437
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:03,280
where you can track down each gym leader

2438
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,920
that you fought, of which there are 16.

2439
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,680
You can break into the house and kill them.

2440
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,520
That's right.

2441
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,400
You can follow, it's incredibly complex to get them all,

2442
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,440
but there is one house where you can gather

2443
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,720
every single Pokemon trainer, every single gym leader,

2444
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,760
and then you can fight them, not as they were before,

2445
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,720
because if the first gym leader you fight

2446
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,520
is the flying guy who has two pieces of shit flying types,

2447
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,400
they do nothing, they're level five or whatever,

2448
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,800
but here, he's got a team of six guys,

2449
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,480
they're all maxed out.

2450
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,560
The best team you could possibly have

2451
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,040
for a flying type gym leader,

2452
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,120
fighting each of those guys and beating them

2453
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:37,040
is the best experience of any Pokemon ever

2454
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,520
because it's fun.

2455
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,760
Nothing is cooler than theming a Pokemon team

2456
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,400
around one elements and then strategizing how to fight it

2457
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,240
and like, oh, what am I gonna do?

2458
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,440
He's gonna counter me with this.

2459
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,960
It's the best, it's the best.

2460
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,280
And I definitely feel like with the de-emphasis of gyms

2461
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,960
in general and the fact you don't even fight

2462
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,320
some gym leaders, that's de-emphasized.

2463
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,600
So my only point is that, yeah, this thing,

2464
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,960
I really like it and it wasn't as big a part of this game.

2465
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,400
So, all right, we can move on from that anyway.

2466
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,000
Hey guys, I think I have a question

2467
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,680
we should have probably asked at the very beginning.

2468
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,120
Which version of the game you have

2469
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,840
and which starter did you start with?

2470
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,680
Just curious.

2471
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:14,920
Oh, well, I, Ben Sainz, got sun

2472
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,960
and I got a Goose the Rowlet.

2473
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:21,160
So, real quick, before we move on from that topic though,

2474
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,520
I'm looking into it and you can indeed fight

2475
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,040
most of the trial captains again.

2476
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:30,080
Like, if you go back to where they were,

2477
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,260
you can fight them for real.

2478
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,480
Well, that's great.

2479
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,160
That's exactly what I was hoping would happen.

2480
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,520
So that's good on it, good on the sun and moon.

2481
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,720
Though I would really wonder why it isn't all.

2482
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,560
I know in white too, you could,

2483
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,880
there was like secondary fights for all the gym leaders

2484
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,000
and stuff after you became champion.

2485
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,560
Fantastic, couldn't be happier.

2486
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,920
That's exactly the sort of thing I want Pokemon to do

2487
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,680
every single time, never deviate from that.

2488
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,840
Because the thing, Pokemon rewards you,

2489
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,920
the thing that feels the best about playing Pokemon,

2490
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,080
at least to me, is big climactic battles

2491
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,320
where you're pushed to stress and strategize

2492
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,800
and it's even more fun when they're themed

2493
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,680
around a certain type and then winning.

2494
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,240
You feel great, you get like a badge

2495
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,040
that's designated for that thing.

2496
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,880
It's the best.

2497
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,960
It's the best thing Pokemon has to offer.

2498
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,880
Let's go back to the mage question.

2499
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:21,720
Yeah, please.

2500
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,880
Well, I got Pokemon moon and I got the Snoopy Clown boy.

2501
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:28,720
Snoopy Clown.

2502
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,040
Are you talking about?

2503
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,240
Ah, Paulio.

2504
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,080
Oh, right.

2505
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:32,920
He's not.

2506
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,760
He's not Clio.

2507
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,840
He's not Clio.

2508
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,280
Hey, he's not Clio.

2509
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,920
I'm same as Gibbon.

2510
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,080
I also got moon and I got Poplio.

2511
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,280
I'm exactly the same as you guys.

2512
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,280
Oh, that's crazy.

2513
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,720
I got sun and I picked Rowlet

2514
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,440
because he's objectively the best.

2515
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,840
Yeah, we're sun, Rowlet boys.

2516
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,080
Yeah, we are, all right.

2517
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,480
And we're moon.

2518
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,800
All three of us.

2519
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,640
Nobody likes cats.

2520
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,920
No one picked Litten, yeah.

2521
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,760
Yeah.

2522
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,880
You know, Litten's first form is indeed dope.

2523
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:00,720
I like Litten.

2524
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,880
I was on team Litten until I saw his third evolution

2525
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,280
and then I just abandoned him immediately.

2526
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,720
Some people like it.

2527
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,680
I like it because he's a wrestler,

2528
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,480
but he doesn't, it's stupid.

2529
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,320
He's still ugly.

2530
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,640
Tony the Tiger sort of bullshit.

2531
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,160
Yeah, like I've said this so many times

2532
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,720
to so many people, I like the theme.

2533
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,040
I think it's cool that he's a wrestler,

2534
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,000
but I just hate that how he looks.

2535
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,960
I gotta say, I kind of regretted getting sun.

2536
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,640
Not that, I mean, I would have got it anyways

2537
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,560
because I always picked like the red one.

2538
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,320
It's like a nostalgia thing.

2539
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,600
But I found out only after having played

2540
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,240
through the whole game that they're on different clocks

2541
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,960
that in moon, it's like everything's time

2542
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,480
of adjusted 12 hours from where you currently are.

2543
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,680
So like it's always night at day and day at night.

2544
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,240
And I was like, this would have been a huge help for me

2545
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,520
because I only played in the fucking, you know,

2546
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,560
in the AMs, like just staying up all night.

2547
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,080
And so I actually had to change my in-game clock in sun

2548
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,400
so that I could catch daytime Pokemon.

2549
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,400
Well, wouldn't you have had to do it

2550
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,760
the opposite way to catch nighttime Pokemon?

2551
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,880
I don't know that there are a lot of nighttime Pokemon,

2552
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,720
maybe.

2553
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,200
Yeah, wherever.

2554
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,880
Radita, it's very important.

2555
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,080
There would have been more nighttime Pokemon in Pokemon.

2556
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,280
The most important Pokemon.

2557
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,160
Alola Ratata.

2558
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,000
Alola Ratata.

2559
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,200
What a wonderful mon.

2560
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,360
Alola Ratata.

2561
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,600
Someone fill in for me.

2562
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,720
Eight, no.

2563
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,440
My Android dog.

2564
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,120
Queens, no worries for the rest of your days.

2565
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,720
Kahoola Matata.

2566
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,440
All right, Kahoola Matata.

2567
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,160
So are we going to go ahead and say

2568
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,840
that this is just a Pokemon Sun and Moon podcast?

2569
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,600
Yeah, I think we've abandoned.

2570
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:54,040
Well, I mean, if we do a general Pokemon podcast,

2571
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,200
it would be also hours long.

2572
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,480
That would take 50 hours.

2573
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,080
So we can do that either as a separate thing.

2574
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,920
It was funny because I didn't think,

2575
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,320
I thought we wouldn't end up talking about Sun and Moon

2576
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,800
that much because almost no one's played much.

2577
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,280
I mean, we beat it, but.

2578
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,760
I mean, all right, what is there to talk about?

2579
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,720
Sun and Moon has rendered all the other Pokemon games obsolete.

2580
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,920
They don't matter anymore.

2581
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:16,760
No, no.

2582
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:17,760
It's as though they never were.

2583
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,200
We have to go back.

2584
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,400
We have to remember.

2585
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,320
We've got to make Pokemon great again.

2586
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,480
Yeah, we just have to keep the good, improve the bad.

2587
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,080
Who said that Kukui was the sexiest professor?

2588
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,600
The sexiest professor is Professor Willow from Pokemon Go.

2589
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:39,480
Hey, Pokemon Go, that doesn't fucking count.

2590
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,520
No, I'm just kidding.

2591
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,880
Can you talk about how much I hate Pokemon Go

2592
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:43,720
before we end this thing?

2593
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,520
Yeah, please, yeah, tell me about how much you hate Pokemon Go.

2594
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,560
Pokemon Go is the greatest.

2595
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,880
Pokemon Go fucking sucks because I live in Iowa.

2596
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,200
Oh, yeah.

2597
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:55,080
It's fucking, the farmhouse doesn't count as a stop.

2598
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,400
I have tried so hard to enjoy Pokemon Go

2599
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,200
and at many times I have succeeded,

2600
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:04,000
but they just keep making it worse with every update.

2601
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,800
They keep making their own game worse on purpose

2602
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,800
over and over again.

2603
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,160
Ben was having such a great time.

2604
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,440
He was telling us all these stories

2605
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,760
and it's only, it's only good.

2606
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:15,080
For the first week, for the first,

2607
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,560
well, I mean, when I play it,

2608
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,000
now how I play it is when I go somewhere,

2609
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,640
I get in the car, I boot it up,

2610
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,720
and then when I get out of the car,

2611
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,400
I look around and see if there's anything to catch.

2612
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,400
If there is, I catch it,

2613
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,000
and that's how I play Pokemon Go.

2614
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,440
In the first week that it was out,

2615
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,680
there was the beautiful thing,

2616
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:33,960
there was a tracking system

2617
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:36,560
that would let you actually track down a Pokemon.

2618
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,320
Like you could see where it was

2619
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,800
and it would give you a good idea

2620
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,320
of like where to go to find it.

2621
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:43,480
And I was like walking around neighborhoods.

2622
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:46,040
I was walking into like parking lots and stuff.

2623
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:46,920
I was going like-

2624
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,600
Children's playgrounds.

2625
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,040
Yeah, I was going like-

2626
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,800
Hearing in their windows at night.

2627
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:55,600
I was sneaking onto private property

2628
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,240
and trying to fucking find these Pokemon.

2629
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,440
It was the most fun I ever had.

2630
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,280
It was fucking amazing.

2631
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,840
Me and my friends went to Tufts University

2632
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,080
and we ran, we would spread out.

2633
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,600
We'd be like, oh shit, a hitmoanly.

2634
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,920
And we would spread out and when someone saw the radar

2635
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,680
like go down from three steps to two,

2636
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,960
they'd be like, it's this way.

2637
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,920
And we'd all run that direction.

2638
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,040
Like we would all go converge on them.

2639
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,800
It was like the greatest thing.

2640
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,880
And then a week after it came out,

2641
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,800
they took that feature out and they never put it back

2642
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,600
because they just don't want it.

2643
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,760
Because they're like, oh no,

2644
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,840
that's not how you're supposed to play our game.

2645
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,880
You're not supposed to be able to find the Pokemon.

2646
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,560
You're only supposed to catch the ones

2647
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,520
that you randomly happened to stumble across.

2648
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,960
Wasn't the excuse that it was too much

2649
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,080
of like a maintenance server issue thing?

2650
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,280
They never said that.

2651
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:46,400
That is what fucking assholes on the Reddit said.

2652
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,000
They were trying to think of excuses for the company.

2653
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
No, there's no way-

2654
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,160
I think maybe it's because they didn't want people

2655
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,480
sneaking onto private property all the time.

2656
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,880
Yeah, well, fuck them.

2657
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,640
Or flooding those heads.

2658
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,960
That's not the game I want.

2659
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,600
The game I want is not one that discourages me

2660
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,240
from doing such things.

2661
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,560
It was the most important one ever.

2662
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,560
The only good thing to come from Pokemon Go

2663
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,120
was the great Hippocrite video you can find in the description.

2664
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,120
Go click on the link right now.

2665
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,720
Give it a big ol' like, subscribe.

2666
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,560
And playing the season.

2667
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,360
I'm going to remember to put that in the description.

2668
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,160
Maybe someone will say in the comments.

2669
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,400
I'll put it in the comments.

2670
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,920
Hippo, that was a really good video.

2671
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,320
And I didn't even know the reference and I still liked it.

2672
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,440
I'm curious, Gib.

2673
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,920
How have you managed to enjoy Pokemon Go

2674
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,080
despite all these deficits?

2675
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,040
Well, the first thing was I wasn't around

2676
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,000
at the very beginning when everyone was-

2677
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,840
When it was good.

2678
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,640
So you don't know what you've lost, yeah.

2679
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:39,960
Well, I mean, there was the tracker,

2680
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,840
but I didn't have a group of friends to play with.

2681
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,360
And I never felt like going to track Pokemon.

2682
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,440
I was just so like, well, there's a Pidgey.

2683
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:49,360
I haven't got a Pidgey yet.

2684
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,760
I'll go get that.

2685
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,320
Tracking things, I didn't really,

2686
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,000
I mean, I live in a suburban area and there's not a,

2687
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,440
there weren't a lot of spawns around.

2688
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,800
Recently, they've upped spawns in general

2689
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,160
in lower spawn areas.

2690
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,080
So it's more tolerable now,

2691
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,360
but I didn't use the track to its fullest extent.

2692
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:09,520
So I don't know, I don't really know what I've lost.

2693
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,560
We had a good time playing Pokemon Go all day.

2694
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,520
Oh yeah, we went to London.

2695
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,360
We got a bunch of Gengar, it was great.

2696
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:17,200
Where was mine?

2697
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:19,560
We also got the Charmander nest, remember?

2698
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,400
Oh yeah.

2699
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,600
Yeah, I went there with my brother.

2700
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,680
Right next to Buckingham Palace is a fucking Charmander.

2701
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:25,880
It's probably changed now,

2702
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,720
but there's fucking Charmander everywhere.

2703
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,880
But the reason that I am still having fun with it

2704
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:34,080
is because I don't have that too many things to catch,

2705
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,520
but I do have a lot of walking to do.

2706
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,880
I have a lot of eggs to hatch

2707
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,040
and I have a lot of candy to get.

2708
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,400
Hippo, part of your involvement with that game,

2709
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,880
wasn't it because you don't generally like the Pokemon games?

2710
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,760
And this was like one that's not a Pokemon game?

2711
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,840
I liked it because I generally,

2712
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,480
I mean, I'd been playing the Nuzlocke

2713
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:55,280
because Ben played the Nuzlocke

2714
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,840
because Monkey played the Nuzlocke.

2715
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,720
I wanted to give it a go.

2716
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,120
And I decided, I realized I don't actually like

2717
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
the battling in Pokemon.

2718
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,280
Oh yeah, I forgot your deep hatred

2719
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,120
of all the Pokemon.

2720
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,280
Why haven't we touched on that?

2721
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,240
Let's get that debate going.

2722
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:12,040
The battling in this Pokemon moon's been great, so.

2723
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,680
Talk about a hypocrite.

2724
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:17,760
Wait, were you just complaining about moon

2725
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,280
and how it was the worst game ever, like an hour ago?

2726
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,600
No, that was because I was trying to catch a Phoebus,

2727
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,280
but I caught it.

2728
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,360
Oh, hey, I just remembered about how in battles,

2729
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,440
they show you what your moves are gonna do

2730
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,320
and that's bullshit.

2731
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,480
That's casualization.

2732
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,720
No, it's awesome.

2733
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,720
No, it's the best thing that's ever happened.

2734
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,040
It's great.

2735
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,320
The fact that you like it is what makes it casualization.

2736
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,160
Yeah, that's right.

2737
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,000
I don't know how to put them straight.

2738
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,080
It doesn't feel like attaching items to his Pokemon.

2739
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,720
It's definitely casualization,

2740
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,880
but I don't think that's a bad thing.

2741
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:48,720
Okay, but think about it.

2742
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,640
I don't like it, but I can live with it.

2743
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,640
Dude, just think about it.

2744
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,200
So many times this has happened to me.

2745
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:55,840
I've been playing through this game and like,

2746
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,240
okay, all these Pokemon, yeah,

2747
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,000
like I don't even think about what they are.

2748
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,840
Just look at my moves.

2749
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,680
It's gonna be strong.

2750
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,520
I use this one.

2751
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,920
What that's done is that when I then find a Pokemon

2752
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,360
that I haven't seen before,

2753
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,640
even if I know what type it is in my head,

2754
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:10,000
I have not trained myself to remember

2755
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,840
what is good against it

2756
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,320
and then I just suffer because I, you know,

2757
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,440
I'm not ready to prepare for the demo.

2758
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,000
It's not, well, yeah, but it's the game

2759
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,760
not leading me to learn.

2760
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,880
I can't remember that perfectly fine.

2761
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:21,840
You can't remember shit.

2762
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,240
What's strong against dark?

2763
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,320
Tell us what's good against dark.

2764
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,160
It was a bug.

2765
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,000
Fighting.

2766
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,600
Because it was like that classic Game Grumps movement.

2767
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,000
The goth kids don't like having bugs on them.

2768
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,640
That's why.

2769
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,000
That's one, but there's not something else

2770
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:37,840
that's good against them.

2771
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,560
I learned typing finally because of this mechanic,

2772
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,200
but there were so many fights I got into

2773
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,680
where like an enemy would show up and I'd be like,

2774
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,680
what the fuck is that?

2775
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,280
Because if you fight it for the first time,

2776
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,640
it doesn't give you the information.

2777
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,440
And usually that was the cause

2778
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,360
of why I would have a team fight.

2779
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,560
Wait, when you fight them the first time,

2780
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,040
it doesn't tell you what's super effective.

2781
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,880
No, it only tells you that if Pokemon

2782
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,440
that are already in your Pokemon decks.

2783
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,280
Well, I like that.

2784
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,120
Then you have C.

2785
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:01,960
You don't have to catch.

2786
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,320
And if you're in a Nuzlocke,

2787
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,080
then that means you can get totally fucked.

2788
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,400
If there's some Pokemon you don't know what it is.

2789
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,560
It's called just knowing what they are, dude.

2790
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,120
You just got to know these things.

2791
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,840
Some Pokemon designs just don't make sense.

2792
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,440
Like, look at Crab Brawler, the Crab Brawler.

2793
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,440
Yeah, I just, I mean, I would expect it to be

2794
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,880
at least a little bit of water,

2795
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,280
but no, it's just pure fighting.

2796
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,520
Yeah, it's just totally fucked me up.

2797
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,080
That's totally thought it would be water.

2798
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,480
Totally meant to mess with you.

2799
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,480
And it knows water attacks too.

2800
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,320
So it totally fucked me.

2801
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:34,120
Oh, like Laurentus, it's pink.

2802
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,880
And it's like, it's based on a bug

2803
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,160
that pretends to be a flower,

2804
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,280
but it's pure grass type.

2805
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,360
It's not even bug grass.

2806
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,800
It's not bug fairy.

2807
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,080
It's just pure grass.

2808
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,280
It makes no sense.

2809
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,880
These are problems to me.

2810
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,800
There's lots of Pokemon that are weird like that.

2811
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,640
Yeah.

2812
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,880
When we talking about Pokemon Go,

2813
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,000
I was trying to say something about,

2814
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,400
all right, I don't like battling.

2815
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,200
Pokemon Go was fun because I could just catch the Pokemon

2816
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:00,040
and not have to battle.

2817
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,360
That was that point.

2818
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:02,960
Let me try and defend.

2819
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,800
The main point I was getting to the whole time ago

2820
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,320
was I like Pokemon Go because it gets me out of the house

2821
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,720
and I like walking around the park every day.

2822
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,720
That's it.

2823
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,600
I think that's the main draw of Pokemon Go.

2824
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,480
See the irony of how Ben plays Pokemon Go

2825
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,720
is that Ben never leaves the house.

2826
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:25,400
He only opens up Pokemon Go when we're already going somewhere

2827
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:29,120
and then becomes entirely consumed by Pokemon Go.

2828
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,880
As though it was a game that he's been playing obsessively

2829
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,240
for the whole time,

2830
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:36,320
but then actually he doesn't even think about it

2831
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,600
until you leave the house

2832
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,560
and then suddenly it's like the only thing

2833
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,560
that matters in the world.

2834
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,480
It's not with Game Freak every single day.

2835
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,560
Ben got out of it.

2836
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,120
We were stopped at a stoplight

2837
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,840
and the light had just turned green

2838
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:48,720
and Ben was like, wait, I see a Gengar.

2839
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,160
He got out of the car.

2840
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,000
Dude, that's a Gengar.

2841
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,120
You got to get out of the car.

2842
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:52,960
Yeah, man.

2843
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,160
You fucking jump out into traffic for a Gengar.

2844
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,200
That's why he's a Gengar.

2845
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,640
He lures people to their death.

2846
01:46:58,640 --> 01:46:59,480
That's canon.

2847
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,640
Yeah, yeah, speaking of Gengar,

2848
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:04,640
I was reading the Sun and Moon Pokedex descriptions of him

2849
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,160
and they're fucking horrible.

2850
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,480
The Sun Pokedex says if you feel a sudden chill,

2851
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:14,040
it means a Gengar is coming for you.

2852
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:16,360
Don't give up.

2853
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,400
You can't run.

2854
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,400
You know what?

2855
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,240
You don't have a sudden chill.

2856
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,600
What if it's just a light breeze?

2857
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,840
No, it's just like if you feel a sudden chill,

2858
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,560
it means a Gengar is coming for you.

2859
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:26,400
You can't escape.

2860
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,720
There's no such thing as a light breeze.

2861
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,160
Is this true, guys,

2862
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,600
that what the Pokedex entries are

2863
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,000
are kind of just the opinions of Rotom?

2864
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,320
He's just like telling you what he thinks

2865
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,920
is going on about these Pokemon.

2866
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,000
He's like making shit up.

2867
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,080
The Pokedex has always been ridiculous.

2868
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,040
Yeah, this game's gone, like, I mean,

2869
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,400
they've always had lots of dark, weird shit,

2870
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,880
but this game's like kind of ramped it up even more.

2871
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,840
When it's in canon described to you

2872
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,280
at the Aether Foundation,

2873
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:56,000
that there are these Pokemon that just destroy Corsulas

2874
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,880
and therefore the sea is lined with bits of Corsula.

2875
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,200
They tell you that.

2876
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,200
And if you get into,

2877
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:05,120
I found out that if you have that Pokemon,

2878
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:06,000
I don't remember which one it is.

2879
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,120
I think it's that new poison thing, but I'm not sure.

2880
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:12,160
But apparently if you get into a doubles battle,

2881
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,400
where like, you know, where Corsula is at low health

2882
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,480
and then it calls for help,

2883
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,400
that Pokemon will come down and it will kill Corsula.

2884
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,240
What? Oh my God!

2885
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,880
I read something similar, like with Carbink and Sableye,

2886
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,600
because now Sableye apparently preys on Carbink,

2887
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,520
so yeah, Carbink.

2888
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,920
That's why he killed him.

2889
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,480
That's why I couldn't catch that fucking asshole.

2890
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,520
Wait, wait.

2891
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,520
I mean, I read that Carbink will summon Sableye.

2892
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,560
Wait, Sableye kills Carbink?

2893
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,720
Apparently.

2894
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,040
Yeah, holy shit.

2895
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,160
They show up because it's low on health

2896
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,000
and then just eat him.

2897
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,240
Oh my fucking God.

2898
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,440
That's insane. That's the coolest thing.

2899
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,440
I thought it was just like a weird recoil thing.

2900
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,800
I didn't pay attention to it, but now that I know,

2901
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,400
Sableye ate him and then I caused a lot of pain.

2902
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:59,680
It's completely redeemed.

2903
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:02,560
It's completely redeemed, the summoning health pun.

2904
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,880
It's still annoying.

2905
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,280
I like it so cool.

2906
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,920
I already liked the fact that sometimes they call for help

2907
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,760
and nothing comes.

2908
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,800
It's sort of like, oh God, they're crying like,

2909
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,160
please don't kill me.

2910
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,320
And it's like no help came.

2911
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,160
All right, that's cool.

2912
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,000
But like, I beat this whole fucking game

2913
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,240
and nothing like this happened.

2914
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:20,440
I didn't, they only summoned more of exactly

2915
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:23,160
what was already there and they never fucking killed each other.

2916
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,480
So fucking game.

2917
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,560
You have to, like, other stuff only starts showing up

2918
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,200
usually if you fought multiple.

2919
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:33,560
The more you kill, the more the weird shit will come up.

2920
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,320
It just sounds like you kind of need to be delivered.

2921
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:37,160
You kind of need to seek the stuff out.

2922
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,480
The first time carving called for help,

2923
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:42,800
Sableye showed up, but I managed to catch the Sableye.

2924
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,160
Maze, didn't you say that a Gyarados showed up

2925
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,560
when you were fighting a Magikarp?

2926
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,600
Yeah, my first Magikarp.

2927
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,400
It's called for help.

2928
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:55,400
Yeah, the very first time I cast the whole...

2929
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,560
The old rod.

2930
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,400
The rod or whatever.

2931
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:58,240
Yeah, the rod.

2932
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,560
Whatever.

2933
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,480
So, and I caught a Magikarp.

2934
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:02,680
I was like, oh, hey, a Magikarp.

2935
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,200
I'm gonna catch it, but then it called for help

2936
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,400
and then the Gyarados came to help it.

2937
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,720
That's badass.

2938
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:12,720
Let me try and defend the fact that it shows you

2939
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,040
the moveset.

2940
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,800
Because like, if it didn't show you the moveset,

2941
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,960
I mean, you would just look it up, right?

2942
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,960
So isn't it just like...

2943
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,800
Well, you should know.

2944
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,640
You should learn.

2945
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,080
You should cut it out of her life.

2946
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,200
Because it's already in your Pokedex.

2947
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,520
Like your character has that information, right?

2948
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,760
Your character has registered this Pokemon

2949
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,040
in their Pokedex and knows what type it is.

2950
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,520
So logically, you should be able to just pop open

2951
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,320
your Pokedex and like quickly reference like,

2952
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,720
oh, this will be super effective against it.

2953
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:43,520
Well, okay, you know what sense in character.

2954
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,040
It's just cutting out the incredible middleman

2955
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,400
of having to fucking constantly look up

2956
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,440
every single thing if you're not...

2957
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,240
Okay, well, here's the thing though.

2958
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:55,120
That's a pretty reasonable point and makes sense to me,

2959
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,240
but like the fact remains,

2960
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,640
it is definitely, you know,

2961
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,760
simplifying the game for you and that that's okay.

2962
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,320
I guess that's not a big problem.

2963
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,560
It does make logical sense.

2964
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,720
But then there's lots of other things like that too.

2965
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,920
Like, and this has been in, I think,

2966
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:10,240
the last game or two, like X and Y before that, I think,

2967
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,760
where like now when you catch a Pokemon,

2968
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,160
your Pokemon still gain it.

2969
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,600
They gain experience from that battle.

2970
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:20,600
And that also makes sense, but the trend here overall

2971
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,880
does feel like they're just trying to make it as easy

2972
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,720
as possible.

2973
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,680
Shut up.

2974
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,520
I worry about that.

2975
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,360
That's stupid.

2976
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:27,200
Well, it's already a problem.

2977
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:30,720
Wait, wait, wait, what you just said was, yeah,

2978
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,200
I was like, here's the thing, here's why it's not bad.

2979
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,920
And you were like, hmm, I agree.

2980
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:36,000
That's not that bad.

2981
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,400
But let me demonstrate how the overall trend is bad

2982
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,120
by giving you another example of something that isn't bad.

2983
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:42,960
But that's true.

2984
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:43,800
Okay, guys, guys.

2985
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,600
Let Mage go, let Mage go.

2986
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,840
Listen, like there's over 700 Pokemon

2987
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:50,440
and you're probably gonna wanna switch out

2988
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,000
between them every now and then.

2989
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,760
So alternate ways of getting more experience

2990
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,120
or knowing which type,

2991
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,680
like because there's so many crazy type things as well,

2992
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,080
the game kinda helping you

2993
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,560
because there's so many Pokemon

2994
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,000
and just so many weird ones.

2995
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,840
There's no daycare,

2996
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,520
so you can't leave Pokemon in this.

2997
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,440
Yeah.

2998
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:09,640
Actually, actually, there is a sort of daycare

2999
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,440
and that's actually, I almost forgot about this.

3000
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:12,280
This is a great picture.

3001
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:13,320
I don't get an experience from it though.

3002
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,160
Well, that's right.

3003
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,960
There is one and you get it way later.

3004
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,200
It's called the Poke Island or the Poke, whatever.

3005
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,040
It's the-

3006
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:20,860
Poke Pelago.

3007
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:24,580
It's the coolest fucking thing in this whole game.

3008
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:25,820
But when do you get it?

3009
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:26,660
When do you get it?

3010
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:27,740
Once you get the fly thing,

3011
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:29,340
I think on the second island sometime.

3012
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:30,180
Oh, okay.

3013
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,700
I need to tell you guys what this is

3014
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:33,460
because it's just the best thing ever

3015
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,060
and Digi was absolutely right.

3016
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:36,580
I wasn't sold on it before,

3017
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,700
but now I am convinced

3018
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,940
that it's one of the greatest things

3019
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:40,260
that's been introduced in the game.

3020
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,100
So what it is,

3021
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:42,740
it's just an archipelago out at sea

3022
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:44,780
where there are these islands that you kind of construct

3023
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:46,620
and what happens is all the Pokemon

3024
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:48,740
that you have in your box,

3025
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:51,540
they just, they go and they populate those islands

3026
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:53,020
and they do things there.

3027
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:54,220
So like for example,

3028
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:55,300
they help you,

3029
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:56,740
they kind of just hang out on this one island

3030
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:58,820
and then it just attracts new Pokemon.

3031
01:52:58,820 --> 01:53:00,660
That just instantly like join your party.

3032
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,940
If they, you know, it doesn't happen too often,

3033
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,300
but they'll just be attracted,

3034
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,940
they'll do it and they'll come get them.

3035
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:10,140
That kind of reminds me of the Digimon games a little bit.

3036
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,820
Yeah, it's very similar to that.

3037
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:12,660
And it's just-

3038
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:16,860
I'm not sure how to handle that for Nuzlocke rules.

3039
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:20,300
Yeah, I'd probably, yeah, I have no idea to do it.

3040
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,260
You'll have to think about it.

3041
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,460
You could just throw them away,

3042
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,100
ignore them or something.

3043
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:25,940
Actually, you know what?

3044
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,740
You only get them to join your team

3045
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:30,140
if you like tap on them twice, I think.

3046
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:31,420
So if you just ignore them,

3047
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:33,060
then they'll never join your team.

3048
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,500
So that's, you know, that's something.

3049
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,180
But there's a bunch of islands

3050
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:38,540
that each do different things.

3051
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:42,220
And the fact that your Pokemon in your box

3052
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:44,120
are actually given like a life.

3053
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,240
Like they don't just sit motionless in stasis

3054
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,400
in a Pokeball somewhere.

3055
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:51,840
They're just out, living life on these archipelagos.

3056
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,520
I have not actually experienced it,

3057
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,000
but yeah, it sounds amazing and wonderful.

3058
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,280
It is wonderful.

3059
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,640
I don't know what you guys all talked about.

3060
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:03,160
I was just telling them how great the Poke-Pelago was.

3061
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:06,440
Going on, yeah, it's really awesome.

3062
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,960
I wanted to say about the gaining experience

3063
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,920
from catching Pokemon thing that like,

3064
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,320
I mean, if you're playing this game in such a way

3065
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,920
that you're mainly keeping a main team

3066
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,640
and like you're not catching a whole lot of Pokemon,

3067
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,280
then that will not help you at all.

3068
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,080
I mean, you're not catching enough Pokemon

3069
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,320
for it to be a big deal.

3070
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:27,280
Well, I catch all the Pokemon I find all the time.

3071
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,240
Well, if you're playing such a style

3072
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,080
that you're trying to catch all the Pokemon,

3073
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,600
then more often than not,

3074
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:35,520
you're catching them not fleeing from them,

3075
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,720
which is a much harder thing to do

3076
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,280
than actually killing Pokemon

3077
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,040
because you have to strategically not kill them.

3078
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:45,040
And so I think gaining experience from that

3079
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:48,120
is like just, it feels way better.

3080
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:51,400
Like I'd rather, it feels like I put more effort

3081
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:53,720
into doing that than I did into just winning a battle.

3082
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,360
And I'm glad I gained experience.

3083
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,240
Could you imagine how annoying it would be

3084
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:00,360
if you had to kill like 17 Pokemon in a row

3085
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,800
that a Pokemon had called for help

3086
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,960
and then not getting experience for that after you catch it?

3087
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,160
Well, I mean, if a Pokemon faints,

3088
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:07,480
obviously you should get experience.

3089
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:09,480
Actually, yeah, you gain the experience immediately

3090
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,400
after killing the fainted ones.

3091
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:14,120
So it's not like you have to wait

3092
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,800
for the end of the battle to gain more experience.

3093
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,000
Oh wait, so you can level up during one of those things?

3094
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,880
Yeah, yeah, it's just like any other battle.

3095
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,480
You gain experience every time you knock something out.

3096
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,720
Yeah, I mean, I was actually arguing with my friend, John,

3097
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,240
that that was actually a good thing to have in the game.

3098
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,000
So I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here

3099
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,680
because I do like the inclusion

3100
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:36,640
of getting experience when you level up.

3101
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:38,520
It's just in the context of me worrying

3102
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,640
about the games being too easy.

3103
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,080
Like they didn't have to do it.

3104
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:44,240
And so, you know, I'm kind of defending a point

3105
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,680
I don't totally agree with here

3106
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,720
just because of the larger context of, you know,

3107
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:50,880
that's why we need to make what's your Tizm.

3108
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,680
Even if that's true.

3109
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:57,680
Yeah, Pokemon don't level up as quick as a bullet from a gun.

3110
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,200
Man, that experience made leveling too easy.

3111
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,360
Did they put in a learning curve in this game, right?

3112
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,440
Am I the only one who thinks this

3113
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,480
that there was like a learning curve

3114
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:06,600
that you can't over level?

3115
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:09,960
Because I found that trying to grind so I could beat Ben,

3116
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:13,200
it took way longer than in other games.

3117
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,600
I didn't grind, so I'm not sure.

3118
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:17,840
Well, it took plenty longer.

3119
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,960
The higher level you are compared to the Pokemon,

3120
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:22,520
you're fighting the lower amount of experience you get,

3121
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,480
which I think was the same.

3122
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,440
There is EXP scaling and that was,

3123
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:28,200
I don't think that was always the case.

3124
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,040
Well, maybe not always.

3125
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:29,880
Yeah, that's gotta be a new thing

3126
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,240
because I've never seen that before.

3127
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:34,160
It was definitely like that in Gen Five.

3128
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:36,880
I do remember that vaguely, I think, as well.

3129
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,880
Really?

3130
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,880
Yeah, I was sort of like a little upset,

3131
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,680
I think, when I found out about it,

3132
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,920
that was years ago, though.

3133
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,280
So, yeah, I think it was since Gen Five, at least.

3134
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,800
Well, I have never once leveled up a Pokemon to level 100,

3135
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,680
and I always wondered where people get

3136
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:52,440
the fucking endurance to do it.

3137
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:53,800
I've done two, but they were in Gen Five.

3138
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:54,640
It's not hard, actually.

3139
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:56,600
In original blue, I did.

3140
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:57,640
How the fuck do you do it?

3141
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:59,960
You just fucking blasted the elite four.

3142
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:01,840
You have to do it so many times, though.

3143
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:06,360
I've beat the elite four over 150 times on Gen Three.

3144
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,480
Hell yeah.

3145
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,320
To get to level.

3146
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,160
That's too many.

3147
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,000
That's too many times.

3148
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:10,840
I know it is too many.

3149
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:13,720
Once you get your Pokemon like 10 or so levels

3150
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:16,480
above the elite four, then, I mean,

3151
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,040
you can sweep it with one Pokemon.

3152
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,720
So it's just gaining all the experience.

3153
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,360
I did it in X and Y with Garchomp

3154
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,800
just because I was just EXP sharing

3155
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,040
for everything else in my party

3156
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,600
because I was trying to catch every Pokemon.

3157
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,960
So I just go in there with five low-level guys,

3158
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,240
sweep the entire thing with Garchomp.

3159
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:34,040
He gains a little bit more than everybody else,

3160
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:36,640
and they all level up fucking all the way

3161
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,840
into the stratosphere.

3162
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,480
And I just, in just the course of trying

3163
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,560
to get all the Pokemon evolved,

3164
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:45,080
I ended up with the level 100 Garchomp.

3165
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:46,800
And Nate, if you're concerned about the time,

3166
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,360
you can just play it on an emulator

3167
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,600
and fucking throttle through that shit in three hours.

3168
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:52,440
Yeah.

3169
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:53,280
Monkey.

3170
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,160
I played White Two on an emulator,

3171
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,760
which had a speed-up function,

3172
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,400
but I didn't realize it until I was seven gyms in.

3173
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,680
Oh my God.

3174
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:04,560
So I played it normally up until the eighth gym,

3175
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,200
and then I finally realized I could hold out.

3176
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,680
I just did the normal way.

3177
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:11,040
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

3178
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,440
Like a fucking sucker.

3179
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:13,280
Was this in White Two?

3180
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:16,440
Every recording for one of an episode of Ben's Nuzlocke

3181
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:20,800
is like, you know, like six to 12 hours long.

3182
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,080
It's no wonder why his series went on for half a year.

3183
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:24,920
It was like three.

3184
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:27,040
That's just because Ben's release schedule.

3185
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:30,440
One of my favorite things to do is to get like a level,

3186
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,200
like if there's an old Pokemon in an earlier area

3187
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:36,160
that I hadn't caught yet, and I need to evolve it,

3188
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:37,680
and it's like level two,

3189
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:39,960
I bring it to the Elite Four and I give it the XP share,

3190
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:43,600
and I can see it level up like 50 in a row.

3191
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,440
Yeah, that's great to see.

3192
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:45,480
How about the XP share?

3193
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:47,160
The XP share made it so that

3194
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,360
I didn't even think about playing this game.

3195
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:52,240
I just used whatever Pokemon I always used

3196
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:54,480
and just fucking didn't worry about switching.

3197
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,040
Just killed everything in one hit,

3198
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:57,320
leveled up.

3199
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:00,080
I do like the XP share that keeps your party

3200
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:03,200
the same sort of level because, I mean,

3201
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:08,960
it's like you have your Pokemon that have the good moves

3202
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:11,000
for fighting specific other types,

3203
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,040
but sometimes you're in a place where, you know,

3204
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:15,960
your flying Pokemon is useless against everything there,

3205
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:17,440
but you need it for the next area,

3206
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,520
and you don't want to have to grind just with the flying

3207
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:22,200
Pokemon in another area because it's useless here.

3208
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:25,920
You can use your useful Pokemon in the right place,

3209
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:28,360
and then switch out when you need a different type,

3210
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:29,840
and they're all generally the same level

3211
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:31,480
if you use the XP share, and I like that.

3212
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,440
It's good.

3213
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:36,160
My team is all the same cool level guy.

3214
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,000
I guess.

3215
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,280
I don't really like the idea of my Pokemon being strong

3216
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,600
despite never actually seeing a real battle.

3217
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,240
Something about that rubs me the wrong way.

3218
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,400
Well, Ben, I've got a question for you, Ben.

3219
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:46,600
You do love the grind, though,

3220
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,680
and I don't like it quite as much.

3221
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,080
Yeah, Ben, have you been getting a shit ton of comments

3222
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:53,160
on the Nuzlocke of people calling you a pussy

3223
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:54,440
for using the XP share?

3224
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:57,280
Because I certainly have, these fucking babies.

3225
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:01,680
I got one guy, he was like, customarily,

3226
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:06,320
it's customary to not use a key share or a me.

3227
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,360
I think he was referring to Pokemon Refresh.

3228
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:10,840
I was like, first of all, customary according to who?

3229
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:12,120
Second of all, shut up.

3230
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,480
These fucking entitled babies in the comments

3231
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:17,920
think they can run my game.

3232
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,240
The idea that there are Pokemon customs.

3233
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,240
Monkey, you said it in your fucking video.

3234
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,640
That doesn't make the game more challenging,

3235
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:25,720
it just makes it grindier.

3236
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,720
It makes it tedious, that's not fun to watch.

3237
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:31,800
It's just more shit on the cutting room floor for me.

3238
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:36,080
And speaking of having authority over your channels,

3239
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,480
Ben, you released your Nuzlocke far too irregularly.

3240
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:42,800
Once a week is not good enough, but they're fucking hour long.

3241
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,440
Didn't make them half an hour long.

3242
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:46,280
You need to release twice a week at least.

3243
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:47,400
Why?

3244
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,320
Because I said so, because I do edit.

3245
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:50,480
Ben, here's why.

3246
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,880
Because you and me are trying to upload our battles

3247
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:56,000
on the same day, and it makes it very weird to schedule

3248
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,120
when you only do it once a fucking week.

3249
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:59,720
Yes, there you go.

3250
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:03,240
No, but it's fine.

3251
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,600
It worked out this first time,

3252
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:06,960
but we got like 18 more of these battles to go.

3253
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,080
I mean, you could easily break those episodes in half.

3254
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:12,920
They are longest shit.

3255
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,400
How would that make it any better?

3256
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,800
Because I don't want to watch a movie

3257
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,080
every time you have a new episode.

3258
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:18,960
I want to watch it day by day.

3259
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:21,000
Why?

3260
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,120
I'm looking for more content per week.

3261
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:26,480
There's pros and cons to the different lengths.

3262
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,080
I get more views, which is more money.

3263
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:30,600
When it comes to having to...

3264
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,840
I don't monetize any of my videos.

3265
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,800
Oh, when it comes to why?

3266
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,080
Because I would get like a dollar for each one.

3267
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,600
It's a fucking dollar.

3268
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,160
I don't want a dollar.

3269
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:42,280
Talking about fucking money, it's when you've got two people

3270
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:44,880
doing like a Nuzlocke side by side,

3271
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,640
it's kind of weird to have like Ben's come out a week

3272
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:50,200
and then for Monkey to have a regular interval.

3273
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:54,640
So you're more Monkey's playthrough is more in your mind.

3274
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:56,320
And then suddenly there's another Ben one.

3275
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:57,160
Yeah.

3276
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:58,720
And you sort of forget what happened in the Ben one

3277
02:01:58,720 --> 02:01:59,960
while you're watching the Monkey ones.

3278
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,080
Yeah, Monkey's in their mind.

3279
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,160
It's gonna be weird.

3280
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,120
That's all I'm...

3281
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:05,440
Well, you got to win the battle of hearts and minds here, Ben.

3282
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,280
I don't think...

3283
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:10,760
No, guys, guys, I like events video length

3284
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:12,760
because personally, like when I watch videos,

3285
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,720
I usually do other stuff like let's say draws.

3286
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,040
So I like lengthy videos

3287
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:18,560
because that means more time for me to draw

3288
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,400
rather than click on the next video.

3289
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,000
That's really been annoying.

3290
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,920
I agree with you, Mage.

3291
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,040
To long and short videos.

3292
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,160
I'm just saying with the two different players,

3293
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:28,320
they should be the same length.

3294
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,280
Hey, it's not about the size of the video,

3295
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,760
it's how you use it.

3296
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:35,000
Well, to say that, I think what Mage is saying

3297
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,080
is how I feel as well,

3298
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:39,520
but I also think that that's kind of a bad thing for Ben

3299
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,600
because you're saying that you like his videos being longer

3300
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,280
because it means you don't have to watch the video.

3301
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,600
No, I'm watching it.

3302
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:50,480
It's on the side and my drawing is on the other side,

3303
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,040
so I'm watching it while drawing.

3304
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:56,160
I've mentioned this to Ben before that with Mumkis,

3305
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:59,240
I actually just watch each episode

3306
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:03,200
and it's because typically what I do is I'll come home

3307
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:07,080
with a sandwich and then I will sit and eat the sandwich

3308
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,400
and watch Mumkis' video.

3309
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:11,400
It's just the right length for me to finish my sandwich

3310
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:12,880
before the video's over.

3311
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,280
Whereas with Ben's videos,

3312
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:18,560
I almost always just listen to them and I'll glance up,

3313
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,680
like with the latest one,

3314
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,000
it was helpful because I was actually playing Pokemon,

3315
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,200
so it was a good way to have an hour and a half long thing

3316
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,080
to have in the background while I was playing,

3317
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:31,480
but I probably would never just sit and watch

3318
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,400
an hour and a half long Let's Play video

3319
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:37,040
the way I would with Mumkis' 20 minute ones

3320
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,080
and I'm just like, yeah, all right,

3321
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:41,400
it's exactly long enough to finish a sandwich.

3322
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:43,120
Did you, it's funny that you say that, did you?

3323
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:46,440
Because every time you upload a new decompression chamber,

3324
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:47,960
I always jerk off to it.

3325
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,480
Yeah, that's a fucking long goddamn jack-off.

3326
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,720
The long, slow pumps, dude, that's the way to do it.

3327
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:59,320
Yeah, that's cool that we do our everyday tasks

3328
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,440
while watching each other's shitty videos.

3329
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,720
I'll be honest, I don't...

3330
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,960
Mumkis sitting there, to take so long,

3331
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:11,320
I feel like you're here so fast, I can jack my whole...

3332
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,040
Do you want to say something?

3333
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:18,680
Something about lengths of videos.

3334
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:22,520
I actually didn't mean to bring up any of that.

3335
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,400
I just need to get more content out.

3336
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:29,440
I like long videos, which is why I made mine the way they are,

3337
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,520
because that's the kind of video that I prefer.

3338
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:32,840
This is what I was going to say.

3339
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,400
I'll be honest, I don't watch either of them.

3340
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:38,680
I listen to both of them, regardless of the length.

3341
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,320
I glance at them every so often.

3342
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:44,000
Yeah, I mostly just keep mumkis tabbed

3343
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,480
unless I hear something of particular interest happening,

3344
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,480
and then I tab over.

3345
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,640
If you don't see every single growl at the scene,

3346
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:51,120
you're missing something.

3347
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,640
I mean, I always tab over, I always flip over for them.

3348
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,000
Yeah, you have to watch the growl at the scene

3349
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,840
every time to get the full mumky experience.

3350
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,960
By the way...

3351
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,280
That will absolutely have been the intro for this video, by the way.

3352
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,520
Yeah!

3353
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,120
But finally, one something.

3354
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:08,160
The thing is, I mean, I like my upload schedule.

3355
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,880
It's easier for me, because...

3356
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:13,400
You only have to edit once a week, yeah, that makes sense.

3357
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,160
Yeah, all you gotta do is edit once a week

3358
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,880
and then split it into two files.

3359
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,960
But then you have to process it and upload it,

3360
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:22,680
and didgy's internet fucking sucks, it's a hassle.

3361
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,240
Well, first of all, my internet's great,

3362
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,080
and second of all, I render all this fucking video, so...

3363
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,200
My concern, by the way,

3364
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:32,960
was only about you two getting it out at the same time.

3365
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,480
But it sounds like you've already got that figured out,

3366
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:35,760
so never mind what I was saying.

3367
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,240
Dude, I don't think that's a problem

3368
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,560
with getting it out at the same time,

3369
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,960
because we are like...

3370
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:44,320
The plan was that three of his episodes would be one of mine.

3371
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,160
That's true.

3372
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:46,960
We planned it out ahead of time.

3373
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:47,960
I was like...

3374
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:52,400
Yeah, we decided that it would be two episodes for me

3375
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,040
and six for him.

3376
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:54,880
So...

3377
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,280
I like that Ben's are long, though,

3378
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:57,720
because I don't have to make a decision

3379
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:00,480
about which one I'm gonna eat my sandwich through.

3380
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:03,640
Like, Ben's can come out once a week,

3381
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:05,280
and I can just focus on that,

3382
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,320
whereas on the day-to-day grind of me eating sandwiches,

3383
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,680
which is pretty common, you know?

3384
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:12,320
Like, as I wouldn't be able to eat the sandwich

3385
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,440
through both of your episodes, you know?

3386
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:17,760
The reason I would like your videos to be the same length

3387
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:20,240
is so that I can watch both of them exactly at the same time.

3388
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:21,080
Yeah.

3389
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:21,920
Unlike me.

3390
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:23,520
I'm like, double screen.

3391
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,920
Yeah, double screen,

3392
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,880
and not know what I'm looking at.

3393
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:31,240
Have one person's audio come through one headphone

3394
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,400
and the other guy through the other?

3395
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:33,240
Yeah.

3396
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,680
And then eat two sandwiches.

3397
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,520
Yes.

3398
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:37,840
Yes, yes, double fisting.

3399
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,320
One meatball and one turkey,

3400
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:45,200
the double meat on a nine-grain wheat,

3401
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:49,400
double meat, turkey, lettuce, tomato.

3402
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,600
What was the rest of it, monkey?

3403
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:51,520
I don't remember.

3404
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:52,640
It was never revealed,

3405
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:54,200
and then Manim will quit the channel,

3406
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,560
but I think, I mean, if you guys want me to spoil

3407
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,120
what was on his Subway sandwich, I'll do it here live.

3408
02:06:59,120 --> 02:06:59,960
Oh, I'll do it, too.

3409
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:00,800
By all means.

3410
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,640
Oh, my God.

3411
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:02,480

No, we've got to pay all this one.

02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,160
No Ben St. Patreon, so I'm not completely sure,

3424
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:34,760
but as far as I know, the other two ingredients

3425
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,000
are onions and banana peppers.

3426
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,080
Oh, my God.

3427
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:40,080
Oh, my God.

3428
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:41,920
Holy shit.

3429
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:44,080
So wait, Skain, you go through all of it?

3430
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:45,040
Yeah.

3431
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:45,880
Pay me a picture.

3432
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,560
So you get the nine-grain wheat.

3433
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:48,400
Right, yes.

3434
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,520
Not toasted, because then the bread gets all crumbly

3435
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,360
and shit.

3436
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,200
Right.

3437
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,480
I don't even remember what fucking cheese.

3438
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:54,320
What was it?

3439
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,480
That's cruel.

3440
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:57,320
Oh, I don't remember.

3441
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,280
American, it's American cheese.

3442
02:07:58,280 --> 02:07:59,840
No, it wasn't American, no.

3443
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:00,680
Not American?

3444
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:01,520
Provolone?

3445
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:03,240
Pepperjack, I don't know.

3446
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:04,080
It wasn't pepperjack.

3447
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:05,640
I think it might have been provolone cheese,

3448
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:08,160
which this is why I was confused why I didn't toast it,

3449
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:09,200
because if you don't toast the cheese,

3450
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:12,480
it's just a fucking, it's a cold piece of cheese, disgusting.

3451
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:15,320
He gets double turkey, double turkey.

3452
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:19,360
He gets lettuce, and now we all know he gets onions

3453
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:20,280
and banana peppers.

3454
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:22,120
That's how you eat Subway sandwich,

3455
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,800
and specifically, no tomato.

3456
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:24,640
No tomato.

3457
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:26,760
We both hate tomato very much.

3458
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,920
Was there any sauce on it?

3459
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:31,080
Yeah, he said Subway vinaigrette, I think.

3460
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:32,480
That's crucial.

3461
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,840
Okay, yeah, all right, so that's it.

3462
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:36,360
Now I can finally go order it,

3463
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:38,880
like ever since he first brought it up,

3464
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:41,320
I was like, as soon as they finished describing the Sub,

3465
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:43,880
I'm gonna go buy one and watch the show,

3466
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:45,680
and it's been fucking three months.

3467
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,040
Digi, I want one too, I'm coming with you,

3468
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,000
I'm gonna get one too.

3469
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,560
We should do that right after the show.

3470
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:52,720
I haven't watched episode four.

3471
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:55,280
No, let's do it after we lift,

3472
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,520
because I'm still full.

3473
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,360
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3474
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,200
Yeah, I've gotta warn you, if you eat the animal way,

3475
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:01,280
you're gonna get big and bloated like him.

3476
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:04,320
Well, you know, Ben, we should buy them,

3477
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,280
and we should buy them before we lift,

3478
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:07,360
put them in the fridge,

3479
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:09,880
and then run the constant risk of monkey

3480
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:11,600
eating the other half of our Sub.

3481
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:16,600
That's the full experience.

3482
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,280
Yeah.

3483
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,960
If you walk in and DeVoo has just devoured it all,

3484
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,040
at my street, the curse.

3485
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,240
That's why it's called DeVoo, he devours it.

3486
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:27,560
He devours it, yeah.

3487
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:28,400
Hey, that's pretty good.

3488
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,880
Does anybody have any more comments about this game?

3489
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,720
This is two hours.

3490
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:34,200
I think we've hit rock bottom.

3491
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,640
What's that supposed to mean?

3492
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:39,400
I like Pokemon, they're cute.

3493
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:40,240
Usually.

3494
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:42,720
Why am I white and my mom is brown?

3495
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,640
That's a good question.

3496
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:45,600
Your dad must be super white.

3497
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,640
My game didn't have that problem.

3498
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:49,400
Oh, I thought you were talking about yourself, Ben.

3499
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:50,560
I was like, what the fuck?

3500
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:55,440
It has been a struggle of identity our entire lives.

3501
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,280
Did you make your girl brown?

3502
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:58,120
Yeah.

3503
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,200
I've seen my video, haven't you?

3504
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,240
Where I showed off my fucking girl and how cool she is.

3505
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:02,080
I guess.

3506
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:04,400
I had no brightness reference.

3507
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:07,200
It's the best fucking video I've ever made.

3508
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,440
What channel is that uploaded on?

3509
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,280
I didn't see that.

3510
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,520
Did you, bro, after dark?

3511
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,520
It's called Pokemon Trainer Sheik.

3512
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:15,560
The Winter Look.

3513
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,880
Yeah, the Winter Look, Winter 2016 Look.

3514
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,840
Is there any way of me analyzing

3515
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:21,840
how fucking cute my outfit is?

3516
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,120
Is there any way for me to get a winter knit cap

3517
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:27,240
and those sunglasses?

3518
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,160
Possibly.

3519
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:31,720
I mean, you start with a winter knit cap.

3520
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:32,280
No, you don't.

3521
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:33,840
You start with a fucking baseball.

3522
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,680
Well, Ben's a girl.

3523
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:37,400
As a girl, you start with a cap.

3524
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:38,160
Ben, I don't know.

3525
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:40,080
I've only seen baseball hats, though.

3526
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,840
But I'm going to look into this.

3527
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,600
I mean, there is no winter clothes.

3528
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:45,360
It's the whole game is all fucking island clothes.

3529
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:46,560
Even though you go to a fucking place,

3530
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,560
you mount it a couple times.

3531
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:48,240
Yeah.

3532
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,120
But what the fuck?

3533
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:52,600
But yeah, I made that and also an hour and a half

3534
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:54,520
long analysis of Pokemon Sun.

3535
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,400
So if anyone listening to this wants to hear a more

3536
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:00,120
structured analysis of the game, I can't believe I had to talk

3537
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:01,600
for another two hours.

3538
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:03,440
Much more structured.

3539
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:05,560
It was, I mean, it was like bullet pointed.

3540
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:07,840
I had fucking full notes for it.

3541
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:08,760
Did you?

3542
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:09,200
Yeah.

3543
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,400
The whole thing is like point by point.

3544
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:14,840
Highly doubtful.

3545
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:17,000
I was doing it in the GRPJ style.

3546
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,120
I was like trying to.

3547
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:19,120
Oh, that's right.

3548
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:22,440
Yeah, go to go to Hippocrite.com.

3549
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:24,800
I, you know, I deliver a point in watching that.

3550
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,240
I avoid watching that because I hadn't beaten the game.

3551
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:30,120
But now that I have, I'll probably go check it out.

3552
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:31,760
Did you do the green screen?

3553
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:32,840
Tell me you did the green screen.

3554
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:34,480
No, I was too lazy for that.

3555
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:37,280
I, I use green sunglasses.

3556
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:42,400
I use the fact that I didn't screen as a way to advertise Hippo more

3557
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,480
by assuring the audience that if they watched him,

3558
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,520
they'd get this, but better, like with, you know,

3559
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,040
like more effort put in.

3560
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:51,680
So have you guys seen that Hippocrite video where he's like

3561
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:55,200
no, I didn't watch the review and he had like this guy who's playing

3562
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:59,120
a guard and he has a big cane and he's taken the key off of him.

3563
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:00,400
And it's really funny.

3564
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,720
And I laughed at it.

3565
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:03,760
Yeah, I've seen that video.

3566
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:06,240
And you guys see the Hippocrite video when his guitar comes

3567
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:09,160
in character and it starts crying and it was really funny.

3568
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:11,240
Yeah, we get that picture.

3569
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,920
He gives videos are great.

3570
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:14,760
So we've seen that mage video.

3571
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:15,040
All right.

3572
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:16,960
Mage wants us to wrap this up.

3573
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,400
Let's finish this off.

3574
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:22,360
OK, well, that that's pretty much it.

3575
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:23,320
We've run the full gamut.

3576
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:25,120
Everything there is to say about this shit.

3577
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,280
We talked about it.

3578
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:31,720
Yeah, I think we can say a solid zero out of ten on Pokemon.

3579
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:37,360
So I think we can all agree that this can, should, must

3580
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,400
and will be the last Pokemon game.

3581
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:40,960
No, yeah.

3582
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:44,400
No, every three years, I want a new generation.

3583
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:46,040
Everybody say goodbye.

3584
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:47,240
Bye.

3585
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:49,200
Hashtag Team Monkey, baby.

3586
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:52,320
Yeah.

3587
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:57,800
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3588
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:03,320
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3589
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:06,200
But I'm not working.

3590
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:08,800
I'm doing nothing.

3591
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:11,440
My dick, I'm jerking.

3592
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:14,120
Myself, I'm sucking.

3593
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:16,800
I am an asshole.

3594
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,440
I am a stupid.

3595
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:22,120
I've got a deadline.

3596
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:24,600
Don't want to do it.

3597
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:35,160
What the hell is wrong with me?

3598
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:40,520
I'm supposed to be making money.

02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:48,520
I'm supposed to be creating funny things that the people

3600
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:51,160
gladly will pay for.

3601
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:56,520
Artist and genius, that's what they came for.

3602
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,160
Instead, I'm tweeting.

3603
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:01,840
Hashtag repeating.

3604
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:08,480
That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling.

3605
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:12,840
Yeah, it's quite the burden.

3606
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:15,160
It's a hard knock life.

3607
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:16,800
Being a genius.
