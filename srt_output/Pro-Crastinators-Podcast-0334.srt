00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I want to bless that guy. That son of a-

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,800
That son of a-

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
That son of a-

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,800
That son of a-

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
That son of a-

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Son of a-

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello everybody. We've passed the 333 milestone without any fanfare at all.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
We didn't notice.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
That's just the way we like it here on the pro-crastinators podcast.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
How's everyone doing? We got Never Paint here.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Hello.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Ben Saint and Gibbontake and Never Paint. Just fucking around.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Oh shit.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Oh shit. Can't say profanity in the first minute.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Yeah, you swear. Now everything's gonna go to ruin.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Just replace it with an even worse curse.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
I-

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
I used-

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
I censored my more extreme profanity

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
in the Mega Man lecture which I announced.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Ooh.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Twitter posted I have revealed the secret project

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
was the Mega Man lecture all along.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
It is gonna-

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
It is rendering right now,

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
but it will be rendering for the next like 4 days.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
How the fuck?

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
I think my computer is just starting to show its age a little bit.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't think it should take this long.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
It should maybe take half that long. I mean it's an eight hour video.

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
It's got lots of like, you know,

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
filters on the-

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
color filters on the-

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
on the footage and all that.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
It's got like 19 filters.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
To look as fucked up as possible.

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I just boosted the color contrast and whatever a little bit.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
And it's kind of a high-res video.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
It's not in 4K.

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
250, 2560 by 1440.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
So, you know, it's a pretty high resolution.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Eight hour video.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
So a serious render period is not unexpected.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Although I was hoping-

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I was hoping it would be less than a hundred hours,

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
but oh well.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
What can you do?

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm just over 24 hours into the render now,

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
and it is just past the 20% mark.

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
21%?

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Yes, we are at 21% mark.

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
A running commentary.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
You should do a stream of the running commentary of the fucking render.

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It will be out when this episode comes out.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Unless-

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Unless some-

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
The upload also takes four days.

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,400
The upload will definitely not take as long as the render.

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
The upload will probably only take a few hours.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
The only reason it would not be out is if I discover that like,

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
there was some fuck up

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
in the footage that I need to like,

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
oops, I have to render it all over again.

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Which I-

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
I pray to God is not the case,

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
but you know,

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
you never know.

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
There's the naked filter, and you've accidentally

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
put that on your footage.

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Now you're naked.

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Uh,

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I-

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I have a low-

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I have a low resolution render that I did beforehand,

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I might like, watch it through at some point again.

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I already watched it through

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
basically one time to catch anything

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
uh, before I made my final corrections.

79
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
But what if I fucked something else up during my final corrections?

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
So now I gotta watch it through again.

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
How do anybody make big video?

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Surely they have secret technology.

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Um...

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,400
They make many small videos and put them together in the end.

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I mean, that's kind of a possible way to do it.

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Like, if you've got like, heavily edited things,

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,400
it takes longer to render that with the filters on

88
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,400
than it does to stitch two fully rendered video files together

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
in a video editor.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Ebola, spreading on Twitter, suggested that I render it in chunks

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
and then stitch them together in Handbrake.

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
But I looked it up and like, and you can't do that.

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Handbrake doesn't do that.

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Uh, is there some other program you would use to

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
like, stitch videos together?

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Wouldn't you just have to put them into

97
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
in a Vegas timeline and render them?

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Take a sewing needle and some thread and then you go.

99
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
No, thank you.

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Well, I guess we can't talk about the contents

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
because neither, uh, me or Never Paint have had time to see it.

102
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Oh.

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Because it's not existing.

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Oh, well, that's okay.

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll just send you, I'll send it to you right now

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
and you can watch it real quick.

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
And then we can reconvene.

108
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Eight-hour episode.

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Life reaction.

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Eight-hour episode of a reaction to the lecture.

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Bonus, is that a, do I smell a bonus episode?

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Oh, no.

113
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
More like four bonus episodes.

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah.

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
So, I don't know, that's pretty exciting.

116
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Then remember monthly bonus episodes?

117
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
That was the time.

118
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
It was a thing.

119
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Okay, we don't do them every month anymore.

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
But, uh, do them sometimes.

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Is the Patreon description like updated to that

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
or does it still say that?

123
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,400
No, I have not really, uh, edited anything on the Patreon.

124
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I think, I think it probably still says that you want to,

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
like, make PCPHQ real and all that.

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Oh god, yeah, it probably does.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
That's probably still there.

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
It probably does.

129
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
I don't.

130
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Can't wait.

131
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I don't.

132
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
You can't wait.

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
It's going to be so much great content.

134
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Oh my god.

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
It's coming any day now.

136
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
It's still coming any day now.

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
The PCPHQ is now going to be in the metaverse,

138
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
so we don't even have to be in the same place.

139
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
We can have legs now.

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Legs are coming.

141
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Leg.

142
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Why did they not have legs?

143
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Like, that's so weird.

144
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I think the, the technical reason is that they use the cameras

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
in the headset to track the face

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
and the arms around it.

147
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
The torso doesn't really move that much,

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
so they don't animate that,

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
but it can't check your legs,

150
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
but I don't know why they can't just add,

151
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,400
like, little fake legs that do an animation.

152
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Like every video game does.

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,400
It's sort of baffling why that's a problem.

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
How is this costing, like, billions upon billions of dollars?

155
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I really don't understand that part of it.

156
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I don't really, um, I mean, I think it looked fine without legs.

157
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I didn't, I didn't miss the legs,

158
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
and then they announced legs.

159
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Like, okay, I guess you can add legs if you, if you need to.

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
It's just sort of like, yeah,

161
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,400
the metaverse being like a new thing that's trying to be made is like whatever.

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm not that, like, I'm not shocked and appalled by it.

163
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
It's just sort of the money.

164
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm a little shocked and appalled.

165
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Like, how is he spending all of his money

166
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
on something that is VR,

167
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
that already exists quite, like, well?

168
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I'm, I'm a little shocked and appalled just because I know that what's on the surface,

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
it's ha ha, it's stupid.

170
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
We already have Second Life.

171
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,400
But underneath, I know that what it is, is like this massive corporation,

172
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
this, this billions, like hundreds of billions of dollars valued company

173
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,400
is going to try to throw its weight around to, uh, what's, what's the word?

174
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Uh, to, to basically, um, to like, to like privatize,

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
like commerce in the metaverse form,

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,400
to like take as much of society under its own ownership in the under,

177
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
with this Trojan horse of this,

178
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Yeah, the whole, the whole stuff would like,

179
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
oh, you can purchase a property on the metaverse,

180
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
get yours today.

181
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
It's very, it's very, it's actually extremely sinister.

182
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah.

183
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
So, yeah.

184
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
All I can hope is that I'm not forced to do it.

185
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah.

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Cause I don't want to.

187
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,400
It's just some video about how like unsuccessful it is that there's only like a few hundred people online

188
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
in the biggest hubs at the time.

189
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
And it's a very, it's a very small community that is not,

190
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
that's not really happening anything in there.

191
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I mean, I just, I hope it stays that way.

192
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Um, I can see it being like, oh, we're a big stupid business

193
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
and we are stupid business people.

194
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
So we've got the, the, we've got so much money.

195
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,400
So we're going to buy like the biggest, most state of the art meeting rooms,

196
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,400
uh, possibilities so we can have meetings from multiple locations

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
and they buy the metaverse VR headsets

198
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
and they have a meeting room where people put the headsets on.

199
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
I could see like one.

200
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,400
That's about like the extent of like the user base for the metaverse.

201
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I can understand one like gullible tech bro, like convincing another.

202
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You know, like, no, this is the future, man.

203
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
This is the future.

204
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
And it's like, yeah, yeah, the future.

205
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Uh, uh, like a, like a mind virus spreading from one, uh, from one dweeb to another.

206
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,400
And like maybe one of those dweebs happens to be like the boss of some Fortune 500 company or something.

207
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,400
But like putting on your VR headset to fucking do commerce is just not,

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
nobody wants to do that.

209
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
So it's not a significant benefit.

210
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Like more so than like zoom.

211
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Like the ability to talk to people across the world with video is already like most of the job.

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Yeah, it really does.

213
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Now they should focus on hologram technology and have like this thing that they have in a Star Wars pre-quest

214
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,400
where they have the conference room and then as some people as hologram sitting in their chairs.

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,400
That's way techier and prettier.

216
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Let's try that.

217
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
VR is, VR is fine.

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I don't really use it because it's like clunky.

219
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Like they have the Oculus Rift.

220
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I played a little bit with it.

221
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I haven't touched it in a long time because like, I don't need to set up a whole like room space for it or whatever.

222
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Uh, it takes a lot of,

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Wasn't like a Kickstarter goal at some point?

224
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Yeah, for the, I think it was for the Vapors 2 Kickstarter.

225
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
No, it was one of the Vapors Kickstarter.

226
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
There was a stretch goal because I just needed an extra stretch goal.

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I was like, uh, uh, if I hit this goal, I'll buy an Oculus Rift and then I did.

228
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
It has nothing to do with anything, but like, it would be nice to have one.

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
We did play it at Radcon 3 though.

230
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
No, for Radcon 3.

231
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,400
It was a misanthropony meme, wasn't it?

232
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
The Oculus Rift.

233
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Yes, yes, that's right.

234
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,400
It was because he said at the time I was making like 300 something dollars on Patreon.

235
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Which is enough to buy an Oculus Rift every month.

236
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
It's right.

237
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,400
It's very funny that like, that's how you conceptualize value.

238
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Um, just like, I guess, I guess he looked at that number and like the first thing he thought of that costs about that much is a VR headset.

239
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
As far as we thought the switch came on.

240
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Oh yeah.

241
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Damn.

242
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Um, yeah, it feels like the switch just came out.

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I can't believe it's been like, it's been like four years.

244
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Seven years.

245
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Seven?

246
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Shut up.

247
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I think it's true.

248
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Don't scare me like.

249
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
It's not.

250
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
It's not.

251
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Unless it is, because I don't know.

252
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Did it come out in 2017 or something?

253
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
No.

254
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I think so.

255
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
When?

256
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
17 or 18.

257
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I mean, it feels about that old.

258
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Like, um, what came out initially.

259
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:44,400
There was arms and like the, the weird like, oh, it's got the controllers have like motion sensor in them.

260
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
So you can sort of feel like haptic feedback.

261
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,400
You can feel a little ball bearing moving around.

262
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
There's like a little game.

263
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
You're right.

264
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
2017.

265
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Yeah.

266
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
And that was all it had.

267
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
And then like Labo was later.

268
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Okay.

269
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Five years.

270
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah.

271
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Yeah.

272
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,400
So that lecture video that is coming out, is that accessible for people who know nothing

273
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
about Mega Man?

274
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Is that like complete beginner's guide?

275
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,400
The, the, the goal of it is explains, um, it explains the, the lore.

276
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Like as it is, as it is expressed in the games themselves.

277
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,400
It's like how it's like what's what lore is there in every individual game in the whole

278
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
series.

279
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,400
So if you, if you just want to know like what's in the Mega Man games stories, it explains

280
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,400
it to you, it doesn't cover like, okay, it doesn't cover like, uh, alternate tellings.

281
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Like, like there's like cartoons and manga and stuff.

282
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,400
And they're all like kind of similar to the games, but they're all a little bit different.

283
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,400
So I had to, I was like, I don't talk about any of that.

284
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm just focusing on like the games themselves.

285
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Uh, yeah.

286
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
And that was enough to talk about.

287
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
For eight hours.

288
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Yes.

289
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Um, uh, you know, I, uh, I was thinking, I was thinking, um, I, the, the, we were on

290
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,400
the subject of that, I don't want, uh, I guess we're only 15 minutes into the episode.

291
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm not monopolizing it yet.

292
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,400
But, um, I did want to say that I have, um, you know, I bought a lot of stuff to make this

293
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
lecture.

294
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I had to buy a new microphone.

295
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I had to buy a bunch of like lights.

296
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Uh, I had to buy like, like, uh, tripods and like light stands and stuff.

297
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
So I like, I like invested.

298
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I like invested some money into like setting up my, the ability to like produce a lecture

299
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
like this because I could not have done it with just stuff I had lying around.

300
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Uh, uh, my, my, I was, I was rewriting my Patreon.

301
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Like yesterday and then this morning because I am sort of, um, hoping, I say so at the

302
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
end of the lecture, I say like, I'm, I'm hoping that like I can sort of make lecture making

303
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,400
kind of like a pillar of my, uh, uh, online presence going forward.

304
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I kind of want to, I kind of want to structure it around like, okay, I have like patron goals.

305
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,400
I'm going to, I'm going to, it's now that I have the stuff to make it, I'm going to be

306
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
like using my Patreon money to like hire an editor.

307
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
This one I edited all by myself and it was a nightmare.

308
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,400
So if I make another one in the future, which I hope I will, uh, I'm going to, I'm going

309
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,400
to like pay an editor to do like some of the, of the grunt like, like rough editing for me.

310
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Uh, and stuff like that.

311
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,400
And I'm going to, um, what's the other thing?

312
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh yeah, I'm going to have, um, like patron goals.

313
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I decided that if I, if I get a hundred patrons, I'm going to like do a poll and I'm going to

314
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,400
like vote on a, on a topic for me, whatever they want.

315
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Uh, that'll be funny.

316
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
And, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm really hopeful.

317
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm really hopeful that the video does well, uh, because, uh, I've sort of like, I don't know,

318
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
I guess I've kind of staked, I guess I've kind of staked my, my plan for like the future

319
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,400
of my self as a content creator on like doing, doing more stuff like this.

320
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
So if it doesn't work out, that's a little bit of a sunk cost.

321
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Uh, that's all I have to say.

322
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,400
The eight hour tag definitely is appealing to people, I think.

323
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Like that makes it stand out a lot.

324
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
To some, yeah.

325
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I mean, for, for me, I would see that and I'd be like, hell yeah.

326
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah.

327
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but, uh,

328
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I think it's plenty of people's cup of tea because it's so popular and so lucrative for

329
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
everyone who does it.

330
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Fucking, um, Wendigoon and like Quentin reviews put out like six hour videos and everybody

331
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
loves it.

332
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,400
So everybody knows Shea Mei is a seven hour, uh, Omega Ruby.

333
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah.

334
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Video.

335
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,400
When I first heard about that, that was a big deal that like people talked about that.

336
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
It just came kind of, I was actually relieved.

337
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I was relieved that I hit eight hours instead of seven so I could be longer than Shea Mei's

338
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
now.

339
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,400
It has to get longer and longer every time you do one of these.

340
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I'd be more and more impressive.

341
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,400
I would not necessarily have to make them all eight hours long.

342
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Uh, but I also have no idea.

343
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I don't know what my next one would be.

344
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Like say, say like the video does well, but I don't do,

345
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
but I don't immediately reach like a get a hundred new patrons.

346
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Like that's fine.

347
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
I'd still do another one.

348
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I would just pick the topic myself, but I have absolutely no clue what it would be about.

349
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Uh, um, that's it.

350
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
That's all I have to say.

351
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I will, I'd think of something.

352
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Make a lecture about making gummies.

353
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Just doing your kitchen.

354
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
That doesn't need to be a lecture.

355
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
That doesn't need to be a lecture actually.

356
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I feel like you've talked about that for like two years on the PCB.

357
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Can't squeeze an eight hour video out of that.

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Uh, no.

359
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Too bad.

360
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Uh, I don't think so.

361
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Uh, I could just read it reading all my old notes about like failed failed.

362
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Then tie a lore.

363
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
It would be so boring.

364
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh my God.

365
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
So first I did it like this and then it was bad.

366
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
So then I did it like this and it was a little bit better,

367
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
but it was still bad and then I did it like this.

368
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
First I did sheet gelatin and then I tried four sheets,

369
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,400
but then I tried three sheets, but then I tried four sheets again,

370
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
but with less water, but then I tried three sheets,

371
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
but with more water, then I switched to powdered gelatin.

372
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Oh, what a twist.

373
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Everyone's like, oh my God.

374
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
He switched to powdered gelatin.

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
That's my secret ingredient.

376
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
What?

377
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,400
The whole arc started with rejecting powdered gelatin and going all fancy.

378
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
And I thought I was so clever.

379
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Switching to sheet gelatin turned out no.

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Powder was the way to go all along.

381
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Surprise twist ending.

382
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
You see, if you do that for eight hours, that would be really funny.

383
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Even if I wouldn't want it.

384
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
They could go on for more than 40 minutes.

385
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,400
My hope is that the Mega Man lecture will be interesting all the way through

387
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,400
and not something like that.

388
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
The gummy lecture would be, which is just me bad.

389
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
And then Mega Man went here and he saw Dr. Light.

390
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Dr. Light said Mega Man died.

391
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
That's pretty much the story.

392
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
The first eight games, it kind of is just like,

393
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I go through them pretty fast because a lot of them are just like,

394
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,400
the story of this game is Wiley built eight robots and you have to fight them

395
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
and then you do.

396
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Okay, that's the story of this one.

397
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
And then the next one is a different guy comes in and he made eight robots

398
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
and you fight him, but then it was actually Wiley all along

399
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
and then you fight him.

400
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Okay, that's the sort of thing.

401
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Anyway, the next game.

402
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Anyway, the next game is powdered Mega Man.

403
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
It's got more surface area than the other ones.

404
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,400
So he feels more pain per square inch.

405
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,400
There are some, there are a couple of really wacky things.

406
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Quint, Quint and Rockman Shadow are a really bizarre piece of Mega Man lore

407
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
that I'm excited for people to maybe find out about.

408
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I think maybe most people don't know about those too.

409
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
There's a part, I'll be honest.

410
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
This is embarrassing.

411
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,400
There's a part where I'm describing the story of Mega Man 04

412
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
and I literally like almost start crying.

413
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
No, that's good.

414
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
It's great.

415
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Okay, I'm not like audibly like about to like cry or anything,

416
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,400
but like at the time I remember it be like I could feel like some emotion

417
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and I had to be like, no, I got to calm down.

418
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I can't.

419
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I can't.

420
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
That would be a great thumbnail image.

421
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I kind of remember talking about Mega Man's lore on this board.

422
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I just love the zero games so much.

423
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
There's so much better than the rest of them.

424
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I wonder if that's a hot take.

425
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm not sure.

426
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I don't think so.

427
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Probably that is Mega Man at the moment.

428
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I feel like I see people talking about Mega Man recently more

429
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
than I used to.

430
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
You know, this year is the 35th anniversary.

431
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,400
So I think people are saying, people are talking about X9.

432
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Like when is X9 getting announced?

433
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
I think people are expecting it.

434
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I don't know if it's actually happening anytime soon.

435
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
It's what you should call your video.

436
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Call it like X9 announcement trailer Mega Man.

437
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
So people take on it.

438
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I think I'm going to call it something like Mega Man.

439
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Every game's lore exhaustively explained or something like that.

440
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Thoroughly analyzing Mega Man.

441
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Or what is it like frantically rambling for eight hours

442
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,400
about the story of every Mega Man game or something like that.

443
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Type it like a Jane and Niggason video and just call it like Mega Man.

444
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Lower cast.

445
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
The Mega Man video.

446
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I guess the audience will know.

447
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,400
The three videos that inspired it were

448
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
it was Jenny Nicholson's The Vampire Diaries video.

449
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,400
It was Mike's Unappropriately Unhinged Recap of Pretty Little Liars.

450
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,400
And then it was, what was your name?

451
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Carrie Ken reads Desperately Explaining the Plot of Crescent City

452
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
so you don't have to read all 800 pages.

453
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
There's a title of that one.

454
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:27,400
So, you know, a title that communicates desperation, unhingedness, deranged.

455
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
It's always very poor.

456
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
A sick mindset.

457
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Mental, it meant the themes of mental illness.

458
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
You know what you want to see on YouTube.

459
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Yeah.

460
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Well, that was a lot of my week.

461
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
You know what else I did this week?

462
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
The other big thing this week?

463
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I played Inscription.

464
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
What did you think?

465
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I loved it.

466
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Solaru had a Steam key and gave me a free Steam key for it, which was great.

467
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,400
So I played it and it was amazing.

468
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
What can I say?

469
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
I can't say that much about it.

470
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I can't say everything I would say about it because it's very spoiler sensitive.

471
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
But I will say that I knew there would be twists.

472
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,400
But the twists were not what I expected them to be.

473
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
And they just kept coming.

474
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
And they surprised and delighted me.

475
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Yeah.

476
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Have you talked about this game before?

477
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Because I don't really remember what it was.

478
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Someone in a voicemail I think told me I should play it.

479
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I think.

480
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
I had other people recommended it to me before.

481
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
So, yeah.

482
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,400
It's funny that you play the game and you have the same response as everyone.

483
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Being like, oh, I can't say anything about it, but it's good.

484
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
You really can't.

485
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
You've seen the footage.

486
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
It's like a card game.

487
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,400
But it's set in a room that you can walk around and explore the room that you're in.

488
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
You've seen that.

489
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Is it like Undertale?

490
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Hmm.

491
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I could point out some surface similarities.

492
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
But no, not really.

493
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Is there sand?

494
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes.

495
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
That's the surface similarity I was talking about.

496
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Hell yeah.

497
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,400
I guess it's like I could say.

498
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
I mean, the game's, there's a lot more to it.

499
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
There's a lot more to it than you think.

500
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Like Frog Fractions?

501
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
A little bit.

502
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Yeah, a little bit.

503
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,400
It's almost a little bit spoilery to make the comparison, but a little bit.

504
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Yeah, a little bit.

505
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Because it's like, if the game is a card game and that's the game,

506
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I generally don't like card games unless they're easy because I always feel stupid and unlucky when I play a card game like that,

507
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
where you draw a card and sometimes it sucks.

508
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Well, there's the card game and then there's the room that you're playing the card game in.

509
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
And they're both like part of the real game.

510
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Yeah.

511
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,400
The card game part of it, I've played enough, I played a lot of it this week.

512
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm still not like, I can't beat it like 100% of the time, but I've definitely gotten better at it.

513
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:05,400
And, you know, I think it's like, if you, once you learn the game,

514
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,400
you know that there are ways to mitigate randomness.

515
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Before you learn the game, you don't know that.

516
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:22,400
And then the fact that you have failed to mitigate that randomness means that you get draw a bad hand because you set yourself up to draw a bad hand.

517
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,400
And then you go, oh, well, it's all luck of the draw.

518
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
It's a RNG.

519
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
But it's not actually.

520
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Hmm.

521
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
It sounds interesting.

522
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
It's just one of those things, isn't it?

523
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Like a game that is like, oh, it's got so many twists, so many interesting things, you got to play it.

524
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Yeah.

525
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Telling me that already is sort of spoilering the experience of playing the game and finding that stuff out because now I'm going to be waiting until it does something insane.

526
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Yeah.

527
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
I mean, I knew there were twists.

528
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I was still surprised.

529
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,400
But you wouldn't be interested in the game if you didn't know that there would be twists, right?

530
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Like it's just a random card game simulator.

531
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
It's, I don't know.

532
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Like with a game that has like more to it, if you can sell somebody on like the initial premise of the game to get them interested in playing that and then not telling them about anything special that might happen.

533
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Like I remember when I pitched Outer Wilds to you, Ben, I did not at all mention the time thing.

534
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,400
I just mentioned that it was a cool space game where you explore.

535
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Yeah.

536
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:56,400
And like all of the things that you learn and left out and I felt like that was it was a pretty good pitch and it got you interested.

537
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Yeah, it was when it was when you said that you have to like adjust your like speed to like match the like celestial body you want to land on.

538
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,400
I was like, oh, what, what kind of game, what kind of game makes you do that?

539
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
What the fuck?

540
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
So that was that was interesting.

541
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,400
On the surface, Outer Worlds is like really fun just because of the things on the surface.

542
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,400
But then there's the stuff under the surface where it's like, oh, cool.

543
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Oh, interest.

544
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Oh, intrigue.

545
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:34,400
I'm thinking is this inscription game like the card games really fun once you get the hang of it?

546
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
I'll say.

547
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,400
And then also there's weird stuff, but we won't tell you about that until you're playing.

548
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:46,400
The I have I have actually been playing the like sort of like challenge mode.

549
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Like it's called it's called Casey's Mod, which is which is pretty much just the card game and but with like a slightly different like set of cards and slightly different rules.

550
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,400
I have been playing that which is just the card game and I like it.

551
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,400
It's fun.

552
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
What else? What else can I even say about it?

553
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I do I do I do.

554
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah, like like the core the core of the game is the card mechanics and the card game and like it is it is a fun.

555
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
In my opinion, it is a fun card game.

556
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm not usually into like deck building games.

557
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,400
I guess there's a lot of games that are deck builders and usually when I hear someone describe a game that way it turns me off.

558
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
But I enjoyed it in inscription.

559
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,400
So maybe I should be a little more open minded to it in the future.

560
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
I prefer dick building games like Minecraft.

561
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:52,400
You know, you know, I the thing about thing about it, I at some point I realized that oh, actually more cards is bad.

562
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Actually, you kind of want less cards.

563
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Actually, like my decks are like much better when like I try not to get any of the new cards that they offer me when I like deliberately avoid them.

564
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:09,400
My deck is more consistent and it's better like almost all the time, which is a very sort of funny real realization to have.

565
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,400
I think I learned that quite young when I had like Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

566
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Sure.

567
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I thought if I combined all of these boosters together and I have a huge deck, then there's no way I could lose.

568
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I know that like, yeah, in like Magic the Gathering, you don't want to have like more cards than the like minimum deck size.

569
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
It's like it's not good.

570
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
I don't know.

571
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I guess I just hadn't didn't I didn't go into like a game like this assuming that that would necessarily still be true.

572
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
But it's totally it's still true.

573
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Yeah.

574
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Yeah.

575
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Anyway, thanks Salaru for the for the Steam key.

576
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Yeah, I trying to think of what's what's how it what's what's the what's the what's the most I can say about it to recommend it without without blowing it.

577
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I don't know.

578
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
It's like among us.

579
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Elder Scrolls Online.

580
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
That's right.

581
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
No, I've said no, I've said enough.

582
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I've said I've said too much.

583
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Anyway, that was my week.

584
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,400
That was my week was finishing my video and playing inscription.

585
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Tomorrow's Halloween.

586
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Tomorrow's Halloween.

587
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Happy Halloween from the past coming out after right when this comes out.

588
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,400
It's already Christmas almost Thanksgiving Christmas.

589
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Oh, well, you guys don't have Thanksgiving.

590
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
No, we don't thank anybody.

591
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
No.

592
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,400
So this week I will actually just yesterday I did the gig.

593
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I did the thing I talked about.

594
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Yes.

595
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Playing the music.

596
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
The zone.

597
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
The game.

598
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
The game.

599
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
The game.

600
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
The big game.

601
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
The big game.

602
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
The big game.

603
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Big game.

604
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Big game.

605
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Big game.

606
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Big game.

607
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Big game.

608
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Big game.

609
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Big game.

610
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Big game.

611
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Big game.

612
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
I played.

613
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Wish you were here.

614
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I did the acoustic guitar on that.

615
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I did dig a pony.

616
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
The Beatles.

617
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I played George Harrison lead guitar.

618
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Wish you were here.

619
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Is that Oasis or is that the Beatles?

620
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
That's Pink Floyd.

621
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Oh.

622
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
You fuck.

623
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
You fool.

624
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
There's an Oasis.

625
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,400
No, there's an Incubus song where the chorus goes, I wish you were here.

626
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
And I always when everyone says wish you were here, I think of that song.

627
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
But that song, I don't even think that song is called wish you were here.

628
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
It's just the line in the chorus.

629
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I wish you were here drinking a beer.

630
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Is that the original?

631
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
I hope so.

632
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
No.

633
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,400
And then I played a fucking black magic woman.

634
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
It's the rhythm guitar for that.

635
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
And then.

636
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
You couldn't make that song today.

637
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Huh?

638
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
You couldn't write that song today.

639
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
What?

640
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Cancel culture being how it's like and all.

641
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
No, no.

642
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Elon saved us.

643
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I don't even understand.

644
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Huh?

645
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Elon saved us.

646
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Didn't you hear?

647
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,400
We can say such things now on Twitter.

648
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
And make songs about it.

649
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Oh, right.

650
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Yes.

651
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
You can say black magic now.

652
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I can sing black magic woman.

653
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Yeah.

654
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Yeah.

655
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Finally.

656
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,400
And then I played sympathy for the devil.

657
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,400
And I played the bongos and then the guitar as well.

658
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Bass, bass, bass.

659
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,400
And it was, I was very nervous the whole week leading up to it.

660
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I was shivering.

661
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I was shaking.

662
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Epic.

663
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Epic.

664
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I was cold sweats adrenaline.

665
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I was like, oh, gee, I hope I don't mess up one note.

666
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I did mess up a note or two, but it doesn't matter.

667
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Once you're on stage, it's fine.

668
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Once you're on stage and the light is blinding you and you're just looking at your guitar

669
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
and you're just sort of like doing your thing.

670
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
You're like, yeah, I'm here.

671
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I'm just playing.

672
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
That's right.

673
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
It's fine.

674
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,400
It's the, it's the having to wait and set up all the equipment and then wait for a few

675
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
hours.

676
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
And it's, oh, it was dreadful.

677
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I couldn't even get drunk because I was, I was afraid that if I got a little bit too

678
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
drunk, I would need to piss my pants on stage.

679
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
And that's not what I wanted.

680
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
So I didn't drink or be anything.

681
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
It would probably negatively affect your ability to perform.

682
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I also would probably like chill me out, but yeah, I mean, everyone else is drinking.

683
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Yeah.

684
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Sure.

685
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Sure.

686
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,400
But yeah, it was a great, it was a great little performance.

687
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,400
I may upload it somewhere.

688
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,400
My mom was there recording a bit on her phone.

689
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
So it might have something to put on the give and take channel.

690
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
What did you end up wearing?

691
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Clothes.

692
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Oh yeah.

693
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Cause I was wondering about that.

694
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Yeah.

695
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Yeah.

696
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I didn't want to go like, I didn't want to be like drawing attention to myself.

697
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I just wore like a, yeah, just like a shirt, a low cut, like woman's style like t-shirt.

698
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
I don't know.

699
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
It's just sort of like clothing.

700
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
I understand.

701
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Just sort of clothing.

702
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Everyone was wearing clothing.

703
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Just a public shirt with no honor.

704
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,400
It wasn't like a, it wasn't like a big venue with like a lighting guy.

705
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,400
It was like the basement of a pub, but it was a really nice pub.

706
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,400
And they had like old oak tables and like miscellaneous chairs from various sort of eras,

707
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
just sort of all in the same place.

708
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
That's cool.

709
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,400
And they had good beer and it was nice.

710
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
It got very hot.

711
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,400
But now that's done and I'm no longer ever going to go play music.

712
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Except until the next time.

713
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah.

714
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Good riddance.

715
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Thank you to everybody who donated.

716
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I know at least two or three people went to the site.

717
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
I think you can still do it.

718
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,400
So I guess we'll put the thing in the description.

719
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
But yeah, we raised I think over two grand.

720
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
What's it for?

721
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Did you say it's for Alzheimer's?

722
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Parkinson's.

723
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Parkinson's.

724
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Excuse me.

725
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Parkinson's charity event thing.

726
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Mmm.

727
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Mmm.

728
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,400
And yeah, it was a really, really good night.

729
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
The band was great.

730
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,400
I was good as well.

731
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
And I feel good about it.

732
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Hell yeah.

733
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
God damn it.

734
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Yes, queen.

735
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
You're welcome.

736
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Thanks.

737
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Thank you everybody.

738
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Slay.

739
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Slay.

740
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I did slay.

741
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Nice.

742
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Mmm.

743
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Yeah.

744
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Red.

745
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Oh and I just got done before.

746
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I wish I could have gone.

747
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Yeah.

748
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Maybe next time.

749
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Maybe next time.

750
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Yeah.

751
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,400
And I guess the only other thing is Halloween decoration.

752
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
I just carved the pumpkin.

753
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I carved the pumpkin and I gave it big eyelashes.

754
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Like my new impsona that I made.

755
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Oh, I saw that.

756
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Oh, I saw it.

757
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
I did see that.

758
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I think I didn't see that.

759
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't know.

760
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Have you heard or watched Hell of a Boss?

761
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
No.

762
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
It's by Vivian Medrano, the person behind Has Been Hotel.

763
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I've watched that.

764
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Has Been Hotel.

765
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Isn't it said in the same world as Has Been Hotel?

766
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Yeah.

767
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Yeah.

768
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Has Been Hotel is a show that has been like, I don't know, more professionally funded

769
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,400
to be put on more professional like distributors, like something Netflix.

770
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I don't even remember.

771
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,400
But Hell of a Boss was a more independently funded by Merch Sales show set in the same

772
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
universe with different characters.

773
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
And I love it.

774
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
And it's in season two right now.

775
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
And it's great.

776
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
And I just decided to make an impsona.

777
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Let me get that tweet.

778
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
I found it.

779
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
It's good.

780
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,400
I like the horns a lot.

781
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Yeah.

782
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
It's basically like Homestuck.

783
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
But you know, they're cooler looking.

784
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
They're cooler looking designs than Homestuck trolls.

785
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
I'll say it.

786
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Impossible.

787
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,400
I really like the black and white stripes that is very imputing to me in any animal or

788
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
creature or whatever.

789
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Yes.

790
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Yes.

791
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Wait a minute.

792
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
We don't see it.

793
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,400
It's like a theme park close to where I live, where they made a spooky forest and all they

794
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,400
did basically was put up like a bunch of gravestones and also paint all the trees and like black

795
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
and white stripes like this.

796
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,400
And it's actually very spooky in that.

797
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Yeah.

798
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
That's cool and all.

799
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
But let's talk about reploids instead.

800
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
No.

801
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Let's talk about it.

802
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Let's talk about reploids and how they just got genocided.

803
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
What?

804
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Let's just talk.

805
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Let's talk about how they did a robot genocide in Mega Man Zero.

806
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Did I miss something on the news?

807
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Did something happen?

808
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Did they storm a robot factory?

809
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
No.

810
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
No, no, no.

811
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Unfortunately, not yet.

812
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Okay.

813
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
What are we talking about?

814
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I don't know.

815
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Just sort of the things I've done this week is practicing for the gig, which is now done.

816
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,400
I feel great having done that and Halloween's coming up.

817
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Oh, Clarissa is getting close.

818
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Here's my Clarissa update.

819
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Give us the Clarissa update.

820
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:10,400
So I was struggling getting stuff done, but I forced myself to work harder.

821
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
And I was doing like a work day.

822
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Like I was waking up and being like, okay, no distractions, nothing, no things, nothing.

823
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
That's pretty good.

824
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Just not even like a podcast in the background.

825
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,400
I know that this is like a sense that, oh, you can focus with music or a podcast.

826
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
No, you really can't.

827
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Not when you're trying to create things.

828
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
When you're doing monotonous work, yes, you can.

829
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,400
But when you're trying to come up with a solution to a creative problem,

830
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,400
like how does this character move from this panel so that they're in this panel and like this?

831
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Or what do they say here that's not cringe?

832
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
You can't listen to anything.

833
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
So I had no distractions at all.

834
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I agree.

835
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm fine with everything that is like, whenever I work on something that doesn't involve language,

836
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm fine with listening to anything, but as soon as I have to write anything.

837
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Oh, yeah.

838
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:11,400
As I was going for like the page layout is what I'm getting to the very, very near end of.

839
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,400
I've been like sort of like scribbling down a rectangle of some very like random size

840
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,400
and being like, okay, so in this page, this thing has to happen.

841
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
This character's here.

842
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I guess I'll draw them from below because like they're imposing right now and they've got a speech bubble.

843
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I need to fit a speech bubble in there for them to say something.

844
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
What do they say?

845
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I have to think of something because if I end up sketching the page and not knowing what they say,

846
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
I'll have to fill it with something that sucks.

847
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,400
So I want to make sure I have something that's kind of good and that I can like tweak and make better.

848
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,400
So I have to fill in the speech bubbles as I go and like sound effects and stuff.

849
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
And I'm like, ah, speed lines here.

850
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:04,400
And I'm at the point now where it is at the very final part of the showdown where the winner is determined.

851
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
There's only a few pages left and then it's like the epilogue.

852
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
What happens after?

853
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,400
I've been waiting for quite a while to see.

854
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I mean, I assume it's Clarissa versus what's the guy with the big hat's name?

855
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
The Bandit King?

856
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
The Bandit King?

857
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Yes.

858
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I've been waiting to see how their confrontation would shake out.

859
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
So I'm happy to know that that's coming.

860
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
It is.

861
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Is that going to be concluding the Clarissa story or do you want to do more with her?

862
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Oh, of course.

863
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
I'm going to do more of that.

864
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,400
This is, I mean, initially this was supposed to be, it was supposed to be a short story for the competition,

865
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,400
the physical awards, the manga competition.

866
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,400
And I wrote a story that went far beyond what I could fit into like the 50 page limit.

867
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:02,400
And so it's going to be probably like 150 to 200 pages at the end of the day, maybe.

868
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
I know.

869
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
You won't have seen it yet.

870
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
So this is a spoiler for you.

871
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,400
But I wore the Lord of Ghosts pin in the lecture and I shouted you out.

872
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
I shouted out your website.

873
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Thank you.

874
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Yeah.

875
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Yeah.

876
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Yeah.

877
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
It's pretty, it's pretty epic.

878
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
Hell yeah.

879
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Hell yeah.

880
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Hell yeah.

881
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Very spooky.

882
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
For just in time for Halloween.

883
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Yes.

884
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Just in time for Halloween.

885
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Yes.

886
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
Very good.

887
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
You know, it's funny.

888
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
I haven't drawn anything spooky this month.

889
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
Yeah, you have so many spooky characters.

890
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
I guess you have your two vampire girls.

891
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Yes, I did.

892
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Yeah, you're always wrong.

893
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
You're always wrong.

894
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
It's hot.

895
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
It's every day.

896
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Every day is Halloween for me.

897
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Like, yeah.

898
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
She's like a puppy by Christmas.

899
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
It's not just for Halloween.

900
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Punk is forever.

901
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,400
You did have the punk profile picture.

902
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Except Halloween or something.

903
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
She's a culture, not a costume.

904
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Yes.

905
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Exactly.

906
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Very good.

907
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Yeah.

908
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:07,400
I don't feel like it's like more punk of a month than it normally is.

909
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
So I haven't really thought about like Halloween drawings.

910
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,400
I should draw a little bit, just in my own time, just for fun.

911
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,400
I'm actually working on a kind of Halloweeny character right now.

912
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Oh, yeah.

913
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,400
I want to finish that before tomorrow so I can post it and be in the season.

914
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Like a week ago, I came up with this character that is kind of a zombie girl.

915
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,400
But she has a wasp lava living in her brain.

916
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
That is the actual person.

917
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,400
And the girl is just like the suit, the body that the little lava pilots.

918
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
That's hideous.

919
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Yes.

920
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
No, but it's like in a cute way though.

921
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
In a cute way.

922
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,400
He's got a cute kind of brain parasite.

923
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Yes.

924
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Yes, exactly.

925
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Oh my god.

926
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Have you seen a little brain slug?

927
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Have you seen that it's like a slug or a snail that has a worm?

928
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
No, I hate that image.

929
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
I hate that.

930
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
I hate it.

931
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,400
With it like pulsating inside of its like eye stalks?

932
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Yeah, that's the worst.

933
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
That's the worst.

934
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
I love that stuff.

935
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
It's kind of cool looking, but like what I actually think about it, it's like, yeah,

936
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
it's like the most horrifying thing I've ever seen.

937
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,400
It's the most existential sort of horrifying like it's using the slug as a suit to perform

938
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,400
like acts of gaslighting of other bugs or whatever it was doing.

939
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
What was it doing?

940
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,400
It was like pretending to be a type of thing so that something would come over to it.

941
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,400
And so it could grasp them or poison them or something.

942
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
I didn't want to look at it any longer.

943
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
I left immediately.

944
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,400
I don't even remember.

945
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
I thought it was just like eating it from the inside.

946
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,400
It like moves the snail to someplace where like a nutrient rich place to die or something.

947
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Well, the caption was something like using like the slug to mimic something, mimic some

948
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
action.

949
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,400
The slug or snail could perform or some, I don't know, it was doing something that was

950
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,400
like gaslighting the birds to come and eat it so that they could kill the birds.

951
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
I don't like it.

952
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
I didn't like it.

953
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Gross.

954
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Is it like the hope is that the bird will eat it and then the parasite will be inside

955
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
the bird?

956
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I don't know.

957
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,400
I didn't read it properly.

958
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,400
Some intrepid explorer can go find that post and puke and then read it.

959
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I just posted Maggie.

960
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
That's her name.

961
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,400
That's a good name for that.

962
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,400
The idea was that like Maggie is just like an open cranium.

963
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,400
You know, it's just like a door.

964
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,400
She can open that if she has to leave the body for maintenance or something.

965
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Okay.

966
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
I see.

967
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
I see.

968
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Okay.

969
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,400
So this is more like a flesh mech.

970
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Yeah.

971
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Than it is a person.

972
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
It's ratatouille.

973
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
It's ratatouille.

974
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
It's gross.

975
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
It's actually cheesy, I think commented that.

976
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,400
It's more realistic.

977
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
What if ratatouille was real?

978
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,400
It's mega-goody.

979
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Mega-goody.

980
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,400
I was also kind of thinking of attack on Titan when I drew it.

981
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Like big flesh monsters that they sit in.

982
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Why are they so gross?

983
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Do you know about like wasp lava and what they do to caterpillars and stuff?

984
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Jesus.

985
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
They fuck them up.

986
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,400
I know some things about that.

987
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,400
I know that like, you know, they put a fucking worm in their body and it eats them from the inside

988
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
and pilots them like a mech or whatever.

989
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Yeah.

990
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Yeah, more or less.

991
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,400
Like they, I don't know, they release some kind of chemical in them that like makes them

992
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,400
behave in a certain way and let them growl to a space.

993
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,400
And then the lava that are inside tell the caterpillar to make one of its cocoons to

994
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
protect the lava.

995
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,400
So it's literally like brain controlled to protect the offspring of this wasp.

996
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,400
And then the wasp lava feed on the caterpillar and leave it behind.

997
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
Makes the cocoon, huh?

998
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Yeah, yeah.

999
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,400
You know, I wonder if like, like insects have, because they're so small, their brains are

1000
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
like very simple, like electronic pulses.

1001
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,400
They have like five buttons and the little maggots can push the little buttons.

1002
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
It's like turn left, turn right.

1003
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Very simple to operate.

1004
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,400
If they try to take over a human, they'll be like, ah, fuck, this is too complicated.

1005
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Well, they made a whole book series about that.

1006
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
It's called The Animorphs.

1007
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
Perhaps you've heard of it.

1008
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
I haven't.

1009
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Only there was a lecture or something to watch.

1010
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,400
If only someone could explain in painstaking detail what happens in The Animorphs.

1011
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Wait, I was going to say, did you know, I learned this recently that like figs exist because

1012
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
like wasps like lay larvae in them?

1013
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:14,400
Like a fig, like a fig fruit has to have like a wasp egg laid in it.

1014
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,400
It has to like hatch like a clutch of wasps.

1015
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,400
What?

1016
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
Yeah.

1017
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,400
It's like, I read this somewhere.

1018
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I think it was real.

1019
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
They have like a symbiotic relationship with wasps.

1020
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,400
I basically know what you're talking about.

1021
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,400
I thought it was like the wasp goes to fertilize the plant and then it gets trapped inside and

1022
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,400
the plant eats the wasp and then the wasp is part of the plant.

1023
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,400
When you eat a fig, you're eating a dead wasp or something.

1024
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,400
I don't think so.

1025
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
I don't think figs would be a kind of a response.

1026
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,400
If they're cannibal plants or meat eating figs.

1027
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
Everything's so fucking gross.

1028
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Well, here's an image that supports to explain it.

1029
00:49:52,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah, I think this is just part of like the life cycle of the fig, which is like wasps basically like pollinated.

1030
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
That was kind of right.

1031
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Yeah.

1032
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:11,400
The pollen laden wasp enters the circuitous root of the fig, lays eggs inside fig and

1033
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,400
then flower ovaries contain wasp larvae.

1034
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,400
So that's kind of just any pollination of a plant, but with the extra step that the

1035
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,400
insect also leaves its larvae in there.

1036
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
That's neat.

1037
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Oh, so it is.

1038
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
No, I was kind of right.

1039
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,400
The babies, they hatch, but they try to dig out and they can't get out and they die.

1040
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,400
Yeah.

1041
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Yeah.

1042
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Yeah.

1043
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Like the like they're still sort of in there or like their bodies kind of like become like

1044
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,400
part of the fruit or something.

1045
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,400
This is why I do not eat fruits.

1046
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
I know I have.

1047
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
I've eaten a fig like once.

1048
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
I've eaten a fruit once.

1049
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
I've eaten a fruit, I swear.

1050
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,400
You ever eat a, you ever eat a, you ever eat a pomelo?

1051
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,400
Oh, I love pomelo.

1052
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
What?

1053
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Fuck you.

1054
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Yeah.

1055
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
No, they're great.

1056
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
They're amazing.

1057
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
No, they're not.

1058
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,400
You're stupid.

1059
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Okay.

1060
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Pomelos are just, pomelos are just worse grapefruits.

1061
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
So like you hate tomatoes and you hate pomelos.

1062
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
I'm sorry.

1063
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,400
I don't hate, I don't hate tomatoes, but I wouldn't eat, I wouldn't just eat a tomato

1064
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
whole.

1065
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,400
I wouldn't just like eat one by itself.

1066
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
I would.

1067
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
I love tomatoes.

1068
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,400
They're not bad.

1069
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,400
I had a tomato salad like basil and mozzarella.

1070
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
With like mozzarella cheese.

1071
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Yeah.

1072
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1073
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,400
That's basically eating whole tomatoes.

1074
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,400
But then you have the, you have the mild, the mild flavor of the mozzarella, you know,

1075
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,400
kind of cutting against these sort of like acidity of the tomato.

1076
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,400
And that's good.

1077
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,400
But like, I don't know.

1078
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,400
I know some people will just eat a tomato and.

1079
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
Yeah, I want one of those.

1080
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
I like that.

1081
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Oh, some pomelo is great because it's one of these fruits that really gives you something

1082
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
for your money.

1083
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,400
Like it's.

1084
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,400
A pomelo?

1085
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Yeah, because they're giant and you can feel like an entire lunchbox.

1086
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
You are a pretender.

1087
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,480
You've never eaten a pomelo because if you did, you would know that it's all rind.

1088
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,400
You open up the pomelo and it's just like all white, fluffy rind.

1089
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,840
There's a little bit of fruit in the middle.

1090
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,700
I think there might be different kinds of tomatoes and you might have like had a bad

1091
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,700
one.

1092
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,700
No, they're all like that.

1093
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,400
Shit, American pomelos.

1094
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,900
No, my American pomelos are the best in the world, even though I hate them.

1095
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,900
There is a lot of the white stuff in them, but there's still like a lot of flesh, too.

1096
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,900
Okay.

1097
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,900
These pictures that I'm finding do have significantly less rind than I remember.

1098
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Oh, pomelo is a fucking app.

1099
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,900
You piece of shit.

1100
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Stop making apps named after things.

1101
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,900
Yeah.

1102
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,900
I don't know.

1103
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,900
Pomelos.

1104
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,900
Pomelos are just to me.

1105
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,900
They're just a grapefruit, but they don't taste like anything.

1106
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,900
They have less flesh and they don't taste.

1107
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,900
They're like sour, bitter, sweet.

1108
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,900
I guess.

1109
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,900
Sometimes they're bad, but most of them they're not.

1110
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:01,900
In my opinion, they just straight up improved the pomelo by crossbreeding it to create the

1111
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,900
grapefruit.

1112
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,900
The grapefruit is perhaps my favorite fruit, and so I owe the pomelo a great debt for

1113
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,900
being a part of its genesis.

1114
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,900
However, now that it's done me that favor, it can fuck off forever and die.

1115
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,900
I never want to see one again.

1116
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,900
There is a lot of rind in the picture.

1117
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
It's superior descendants.

1118
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Yeah, that's a bit much.

1119
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,900
Okay, well, get off my podcast.

1120
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,900
I think citrus fruits are weirdly inconsistent in taste.

1121
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,900
That's why I don't like buying them usually.

1122
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:39,900
Sometimes they get the same bag of oranges and they're great, and next time they're bad.

1123
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:46,900
Sometimes when they eat a mango, certain mangoes, occasionally like one bite of the mango,

1124
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:53,900
will have a weird pine tree floral flavor to it.

1125
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,900
Interesting.

1126
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,900
It's not the whole mango.

1127
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,900
It's just one little bits here and there, and it's just not every mango.

1128
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,900
It's just certain mangoes.

1129
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,900
Why did I get on this subject?

1130
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,900
You know what?

1131
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,900
I said pomelo.

1132
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,900
I said pomelo.

1133
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,900
I didn't even mean to say pomelo.

1134
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,900
I meant to say persimmon.

1135
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,900
What is that?

1136
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,900
It looks like a tomato, but it doesn't taste like one, and you eat it with a spoon.

1137
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,900
Is it?

1138
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,900
Are these those black tomatoes?

1139
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
No, no, here.

1140
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,900
They look like this.

1141
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,900
Oh, actually, we call them khaki.

1142
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,900
I don't know why, but we do.

1143
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,900
They're more fushy.

1144
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
They're sweet.

1145
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,900
They're sweet like, I don't know what they taste like.

1146
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
They don't taste like a tomato.

1147
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,900
I don't know.

1148
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,900
I had one once and it was okay.

1149
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,900
My favorite tomato is the beef tomato or whatever the fuck that is.

1150
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,900
Beef steak?

1151
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,900
The big beefy ones that you can...

1152
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,900
Yeah, with all flesh.

1153
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,900
With more flesh and less juice.

1154
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,900
I guess that's what they are.

1155
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:07,900
Yeah, a beef steak tomato or a good beef steak tomato, it's like a regular tomato.

1156
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,900
You cut it open and it's got these chambers inside that are full of beef.

1157
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,900
A beef steak tomato doesn't really have much of that.

1158
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,900
So it's ideal for slicing and putting on a steak.

1159
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:23,900
That's also my favorite kind of tomato, because the only context I really particularly like tomatoes is the slice of them.

1160
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,900
What about sweet cherry tomatoes?

1161
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,900
I don't like them.

1162
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:36,900
Cherry tomatoes are pretty good in a tomato sauce with a bunch of other stuff.

1163
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:44,900
I don't like raw, cold cherry tomatoes just because it's too much moisture.

1164
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,900
If I wanted a drink, I would have a drink, you know what I mean?

1165
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,900
No, I could eat like a whole cucumber just because of drinking glass of water.

1166
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,900
I knew my family would eat cherry tomatoes.

1167
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,900
It would snack on cherry tomatoes and I just thought they were gross.

1168
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,900
I don't like them.

1169
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,900
There was this?

1170
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,900
I don't like them.

1171
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:10,900
It's very, very simple Italian recipe of beef tomatoes in olive oil and that's it.

1172
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,900
You just eat beef tomatoes with olive oil and it's great, actually.

1173
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,900
You don't need to do anything.

1174
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Maybe a bit of seasoning, a bit of salt, but I had that one.

1175
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:26,900
So it's like, how does this not a normal thing we do all the time?

1176
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,900
When you're talking about like, oh, I'm too lazy to cook a good meal.

1177
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Just get a tomato and cut it up, put it oil on it.

1178
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
I'm not too lazy to cook a good meal.

1179
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
I am.

1180
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,900
Depends on the meal, I guess.

1181
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:50,900
I discovered, wait, I discovered a new food that I love, but I like it too much so I can't get it anymore

1182
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,900
because if I get it, I will just eat all of it and it's unacceptable.

1183
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,900
The last time this happened, it was nuts.

1184
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:03,900
I decided I can't eat nuts anymore because I will just eat the whole bag.

1185
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,900
The new one is Wegman's bacon rise pizzas.

1186
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
Wegman's bacon rise frozen pizzas.

1187
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,900
You know, nuts were a better idea.

1188
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,900
Nuts will damage your colon.

1189
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,900
I guess if you eat a whole bag, yeah.

1190
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,900
Wegman's bacon rise frozen pizzas, they're just, they're huge.

1191
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
They're giant.

1192
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,900
They cost $4 and I can't buy them.

1193
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Yeah, they're like $4.99.

1194
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Oh, bake and friends, I see.

1195
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
I was trying to think what the bacon.

1196
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,900
Not bacon, not bacon rise.

1197
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,900
No, no, no, no.

1198
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:50,900
But it's like more than a whole day's calories for $4.99, which is good.

1199
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,900
It's like a whole day's calories for a family of five and you have seven of them every day.

1200
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
But it's not good.

1201
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,900
It's good for the money, but it's not good for me because I don't want to eat that many calories in a day.

1202
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,900
So it's a, here's what I should do.

1203
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,900
Here's what I should do to be scrupulous.

1204
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:15,900
I should like under eat one day and then use those calories surplus that I saved up

1205
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,900
and use them on the next day so I can eat more the next day so I can make a Wegman's bacon rise pizza.

1206
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,900
And that can be my food for that day.

1207
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,900
Go on a diet for like a month and then eat pizza for a month.

1208
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,900
I'll go on a diet for a whole month and then I'll spend the next month.

1209
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,900
I'll eat nothing but bacon rise pizzas every day.

1210
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,900
It's genius.

1211
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,900
It's calories in, calories out.

1212
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
The math checks out.

1213
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
I'm sorry.

1214
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,900
You'll probably be sick of it and you never have to do it again.

1215
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
You know what?

1216
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,900
You could take this further.

1217
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,900
You could say the first half of my life.

1218
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,900
I will not eat anything.

1219
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,900
And the second half I will gorge myself constantly.

1220
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
Yeah.

1221
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,900
You know, the first part of your life is not like you don't need much food in there.

1222
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,900
Like you're small.

1223
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,900
You just stay small.

1224
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,900
Get that sun.

1225
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,900
Get that sun in you.

1226
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,900
Drink some water and then eat when you're like 40.

1227
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,900
That's right.

1228
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,900
It's the circle of life, baby.

1229
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,900
That's how I'm going to raise my kid.

1230
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,900
So that one.

1231
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,900
Speaking of pizza.

1232
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:21,900
I left my favorite pizza behind in Canada because I came back and favorite pizza.

1233
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,900
Yeah.

1234
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,900
In Canada.

1235
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,900
It was in Canada actually like in downtown right under the CN tower.

1236
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,900
Like there's a little pizza place.

1237
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,900
I think it's called scatter bush or something.

1238
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,900
And they have, they have these pizzas that like, of course, like, I mean, it's, it's like

1239
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,900
a kind of nice Italian bar restaurant thing.

1240
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,900
And have these pizzas that are very properly baked, but they have like handmade, freshly

1241
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,900
made mozzarella on them.

1242
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,900
So there's a guy in a bag.

1243
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:54,900
You can see how he like, like twists and like pulls the mozzarella and turns into balls

1244
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,900
and stuff.

1245
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,900
Pretty nice.

1246
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,900
Pretty nice.

1247
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,900
That was great.

1248
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,900
His name was Remy.

1249
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:05,900
We got told that his name so that we know that he's the Red from Rutter 2 actually.

1250
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:11,900
And, and it was just like a very like kind of simple like mozzarella cheese pizza, but

1251
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,900
it had like sun dried tomato bits on it.

1252
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,900
And an olive like in basil oil over it.

1253
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,900
Like just a few sprinkles.

1254
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,900
That was so delicious.

1255
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:29,900
I know we went there like, like three times in the three months I was in Canada.

1256
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,900
And I, I don't know, I don't know when I'm ever going to go back.

1257
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:38,900
There was, um, there's a pretty good, there's a pretty good, like slightly, it's not like

1258
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,900
super fancy, but it's a little, it's a little bit fancy pizzeria kind of near me.

1259
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:48,900
And I've had the other pizza like twice and it's very good, but they were the, you know,

1260
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,900
at, um, at Radcon three, we got a bunch of pizzas and somebody, some, it might have been

1261
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:01,900
my suggestion actually, I might be an idiot because someone suggested pineapple and ham.

1262
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,900
And I didn't like it.

1263
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:10,900
Uh, but this, this place, I got, uh, I got a pineapple and pepperoni pizza at this fancy

1264
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,900
place and it was actually really great.

1265
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,900
And I really liked the pineapple.

1266
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,900
The difference was that it was cooked better.

1267
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,900
It was cooked more thoroughly and the pineapple sort of like kind of melted and caramelized

1268
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,900
a little bit into the cheese and it made it so much better.

1269
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:29,900
The Domino's fucking, fucking raw, raw pineapple chunks on top of your pizza.

1270
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,900
Nightmare.

1271
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,900
Um, these other guys know how to do it.

1272
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,900
Yeah.

1273
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:40,900
I don't really eat frozen pizza or like cheap, uh, fast food pizza anymore if I can avoid

1274
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,900
it.

1275
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,900
Like even a restaurant or like handmade, we do that in our apartment sometimes, like

1276
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,900
handmade, make the dough and, uh, sauce and stuff.

1277
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
That's also good.

1278
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
We have a pizza stone in the oven.

1279
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,900
My dad used to sometimes make pizza and it's, it's funny in hindsight because like, I don't

1280
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,900
know, it was so, I didn't really understand like why it was so different.

1281
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:07,900
Like it had, it bore almost no resemblance to like, you know, pizza you would buy from

1282
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,900
a pizzeria.

1283
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,900
And now I've watched, you know, I've watched some cooking videos.

1284
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,900
I've watched like, uh, Adam Raguse is like how to make, uh, you know, a New York style

1285
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,900
pizza.

1286
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,900
And now I understand, oh, there's actually a lot of like very specific processes that

1287
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,900
go into making the kind of pizza you get from like a pizzeria.

1288
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,900
Uh, you can't, you kind of can't just like fuck around in your kitchen and make it.

1289
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,900
Uh, so no wonder.

1290
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,900
I mean, it was still good.

1291
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,900
I still liked pizza night.

1292
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,900
There's very different kinds of dough.

1293
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,900
I think, isn't it like mostly the oven?

1294
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,900
That's the hard part to get right.

1295
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:47,900
Like the immense heat that you need to get like the right, crispy, uh, the blackening

1296
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,900
of the bread or whatever.

1297
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,900
Yeah, that's, that's a big part of it.

1298
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:59,900
Also the kind, the kind of cheese, the whole, the whole, uh, fat mozzarella is like kind

1299
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,900
of hard to find.

1300
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:06,900
Uh, although the pizza stone makes it a little easier because it's like, it gets really hot

1301
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,900
and burns it from under.

1302
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,900
Oh yeah.

1303
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,900
And a pizza stone or a paddle, right?

1304
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,900
Like you can't, you know, if you could, if you just cook it on a baking sheet like my

1305
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,900
dad did, you know, it's not going to cook the same way.

1306
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,900
Yeah.

1307
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,900
But it's fine.

1308
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,900
No, I'm not complaining.

1309
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,900
I'm still.

1310
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,900
No, I'm hungry.

1311
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,900
Sorry, dad.

1312
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,900
Listen.

1313
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:32,900
Uh, this is the food cast for some reason.

1314
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,900
Um, did I mention that I'm making, I'm making Halloween gummies.

1315
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,900
I'm making Halloween gummy worms.

1316
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,900
Oh, you haven't.

1317
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
I'm making some orange.

1318
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,900
Oh yeah.

1319
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,260
I have, I have them, I have them laying out on a paper towel right now to sort of like

1320
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,900
dry out so I can put them into a cup together and they won't all become glued together.

1321
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,900
Uh, I tried to make orange and black ones.

1322
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,900
I didn't have like enough food coloring to make them like black black.

1323
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,900
So the black one just came out brown, but you know what?

1324
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,900
It's fine.

1325
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,900
This, they look good with the orange.

1326
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,900
So it's all right.

1327
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
Uh, it's spooky.

1328
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,900
I don't know.

1329
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,900
It's spooky.

1330
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,900
It's worms, but they're pumpkin worms.

1331
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:16,900
Worms like what will devour you in the gray food.

1332
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,900
Are you two doing anything for Halloween?

1333
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,900
Going to a party?

1334
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,900
I think I'm treating.

1335
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:28,900
I think, I think people might be, I think people are hanging out at Munchie's house for some

1336
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,900
kind of Halloween thing.

1337
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,900
I think I'll probably be there most likely.

1338
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,900
Yeah.

1339
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:42,900
I'm, I'm going to go see someone a friend and at home we're going to decorate and stuff.

1340
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,900
I don't really do like parties anyway.

1341
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,900
So it's just going to be a chill.

1342
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,900
No scary tonight.

1343
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,900
Just, just a bit of stuff.

1344
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,900
I guess I'm going to wear my gulf get up.

1345
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:01,900
I'm going to wear my full gulf get up that I have now with the corset and everything.

1346
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:02,900
I just remembered.

1347
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,900
I think, yeah, I think the, the, the Munchie place, I think they're doing like scary movies

1348
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,900
and I hate scary movies.

1349
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,900
That's not true.

1350
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:16,900
Sometimes I like them, but I think I'm, I think more that more often I don't like them.

1351
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:23,900
I like them except when I'm alone and I'm all alone in my apartment this whole weekend,

1352
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,900
including Halloween.

1353
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,900
And I'm like, I, this is your Netflix show.

1354
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,900
Um, like you know, the Toros, uh, cabinet of curiosities or something.

1355
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:38,900
It's like an oral anthology and I watched the first episode and was pretty good.

1356
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900
And I want to watch more, but then I was alone.

1357
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,900
I'm like, um, that's exactly.

1358
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,900
Yeah.

1359
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,900
Maybe I watch it when everyone's back in Halloween's over.

1360
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,900
Yes.

1361
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,900
I liked the witch.

1362
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,900
I did not like Midsommar.

1363
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,900
I did not like drag me to hell.

1364
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Like, you didn't like it or were you like grossed out or too horrified to enjoy it?

1365
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:10,900
I just, I thought it was extremely well, those are all, those are three very well made

1366
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,900
movies that I, two of them I just didn't enjoy.

1367
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:20,900
They, they, they, they, they gave me, I had the experience that the director wanted me to have

1368
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,900
and it was not an experience that I appreciated having.

1369
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,900
You know what I mean?

1370
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,900
Yeah.

1371
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Okay.

1372
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,900
I guess I get it.

1373
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:39,900
I, I like the feeling of being like scared or tense when in a scene in a film, but like,

1374
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,900
I don't really like sitting down knowing that I'm about to feel tense.

1375
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,900
I like, I don't sit, I don't put on a scary movie for that experience.

1376
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:58,900
I find video games are way better because like it's, it's not just that something's going to happen.

1377
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,900
Something's going to go boo at you.

1378
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,900
It's that something's going to go boo at you if you turn the corner and you have to be the one to turn

1379
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,900
the corner and then you'll scream loudly and you throw the control across the room.

1380
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,900
Like that, that feels fun.

1381
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:16,900
And, and I don't know, watching a film and I'm just sort of like, yeah, I'll pause it.

1382
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,900
I'll leave.

1383
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,900
I mean, I don't need to finish it.

1384
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,900
Yeah.

1385
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:28,900
Have you guys seen like the, wait, what's he called Jacob Geller YouTube videos?

1386
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,900
Video essays?

1387
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,900
I, I hate that guy.

1388
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,900
I think I know.

1389
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,900
You hate that guy?

1390
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,900
No, I don't really hate him, but I don't, I don't like his speech pattern.

1391
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:44,900
Did he, did he have that one video where it's like the thumbnail was, they weren't disabled and then it was like.

1392
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,900
No, that's, um, no, not, not Patrick Willem.

1393
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Uh, that's, uh, and shit.

1394
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,900
I know who you're talking about.

1395
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,900
Yeah.

1396
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:54,900
I never clicked on it.

1397
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,900
I remember that video, but I don't know who it was.

1398
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,900
It's the guy, it's the guy who did, he did that video about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

1399
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,900
Everybody did that.

1400
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,900
Oh.

1401
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,900
There's so many video essays on everything.

1402
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,900
Everybody, everybody and anybody who's done everything.

1403
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,900
Yeah, that guy's not really interesting.

1404
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:17,900
Um, but Jacob Geller, um, I've been watching his videos for the past two days because they're kind of spooky.

1405
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,900
I don't know.

1406
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:25,900
They have a, they have a weird atmosphere and he keeps talking about horrifying existential things.

1407
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:36,900
Um, he released a new video about like deep sea creatures and like the stories that people tell about like crackings and horrifying things.

1408
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:44,900
And he often combines that, uh, like little, um, snippets about indie video games about horrifying things.

1409
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,900
And that's cool.

1410
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:57,900
I like that he includes or he always includes like literature and video games and, um, different kinds of art and all kinds of mediums in the stories.

1411
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,900
Oh, I know this.

1412
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,900
Yeah, I watched the one he did about the Simpsons intro.

1413
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,900
Oh yeah, that one's also good.

1414
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Um, yeah, he's all right.

1415
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,900
It's just sort of like, yeah, it is that is Austin McConnell.

1416
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,900
Austin McConnell is the very disabled guy.

1417
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:28,900
But yeah, this guy, Jacob Geller, there's something about like, I don't know, heady topics in a thumbnail that I'm like, oh my God, this is going to be like, this is going to be so like epic.

1418
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,900
And I'm like, well, that's why I don't want to click on it.

1419
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:39,900
Like, it's like, oh, the, you know, the big, the big talk about the big thing, very serious.

1420
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,900
I'm like, oh, God, you know what?

1421
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,900
Fuck this.

1422
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,900
I'm going back to German.

1423
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:57,900
Um, Jacob Geller's cadence speaking is like, it's almost like he's doing like a spoken word poem in the way that he's like so modeling in his delivery and I find it really annoying.

1424
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,900
I have no, I have no hate towards this sort of style.

1425
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,900
It's just sort of, I don't know.

1426
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
I feel like I've gone past.

1427
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:12,900
I've grown out of enjoying taking, taking, taking videos seriously.

1428
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,900
I kind of, I kind of get what you mean.

1429
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:17,900
I think I get it.

1430
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:23,900
Yeah, I don't really, I don't really like religiously follow any like YouTuber anymore.

1431
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,900
I don't mean to, I don't mean to shit on your YouTube choices.

1432
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,900
I watched lots of stupid crap that I'm ashamed of.

1433
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:32,900
Yeah.

1434
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,900
Yeah.

1435
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,900
No, no, no, no hate.

1436
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:40,900
Um, what's, what's the worst, what's the worst thing I watched?

1437
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
The Mega Man lecture.

1438
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,900
That's, that's, I didn't even have one frame.

1439
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:54,900
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder if, I wonder if, I wonder if my, what's the word?

1440
01:10:54,900 --> 01:11:01,900
My divisive lefty politics will, will, will enrage the existing Mega Man YouTuber community.

1441
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:08,900
I wonder, I wonder if Twitter, I wonder if Reploid Revo will be mad that I, that I'm against the cops.

1442
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,900
I doubt it, but that would be really funny.

1443
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:27,900
There's, there's, there's a, there's a guy, there's a guy who has a channel called Reploid Revo and he just, he makes Mega Man videos and uh, he's, he's fine and all, but uh, I don't know.

1444
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:34,900
He's probably, he's a libertarian, he's gotta be a libertarian and I know that because his, his OC is yellow and black, just like the Gadsden flag.

1445
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,900
So that's the tell.

1446
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,900
I'm joking.

1447
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,900
Um, yeah, just yellow is just a sus color, just a sus color, I'm sorry.

1448
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,900
I'm trying to think of any yellow characters.

1449
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,900
There aren't any, there aren't any, I'm sorry.

1450
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Uh, April O'Neill.

1451
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,900
Bumblebee.

1452
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,900
Pikachu.

1453
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,900
Pedophiles, all of them.

1454
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,900
What?

1455
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,900
I missed what you said.

1456
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,900
I said they're, I said they're all pedophiles.

1457
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,900
Oh no, Pikachu.

1458
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,900
Pikachu, how could you?

1459
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,900
That's why it's been with Ash.

1460
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,900
It was too much power.

1461
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:19,900
He had too much, he had too much, he had too much unchecked power and too much access to kids.

1462
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,900
You know what, it's a, it's not a good combination.

1463
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,900
You know, we should have, we should have done something.

1464
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,900
I mean, Ash has been a kid for like 20 years, so.

1465
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,900
Yeah.

1466
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,900
And who do you think kept him that way?

1467
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:30,900
It was kids.

1468
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,900
Yeah.

1469
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,900
You know what, it makes a lot of sense when you think about it.

1470
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,900
Uh, um, who boy?

1471
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:56,900
He's, there's only, I saw another Mega Man video, it was posted like a couple weeks ago, and it was like every Mega Man game, but it was only an hour,

1472
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:02,900
pitifully the video was only an hour long, and it only covered the regular Mega Man games, like one through 11.

1473
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,900
So like, that's not even that many games, bro.

1474
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,900
Why, why would you, why would you even bother?

1475
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,900
Was, I don't forget who, I forget who posted that one.

1476
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,900
But I saw that.

1477
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,900
I started listening to it, and I was like, oh no.

1478
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,900
Oh no, he's saying some of the things that I said.

1479
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:25,900
Oh no, some of the facts that he's repeating are the same facts that I repeated.

1480
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,900
Oh fuck.

1481
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,900
I couldn't keep, I couldn't keep going.

1482
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,900
I was going to be sick.

1483
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,900
Turn it off, I couldn't take it.

1484
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,900
That feel when somebody has also talked about media that was public.

1485
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,900
What are you, could have been seen.

1486
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,900
You can't review this, this game.

1487
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:47,900
Uh, I was going to, I already made a review of that game on my side, on my part of the channel, on my...

1488
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,900
Don't do it, Critic, it's too bad.

1489
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,900
Don't do it.

1490
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,900
No, you'll, you'll, you'll cause a time paradox.

1491
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:06,900
It's called, the one I saw, it's called The Journey Through the Entire Mega Man Classic Series by Gilly the Kid.

1492
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:11,900
Beat me to the punch by two weeks, but it's okay, cause mine's bigger.

1493
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:20,900
Yeah, somebody asked me recently if I wanted to like make a podcast or something about the new Tolkien show.

1494
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:25,900
Uh, and I felt similarly that, like, this has been so thoroughly covered by now.

1495
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,900
Like, everyone's made a podcast about this.

1496
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:35,900
Do I have anything to say about this that other people haven't said better?

1497
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:44,900
It is just sort of like, the quality and quantity of stuff talking about media on YouTube is quite high.

1498
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:52,900
So, like, yeah, if somebody has talked about it, there's a chance that, like, many people have talked about it

1499
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,900
and somebody has done a lot of work and put a lot of effort to make a really good video.

1500
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:00,900
And it's like, well, I mean, fuck, what the hell can I add to this?

1501
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:06,900
Oh, I would say that, like, the thing that would drive me to say, yes, you should definitely do a podcast about it,

1502
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:13,900
is if, like, you were, you were hearing what people were saying about the show and you, like, disagreed with it,

1503
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,900
or you thought that, like, the discourse was lacking.

1504
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,900
Hmm. Or just, yeah.

1505
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:24,900
Maybe it's also, like, retapping the discourse, maybe, like, going back and showing a different side.

1506
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:29,900
Oh, my God. Just like, just like the Gibb and take a weekly analysis roundup.

1507
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,900
What were they called?

1508
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,900
Analysis assemblage.

1509
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,900
Analysis assemblage, yes. You got to do that, but for Tolkien podcasters.

1510
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,900
Oh, God.

1511
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,900
Rings of power.

1512
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,900
Oh, no. I really don't have time for that.

1513
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,900
No, no, no, no.

1514
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,900
I stopped doing that because I had to, like, watch people's reviews.

1515
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,900
And I was like, you know what? This sucks.

1516
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,900
I don't want to do this.

1517
01:15:52,900 --> 01:16:02,900
I don't want to go onto the My Little Pony, Brony fucking reviewer subreddit and find all of the Brony reviews of the episode

1518
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,900
and look through all of them and being like, did anybody have anything interesting to say?

1519
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,900
I guess this person did. Fuck.

1520
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:14,900
But isn't that what you had to do to make those videos is find the reviews and watch them? Yeah.

1521
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:20,900
I had to find them because, like, that's, yeah, it was just the easiest place because everyone was posting there.

1522
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,900
Well, I just came across too many people who were very boring.

1523
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,900
I think there was a person who did that with the, like, entire anime tube,

1524
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:33,900
like, like watching all anime analysis videos that would come out in a week and making a video about that.

1525
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,900
Oh, are you talking about Koon something?

1526
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:44,900
Is it Caribou Koon? Yeah. I remember watching that years ago, maybe.

1527
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,900
I think he's still doing it.

1528
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,900
I don't know. There aren't any anime YouTubers left.

1529
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:53,900
Like, that I watch. Are you? I used to watch that.

1530
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,900
That you watch, that you watch. Okay. No, sure. Yeah.

1531
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,900
I mean, I think Jeff is still around and does his thing.

1532
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:07,900
Isn't Giga around? Giga is around and Giga is part of the podcast that they do.

1533
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,900
Does he still make, like, anime videos? Probably.

1534
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,900
I've never watched Giga ever, so I don't know.

1535
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:23,900
I liked his comedy a few years ago. They were pretty funny, but also a little stupid.

1536
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:27,900
Sure. That's comedy sometimes is.

1537
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,900
Fuck, were we talking about? How did we get on this?

1538
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,900
We could talk about tomatoes. Let's go back.

1539
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,900
That's the most important topic.

1540
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,900
Wait, I could talk about...

1541
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,900
What if he carved a tomato for Halloween? How difficult would that be?

1542
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,900
If it's one of these big meaty beefy ones, that would work.

1543
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,900
You put a little candle in it.

1544
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:59,900
You just put some gasoline in it, set it up light, fire, like, billows out the top.

1545
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:04,900
I'll turn my house into a jack-o'-lantern by just lighting a fire in the middle of it.

1546
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:10,900
Wait, isn't it already a jack-o'-lantern? It's like a hollow thing with holes and light inside.

1547
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,900
When you think about it.

1548
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,900
The doors, the mouth.

1549
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:20,900
And when you think about it, all of us are jack-o'-lanterns because we ourselves are all hollow things.

1550
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,900
Wait, are you glowing from inside?

1551
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,900
Lit from the inside by the light of the Holy Spirit.

1552
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:32,900
Talk about yourself. I don't have a Holy Spirit.

1553
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:43,900
If you swallow a torch or your phone when your torch is on, then you'll have a light from inside.

1554
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:47,900
The Holy Spirit is based. It gives you buffs if you're an apostle.

1555
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,900
What if you're not an apostle? What if you're a Sylvester?

1556
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,900
Why would you not want to be an apostle?

1557
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,900
I don't know.

1558
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,900
Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

1559
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,900
I just looked it up.

1560
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,900
I just went to Google and I went to the Wikipedia page for Pentecost.

1561
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:11,900
It starts with Pentecost, also called Wit Sunday.

1562
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:17,900
But I dyslexia, spoonerismed reading it, and I read it as Pentecost, also called Shit Wednesday.

1563
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,900
I love Shit Wednesday.

1564
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,900
Is it Wit Sunday or it's counterpart Shit Wednesday?

1565
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,900
We call it Kingston.

1566
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,900
And they have a week off at Kingston, which is nice.

1567
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:35,900
Really?

1568
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,900
Yeah.

1569
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,900
A week off for fucking Pentecost?

1570
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,900
Yeah, for university.

1571
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,900
They say it's like for school trips and stuff, but then I went on a school trip one year,

1572
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,900
and it wasn't that week, and I missed a week off school.

1573
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,900
Why did you do this?

1574
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,900
Why did you not put it in that week that we have off anyways?

1575
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,900
Listen, listen, listen.

1576
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,900
Okay, okay.

1577
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:03,900
In Acts 2-1, the events that are celebrated at Pentecost, listen.

1578
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,900
Here's what happened.

1579
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,900
Be amazed by the power of the Holy Spirit.

1580
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:14,900
There is a mighty rushing wind, and tongues as of fire appear.

1581
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:19,900
The gathered disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues

1582
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,900
as the Spirit gave them utterance.

1583
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,900
What else, what else, what else?

1584
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,900
When you speak in tongues, is it like the Tasmanian Devil?

1585
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,900
Yes.

1586
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:37,900
Yes, if the Holy Spirit, it will give you buffs, it will give you flame fiery tongues,

1587
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,900
and you can talk different languages.

1588
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,900
So, beat that.

1589
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,900
You can't.

1590
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,900
What languages?

1591
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,900
Just other ones.

1592
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,900
Just the normal one.

1593
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:58,900
Probably like Aramaic, I guess, right?

1594
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,900
It was what Jesus spoke.

1595
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,900
So, yeah.

1596
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,900
Maybe they started speaking English.

1597
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:11,900
They started speaking Christian, a.k.a. modern American English,

1598
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:18,900
and they wrote the new version of the Bible called?

1599
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,900
Envy?

1600
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,900
No, no, no, like the Envy...

1601
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,900
Adams.

1602
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,900
No, shut up.

1603
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,900
Shut up.

1604
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,900
The new international version.

1605
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,900
They wrote the new international version.

1606
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,900
This was, yeah, they skipped the Greek.

1607
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,900
That's all, that's all fake.

1608
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,900
Hebrew, fake.

1609
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,900
Aramaic, fake.

1610
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,900
Okay, that's all.

1611
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,900
That's my joke.

1612
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,900
Good job, man.

1613
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,900
Let's move on.

1614
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,900
Let's move on really, really fast.

1615
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,900
But I can't, because I didn't do anything else this week, so...

1616
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,900
I could talk about what my life's been recently,

1617
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,900
which is distressing.

1618
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,900
Go for it.

1619
01:21:58,900 --> 01:21:59,900
Go for it.

1620
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,900
Oh, dear.

1621
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:01,900
It's the world.

1622
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:02,900
No, it's not that bad.

1623
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,900
It's just, you know, new semester starts,

1624
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,900
and I'm full of ambition.

1625
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,900
I want to do so many things,

1626
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,900
but I also get so many new homeworks and projects from school

1627
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:18,900
that it's those first few weeks where I don't have that much to do,

1628
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,900
but I want to do so many things,

1629
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,900
and it's a bit overwhelming,

1630
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,900
and I don't know where to start,

1631
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,900
but also it's cool, I don't know.

1632
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,900
What are you working on?

1633
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,900
Yeah, for example, for example.

1634
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,900
I have, well, just in general,

1635
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,900
I have a bunch of presentations I have to do

1636
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,900
in different classes on English things,

1637
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,900
like cover, bebop,

1638
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:48,900
and also I have an art project that I have to do this semester.

1639
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:55,900
I already did one last semester of the kind where I have to have an exhibition at the end.

1640
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,900
We do a big group exhibition in a gallery as a course,

1641
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,900
and we kind of have a completely free range on what we want to do there,

1642
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,900
and that's neat.

1643
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,900
Yeah, but last semester I kind of overdid it,

1644
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:14,900
and I did like six big full-detailed background illustrations

1645
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,900
that took me way too long,

1646
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,900
and I neglected my other courses,

1647
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,900
and that shouldn't happen again.

1648
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,900
So at the end, I was like,

1649
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,900
okay, I have to do this course again next semester,

1650
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,900
but next time I will only do one drawing, that's enough.

1651
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,900
Some people only did one painting, it's fine.

1652
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,900
I really don't have to do that much.

1653
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,900
But then the semester starts,

1654
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,900
and I'm like, what if I made a whole comic?

1655
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,900
What if I made a whole short animation film?

1656
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,900
So you're sure overloading yourself?

1657
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,900
Yeah, I'm fighting against it.

1658
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,900
Is the goal to get a good grade,

1659
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,900
or is the goal to make something that you want to make?

1660
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:01,900
Yeah, it's really doing something that I'm happy with,

1661
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,900
and also that it doesn't take too much time away

1662
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,900
from other things that I have to do.

1663
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,900
I have like four different presentations,

1664
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:15,900
and one exam, and this art project,

1665
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,900
and I also want to do my private art, of course,

1666
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:19,900
and maybe commissions.

1667
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,900
By the way, commission me, I need money, help me.

1668
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:29,900
And it's kind of crazy.

1669
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,900
One of the other things that I want to do

1670
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,900
is I want to finally get into making comics properly.

1671
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,900
I tried it before, I made, I mean,

1672
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,900
it's not that I tried it, I made comics.

1673
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,900
I made like a whole chapter of my comic never forest,

1674
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:48,900
but that was like two years ago, and it sucks now.

1675
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,900
I look at it and I hate it,

1676
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:53,900
and it don't want to touch it again.

1677
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,900
That's how it goes.

1678
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:58,900
It's just, I was really proud of it back then,

1679
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,900
and now I look at the faces and I'm like,

1680
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,900
ah, no.

1681
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:07,900
Yeah, well, that's, what do you call it?

1682
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,900
That's a...

1683
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,900
Improvement?

1684
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,900
Yeah, I guess so.

1685
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,900
That's artistic growth for you.

1686
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,900
Yeah.

1687
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:21,900
Well, I mean, I mean,

1688
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:25,900
I mean, I don't know, if you wanted to do a second chapter,

1689
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,900
there's nothing wrong with like the first pilot episode

1690
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,900
looking rough or whatever.

1691
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:32,900
Yeah.

1692
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,900
But, you know, I mean...

1693
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,900
I was actually thinking...

1694
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,900
Yeah, I was thinking of like,

1695
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,900
maybe reusing that idea in the future

1696
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,900
and making something different with it,

1697
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,900
because the story also wasn't that special or great.

1698
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,900
I found a lot of like long running web comics

1699
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,900
start as an obvious, like,

1700
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,900
this is not supposed to be a long-term project.

1701
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,900
I'm just drawing, you know, whatever.

1702
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:01,900
And then they slowly realize that this can become bigger

1703
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,900
and they start to improve the art and become more serious.

1704
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:08,900
And so chapter one looks completely different from like chapter 50.

1705
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,900
Yeah.

1706
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,900
And that's fine, because, you know,

1707
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:17,900
the only reason comics were so, like, rigidly,

1708
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:21,900
like, you know, well done from the first chapters

1709
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,900
because there's a rigorous, like, approval process

1710
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,900
before anything gets published in like physical print media.

1711
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,900
And on web comics, you can just make something

1712
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,900
and throw it out there.

1713
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:33,900
Yeah.

1714
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,900
So there's no problem.

1715
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,900
I mean, the beginning of Clarissa

1716
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,900
is gonna look a lot worse than the ending,

1717
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:44,900
based on just the two years it's been since I drew that,

1718
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,900
I guess, almost two years.

1719
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:48,900
Yeah.

1720
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,900
And that's okay.

1721
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:54,900
It's just, you know, it just sucks when a starting point,

1722
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,900
when you want to send someone the beginning of your comic,

1723
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,900
but that part is like the worst part.

1724
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,900
It's like, you know, I don't know.

1725
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,900
I wish I could, I wish I could start with a bang.

1726
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,900
But, well, whatever.

1727
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,900
It's better to make it finished

1728
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,900
and then figure out how to do that

1729
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,900
than it is to not, you know, continue.

1730
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,900
I mean, unless you really don't want to,

1731
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,900
but like...

1732
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,900
I worked on other ideas.

1733
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,900
I feel like the problem of people coming to chapter one

1734
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:28,900
and being like, oh, this doesn't look very good,

1735
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:34,900
is a lesser problem than not finishing things.

1736
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,900
That's the challenge.

1737
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,900
I haven't really...

1738
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,900
Okay, I worked on three comics, I guess, so far.

1739
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,900
I made Never Forest, just like the pilot pilot

1740
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,900
that had no planning

1741
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,900
and was just like 10 pages long

1742
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,900
and it sucked and I threw it away.

1743
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,900
Then I put more planning into Never Forest proper

1744
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:59,900
and that was like 30, 40 pages

1745
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,900
took me quite a while to draw

1746
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,900
and I don't really like it anymore.

1747
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,900
And then I have Midnight Mermaid,

1748
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:09,900
which is still ongoing, I guess.

1749
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,900
It's a comic I made with Asha.

1750
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,900
I wrote and she drew the characters

1751
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,900
and I drew backgrounds in the second chapter.

1752
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:22,900
But that one, I haven't really gotten to it.

1753
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:26,900
We published the first chapter, I think, in 2020

1754
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:30,900
and the second chapter more than a year later

1755
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:34,900
and I don't know when the third chapter is going to be.

1756
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,900
It's going to take too long.

1757
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,900
That's the problem, I don't know.

1758
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:45,900
You know, I've been having quite randomly

1759
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,900
without really meaning to.

1760
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,900
I've been having some champion-related

1761
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,900
world-building ideas lately.

1762
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,900
Thank you, I'm glad that's exciting for you.

1763
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,900
I was like, it's cool that you want to make more lectures in videos

1764
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,900
but I'm like, I like your comics, go make more comics too, please.

1765
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:13,900
Well, check out my newly up, my new Patreon page

1766
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,900
or I'll just tell you what it says.

1767
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,900
As I say on there, I do want to make more lectures

1768
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,900
but I'm not going to stop doing comics and stuff.

1769
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,900
I don't know if I'm...

1770
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,900
I don't know, my hope is that,

1771
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,900
okay, the lectures are kind of a hit, people like them.

1772
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:33,900
So if I can split my time between do those sometimes

1773
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:37,900
and then as my sort of side thing do comics and stuff,

1774
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,900
that would be fine and great.

1775
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:43,900
But the...

1776
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,900
What was I saying?

1777
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,900
Shit.

1778
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,900
Fuck.

1779
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
Champion idea.

1780
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,900
I guess I didn't really have anything else.

1781
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,900
I don't want to go into details about them.

1782
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,900
I don't know when I'll actually get around to drawing it

1783
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,900
but I've just had some thoughts across my mind about

1784
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,900
what if it was like that?

1785
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,900
What if that was going on?

1786
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,900
I wrote down some notes about it.

1787
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,900
I feel very inexperienced in storytelling

1788
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:18,900
and so it's pretty hard for me to go back

1789
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,900
to something I wrote years ago

1790
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,900
and I'm like, this all sucks, this is all boring,

1791
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,900
why did I do this?

1792
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:29,900
Yeah, it's hard.

1793
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:32,900
I was listing...

1794
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,900
In the intro paragraph to the new Patreon,

1795
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,900
I was listing projects I've done in the past

1796
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:38,900
and I left the champion off

1797
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,900
because I only listed things that I completed.

1798
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,900
So I didn't list the Winnie the Pooh videos or anything.

1799
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,900
I didn't list...

1800
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,900
I didn't list Biscopades.

1801
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,900
You can set up Vapors finished.

1802
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,900
Vapors was never going to be...

1803
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,900
It was always just going to be vignettes

1804
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,900
and I did three complete vignettes.

1805
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,900
So yeah, I would consider each Vapors story

1806
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,900
to be sort of its own complete thing.

1807
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,900
Yeah.

1808
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,900
Still need the physical release of the third one, though.

1809
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,900
Yeah, at some point, I guess I might as well.

1810
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,900
Although now that I'm basically done working on

1811
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,900
the Mega Man lecture,

1812
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,900
it means I have to get back to finishing up the...

1813
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,900
I have to go back to the Nightmare

1814
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,900
that was sorting out the Slime and Punishment Bookcake Starter.

1815
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:34,900
So I have to stop playing Inscription and start...

1816
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,900
I have to finish drawing the cover.

1817
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,900
I never finished drawing the cover.

1818
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,900
Ugh, yeah.

1819
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,900
There's just so much stuff.

1820
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,900
Yeah, that's what...

1821
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,900
I literally had kind of a crisis yesterday

1822
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,900
because there's so much stuff I want to do.

1823
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,900
I also have this completely different project

1824
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
that I came up with this year

1825
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,900
that was my last big art project

1826
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,900
for the exhibition in the summer.

1827
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,900
And it's the Draconic Drug Store

1828
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,900
I posted these illustrations on Twitter.

1829
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,900
Yes, with the Spider Man.

1830
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,900
Is he a guy? Man?

1831
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,900
Or is he a girl? I don't remember.

1832
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,900
Non-binary, more or less.

1833
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,900
Yeah, you know what? That makes sense.

1834
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,900
Yeah, their name is Jitter.

1835
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:23,900
And it's supposed to be this goofy, wacky cast

1836
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,900
of monster characters

1837
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:30,900
that live in this drug store

1838
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:34,900
where they cure horrible, fantastic diseases.

1839
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,900
And it's supposed to be this mash-up of fantasy

1840
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:42,900
and modern life and aesthetics.

1841
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,900
And also the thing that I specifically like,

1842
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,900
is getting fantasy creatures

1843
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:52,900
and designing them with natural animals in mind

1844
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:56,900
or different natural aesthetics.

1845
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,900
I think that's neat.

1846
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,900
So Jitter is specifically designed

1847
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,900
after the African social spider,

1848
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,900
which is a spider that lives in giant colonies

1849
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:12,900
and makes big web constructions.

1850
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,900
Are spiders living in a social group?

1851
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,900
Let's make them hive mind

1852
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,900
and have them inhabit a puppet.

1853
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,900
And yeah.

1854
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:26,900
Okay, I saw something on Twitter the other day

1855
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:31,900
and it was about a spider that builds an effigy of itself.

1856
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,900
A what?

1857
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:38,900
It builds a statue of a spider

1858
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,900
out of debris.

1859
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,900
Yeah.

1860
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,900
If you could link that, that sounds amazing.

1861
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,900
Why would it do this?

1862
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,900
Is it lonely?

1863
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,900
Nobody knows.

1864
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,900
Is it like a body pillow?

1865
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,900
What?

1866
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,900
Yeah.

1867
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,900
It's lonely for a spider.

1868
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:02,900
Well, this was the tweet that I saw

1869
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,900
and I get all my science facts from Twitter users

1870
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,900
who I don't recognize.

1871
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,900
The best source.

1872
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,900
Yeah, even though my internet is perfectly fine

1873
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,900
to handle this call,

1874
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:17,900
Discord is having a really hard time

1875
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,900
sending a text-based Twitter link.

1876
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,900
It's really struggling with all those bits,

1877
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,900
so you're just going to have to wait.

1878
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,900
That sounds awesome.

1879
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,900
Oh, there it goes.

1880
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:35,900
Nobody knows why the spider in the Philippines does this.

1881
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:39,900
Maybe it's like a scarecrow

1882
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:43,900
in the same way that you would put a scarecrow to scare crows away.

1883
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,900
It's like a spider.

1884
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,900
What's a track fly?

1885
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,900
Exactly.

1886
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,900
What's a track thing to its web?

1887
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,900
It wants to find masochist flies.

1888
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,900
Oh, God.

1889
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,900
Maybe there's spiders who steal webs

1890
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,900
and he's like, this is mine.

1891
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,900
There's already a spider here, so you can't take my web.

1892
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:03,900
I'm going to go for a walk.

1893
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:07,900
It might be some partner attraction thingy.

1894
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:10,900
Oh, the person who owns this web is huge.

1895
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:11,900
Look at that spider.

1896
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,900
I'm going to go say hello.

1897
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:15,900
That might actually be it.

1898
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,900
If male spiders look for specifically the largest female spiders

1899
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,900
because they are the healthiest or something,

1900
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:26,900
maybe smaller female spiders will create this big fake spider

1901
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,900
to attract males or something like that.

1902
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:32,900
I don't know why it's so fascinating to me,

1903
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,900
but they've got the number of legs correct.

1904
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,900
Spiders can count.

1905
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:37,900
That's what I looked at, too.

1906
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,900
I was like, wait, does it know how many legs a spider had?

1907
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:41,900
And I counted.

1908
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,900
Like, yes, it has eight legs.

1909
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:46,900
You know how many legs you have.

1910
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,900
I'm a human.

1911
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,900
I can count to two.

1912
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:56,900
And also, I mean, I guess it must be an instinctual thing.

1913
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,900
It's just so funny.

1914
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,900
It's humanizing the spider to me.

1915
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,900
It's like a little sculptor.

1916
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,900
I'm sorry.

1917
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,900
I know what a spider looks like from above.

1918
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,900
Absolutely fascinating.

1919
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,900
And I will probably incorporate that into Jidder's personality.

1920
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:17,900
Maybe Jidder can make a decoy spider or like doubles of themselves.

1921
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:21,900
In one of the tweets below it, they linked to like an article

1922
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,900
and I'm embarrassed to admit that I did a double take

1923
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,900
at the name of the island that the spider lives on.

1924
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,900
I'm really sorry.

1925
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,900
It's OK.

1926
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:33,900
It's just a kind of...

1927
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,900
Forgive me.

1928
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,900
It's just a kind of like Spanish or something.

1929
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,900
Exactly, exactly.

1930
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,900
Anyway, I just thought this was really weird.

1931
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,900
Yeah, that was the first thing I was like.

1932
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:52,900
Because someone replied like, oh my God, the spider knows what it looks like.

1933
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,900
Yeah, it has a sense of self.

1934
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,900
Like, that's crazy.

1935
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,900
Just a little guy.

1936
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,900
You know, they train elephants to paint pictures of themselves,

1937
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,900
but the elephant doesn't know that it's painting itself.

1938
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,900
They train the elephant to do like a series of brushstrokes

1939
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,900
that sort of end up looking like an elephant.

1940
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,900
The elephant is not consciously being like,

1941
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,900
this is what I look like and I'm going to paint myself.

1942
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,900
But this is like...

1943
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,900
The spider doesn't either.

1944
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:21,900
You don't think so?

1945
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,900
No, it's probably just like with anything.

1946
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,900
I mean, spiders are able to build beautiful webs

1947
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:30,900
that look super symmetric and accurate.

1948
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:31,900
Yeah.

1949
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,900
And there's like, I don't know,

1950
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,900
paradise birds who make weird, interesting patterns in the sand

1951
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,900
for their mates.

1952
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,900
Well, that's sort of an instinctual...

1953
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,900
Yeah.

1954
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:44,900
But like, I don't know why a spider would instinctually know

1955
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:49,900
that if they wanted to build a facsimile of themselves,

1956
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:52,900
they would do four legs, eight legs with a circle.

1957
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:56,900
What if that's a bit of a coincidence or something?

1958
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:57,900
I mean...

1959
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:00,900
What if they just follow their web pattern

1960
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,900
because it looks like it's in the middle of their web

1961
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:06,900
and the legs might just be placed on...

1962
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,900
There's probably more than eight strokes.

1963
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:09,900
The web is...

1964
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,900
I don't think, yeah, the web is not...

1965
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:12,900
Yeah.

1966
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,900
I mean, it could be...

1967
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:17,900
I'm just wondering if we're over-interpreting this

1968
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:18,900
and we see a spider,

1969
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,900
but to the spider, it's just a badge with a bunch of lines around it.

1970
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:23,900
What a...

1971
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,900
Yeah, I mean, I wonder if maybe if we looked at more of these,

1972
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,900
if they don't all look so clean and spider-like.

1973
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,900
Yeah.

1974
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:30,900
I suppose.

1975
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:35,900
I like the idea that spiders, for some reason, know what they look like.

1976
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,900
I would like to know...

1977
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,900
Yeah, I would like to know why it does this.

1978
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,900
Like, what is the purpose of this construction?

1979
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,900
I mean, spiders know what they look like

1980
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:48,900
in the sense that any animal can recognize their mates

1981
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,900
because they have to.

1982
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:51,900
Yeah.

1983
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:55,900
The spider knows when they meet another one of their own species.

1984
01:38:55,900 --> 01:39:03,900
It's just like a bear couldn't build a crude statue of a bear.

1985
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,900
Well, bears don't build things anyway.

1986
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:07,900
That's true.

1987
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:08,900
A beaver, then.

1988
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:12,900
A beaver wouldn't shape its dam to look like another beaver.

1989
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,900
I hope he's sick, though.

1990
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,900
It's just like an intimidation tactic.

1991
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,900
Like, there's a huge beaver here.

1992
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:20,900
Don't do not come close.

1993
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,900
That's so scary.

1994
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,900
Cool.

1995
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:25,900
Pretty cool.

1996
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:30,900
But like, this is a view of a spider from above, essentially.

1997
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:34,900
And spiders, I imagine, meet each other on the same plane.

1998
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:35,900
They can see each other.

1999
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:38,900
They can't see that far in the, like, ahead of them.

2000
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,900
Yeah, I'm not even sure how well it sees.

2001
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:45,900
They might just sense themselves in different ways.

2002
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:49,900
Because they could probably use their legs to rub against their other legs

2003
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,900
and be like, yeah, I got one leg there.

2004
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:52,900
Another leg there.

2005
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,900
And there's a big smell.

2006
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:59,900
Well, you know, bees can do multiplication.

2007
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:07,900
Yeah, but bees also have a language like they dance for each other

2008
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,900
to communicate how far the flower is away.

2009
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,900
Yeah, I saw a movie.

2010
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:17,900
There was a, I read about an experiment where they did,

2011
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,900
they would put out, they had took a beehive

2012
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:23,900
and they put out, like, sugar water or, you know, pollen or whatever

2013
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,900
for these bees to, like, eat.

2014
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:28,900
And they moved the location of the pollen.

2015
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:32,900
Like, they tried moving it, like, you know, 10 feet away.

2016
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,900
And then the next day it would be, like, 20 feet away.

2017
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,900
And the next day it'd be, like, 30 feet away.

2018
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,900
And the bees eventually figured out the pattern

2019
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,900
and they would predict they knew where it was going to be.

2020
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,900
And then they even tried it with a multiplication.

2021
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,900
They would put it, like, 2 feet away and then 4 feet away

2022
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:46,900
and then 8 feet away.

2023
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:49,900
And the bees were able to figure out that pattern too.

2024
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,900
They were like, oh, every day it's twice as far.

2025
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,900
So they would, like, be there already.

2026
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
They would be there already.

2027
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,900
So they would be 16 feet away being like, where's the pollen?

2028
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,900
Where is it?

2029
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:00,900
Exactly.

2030
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:01,900
Exactly.

2031
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,900
And me dancing is interesting because it's kind of fucking

2032
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:09,900
with one of the definitions of what, like, human language means.

2033
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,900
I learned about this in the first semester, I think,

2034
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:16,900
that, like, human language has the feature of displacement.

2035
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,900
So we can talk about things that aren't true.

2036
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:20,900
We can make things up.

2037
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,900
And we can talk about things that aren't

2038
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,900
in, like, our immediate surroundings.

2039
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,900
We can tell stories about things that we can't see.

2040
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,900
And most animals can't do that,

2041
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,900
even though they can communicate, like, dogs talk to each other, basically.

2042
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,900
But they can never talk about something that's not true

2043
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,900
or that's not there.

2044
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,900
But bees actually have a form of displacement

2045
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:39,900
because they can do that.

2046
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:43,900
They can talk about, they can tell their people about, like,

2047
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,900
a flower that is, like, kilometers away.

2048
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,900
And that's pretty crazy.

2049
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,900
I don't think they could make up stories about flowers,

2050
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,900
though I'm not sure if that's a thing.

2051
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:52,900
But that would be fascinating.

2052
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,900
Yeah, maybe more moral than humans.

2053
01:41:54,900 --> 01:42:00,900
I would be surprised if bees have, like, a sense of, like, narrative.

2054
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,900
No, probably not.

2055
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:03,900
Probably not.

2056
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:04,900
Yeah.

2057
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,900
But, I mean, there's other animals, like, dolphins, for example,

2058
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,900
that have, like, very complex languages

2059
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:14,900
that people wonder if that maybe there's more to it.

2060
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:19,900
Maybe they can actually be, like, playful or creative.

2061
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:23,900
If we made, we've designed a new special iPad

2062
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,900
that dolphins can use underwater.

2063
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,900
They boop the thing with their nose.

2064
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:32,900
And we've discovered they've invented their own form of mean.

2065
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,900
And they send it to each other.

2066
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:40,900
You ever see a video of, like, a monkey reacting to, like, a magic trick?

2067
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,900
Yeah, I've seen some of those.

2068
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:43,900
Some of them are fake.

2069
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,900
I don't like the fake ones.

2070
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,900
I don't know if the one I'm thinking of is fake or not.

2071
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,900
There's a few that are, like, CGI.

2072
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:52,900
And I'm like, you fuck.

2073
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,900
It's easy enough to make a monkey be, like, what?

2074
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:57,900
Where'd it go?

2075
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:58,900
That's fun.

2076
01:42:58,900 --> 01:42:59,900
That's all you need.

2077
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:03,900
Well, I saw one where, like, someone does a little, like,

2078
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,900
makes, like, a handkerchief disappear or something.

2079
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:09,900
And the monkey, like, kind of, like, sort of, like, opened its mouth,

2080
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:13,900
kind of, like, put its hands to its face, kind of, like, was, like, looking around

2081
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:17,900
and sort of, like, started, like, jumping and, like, looking back at, like, where it was.

2082
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,900
It seemed real enough, I don't know.

2083
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,900
Yeah, they're subtle.

2084
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,900
The fake ones.

2085
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:27,900
There was one that, I mean, I'm not entirely sure.

2086
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,900
It's just sort of, like, I couldn't tell how it could have been done.

2087
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:35,900
But there was a guy who put a playing card up against the glass.

2088
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:38,900
And he pushed it through the glass.

2089
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,900
And it was on the other side of the glass, inside the orangutan enclosure.

2090
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:46,900
And the orangutan, like, looked at it and tapped it and picked it up.

2091
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,900
And that was fake.

2092
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:53,900
And then he tried to push the thing back through the glass and he tapped it with a stick.

2093
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,900
Because he thought, like, oh, I can push it through too.

2094
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,900
And I thought that was real.

2095
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:02,900
But then I was like, how the fuck did he put the thing through the glass in the first place?

2096
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,900
That is, yeah.

2097
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:08,900
That seems like more of a camera trick than it was a magic trick.

2098
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:14,900
Well, I mean, I guess magic tricks and camera tricks are the same thing, but you know what I mean.

2099
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,900
No, a camera trick is not a magic trick.

2100
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:23,900
Like the monkeys, the orangutan seemed a little confused, but I don't know.

2101
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,900
You know, magic is just technology that we don't understand.

2102
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,900
Like cameras, I don't understand them.

2103
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:38,900
Magic tricks are not the same as camera tricks, but, like, a lot of magic is about, like,

2104
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:42,900
making you look in the place so that they can do a special thing.

2105
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,900
Yeah, sure.

2106
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:48,900
And so, like, you can not edit the footage, but still use camera trickery

2107
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:51,900
to make it hard for you to notice something happening.

2108
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,900
Yeah, okay, that's fair.

2109
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:01,900
But I feel like that one particular was just CGA and there was already a card on the other side of the glass.

2110
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:07,900
Well, wait, just to finish about the Draconic Dragstore.

2111
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:08,900
Yes.

2112
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:15,900
So I came up with an idea because I want to have, like, characters that have a world

2113
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:20,900
that I can tell stories about, that I can make narrative illustrations about,

2114
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,900
and explore that whole thing.

2115
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:28,900
And then I made that big project for school and, like, explore that entire house.

2116
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:32,900
By the way, I built the entire house in Minecraft to have reference pictures.

2117
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:33,900
Nice.

2118
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:38,900
Like, in a bigger scale to, like, get all the angles right.

2119
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,900
So, yeah, that was fun.

2120
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:45,900
But after that, I was kind of burned out on the project.

2121
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:48,900
And I was like, I need to get back to it.

2122
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:49,900
I want to make a comic about them.

2123
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:55,900
I want to make a comic with my, like, five people cast of wacky creatures.

2124
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:02,900
And it's, like, it's hard to think where to start.

2125
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:08,900
It's, like, having a complex cast of characters is really overwhelming.

2126
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,900
Yeah.

2127
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:18,900
I have had, like, a big project in mind for a long time.

2128
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,900
I don't really want to spoil too much.

2129
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,900
But essentially, I think I've mentioned this part before,

2130
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:27,900
is that comics that I make eventually will coincide.

2131
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:31,900
So, like, Clarissa will meet Pumk at some point.

2132
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:35,900
The Lord of Ghosts characters will meet everyone else.

2133
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:38,900
And then there's a bunch of other comics with characters I haven't made yet,

2134
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:44,900
which will also be part of, like, this big, super cinematic universe thing.

2135
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,900
Going to make your own end game.

2136
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:48,900
Yeah.

2137
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:49,900
But, like, better.

2138
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:51,900
Because I don't like Marvel.

2139
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:52,900
But actually good, though.

2140
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,900
Because it's got my characters in it.

2141
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:55,900
I haven't seen that game.

2142
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:56,900
Maybe it's great.

2143
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:57,900
Maybe it's a masterpiece.

2144
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:58,900
That's probably good.

2145
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:02,900
I haven't seen anything beyond the first Avengers.

2146
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,900
So, like, that...

2147
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,900
It's a huge idea.

2148
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:11,900
And, like, it's kind of stupid.

2149
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:16,900
But I've sort of...

2150
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:23,900
I've not, like, focused too heavily on, like, making it perfect.

2151
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:28,900
Like, making everything fit perfectly and then having, you know,

2152
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,900
parts of one comic, like, foreshadow other things

2153
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:35,900
and having everything perfectly planned out.

2154
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:38,900
Because I realized that planning everything out on such a large scale

2155
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:42,900
would mean that I would be planning my comic career

2156
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,900
for the next 20 years and then not post anything.

2157
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,900
So, instead, I'm just going to work on Clarissa.

2158
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,900
I'm going to make that.

2159
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:51,900
Then I'm going to...

2160
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,900
Maybe I'm going to finish the Lord of Ghosts.

2161
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,900
Then there's some other things to do.

2162
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,900
Bail Jape, too.

2163
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,900
Punk will have to return at some point.

2164
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:01,900
I don't even know how.

2165
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:02,900
Zuggling many balls.

2166
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:03,900
Yeah.

2167
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:08,900
But, like, the point, I think, is to have this cool, huge story

2168
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,900
and then to not think about it too hard.

2169
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:14,900
And then do, like, the individual parts.

2170
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,900
Yeah, do the individual parts.

2171
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,900
Start it.

2172
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,900
I don't even know what it would be called.

2173
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:24,900
My problem was also a bit that, like, in that big project

2174
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,900
about, like, the different rooms of the Draconic drugstore,

2175
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,900
I essentially spent, like, three, four months

2176
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,900
just drawing these rooms and planning them out

2177
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:34,900
and thinking about how this house works.

2178
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:37,900
And that's all cool, but it doesn't really tell a story.

2179
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:41,900
Like, I don't really make people care about these characters

2180
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,900
by planning out this house in much detail.

2181
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:44,900
Oh, yeah.

2182
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,900
It's fun, but, like...

2183
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:50,900
It's extremely fun to flesh out the lore.

2184
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:55,900
Like, I've got, like, a origin of, like, the universe,

2185
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,900
sort of lore part.

2186
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,900
Like, why roll these things the way they are?

2187
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,900
Well, you see, millions of years ago,

2188
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:03,900
and I'm like, I wrote a little thing, and I'm like,

2189
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,900
oh, this is so fucking sick.

2190
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:09,900
I can't wait for one of the comic characters far in the future

2191
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,900
to be, like, millions of years ago,

2192
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:13,900
and they just say the lore that I came up with.

2193
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:15,900
And they just say it.

2194
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,900
It would be fucking so cool.

2195
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:20,900
I can't wait until the dramatic conclusion

2196
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:23,900
wherein Clarissa and the Lord of Ghosts

2197
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:28,900
and Pump are all unicorn jelly-style,

2198
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,900
billions of years in the future,

2199
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,900
existing as, like, abstract mathematical symbols

2200
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,900
in a space beyond time.

2201
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:36,900
Yes.

2202
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,900
That's what I'm looking forward to.

2203
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,900
I forgot what I was gonna...

2204
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,900
What was I getting at?

2205
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,900
So you were talking about a character in the future,

2206
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:49,900
like, bringing up the origin of the universe?

2207
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,900
Oh, no, not that.

2208
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,900
Just sort of...

2209
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:57,900
Yeah, it's fun to obsess over the lore

2210
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:58,900
and get it all right.

2211
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,900
And I would say every time you have a cool new idea,

2212
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:02,900
write it down immediately,

2213
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:04,900
and then figure out how you're gonna fit it in later.

2214
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,900
I started off that recently.

2215
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,900
I started actually using, like, one note

2216
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,900
and making folders for ideas

2217
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:13,900
and, like, putting them all down.

2218
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,900
You can figure out the details

2219
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,900
the minutiae later,

2220
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,900
but it's fun to write it down when you think of it.

2221
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:22,900
But a great example

2222
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:28,900
of a naturally-evolving set of lore

2223
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,900
and characters

2224
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,900
is a Batman and Spider-Man,

2225
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,900
the animated series on YouTube.

2226
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:38,900
Have you ever seen Batman and Spider-Man?

2227
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,900
A little bit, a little bit.

2228
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:41,900
It sort of...

2229
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:46,900
It starts out as, like, a goofy-looking Batman character

2230
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:47,900
and a Spider-Man,

2231
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:48,900
and they say,

2232
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:49,900
I'm Batman.

2233
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:50,900
I'm Spider-Man.

2234
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:51,900
We come over to the house.

2235
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,900
Sounds like a PSP voicemail.

2236
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:54,900
We are best friends,

2237
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,900
and they're just, like, Batman and Spider-Man.

2238
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,900
They're just hanging out in the house,

2239
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:01,900
and it's, like, really, like, dumb and fun and cute.

2240
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:02,900
Yeah.

2241
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:05,900
And over time, like, they introduce characters,

2242
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,900
and then the characters have wacky adventures

2243
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,900
because they live in a world where anything could happen.

2244
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:10,900
It's kind of like adventure time.

2245
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:11,900
It's just sort of...

2246
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,900
Because anything could happen,

2247
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:14,900
anything does happen,

2248
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:17,900
and then things that happen remain

2249
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,900
in the lore of the show,

2250
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:22,900
so another episode can happen,

2251
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:25,900
and the characters from before can still exist to there,

2252
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:26,900
and there's sort of...

2253
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:27,900
It just sort of builds.

2254
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:28,900
It's really fun to watch.

2255
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:31,900
I would very much recommend watching all of that

2256
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,900
because it's not that long.

2257
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:38,900
There's definitely stories where they feel so free-flowing

2258
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:41,900
that I feel like would be easier to write for them.

2259
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:43,900
Like, I'm not...

2260
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,900
I'm thinking about Calvary Beaver a lot recently.

2261
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:49,900
Like, every episode is kind of just something completely new,

2262
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,900
and they...

2263
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:52,900
It's the same premise,

2264
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,900
but they do something new with it

2265
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,900
on a different planet,

2266
01:51:56,900 --> 01:52:00,900
in a different set of supporting characters,

2267
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:04,900
and it's very appealing to me.

2268
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,900
And I mean,

2269
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:12,900
my favorite example of someone who just started writing

2270
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,900
and then figured things out is Tolkien himself,

2271
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:18,900
because he's a weird freak of nature,

2272
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:21,900
and the way he wrote was,

2273
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:24,900
oh yes, I'm gonna start at Bilbo's birthday

2274
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,900
and then I'm gonna send them on an adventure,

2275
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:29,900
and whenever something happened in the story,

2276
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:31,900
he was like, huh, what does this mean?

2277
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:34,900
What are the larger implications of this?

2278
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,900
Let's find out.

2279
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:38,900
Like, he didn't really plan much ahead,

2280
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,900
and that's why...

2281
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:42,900
I don't know how he did it,

2282
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:46,900
but like, it somehow in the end all fit into a larger narrative,

2283
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,900
but he just went along.

2284
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:51,900
He changed a few bits, like in retrospect,

2285
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,900
I think like Aragorn when he first meets the Hobbits.

2286
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,900
In the original script,

2287
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:00,900
he used to be a Hobbit himself too.

2288
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:03,900
Instead of Strider, he was called Trotter.

2289
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:07,900
I mean, Frodo's name was also Bingo at that time.

2290
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:09,900
Bingo. Bingo.

2291
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,900
Bingo and Bilbo sounds like a monkey.

2292
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,900
Yeah, they should have kept that.

2293
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:15,900
But at some point, he was just like,

2294
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:19,900
huh, this Trotter guy, he seems not that Hobbit-y.

2295
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,900
He might be a human.

2296
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:23,900
What kind of human would he be?

2297
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:26,900
And as he was writing it, he was developing this backstory,

2298
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,900
and I'm like, it's like, he just started.

2299
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:32,900
He just started and went off in a crazy, creative direction

2300
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,900
and made a masterpiece.

2301
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:40,900
I really shouldn't spend years planning houses or whatever.

2302
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,900
That sounds like the way to do it.

2303
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:46,900
Yeah, I mean, for sure, he went back and iterated

2304
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:49,900
and like, changed a few things.

2305
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:51,900
The first draft is never the best draft,

2306
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:54,900
but once you have a first draft,

2307
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,900
it's so much easier to write a compelling story

2308
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,900
because you have a story that already exists

2309
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
and you're like, yeah, I mean,

2310
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,900
this part would be better if it was like this, actually.

2311
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:08,900
So you just change it and then you have, you know,

2312
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:11,900
a story that had a good foundation

2313
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:16,900
and then you made it better by tweaking a few things later.

2314
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:18,900
So it's always good to get a first draft out,

2315
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:21,900
even if you don't release it immediately.

2316
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,900
Yeah, or draw it when it's a comic.

2317
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,900
Yeah, I mean, that's definitely a thing.

2318
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,900
I always write the comics before I draw them.

2319
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,900
Yeah, I would think drawing takes,

2320
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,900
I mean, it takes me much longer than to write something.

2321
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:37,900
But even for me, it's like, when I'm sketching something,

2322
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:41,900
I'm like, you know, I'm reading this the way I'm turning the pages

2323
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:46,900
and I'm like, something sucks about this.

2324
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,900
I've got to change something.

2325
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:50,900
You can go back and change it.

2326
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,900
And because I had all of those sketches,

2327
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:56,900
I could read it and figure out that something was needed.

2328
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,900
So it's always better to have something to work with

2329
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,900
rather than planning it out

2330
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,900
and then hoping that your plan will work,

2331
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,900
because it most likely will not.

2332
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,900
Yeah.

2333
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:10,900
Just because of the lack of information you have

2334
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,900
while you're making the plan, you have zero information.

2335
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:15,900
You're making it from scratch.

2336
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,900
And so seeing the finished product,

2337
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:19,900
if it's perfectly to the plan

2338
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:23,900
and you didn't change anything as you were going,

2339
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:27,900
you might at the very end realize that the plan was flawed

2340
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:29,900
and you're like, dang.

2341
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,900
Fuck.

2342
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:35,900
That's why it's good to iterate as you go.

2343
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,900
Yeah.

2344
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:42,900
I was thinking that I might focus on telling mini stories first

2345
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:46,900
just to get myself writing and practicing

2346
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,900
and getting to know the characters a bit

2347
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,900
without having the pressure of having everything

2348
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:55,900
to be canonical and important for an overarching story.

2349
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:57,900
Yeah.

2350
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,900
Honestly, I should do that as well.

2351
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,900
Yeah.

2352
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:04,900
Just like short stories with punk or whatever.

2353
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,900
Mini comics.

2354
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,900
We already have the mini red man comics.

2355
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,900
By the way, I celebrated his return.

2356
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,900
It was great.

2357
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,900
The singular post of return where he has goofy teeth now.

2358
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,900
Yes.

2359
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:20,900
Very spooky, too.

2360
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:24,900
I like to think he got inspired by the mouse.

2361
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,900
Oh, the mouse vampire?

2362
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,900
Yes.

2363
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,900
And the red man was like, oh, that's spooky now,

2364
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,900
having cute mouse teeth.

2365
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,900
Yeah.

2366
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,900
They got the same teeth.

2367
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,900
They got to be the same teeth.

2368
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:40,900
It's exactly the same.

2369
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,900
I don't know what he got into.

2370
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,900
Maybe red man killed her and is using her teeth for real.

2371
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,900
He thought, oh, it's a vampire.

2372
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:49,900
She must be full of blood.

2373
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,900
So he ate her, but he's like, oh, there's just cheese.

2374
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,900
It's disgusting.

2375
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,900
Oh, but at least I got all the sweet teeth.

2376
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:58,900
Red man is a vampire, right?

2377
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,900
Like a vampire in its purest form.

2378
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:04,900
Um, I don't, I mean, how would you describe it?

2379
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,900
He's not like magical.

2380
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,900
He just eats a lot of blood.

2381
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:11,900
That's true, but vampire bats aren't magical either.

2382
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,900
It's the vampire.

2383
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:14,900
Sure.

2384
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,900
I mean, what do you mean when you say vampire?

2385
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:17,900
Do you mean drink the blood?

2386
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:18,900
I don't know.

2387
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:19,900
I was just like, yeah, he drinks blood.

2388
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:20,900
Yeah, that's the thing.

2389
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:21,900
That's it.

2390
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:22,900
That's all.

2391
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:24,900
Well, hell, I could be a vampire.

2392
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:27,900
Every time I cut my lips and I suck the blood out,

2393
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:29,900
I'm a vampire.

2394
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:32,900
Eat a delicious black pudding.

2395
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,900
No.

2396
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,900
If you think that's delicious, yes, you are a vampire.

2397
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:37,900
I do.

2398
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:39,900
I do like black pudding, actually.

2399
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:40,900
It's good, actually.

2400
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:43,900
Everyone who doesn't like it is just a hater.

2401
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,900
Yeah, it's fine.

2402
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:48,900
It's just sort of like a little meaty something or other.

2403
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,900
Yeah.

2404
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:50,900
Yeah.

2405
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:52,900
Hell yeah.

2406
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,900
Ew, gross.

2407
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,900
Ew, haggis or whatever.

2408
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:57,900
Ew, gross.

2409
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:01,900
Are you telling me that food is made of parts of a dead animal?

2410
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:02,900
Well, let me tell you.

2411
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,900
Let me tell you something, buddy.

2412
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:07,900
There's more where that came from.

2413
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:08,900
I don't like that.

2414
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:11,900
Chicken nuggets are more gross than black pudding,

2415
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:13,900
but they taste better.

2416
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:14,900
So, yeah.

2417
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:15,900
Who's the real winner?

2418
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,900
Yeah.

2419
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:17,900
Okay.

2420
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:18,900
All right.

2421
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,900
I'm not saying they're as good as chicken nuggets.

2422
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:23,900
Just that it's good is all.

2423
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,900
Did you hear that?

2424
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,900
Sauron's straight.

2425
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:30,900
Was he not straight originally?

2426
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:34,900
Well, well, not very.

2427
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,900
I mean, not very.

2428
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:39,900
There's a lot of queer readings on Sauron specifically

2429
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:41,900
because he is...

2430
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:46,900
Sauron takes on a fair form to seduce the man of Middle Earth

2431
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:50,900
and seduce the elves to make rings and stuff like that.

2432
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:52,900
And there's a lot of people who say...

2433
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,900
I mean, it's a classic...

2434
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:55,900
Okay.

2435
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:58,900
I guess you could read it that way.

2436
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,900
It is a classic boomer thing to make your villain

2437
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:04,900
of your thing that you're writing gay-coded

2438
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:06,900
because gays are evil.

2439
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:10,900
And it's just sort of become like a popular thing in media

2440
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:12,900
from then.

2441
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:13,900
Is there something to it?

2442
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,900
Because it sounds like you're just deliberately

2443
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,900
misunderstanding the words seduce there.

2444
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:24,900
Well, it's complicated, but...

2445
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:28,900
You have to point to some clear sexual tension

2446
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:31,900
between him and a person.

2447
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,900
I think there's people who say,

2448
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,900
researchers have said that queerness goes beyond that.

2449
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:44,900
It's just a rejection of societal norms in a certain way.

2450
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:47,900
What the fuck are you talking about?

2451
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:52,900
There's a bit more to queer theory than just being gay.

2452
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:56,900
I don't know too much about it, but the point...

2453
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:59,900
Okay, so your argument is...

2454
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:04,900
Yes, Sauron was never attracted to any men,

2455
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:09,900
but he's gay-coded and that counts.

2456
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:10,900
That's what you're saying.

2457
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:13,900
He's just got gay vibes.

2458
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:17,900
That is a very popular interpretation of Sauron.

2459
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,900
That sucks.

2460
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:26,900
I mean, look up Sauron Melkor and see all the hot fan arts

2461
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,900
that there are.

2462
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,900
The big deal about this show is that

2463
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,900
it's about the making of the Rings of Power.

2464
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:37,900
And Kelly Brimbo, who made the Rings of Power,

2465
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:41,900
is very popularly shipped with Sauron

2466
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,900
because Sauron seduced him and worked with him

2467
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:48,900
on these great pieces of art and betrayed him in the end.

2468
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:53,900
And murdered him in a horrific way.

2469
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:57,900
A very homosexual thing to do.

2470
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,900
Betraying and murdering.

2471
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,900
Well, I didn't come up with it,

2472
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:08,900
but there's a lot of people who are really invested in that dynamic

2473
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,900
in that way.

2474
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:13,900
In the show, what they did instead was

2475
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:18,900
that they have Sauron paired with Galadriel

2476
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:23,900
and make him instead of him being this ethereal,

2477
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:27,900
beautiful, kind of elvish creature.

2478
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:28,900
Evil fanboy.

2479
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:29,900
Yeah, like evil.

2480
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,900
Instead of making him an evil fanboy,

2481
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:36,900
they made him like kind of a scruffy, aragorn type looking dude.

2482
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:40,900
Yeah, because unlike back in the day

2483
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:44,900
where you would code your villains to be gay, like queer,

2484
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:48,900
nowadays it's queer to be straight.

2485
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:52,900
And so the straighter and more masculine typical is like,

2486
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:54,900
oh, that sucks, that's evil.

2487
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:57,900
So now we make Sauron the straightest guy of all time.

2488
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:59,900
Yeah, it definitely makes sense.

2489
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:01,900
It feels a bit that way.

2490
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:07,900
And I think they tried to misdirect the audience who were expecting,

2491
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:11,900
especially talking fans who were expecting a certain tag on Sauron

2492
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:13,900
and haven't been kind of the opposite.

2493
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:17,900
But I've also seen a lot of people being really mad about that.

2494
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:22,900
And I was like, I can understand that because, I mean,

2495
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:26,900
it would be like one opportunity to have kind of a complex

2496
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:33,900
or maybe queer relationship between two male characters in big fantasy show.

2497
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:39,900
And for many people, that's been the text that they've been interpreting for decades.

2498
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:43,900
And then like Amazon comes around and like makes it the most

2499
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:49,900
just like, I don't know, boilerplate, kind of heterosexual ship.

2500
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:50,900
That's like, yeah.

2501
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:53,900
Yeah, I think he would have been cooler if he was gay

2502
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:56,900
and it's super flamboyant as well.

2503
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:59,900
Because like, they might still go there,

2504
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:02,900
but they're like, yeah, I don't know.

2505
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:04,900
Didn't do so in the first season.

2506
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:08,900
He's gonna turn gay because of the power of the ring.

2507
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:10,900
Well, he's a shape shifter.

2508
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:14,900
So like he could take on a different form in the next season

2509
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:18,900
to do different things, which could be fun.

2510
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:22,900
But yeah, there's been a lot of criticism of the show because of that.

2511
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:25,900
They like, it's funny, like on the one side,

2512
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:31,900
like all the conservative rage troopers like calling the show woke

2513
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:37,900
and the most horrible thing, the conspiracy, the message, everything.

2514
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:40,900
And on the other side, the woke people are also not really happy with it

2515
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:46,900
because it isn't like, it isn't actually like, it's still pretty conservative in that sense.

2516
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:53,900
And yeah, it kind of, those show, I feel like it made most people

2517
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:55,900
on both sides not quite happy.

2518
02:03:55,900 --> 02:04:00,900
And that's kind of, that's pretty unfortunate.

2519
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,900
But it's the show good.

2520
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:04,900
It's all right.

2521
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:06,900
And that's the worst thing about it.

2522
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:07,900
All right.

2523
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:08,900
It's a lot of her rings.

2524
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,900
It should be amazing.

2525
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:13,900
But I think it was enjoyable enough.

2526
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,900
That's good acting.

2527
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:17,900
Is there going to be a second season?

2528
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:19,900
There's actually five seasons.

2529
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:22,900
They contracted five seasons from the beginning.

2530
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:24,900
As a disease?

2531
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:25,900
Yeah.

2532
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:27,900
There's a contract or contract.

2533
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,900
Contracting a disease.

2534
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,900
No, that's correct.

2535
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,900
I was actually.

2536
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:33,900
I have to pee.

2537
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,900
I will be right back.

2538
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:37,900
Okay, bye-bye.

2539
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:41,900
Have a good pee.

2540
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:47,900
Ah, now that show has been occupying my brain for two months.

2541
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:51,900
And yeah, it's a big deal for me.

2542
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,900
I caught like the end or not the end.

2543
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:56,900
It's sort of a middle of an episode.

2544
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:01,900
And I was just sort of seeing if it was interesting.

2545
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:07,900
And then it was a lot of dramatic talking between characters.

2546
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:12,900
Obviously, I didn't know the characters because I hadn't watched from the first episode.

2547
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:14,900
I was just catching it.

2548
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:15,900
How are you catching it?

2549
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,900
It was no TV.

2550
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:19,900
My brother was watching and I walked in the room.

2551
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:22,900
I was like, okay.

2552
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:27,900
And there was scary people and they burned a forest.

2553
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:30,900
And the hobbits were like, this sucks.

2554
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,900
The forest is burnt.

2555
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,900
And then there was a Jesus guy.

2556
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:36,900
And so someone gave him an apple.

2557
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:40,900
And then they were in the Mines of Moria or whatever.

2558
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:42,900
That's actually right.

2559
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:46,900
Yeah, I figured because at the end, the Balrog was at the bottom.

2560
02:05:46,900 --> 02:05:47,900
Yeah.

2561
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,900
They threw like a stone.

2562
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:52,900
They got a hole and it's like, wow, look down there.

2563
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:55,900
It's like a cavern, cool.

2564
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:58,900
And then the guy said to his father, fuck you, dad.

2565
02:05:58,900 --> 02:06:00,900
And the dad said, fuck you, son.

2566
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,900
Get out.

2567
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:04,900
They're gonna explore that.

2568
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:08,900
They're gonna explore the backstory of Khazadum.

2569
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:12,900
And they showed it at its glory basically and that was pretty neat.

2570
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:13,900
Yeah.

2571
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:23,900
The part of the episode I sort of watched didn't have anything that hooked me in terms of intrigue.

2572
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:29,900
It was just sort of like characters despondently talking to each other about how bad things are.

2573
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:32,900
And that, don't worry, we'll get through this.

2574
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:34,900
Come on, we can do it.

2575
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:35,900
Oh no.

2576
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:38,900
And I'm like, that's not really the vibe of Lord of the Rings.

2577
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:41,900
It is for like a few scenes at a time.

2578
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:45,900
But like the swelling music and the adventure is what I think of.

2579
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:51,900
The climbing of the mountains and the, I guess it's just sort of a film sized film.

2580
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:56,900
It's better to get your pumped about what's happening.

2581
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:57,900
Well, come back.

2582
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:04,900
Yeah, they always just like get caught a bit of an episode and wasn't satisfied with the vibe.

2583
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:11,900
And I get that because it's like the dialogue is well written,

2584
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:19,900
but it's missing, it's certainly missing some of the drive that like a self-contained adventure would have like the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings.

2585
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:30,900
Like we have a clear quest and instead we have like three or four plot lines that go into different directions and it's not really clear where or when.

2586
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:31,900
Yeah.

2587
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:35,900
Is there like an inciting incident that you can point to in the show?

2588
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:36,900
Well, it's...

2589
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:44,900
The set things in motion or is it just sort of like, let's have a view of the way the world is and then we'll build to something happen.

2590
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:58,900
It's basically building towards anticipating that Sauron will come back and wondering where is Sauron, who is Sauron and what can we do to prepare against him.

2591
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:01,900
And there's like resurgence of evil in the world and stuff like that.

2592
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:09,900
But yeah, it doesn't have like Gandalf coming up, take this ring, go on, adventure now.

2593
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:17,900
It doesn't have that at all and it has a few interesting plot elements that just kind of...

2594
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:22,900
They don't have enough drive to like make that season very exciting.

2595
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:27,900
It was very exciting for me because I'm a big Tolkien fan and I'm glad when they showed something from the Silmaroo and I'm like,

2596
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:33,900
Wow, that's like the helm of Turin that you wore to slay Glauron.

2597
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:35,900
Neat, they have that in the background.

2598
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:36,900
Soy.

2599
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:37,900
Yes.

2600
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:38,900
Yes.

2601
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:40,900
Is that Baron Lufian on that painting?

2602
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:43,900
Yes.

2603
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,900
You know what?

2604
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:45,900
It's reasonable.

2605
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,900
I like that.

2606
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:48,900
And I...

2607
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:50,900
Yeah.

2608
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:56,900
The other big thing is that they completely rely on mystery boxes to keep the show going at least in the first season.

2609
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,900
So like, there's like...

2610
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:00,900
There's the stranger.

2611
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,900
The stranger, nobody knows who he is.

2612
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:05,900
He came to Middle Earth in a meteor and got found by a hobbit.

2613
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:11,900
He's a weird bearded man who has weird powers and who could he be?

2614
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:13,900
Could he be a wizard?

2615
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:14,900
Could he be Sauron?

2616
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:19,900
Could he be a Maia or a Balrog or something like that?

2617
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:20,900
Could he be...

2618
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,900
And they just don't answer it.

2619
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:26,900
It keeps going on and we like find out bits and pieces.

2620
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,900
And he may be a young Gandalf.

2621
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:31,900
He may be a blue wizard.

2622
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:32,900
I don't know.

2623
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:36,900
And it's just like his story himself is not satisfying enough.

2624
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:38,900
It's just about figuring out who he could be.

2625
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:39,900
Yeah.

2626
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:43,900
And same thing with the guy who turns out to be actually Sauron.

2627
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:48,900
That guy, that story works out better because we actually learn that he's Sauron.

2628
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,900
But yeah.

2629
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:51,900
That's sort of a thing with TV.

2630
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:59,900
I don't know like the sort of make the audience ask questions so that they'll watch the new episode,

2631
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:02,900
but like never fulfill on the answer.

2632
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:03,900
It feels cheap.

2633
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:04,900
It feels cheap.

2634
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:09,900
Did you see the latest Doctor Who special?

2635
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,900
The last.

2636
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:12,900
Do you watch Doctor Who?

2637
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:13,900
I forget.

2638
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:14,900
You don't.

2639
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:15,900
Okay.

2640
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:18,900
Well, I'll just say Chris Chibnall, the current showrunner.

2641
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:31,900
He has a problem with having the illusion of complexity, but it just results in me asking,

2642
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:36,900
what does any of this have to do with anything for like 90% of the episode?

2643
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:40,900
And then at the end it's like, haha, they were all intertwined magic perfectly.

2644
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:43,900
And I'm like, oh, that's not clever though.

2645
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:46,900
You just didn't give me the information I needed to know that.

2646
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:48,900
It's not like a twist.

2647
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:53,900
It's just sort of like, finally you've revealed the plot right at the end.

2648
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:58,900
I'm sure you can do it in a satisfying way, but it's complicated to pull it out of, I think.

2649
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:02,900
It was just sort of like, this isn't good writing.

2650
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:04,900
This is annoying.

2651
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,900
I hate you.

2652
02:11:05,900 --> 02:11:10,900
I'm just glad that we know who Sauron is now so that in the following seasons we don't

2653
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,900
have to wonder anymore who he could be.

2654
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:15,900
It's like, that's just not a...

2655
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:17,900
I want him to get to the plot.

2656
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:20,900
I want him to get to the War of the Elves and Sauron.

2657
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:23,900
And I want him to get to the Fall of Númenor and all of that.

2658
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:32,900
But they just, you know, feels like they were dragging and they wanted to fill a season.

2659
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:37,900
They said, I think the showrunner said, it's like, no, it's so that you can learn to care about

2660
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:41,900
all of these characters and know what's at stake when the war is coming.

2661
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:46,900
That's fine, but in the end, it's mostly just about the mysteries.

2662
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:53,900
I mean, you can care about Frodo even though you don't know anything really about his life.

2663
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:54,900
That's true.

2664
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:57,900
Yeah, we don't bear anything about his life for the first 50 years.

2665
02:11:57,900 --> 02:12:03,900
You get a brief like, oh, he lives in this nice place that's green and lush and people are happy.

2666
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:06,900
His parents died, he got adopted, that's it.

2667
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:07,900
Well, you don't even know that in the film.

2668
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:10,900
I'm just thinking the way the film shows him.

2669
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:20,900
He's just a guy who lives in a place and his uncle Bilbo has a ring and you learn about Frodo as he's on his adventure.

2670
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:27,900
So while the exciting stuff is happening, you're also caring about Frodo more because of all the stuff that the way he reacts to things.

2671
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:34,900
It's like, you don't need to do like a pre prologue so that you know Frodo's entire life story,

2672
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:37,900
which is probably boring because he's not on the adventure.

2673
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:38,900
That's right.

2674
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:39,900
I agree.

2675
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:42,900
He just lived in a house.

2676
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:45,900
One day he had a lovely block of cheese.

2677
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,900
What do hobbits do?

2678
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:52,900
They fish, they have like Morris dancing, they smoke pipe weed.

2679
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:57,900
Frodo was kind of a bookworm and was like meeting with the elves in the forest.

2680
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:58,900
Did you say he was kind of a worm?

2681
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:00,900
No, a bookworm.

2682
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:07,900
I thought you was like, would you still love me if I was a worm?

2683
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:10,900
I think Frodo was a worm.

2684
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:12,900
Would the ring still fit him if he was a worm?

2685
02:13:12,900 --> 02:13:13,900
Yes, actually.

2686
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:15,900
The ring changes in size.

2687
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:20,900
Master Frodo, Master Frodo, would you still like me if I was a worm, Master Frodo?

2688
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:24,900
Go back to bed, Sam, shut the hell up.

2689
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:26,900
Yes.

2690
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:28,900
Yes, actually.

2691
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:29,900
He would.

2692
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,900
Yeah, I think so.

2693
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:36,900
A worm couldn't carry Mr. Frodo into the fire's amount dune.

2694
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:37,900
Sadly.

2695
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:40,900
Like worms, Sam would say, I can't carry the ring.

2696
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:42,900
I also can't carry you.

2697
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:47,900
I guess you're on your own.

2698
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:53,900
I think the most interesting show, the most interesting thing the show did was that they

2699
02:13:53,900 --> 02:14:01,900
tried to do more with the orcs and having the orcs not be pure evil.

2700
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:11,900
And they have a character who is like a deformed elf and he calls himself an orc, but he clearly

2701
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:12,900
doesn't look like an orc yet.

2702
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:14,900
He just kind of looks like a dark elf.

2703
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:19,900
And supposedly he was one of the first elves that got caught by Morgoth and he like farbored

2704
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:21,900
a lot of the orcs.

2705
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,900
Oh, they made babies?

2706
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,900
I thought they were all tortured, the orcs.

2707
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:27,900
Oh, no, they procreate.

2708
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:31,900
They procreate in the same way that elves and humans do.

2709
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:33,900
You mean there's orc bitches out there?

2710
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,900
Yes.

2711
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:38,900
Well, don't they get like spawned out of like a pit?

2712
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:40,900
No, that's Peter Jackson.

2713
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,900
That's the movie version.

2714
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,900
Oh, that's just the movie?

2715
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:45,900
Yes.

2716
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:46,900
I see.

2717
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:47,900
It was cool though.

2718
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:50,900
And yeah, I like that effect too.

2719
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:54,900
I just imagined that they had sex down there and then just like they grow up and then the

2720
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:56,900
babies come out of the mud pool.

2721
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:58,900
They fuck the mud.

2722
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:00,900
I don't know.

2723
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,900
Or just under the mud.

2724
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:05,900
But they have this like orc elf character.

2725
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:09,900
It's like the Homestuck alternative mother grub.

2726
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:13,900
Only instead of like a big grub that's like spitting out babies down at the core of the

2727
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:15,900
planet, it's down in the pit.

2728
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:19,900
There's just all these like orcs fucking down like a hole that you can't see and just

2729
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:24,900
sometimes like fully formed like adult babies just crawl out from the hole.

2730
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:26,900
Down, down in the pit.

2731
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:28,900
It's the incestuous slurry.

2732
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:29,900
The incestuous slurry.

2733
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:30,900
That's right.

2734
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:33,900
They still have that.

2735
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:39,900
And they go in a direction where the orc guy just kind of wants to make a home for his

2736
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:40,900
people.

2737
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:42,900
I just like want to walk right?

2738
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,900
Big mistake.

2739
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:46,900
Have them be a place to live.

2740
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:51,900
And I think that's very interesting because that's something that Tolkien never was sure

2741
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:57,900
about or made a decision on because on the one side he was like, so orcs, yeah, they

2742
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:58,900
they procreate.

2743
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:04,900
They are like, they, they are like fighting, but they also have personalities.

2744
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:09,900
They have some extent of free will.

2745
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:12,900
But at the same time was like, but no, they're created by the evil.

2746
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:15,900
So they can't have that.

2747
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:19,900
So like, like his idea was like evil can't create anything new.

2748
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:22,900
It can only corrupt things and make them bad.

2749
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:27,900
And, and he was like, he can't give the orcs free will because then that would mean like,

2750
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:31,900
Oh, after they're dead, I guess because they spawned out of else, they would go to the

2751
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,900
west and live in peace there.

2752
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:34,900
That's weird.

2753
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:35,900
They did evil things.

2754
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:37,900
That's not how it should work.

2755
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:44,900
And I think in early versions, orcs were actually just like golems, like mindless, like fighting

2756
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:49,900
robots that just did the bidding of the Dark Lord.

2757
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:54,900
But while writing Lord of the Rings, I think it just had too much fun with the orcs and

2758
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:59,900
there are scenes in Lord of the Rings where orcs talk to each other without like supervision

2759
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:05,900
and they talk about after the war's over, we're going to go and open our own little company

2760
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:10,900
somewhere else with a few, with a few good boys and we're going to do our own thing.

2761
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:17,900
And at that point, orcs just become like their own like people that clearly aren't like, like

2762
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:22,900
tied to forever just doing the evil spitting.

2763
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:28,900
And, and, and talking never really made a like final decision on that.

2764
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:31,900
Like, are they can, can orcs be redeemed?

2765
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:36,900
Because at the end of the Lord of the Rings book, Aragorn like goes and genocides all of the orcs.

2766
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:39,900
That's like, that's like,

2767
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:46,900
when you think about them as people that had other ambitions than just being evil, that's really fucked up.

2768
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:50,900
Sad, yeah, yeah.

2769
02:17:50,900 --> 02:17:52,900
That's too bad.

2770
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:55,900
And I'm just, and at least they're doing something with it.

2771
02:17:55,900 --> 02:18:01,900
They're like, like Galadriel tells like the evil orc guy, oh, I will hunt you all down and kill your last kin.

2772
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:04,900
And he's like, that sounds pretty evil, dude.

2773
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:08,900
Like, that sounds pretty, that sounds pretty morgopy what you're saying.

2774
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:09,900
Yeah.

2775
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:15,900
That's, that's pretty good though, that they found a little bit of like space in the, in the lore that like Tolcan never really filled in.

2776
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:18,900
And they're like, what, what's, what do we think is there?

2777
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:21,900
But what the big question mark is, what are they going to do about it?

2778
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:26,900
Because at the end of the show, there's still going to be a giant war between the orcs and the elves.

2779
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:30,900
And like, the elves have to come out as the good guys there.

2780
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:31,900
What's going to happen?

2781
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:32,900
Yeah.

2782
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:40,900
In short, maybe they're going to do something where they, perhaps they show some orc, orc characters that are more morally ambiguous.

2783
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:51,900
And maybe they get like, they, they stand up against their like other orcs and maybe they get like granted lands in the end somewhere else,

2784
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:54,900
like being forgiven by crimes or something.

2785
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:57,900
And they need to, they need to do something now.

2786
02:18:57,900 --> 02:19:09,900
I would imagine that the way they could get around that is having like the sympathetic orcs who want peace killed by more bloodthirsty orcs that like the idea of fighting and killing.

2787
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:10,900
Yeah.

2788
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:14,900
So like the bad orcs are now the orcs that they do go to war with.

2789
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:15,900
Yeah.

2790
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:30,900
Or that they get tricked in some way, like, or like, there's some kind of scheme to make all the orcs forever turn against the elves or something like that.

2791
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:34,900
They, they opened the door and the implications are pretty complicated.

2792
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:38,900
And I'm curious what they're going to do with it.

2793
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,900
Rose.

2794
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:42,900
We're at 23%.

2795
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,900
We are at 23% rendered.

2796
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:47,900
We have gone up to almost 2%.

2797
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:48,900
Yo.

2798
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:50,900
That's like, it's a red, it's a red letter day.

2799
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:52,900
How many minutes is that of the video?

2800
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:54,900
Like two?

2801
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:56,900
That's probably about half an hour.

2802
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:58,900
Wait, no.

2803
02:19:58,900 --> 02:19:59,900
No, that's not right.

2804
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:00,900
No, that's no way.

2805
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:01,900
That could be it, right?

2806
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:03,900
I can't do much.

2807
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:09,900
Eight hours times 60 is 480 minutes.

2808
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:12,900
So 1% of that is 4.8 minutes.

2809
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:16,900
So yeah, 2% of it's almost 10 minutes, almost nine, nine ish minutes.

2810
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:17,900
Shit.

2811
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:19,900
Hell yeah.

2812
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:21,900
We're, we're going to make it.

2813
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:23,900
We're GMI.

2814
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,900
We're GMI.

2815
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:29,900
Running commentary.

2816
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:32,900
I would be so, yeah, I'd be so scared because like,

2817
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:34,900
Oh, I'm terrified.

2818
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:38,900
I've had like renders that, I don't know.

2819
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:43,900
They just, they just fuck up like, like 70% of the way through,

2820
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:45,900
like a multi-hour thing.

2821
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:48,900
Like when I was editing the podcast a couple times,

2822
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:51,900
I happened with the, the animations I did,

2823
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:54,900
which I guess makes sense, but like still fucking sucks.

2824
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:56,900
Having to redo it.

2825
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:59,900
And sometimes it just doesn't make sense why it broke.

2826
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:00,900
It could fail.

2827
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:02,900
Something could go wrong.

2828
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:07,900
But I mean, what can, what can I do other than just let it go and hope it all works out?

2829
02:21:07,900 --> 02:21:08,900
True.

2830
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:10,900
Yeah.

2831
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:11,900
Yeah.

2832
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:16,900
Still, it is, it is a little nerve wracking.

2833
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:20,900
I, you know, I try, I set, I tried setting in the control,

2834
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:21,900
I'll delete menu.

2835
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:25,900
I tried setting Vegas to high priority to allocate more CPU space for it.

2836
02:21:25,900 --> 02:21:28,900
And it does actually speed it up a little bit.

2837
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:31,900
If I set it to above normal priority,

2838
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:34,900
and it kind of slows down everything else.

2839
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:36,900
But if I set it to high priority,

2840
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:38,900
it slows down everything else so much that like,

2841
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:42,900
I can't even like use the mouse or like do anything.

2842
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:45,900
Like the computer, like it does not function when it's,

2843
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:48,900
so like, if I set it to high priority, everything's fucked.

2844
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:52,900
I literally have to like restart the computer.

2845
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:54,900
Would, well, okay.

2846
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:57,900
Hypothetically, if you were okay with not using the computer,

2847
02:21:57,900 --> 02:22:00,900
could you turn it to high priority to speed it up?

2848
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:02,900
And then when it's finished,

2849
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:05,900
then your computer will be usable again.

2850
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:06,900
Maybe.

2851
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:08,900
I don't know.

2852
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:12,900
I haven't, uh, haven't tested it.

2853
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:15,900
Hmm.

2854
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:18,900
In theory, like maybe when the render completed,

2855
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:21,900
it would like ping and then it would stop taking up all the CPU

2856
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:24,900
and then the computer would go back to working normally again.

2857
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:27,900
But I don't know because I didn't try it.

2858
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:33,900
I started like the 120 hour render and then I set it to high priority

2859
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:35,900
and then it was like, well, now your computer doesn't work.

2860
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:39,900
And like the menus don't pop up when you try to click.

2861
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:41,900
It just doesn't work.

2862
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:46,900
So I was like, well, I can't not use my computer for 100 hours.

2863
02:22:46,900 --> 02:22:48,900
So I'll just have to start over.

2864
02:22:49,900 --> 02:22:51,900
Uh, yeah.

2865
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:52,900
Yeah.

2866
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:57,900
It's, it's, I'm, I'm thinking of like, what is it?

2867
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:01,900
Like animated CG films, like finding Nemo or whatever.

2868
02:23:01,900 --> 02:23:07,900
They take, they take like, like an entire arrays of computers

2869
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:12,900
to render, um, like a single frame and they have so many frames.

2870
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:13,900
It takes weeks.

2871
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:14,900
At least back then.

2872
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:16,900
Is it still that much?

2873
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:18,900
I think so.

2874
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:24,900
Just because of like the, like the fidelity is increased.

2875
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:28,900
I mean, the fidelity has increased, but the computer,

2876
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:32,900
computing power has also increased and also the like efficiency of the.

2877
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:33,900
Maybe, maybe it's different.

2878
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:38,900
I still feel like they would still have their like arrays of rendering computers

2879
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:40,900
that are just there to render.

2880
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:42,900
I mean, I'm sure the files are huge.

2881
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:43,900
Oh yeah.

2882
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:50,900
Cause like they want blu-ray quality of like a feature length animated film.

2883
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:53,900
Every frame has to be rendered.

2884
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:56,900
Like every, every frame.

2885
02:23:56,900 --> 02:24:03,900
If you've ever like worked with, uh, with, um, like a blender or whatever

2886
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:07,900
where you're like rendering like a little thing and it takes, I don't know,

2887
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:10,900
20 minutes to make an image that has like the, the right lighting.

2888
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:15,900
Like lighting takes so much more than like rendering in a video game

2889
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:22,900
because it's like dynamically like figuring out how everything is going to reflect.

2890
02:24:22,900 --> 02:24:30,900
And so to do that for a high fidelity, like 4k blu-ray quality image of,

2891
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:34,900
and then more than one of them.

2892
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:41,900
It's just like an, I still, I feel like it must still take weeks for the final render.

2893
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:46,900
I think if there's, it would be cool if there would be like a library or something

2894
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:48,900
where they just had powerful computers.

2895
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:49,900
They do.

2896
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:52,900
Pay a little, pay a little bit and render your video there.

2897
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:54,900
Another thing.

2898
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:56,900
Uh, I don't know about library.

2899
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:02,900
I mean, like, um, in Pixar, they have like the, the, the rendering room,

2900
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:06,900
or at least they did where they just like tons of computers all linked together

2901
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:10,900
to render these frames and they have backups just in case, but yeah.

2902
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:13,900
Would be cool if that was like a public service people could use.

2903
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:19,900
Like, so not everyone has to buy a more expensive big computer or two of them.

2904
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:25,900
When I did like animation, uh, uni, I had to do some, some 3D rendering.

2905
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:30,900
I only had the one computer and you were allowed to leave it running overnight.

2906
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:36,900
And you could go home and you had, they had the computer room had like a lock

2907
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:41,900
and you knew the passcode or your student ID badge was like a card things.

2908
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:44,900
You could swipe that and get in.

2909
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:48,900
I'm going to miss my student ID badge so much.

2910
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:50,900
I still keep buying around.

2911
02:25:50,900 --> 02:25:51,900
I don't know why.

2912
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:53,900
It's sort of like, oh, that's what I used to look like.

2913
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:56,900
Oh, I remember putting this around my neck every fucking day.

2914
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:59,900
Did you wear the transportation?

2915
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:06,900
I wore my college lanyard everywhere and everyone made fun of me and I was a big loser.

2916
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:09,900
We just have like a tiny card.

2917
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:12,900
I wore it around my, I wore it around my neck.

2918
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:14,900
What's a lanyard?

2919
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:21,900
You know, like the like rope, the like the rope around your neck that housed like your keys and stuff on it.

2920
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:24,900
I wouldn't, I didn't put my keys, but I know what you mean.

2921
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,900
Like they'll like,

2922
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:28,900
Or your ID card or whatever.

2923
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:29,900
Yeah.

2924
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:30,900
It would have like a little plastic thing.

2925
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:32,900
You would snap your ID card in there.

2926
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:33,900
Yes, exactly.

2927
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:34,900
Exactly.

2928
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:35,900
Yeah.

2929
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:38,900
That's such an old memory now having to do that.

2930
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:41,900
Yeah.

2931
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:47,900
My student ID gives me free public transportation and then entire like state.

2932
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:49,900
That's really nice.

2933
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:50,900
Wow.

2934
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:51,900
That's a good deal.

2935
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:54,900
I mean, that's most of the cost of going to university here.

2936
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:56,900
It's just like, yeah, I pay like.

2937
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:57,900
Fuck off.

2938
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:59,900
I pay 300 bucks so that I get that card.

2939
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:05,900
So I have free public transportation and I was allowed to go to school.

2940
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:08,900
Geez, don't, don't break, don't break the bank.

2941
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:14,900
Oh God, don't break the bank paying for bus fare for your college education.

2942
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:16,900
Yeah, it's nice.

2943
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:20,900
I was born in the right country.

2944
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:22,900
I can't.

2945
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:23,900
I can't complain.

2946
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:24,900
I can't complain.

2947
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:26,900
My student loans are all paid off.

2948
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:28,900
You're still allowed to complain.

2949
02:27:28,900 --> 02:27:30,900
I'll never, I'll never stop griping.

2950
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:31,900
No, no, no.

2951
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:32,900
I'm going to keep griping about it.

2952
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,900
I'll never let that grudge go.

2953
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:35,900
Severely horrible.

2954
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:40,900
I'll let it, I'll let it drive a wedge between me and my, and foreigners.

2955
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:41,900
You know what?

2956
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:43,900
Maybe we should build the wall, actually.

2957
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:44,900
To keep fucking...

2958
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:47,900
We don't have an ocean between us men.

2959
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:50,900
It's not right across the Atlantic Ocean.

2960
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:51,900
Yeah.

2961
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:57,900
Get that, that, that Saudi, the line project.

2962
02:27:57,900 --> 02:27:59,900
Put it in the ocean.

2963
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:00,900
Why?

2964
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:01,900
What?

2965
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:02,900
Okay.

2966
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:04,900
I saw that post that was like, this is terrifying.

2967
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:06,900
Like, why is it terrifying?

2968
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:09,900
Like, yeah, I get that it like, it's sci-fi and it's probably never going to happen.

2969
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:12,900
But like, what would, what's, what's bad?

2970
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:13,900
What's scary about it?

2971
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:15,900
I think it looks cool.

2972
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:16,900
Well, okay.

2973
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:17,900
It doesn't look cool.

2974
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:18,900
It looks gross.

2975
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:20,900
On the one side it's scary.

2976
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:24,900
It looks like, it looks like a cyberpunk video game city.

2977
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:25,900
Yeah.

2978
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:26,900
I don't like that.

2979
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:27,900
I like that.

2980
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:28,900
Okay.

2981
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,900
Okay.

2982
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:34,900
I think like, one of the gross things or scary things about it is just like, it's Dubai

2983
02:28:34,900 --> 02:28:38,900
and Dubai literally uses slaves and like labor.

2984
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:39,900
Shit.

2985
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:41,900
Is Dubai in Saudi Arabia?

2986
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:42,900
No.

2987
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:43,900
Where is Dubai?

2988
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:44,900
No, wait.

2989
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:45,900
Is it?

2990
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:46,900
It's like, ah, fuck.

2991
02:28:46,900 --> 02:28:47,900
I don't know.

2992
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,900
Hang on.

2993
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:49,900
I'm embarrassed.

2994
02:28:49,900 --> 02:28:50,900
I should know.

2995
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:51,900
I used to think it was in India.

2996
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:52,900
I'm not sure.

2997
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:53,900
No, it's in the UAE.

2998
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:54,900
It's in the Emirates, right?

2999
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:55,900
It's in the, yeah.

3000
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:56,900
It's in the Emirates.

3001
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:57,900
Yeah.

3002
02:28:57,900 --> 02:28:58,900
Yeah.

3003
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:01,900
Which is like next to Saudi Arabia, right?

3004
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:02,900
It's under.

3005
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,900
Close, close by, yeah.

3006
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:05,900
Okay.

3007
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:06,900
Yeah.

3008
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:11,900
And they have like horrible human rights violations and stuff going on there.

3009
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:12,900
I mean, okay, sure.

3010
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:13,900
Exploit horribly.

3011
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:21,900
And like they do these like crazy stunts like projects that are like just for tourism,

3012
02:29:21,900 --> 02:29:23,900
I guess, and status.

3013
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:30,900
I had, I had, I'm just saying, sure, like maybe the country's bad, maybe the government's

3014
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:31,900
bad, whatever.

3015
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:38,900
But I just saw the tweet of the, this is terrifying with the video showing the 3D CG render of

3016
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:41,900
the lion city.

3017
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:46,900
And I genuinely did not understand what was supposed to be scary about it.

3018
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:57,900
I think they might have been like talking about like the stacked nature of like the city being

3019
02:29:57,900 --> 02:30:00,900
like, I don't know.

3020
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:05,900
It's, it's all in a line and it's all really tall and cramped together.

3021
02:30:05,900 --> 02:30:06,900
Yeah.

3022
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:16,900
I feel like it could feel kind of claustrophobic living in a place where the only like, I mean,

3023
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:19,900
it's, it's a terrible idea for very many reasons.

3024
02:30:19,900 --> 02:30:23,900
But like, I just think I'm not terrified by it.

3025
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:25,900
Why, why, why is it a terrible idea?

3026
02:30:25,900 --> 02:30:29,900
Isn't, isn't the idea that it's just like a really efficient way to like.

3027
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:31,900
But it, but it can't be though.

3028
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,900
Organize an urban space.

3029
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:35,900
Stretch it out as far as you can literally.

3030
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:37,900
It's like the least efficient thing.

3031
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:43,900
Like a good urban space is like a small and condensed like network.

3032
02:30:43,900 --> 02:30:44,900
A circle.

3033
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:45,900
A circle would be better.

3034
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:47,900
Well, I thought that's just the main thing.

3035
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:50,900
I thought the, I mean, it's in the, it's in the desert.

3036
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:52,900
Like it's not like, it's, it's like.

3037
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:54,900
No, for like, all right.

3038
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:57,900
They, they, here's the one of the main things, the public transport.

3039
02:30:57,900 --> 02:31:00,900
They say you can go seven kilometers in 20 minutes.

3040
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:04,900
But it needs to stop at all the stations along the way.

3041
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:09,900
So it's not going to take 20 minutes because no train is going to not stop at any of the stops.

3042
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:11,900
Okay.

3043
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:18,900
And it's just sort of, it's, it's all packed so tightly together that you can't expand if.

3044
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:20,900
I mean, I don't know.

3045
02:31:20,900 --> 02:31:21,900
Yeah, that's also the thing.

3046
02:31:21,900 --> 02:31:25,900
Like cities grow and change and this thing can grow and change.

3047
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:43,900
It's a sprawling, a sprawling city coming outwards, having like, like a single district being connected to four districts, five districts around it, as opposed to a line where you can only be connected to what's ahead or behind you.

3048
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:46,900
And you can't build it taller.

3049
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:58,900
It's a cute idea, I guess, but it has no real practicality making a city in that shape, except for making a cool CG render that's like, wow, the future.

3050
02:31:58,900 --> 02:31:59,900
It's stupid.

3051
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:03,900
I've seen enough videos to know that it doesn't make sense architecturally.

3052
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:14,900
I thought that the point of it was that the fact that it's like thin and condensed into a line means that you can like get anywhere in that line in like a relatively short amount of time.

3053
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:18,900
Instead of relying on like a sprawling network of like public transportation and buses.

3054
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:23,900
That's what they say, but the problem is that it wouldn't work that way, probably.

3055
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:34,900
I mean, I don't know what they have in store if they have a solution to those problems, but they have not addressed them, which is the sort of the red flags.

3056
02:32:34,900 --> 02:32:39,900
They haven't addressed issues that are so obvious with the design of a line.

3057
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:41,900
They just said, we're going to do it.

3058
02:32:41,900 --> 02:32:45,900
And I'm like, OK, well, I mean, your track record of Saudi Arabia is very poor.

3059
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:56,900
You've built like so many lush, amazing things that you've abandoned because you did it for like publicity, tourism, or just showing off your wealth.

3060
02:32:56,900 --> 02:33:01,900
Most of Saudi Arabia is in like disrepair.

3061
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:05,900
There's so many slums, there's so many poor places that are not kept up.

3062
02:33:05,900 --> 02:33:14,900
And the billionaires spend all of this money on these big, luscious, like mostly ego driven projects more than anything else.

3063
02:33:14,900 --> 02:33:17,900
They want to be the coolest guys doing the coolest things.

3064
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:33,900
Stuff like the palm tree islands that are absolutely ridiculous where they like where they have to like dig up sand from the ocean to like destroy coral reefs and everything around it to make these islands

3065
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:39,900
so that they can look like palm trees and then have like a normal like suburb on it and a highway.

3066
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:43,900
Saudi princes are basically Elon Musk's.

3067
02:33:43,900 --> 02:33:45,900
That's the easiest way to describe.

3068
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:55,900
Yeah, I, I, OK, I get that it looks like it's not actually there.

3069
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:57,900
Like they're not actually going to do it.

3070
02:33:57,900 --> 02:34:02,900
I think they started, I think they actually started digging a hole for it.

3071
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:05,900
Yeah, they've started doing something, but like.

3072
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,900
Not a hole, a line.

3073
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:09,900
Well, it's a line shaped hole.

3074
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:10,900
It's a trench.

3075
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:12,900
Yeah, right.

3076
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:18,900
Yeah, it's just a fancy, it's just a fancy word for a line shaped hole.

3077
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:20,900
I also just think it looks shit.

3078
02:34:20,900 --> 02:34:21,900
It looks bad on a map.

3079
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:22,900
It's just a line.

3080
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,900
I think it looks, I think it looks neat.

3081
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:25,900
I think it looks cool.

3082
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:27,900
All right.

3083
02:34:27,900 --> 02:34:33,900
One thing I don't like about like the aesthetic of it is the mirror on the outside.

3084
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:41,900
I don't know what the benefit of the mirror is other than like blinding you with like the sun's rays if you're anywhere outside the line.

3085
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:46,900
It's like, if you try to approach the line, we will blast you with these solar power.

3086
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:50,900
I assumed that they were like solar panels on the.

3087
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:56,900
I think it's just so that the desert, so that it looks kind of invisible in the desert that like the landscape doesn't get ruined.

3088
02:34:56,900 --> 02:34:57,900
I think that's the point.

3089
02:34:57,900 --> 02:35:02,900
Which is stupid because the landscape, like no one's going to be out there.

3090
02:35:02,900 --> 02:35:03,900
Yeah.

3091
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:16,900
The only thing that might happen is birds will fly into it and the sun will like bake the land around the line, which could cause problems for the any, any living thing outside of it.

3092
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:17,900
Yeah.

3093
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:29,900
You know, Ben, I think my aesthetic problem with the line is like a cultural thing because like you Americans are used to like straight lines and borders and straight streets everywhere.

3094
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:32,900
And like that's not some places.

3095
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:35,900
Yeah, but it's just not how like the world that I grew up in.

3096
02:35:35,900 --> 02:35:36,900
Yeah.

3097
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:46,900
I was kind of like terrified by Toronto where it's been like a month and a half just because like I look into one direction and I can see the horizon.

3098
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:47,900
I look in the other direction.

3099
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:48,900
I can also see a horizon.

3100
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:53,900
It's like one street that goes from one end of the world to the other.

3101
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:56,900
And it's so far and I need a car to get anywhere.

3102
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:57,900
Sucks.

3103
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:00,900
Boston is not really like that.

3104
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:01,900
New York is like that.

3105
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:02,900
And then that's yeah.

3106
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:04,900
When I look at the line, it's like what?

3107
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:07,900
It just looks like one huge strip of downtown New York.

3108
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:09,900
It looks, it looks fine.

3109
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:10,900
Yeah.

3110
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:11,900
I don't.

3111
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:12,900
I don't like New York.

3112
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:13,900
Well, fair enough, I guess.

3113
02:36:13,900 --> 02:36:14,900
I like, I prefer a bus.

3114
02:36:14,900 --> 02:36:15,900
I like a curvy city.

3115
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:21,900
I like roads that are weird and wacky and unique because they didn't know how to build roads back then.

3116
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:22,900
That's what I like.

3117
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:23,900
I like.

3118
02:36:23,900 --> 02:36:24,900
Stupid roads.

3119
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:30,900
Actually, they knew it better because they are made for like people who can walk and not constructed for car traffic.

3120
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:36,900
They would build it around the hill instead of destroying the hill to flatten it to make a cube.

3121
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:52,900
And they would build it like towards like like city centers, marketplaces where the shops are and people gather and like making a spread from there instead of making just a grid over like a suburban like place for people to live.

3122
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:53,900
Yeah.

3123
02:36:53,900 --> 02:36:59,900
I think when it comes to like, because I can say that one of the things they say about the line is like, it's walkable.

3124
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:09,900
You're in your little pod and you can walk to the nearby grocery cube and you can go to the park area and it's like, you know, conceptually, not like terrible.

3125
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:11,900
Like I like that they're trying to make it walkable.

3126
02:37:11,900 --> 02:37:13,900
They're trying to put trees in it.

3127
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:21,900
I just, it's sort of the aesthetic of the future with the, the gray squares and the concrete this and that.

3128
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:24,900
Don't you have like a rich history of architecture?

3129
02:37:24,900 --> 02:37:36,900
Put some like cool Saudi Arabian like architecture with like stone things and make it look like a marketplace from Aladdin.

3130
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:38,900
Or you're just being a sentimental.

3131
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:44,900
I'm just, I'm just being a fucking, I'm just being kind of racist, but I like old buildings.

3132
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,900
I like old buildings in the, in the.

3133
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:49,900
The line's cool, but can you make it look like Aladdin though?

3134
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:52,900
I hate that.

3135
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:54,900
I would prefer that though.

3136
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:56,900
Not, not a single onion dome in sight.

3137
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:58,900
Like are you, are you joking me?

3138
02:37:58,900 --> 02:37:59,900
What's the point?

3139
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:02,900
Could you use like wooden planks instead of like concrete slabs?

3140
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:03,900
I like wood.

3141
02:38:03,900 --> 02:38:05,900
Wood is cool.

3142
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:07,900
Could you get some cloth?

3143
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:09,900
I'm okay with squares.

3144
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:10,900
I'm okay with concrete.

3145
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:18,900
Like you can walk in, you can walk in your little pod section and like there's only so many things you can walk to.

3146
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:25,900
Just this one thing and then you walk further and then that's the next pod section and it probably looks similar because like to be.

3147
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:27,900
Yeah, that's what a city is.

3148
02:38:27,900 --> 02:38:40,900
Not necessarily cities have different areas that feel different and have like different focuses of like culture and like things you can buy there and like things you can do there.

3149
02:38:40,900 --> 02:38:42,900
Think of a video game.

3150
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:48,900
Imagine if you're playing Dark Souls and every place in Dark Souls is the same place.

3151
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:51,900
You go from one place to the other place and it's a new place.

3152
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:55,900
There's new enemies, but it's the same architecture every single time.

3153
02:38:55,900 --> 02:38:56,900
It would get boring.

3154
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:57,900
It would get dull.

3155
02:38:57,900 --> 02:38:59,900
It would be like, where's, where's anything new?

3156
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:00,900
Where's variety?

3157
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:02,900
That was a joke by the way.

3158
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:03,900
It's not like that.

3159
02:39:03,900 --> 02:39:04,900
Just a little bit.

3160
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:09,900
They reuse a lot of enemies and ruins and stuff.

3161
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:11,900
It's like the same kind of ruin everywhere.

3162
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:12,900
Okay.

3163
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:13,900
Imagine this.

3164
02:39:13,900 --> 02:39:14,900
Imagine this.

3165
02:39:14,900 --> 02:39:19,900
It's Dark Souls, but it's set in the line and because you can always see the horizon.

3166
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:31,900
You can always see the point that like the lines converge on and you have to go in that direction and you have to fight through a gauntlet of big armor dudes that come out of the big concrete squares.

3167
02:39:31,900 --> 02:39:32,900
This is Final Fantasy 13.

3168
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:33,900
Shoot machine guns at you.

3169
02:39:33,900 --> 02:39:34,900
15?

3170
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:35,900
13.

3171
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:36,900
13.

3172
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:37,900
13.

3173
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:41,900
The one where it's like notorious for being a hallway.

3174
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:42,900
Oh yeah.

3175
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:43,900
Yeah.

3176
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:44,900
Hallway is right.

3177
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:45,900
Okay.

3178
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:46,900
Well, good.

3179
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:47,900
No, not good.

3180
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:48,900
You know?

3181
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:49,900
Sounds cool actually.

3182
02:39:49,900 --> 02:39:59,900
I like, here's my favorite aesthetic is like a seaside town in the Mediterranean with

3183
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:08,900
those like bright white, I don't know what they're made of like clay houses with like stuff.

3184
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:11,900
That's what I like.

3185
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:14,900
The ones like set into like a cliff?

3186
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:17,900
Yeah, set into the side of the hills and sort of.

3187
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:18,900
Are those called adobes?

3188
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:21,900
I don't know if it's a specific type of building.

3189
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:28,900
It's just sort of like, I like when there's a Mediterranean, it's like a hot climate and they have like colorful roofs, all the same color.

3190
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:31,900
Or maybe it's like, there's a few red ones here, some yellow ones here.

3191
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:36,900
And then there's like white walls or like peach walls and little cobbled streets and small little alleyways.

3192
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:39,900
And it's all going down to the ocean where there's the harbor and there's the ships.

3193
02:40:39,900 --> 02:40:40,900
That's what I like.

3194
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:44,900
That's my favorite sort of location.

3195
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:51,900
I have a city in mind that is exactly like you described and one of my favorite places to be at wait.

3196
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:52,900
What's it called?

3197
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:53,900
Damn it.

3198
02:40:53,900 --> 02:40:57,900
I have to look on Google Maps.

3199
02:40:58,900 --> 02:41:03,900
Oh, Bonifacio on course.

3200
02:41:03,900 --> 02:41:04,900
Bonifacio?

3201
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:05,900
Bonifacio.

3202
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:16,900
It's like that kind of like Mediterranean city that is like built on a cliff, on a seaside cliff and it looks like it's almost falling in.

3203
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:22,900
Is it the one that you can see in the background of the skybox in Mario 64?

3204
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:24,900
I really don't know.

3205
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:25,900
This is nice.

3206
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:26,900
Show me.

3207
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:29,900
I'm uploading it right now.

3208
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:31,900
Got a bit of a long exposure.

3209
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:35,900
It's more orange than it would be, but that's a cool little place.

3210
02:41:35,900 --> 02:41:36,900
Yeah.

3211
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:37,900
Yeah.

3212
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:38,900
Exactly.

3213
02:41:38,900 --> 02:41:42,900
I said basically exactly there where you can see this.

3214
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:43,900
Yes.

3215
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:51,900
It's the higgledy-piggledy unregimented placement of the buildings, the different sizes, different slants of the roofs, different colors.

3216
02:41:51,900 --> 02:41:57,900
It's so tall and like so thin and built so funnily over the cliff.

3217
02:41:57,900 --> 02:41:59,900
They're going to fall over?

3218
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:02,900
How many kids spit off the end of that cliff?

3219
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:13,900
You can see the giant rocks that have fallen in the past thousands of years and so like, yeah, one day the rest is going to fall.

3220
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:14,900
It's neat.

3221
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:29,900
Finally, I like in movies about Jesus in Judea or whatever, people just live in holes carved into the wall.

3222
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:40,900
In places in the Roman Empire, peasants would just live in freaking holes carved into the side of a silver rock wall.

3223
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:41,900
It was great.

3224
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:43,900
Everyone loved it.

3225
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:44,900
I have to go back.

3226
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:53,900
Another thing about the line, I think I would hate to be anywhere near the bottom just because of the sheer tallness of everything around me.

3227
02:42:53,900 --> 02:42:55,900
I would want to be at the top all the time.

3228
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:59,900
I don't know whether I'd be allowed at the top because it's probably more expensive.

3229
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:07,900
Would you feel claustrophobic to be kind of like at the bottom of it with the walls rising up on both sides of you?

3230
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:08,900
Yeah.

3231
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:09,900
Both sides and floor.

3232
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:10,900
Maybe.

3233
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:13,900
People are going to throw trash down there probably from the walkways.

3234
02:43:13,900 --> 02:43:16,900
I like a big open sky.

3235
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:19,900
I like a big open flatter sort of area.

3236
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:22,900
I kind of think it's cool.

3237
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:30,900
The idea is that there'd be buildings on the wall going up both sides.

3238
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:33,900
The buildings would be built into the wall.

3239
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:37,900
They wouldn't be rooted on the ground rising up from it.

3240
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:39,900
I think that sounds neat.

3241
02:43:39,900 --> 02:43:41,900
I think it sounds neat as hell, honestly.

3242
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:45,900
But isn't that just houses with many stories?

3243
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:48,900
Isn't that already the same thing?

3244
02:43:48,900 --> 02:44:03,900
Well, it would mean that in theory it would mean that I think it would change the considerations for how you built buildings.

3245
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:05,900
I don't know.

3246
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:10,900
I just can't get a sense of how the lights would get into that place.

3247
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:12,900
I feel like it would be dark all the time.

3248
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:15,900
I think it would just need to be wide enough.

3249
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:23,900
I just think if you make it wide enough that the street down the middle of it is broad enough that the daylight can come in through the top.

3250
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:27,900
I thought the daylight comes in through the mirror walls.

3251
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:31,900
I thought it's like a one-sided mirror or something.

3252
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:33,900
The outside walls.

3253
02:44:33,900 --> 02:44:36,900
I think the buildings are on the wall.

3254
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:39,900
Yeah, buildings would stop.

3255
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:46,900
I mean, maybe those walls look really thick from these images.

3256
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:48,900
They would have to be.

3257
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,900
Yeah.

3258
02:44:50,900 --> 02:44:54,900
I'm assuming the walls are opaque and extremely rigid.

3259
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:59,900
I'm thinking of it like the same way in an airport they have big windows,

3260
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:03,900
the roof is always above them and shading everything.

3261
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:09,900
If the sun isn't shooting through the window, it's dark, even though you can see outside.

3262
02:45:09,900 --> 02:45:11,900
I feel like that's how it would feel.

3263
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:17,900
You would be in the shade looking out at the desert, and that's all.

3264
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:19,900
I'm like, ah, jeez.

3265
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:22,900
I shouldn't have made that left-turned-out bookway key.

3266
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:26,900
I would go check it out.

3267
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:28,900
I'd go check out the line.

3268
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:30,900
I probably couldn't afford to live there.

3269
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:32,900
No, no, no.

3270
02:45:34,900 --> 02:45:37,900
Well, that's all I got to say about that.

3271
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:42,900
Yeah, I don't know if they're going to make it like a bridge people place,

3272
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:44,900
because it doesn't even have a street.

3273
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:49,900
Like, bridge people need a place to drive their expensive cars.

3274
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:51,900
If it's just public transportation.

3275
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:53,900
They'll have an airport at the top.

3276
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:57,900
You can land your private jet.

3277
02:45:57,900 --> 02:46:01,900
I could actually imagine that they put just a highway on top.

3278
02:46:01,900 --> 02:46:03,900
You cover everything with a highway?

3279
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:06,900
Yes, just on top and all under the highway.

3280
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:10,900
And then the smoke would fall down into and suffocate everyone inside.

3281
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:14,900
And then they also have to build parking lots next to the line,

3282
02:46:14,900 --> 02:46:17,900
just giant parking lot buildings.

3283
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:22,900
No more cars.

3284
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:24,900
Shoot the tires.

3285
02:46:24,900 --> 02:46:25,900
Shoot them.

3286
02:46:25,900 --> 02:46:27,900
I'm tired of tires.

3287
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:34,900
Americans need cars to drive across the big desert in the middle of the country.

3288
02:46:34,900 --> 02:46:35,900
Yeah.

3289
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:37,900
That nobody wants to be in.

3290
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:42,900
You do that all the time, like, every two weeks.

3291
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:43,900
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

3292
02:46:43,900 --> 02:46:44,900
Yeah, of course.

3293
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:46,900
Some people do for some reason.

3294
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:50,900
You know what would be a cooler line is a vertical one.

3295
02:46:50,900 --> 02:46:52,900
If they build like a line straight up.

3296
02:46:52,900 --> 02:46:54,900
Cut the skyscraper.

3297
02:46:55,900 --> 02:46:56,900
No, no, no.

3298
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:59,900
I mean, like a seven kilometer like into space,

3299
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:02,900
like you can take an elevator to get to space.

3300
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:04,900
And then you could jump and land on the moon.

3301
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:07,900
You just jump like five feet as it flies past.

3302
02:47:07,900 --> 02:47:08,900
He's like, here it comes.

3303
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:11,900
And then you go, whoop, splat and you're on the moon.

3304
02:47:11,900 --> 02:47:13,900
I think space elevator is something I've heard before.

3305
02:47:13,900 --> 02:47:15,900
Like, I think people tried that.

3306
02:47:15,900 --> 02:47:17,900
Or like, at least different plans.

3307
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:19,900
The Apple Seed Manga.

3308
02:47:19,900 --> 02:47:22,900
Yeah, it's in Mega Man X8.

3309
02:47:22,900 --> 02:47:25,900
The Jacob Project for the Orbital Elevator.

3310
02:47:25,900 --> 02:47:28,900
Because obviously they can't build space travel

3311
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:31,900
not after the Eurasia incident, obviously.

3312
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:35,900
We don't talk about the Eurasia incident.

3313
02:47:36,900 --> 02:47:38,900
What happened to Eurasia?

3314
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:43,900
The space colony Eurasia, idiot.

3315
02:47:43,900 --> 02:47:47,900
Not the sub, not the continent, not the continent group.

3316
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:51,900
Obviously, listen, you don't know your history.

3317
02:47:51,900 --> 02:47:54,900
Is there a planet or a planet called Eurasia?

3318
02:47:54,900 --> 02:47:57,900
That'll explain everything, huh?

3319
02:47:57,900 --> 02:47:59,900
Is there a real planet called Eurasia or something?

3320
02:47:59,900 --> 02:48:01,900
Because there's a moon called Europe.

3321
02:48:01,900 --> 02:48:03,900
Europa?

3322
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:05,900
Oh, no.

3323
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:10,900
In Mega Man X5, there is an orbital.

3324
02:48:10,900 --> 02:48:13,900
It's like a space colony in orbit around the Earth

3325
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:16,900
called Space Colony Eurasia.

3326
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:18,900
Like an artificial satellite.

3327
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:21,900
I was just freaked out for a second because, like,

3328
02:48:21,900 --> 02:48:25,900
holy shit, you call the moon Europa

3329
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:27,900
because that's what we call Europe.

3330
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:30,900
They just have the same name in my language.

3331
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:31,900
I think there's...

3332
02:48:31,900 --> 02:48:33,900
It's like one of Jupiter's moons or something.

3333
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:35,900
Jupiter or Saturn.

3334
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:37,900
Yeah, something like that.

3335
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:39,900
One of those stupid planets with, like, 18 moons

3336
02:48:39,900 --> 02:48:41,900
that nobody gives a fuck about.

3337
02:48:41,900 --> 02:48:43,900
I think that one's interesting because it's, like,

3338
02:48:43,900 --> 02:48:48,900
covered with water ice and liquid under the ice or something.

3339
02:48:48,900 --> 02:48:51,900
And people say there could be aliens on there.

3340
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:54,900
There could be water aliens in the ice.

3341
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,900
True, true.

3342
02:48:56,900 --> 02:48:59,900
It's not an apple seed.

3343
02:48:59,900 --> 02:49:02,900
It's Battle Angel Elite Manga

3344
02:49:02,900 --> 02:49:09,900
has, like, this cool concept for a floating city

3345
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:14,900
that is suspended in the air

3346
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:18,900
by there being an out-of-orbit other floating city

3347
02:49:18,900 --> 02:49:20,900
that it's connected to.

3348
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:22,900
And, like, the out-of-orbit one is, like,

3349
02:49:22,900 --> 02:49:24,900
pulling the other one up.

3350
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:27,900
And it's, like, attached with, like, these trash...

3351
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:30,900
It's attached with a large, long, like, tube of stuff.

3352
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:32,900
That's what I'm thinking of.

3353
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:34,900
Yeah, they're, like, tubes of where they throw trash down

3354
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:36,900
going down and under the floating city

3355
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:39,900
where the second trash city where the story takes place.

3356
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:41,900
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's where Battle Angel Elite lives

3357
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:43,900
and she has, like, adventures.

3358
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:45,900
I gotta read the rest of this,

3359
02:49:45,900 --> 02:49:47,900
because I remember reading, like, the first volume

3360
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:49,900
at the Life Actions once.

3361
02:49:49,900 --> 02:49:51,900
I only watched the Life Action movie, and it was actually...

3362
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:53,900
Oh, no, it's...

3363
02:49:53,900 --> 02:49:55,900
No, it was good. I liked the movie.

3364
02:49:55,900 --> 02:49:57,900
Oh, I mean, I didn't see the movie, but, like, the manga is amazing.

3365
02:49:57,900 --> 02:49:59,900
Yeah, I'm sure it is. It looks really good.

3366
02:49:59,900 --> 02:50:01,900
But the movie also looked really good.

3367
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:04,900
It was really fun. I saw it, like, three times in the cinema.

3368
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:07,900
And then I went back just for fun of it, because it was cheap.

3369
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:11,900
I read the first volume of that manga,

3370
02:50:11,900 --> 02:50:15,900
and it freaked me out when that guy ate that lady's brain.

3371
02:50:15,900 --> 02:50:17,900
That was fucked up.

3372
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:19,900
That's also in the film, I think.

3373
02:50:19,900 --> 02:50:20,900
Really?

3374
02:50:20,900 --> 02:50:22,900
Oh, at least there's a scene where they, like,

3375
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:24,900
dissect, like, a lady who's just a character

3376
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:26,900
and she's just a brain and a jaw,

3377
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:29,900
and, like, eyes, like, next to it or something.

3378
02:50:29,900 --> 02:50:31,900
It's fun.

3379
02:50:31,900 --> 02:50:33,900
Yish. Yish.

3380
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:35,900
I always want to...

3381
02:50:35,900 --> 02:50:37,900
I want these as physical copies,

3382
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:40,900
because I don't like reading manga online that much,

3383
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,900
at least not when it's long.

3384
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:44,900
I like it either. Yeah.

3385
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:46,900
But, like, I always see them in the bookstores,

3386
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,900
and they're, like, 20 to 30 bucks a volume.

3387
02:50:48,900 --> 02:50:50,900
It's, like, so many of them.

3388
02:50:50,900 --> 02:50:52,900
Well, how many chapters is a volume?

3389
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:54,900
I don't know how many chapters,

3390
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:57,900
but there's at least, like, six volumes, so it's, like...

3391
02:50:57,900 --> 02:50:59,900
Yeah.

3392
02:50:59,900 --> 02:51:02,900
I could buy food for that.

3393
02:51:02,900 --> 02:51:04,900
Hmm. Hmm.

3394
02:51:07,900 --> 02:51:09,900
What do we think about voicemails?

3395
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:11,900
Think it's about that time?

3396
02:51:11,900 --> 02:51:13,900
I think they suck.

3397
02:51:13,900 --> 02:51:15,900
Oh, I mean, should we do them? Yes, let's do them.

3398
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:19,900
Yeah, okay. I agree on both counts.

3399
02:51:19,900 --> 02:51:23,900
Okay, let's see. I got them here.

3400
02:51:23,900 --> 02:51:26,900
Okay, I've never done this before, last time I was here.

3401
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,900
We didn't have voicemails.

3402
02:51:28,900 --> 02:51:30,900
Well, I'll post them as attachments in the general.

3403
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:32,900
Okay. Let's be listened to.

3404
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:35,900
Let me just find the first one.

3405
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:39,900
The first one from today is called...

3406
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:42,900
It's called Very Talented.

3407
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,900
Ooh, my neck just cracked.

3408
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:46,900
Okay, here it is.

3409
02:51:46,900 --> 02:51:48,900
Three, two, one, go.

3410
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:55,900
I can make Shadows, you know, the Pokemon.

3411
02:51:57,900 --> 02:51:59,900
Could you understand that?

3412
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:03,900
He can make something, you know, the Pokemon,

3413
02:52:03,900 --> 02:52:06,900
and then he made a funny sound.

3414
02:52:06,900 --> 02:52:08,900
I think he imitated a Pokemon?

3415
02:52:08,900 --> 02:52:10,900
Or they imitated a Pokemon? I don't know.

3416
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:12,900
Wait.

3417
02:52:12,900 --> 02:52:15,900
Bye-bye.

3418
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:17,900
Saw.

3419
02:52:17,900 --> 02:52:19,900
I can't understand it.

3420
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:23,900
The next one is Paramount.

3421
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:25,900
Well, it's called Paramount.

3422
02:52:25,900 --> 02:52:27,900
There's a voicemail attached.

3423
02:52:27,900 --> 02:52:29,900
There's also a link.

3424
02:52:29,900 --> 02:52:30,900
Here's the voicemail.

3425
02:52:30,900 --> 02:52:33,900
Three, two, one, go.

3426
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:36,900
And you have to look at this.

3427
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:38,900
I said that s-p-c-p, hashtag,

3428
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:41,900
but I guess you just used it the wrong time

3429
02:52:41,900 --> 02:52:44,900
because we couldn't voicemail.

3430
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:45,900
I don't know.

3431
02:52:45,900 --> 02:52:50,900
He's saying you used the s-p-c-p.

3432
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:52,900
Yeah, I guess we don't check it.

3433
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:54,900
Oh, the hashtag.

3434
02:52:54,900 --> 02:52:57,900
I only check it when I make a tweet that's like,

3435
02:52:57,900 --> 02:52:59,900
hey, we're doing it by voice.

3436
02:52:59,900 --> 02:53:03,900
Yeah, I mean, I don't check the hashtag unless I announce it.

3437
02:53:03,900 --> 02:53:08,900
Okay, this gamma girl.itch.io.

3438
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:11,900
This is like a claymation game called Gob.

3439
02:53:11,900 --> 02:53:13,900
This looks cool.

3440
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:16,900
It does look cool, actually.

3441
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:21,900
That's got just the right amount of grunge.

3442
02:53:21,900 --> 02:53:28,900
Yeah, I mean, I think of Hilux when I see it, obviously.

3443
02:53:28,900 --> 02:53:31,900
So dirty.

3444
02:53:31,900 --> 02:53:35,900
I love this PDA they're holding.

3445
02:53:35,900 --> 02:53:39,900
It looks like the curved plastic of the 2000s.

3446
02:53:39,900 --> 02:53:42,900
Yeah, it's just like a...

3447
02:53:42,900 --> 02:53:44,900
Okay, it's a point-and-click adventure.

3448
02:53:44,900 --> 02:53:48,900
Point-and-click mechanics without the pointing and clicking, it says.

3449
02:53:48,900 --> 02:53:54,900
Wordless design. What does it even have?

3450
02:53:54,900 --> 02:53:59,900
No pointing, clicking, and no words.

3451
02:53:59,900 --> 02:54:04,900
I mean, seems neat. Seems nifty.

3452
02:54:04,900 --> 02:54:06,900
Gob, huh? Okay.

3453
02:54:06,900 --> 02:54:08,900
Cool.

3454
02:54:08,900 --> 02:54:13,900
Next voicemail. Where did I put that?

3455
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:20,900
The next one is... Oh, there's an image link here.

3456
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:23,900
Let's see what's in it.

3457
02:54:23,900 --> 02:54:26,900
Big Mac. Big Mac, call the doctor quick.

3458
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:30,900
Applejack just did the blackout challenge for her TikTok.

3459
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:33,900
Oh, no. What the hell's that?

3460
02:54:33,900 --> 02:54:34,900
I don't want to...

3461
02:54:34,900 --> 02:54:38,900
Isn't that like when you put the black square on your social media

3462
02:54:38,900 --> 02:54:41,900
in solidarity with Black Lives Matter?

3463
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:45,900
I think a big blackout challenge.

3464
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:50,900
I guess that's not it.

3465
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:58,900
I would imagine it could be like a blackface that TikTok is like doing.

3466
02:54:58,900 --> 02:55:02,900
Well, she's like throwing up, so...

3467
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:05,900
Oh, the blackout challenge is resurfaced on TikTok,

3468
02:55:05,900 --> 02:55:08,900
and it's just as still as dangerous as it was 16 years ago.

3469
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:11,900
Oh, it's just hold your breath until you pass out.

3470
02:55:11,900 --> 02:55:12,900
God.

3471
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:13,900
Awesome.

3472
02:55:13,900 --> 02:55:15,900
Oh, yeah, somebody died doing it.

3473
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:18,900
It has resulted in more than 80 deaths according to the CDC.

3474
02:55:18,900 --> 02:55:20,900
80? Oh, my God.

3475
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:23,900
TikTok is extremely popular, so fuck.

3476
02:55:23,900 --> 02:55:29,900
So is death.

3477
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:32,900
Okay, well, I get it.

3478
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:35,900
Why? Apple Bloom, why?

3479
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:38,900
Well, for the clout. For clout.

3480
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:40,900
Same reason to do everything for clout.

3481
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:43,900
She got the blackout challenge cutie mark at last.

3482
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:47,900
More like blackout, more like black clout.

3483
02:55:47,900 --> 02:55:50,900
Nah, not really, though. Not if you die.

3484
02:55:50,900 --> 02:55:53,900
Next one is called Wiggler...

3485
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:55,900
No, Wiggler Diggy.

3486
02:55:55,900 --> 02:55:57,900
Wait, don't play that one. That one's mine.

3487
02:55:57,900 --> 02:55:59,900
I can just say what I said. That's stupid.

3488
02:55:59,900 --> 02:56:00,900
Are you sure?

3489
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:01,900
Yes, I know.

3490
02:56:01,900 --> 02:56:04,900
I recorded that yesterday before deciding that I want to be honest.

3491
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:08,900
Remember that voice mail last week about the person who said

3492
02:56:08,900 --> 02:56:14,900
that the new Pokemon game is going to have a regional type that's not a regional type?

3493
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:17,900
That's like Wiggler?

3494
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:19,900
Yeah.

3495
02:56:19,900 --> 02:56:22,900
Yeah, the Worm Diglet thing.

3496
02:56:22,900 --> 02:56:28,900
So what they said is that it's not a regional variant

3497
02:56:28,900 --> 02:56:33,900
because regional variants can't change their biology or something like that.

3498
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:37,900
That's why there's never been a regional variant that's a bug type

3499
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:42,900
because a bug type is more fundamental to their biology

3500
02:56:42,900 --> 02:56:47,900
and it's not just attaching a different element to an animal.

3501
02:56:47,900 --> 02:56:51,900
So, okay, Bullpix for example.

3502
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:53,900
That's like a fire fox, right?

3503
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:56,900
And the variant is just an ice fox.

3504
02:56:56,900 --> 02:57:01,900
But you couldn't easily make it a bug type because what's a bug fox?

3505
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:03,900
That's gonna be completely different.

3506
02:57:03,900 --> 02:57:05,900
Just give it a big ice.

3507
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:07,900
Multiple ice.

3508
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:09,900
Okay.

3509
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:13,900
Wigglet is not a mammal or a mole kind of creature.

3510
02:57:13,900 --> 02:57:15,900
It's an eel. It's a fish.

3511
02:57:15,900 --> 02:57:17,900
So it's not...

3512
02:57:17,900 --> 02:57:20,900
And that's why it's specifically not a regional variant

3513
02:57:20,900 --> 02:57:23,900
and they said that when they announced that Pokemon.

3514
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:26,900
So they're doing something new?

3515
02:57:26,900 --> 02:57:28,900
I guess so.

3516
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:36,900
It's just sort of confusing because Pokemon biology doesn't necessarily correlate

3517
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:42,900
to the way that we have genuses and subspecies in real life

3518
02:57:42,900 --> 02:57:46,900
and evolution the actual way it is.

3519
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:53,900
I feel like whether it is or isn't a regional variant is sort of like a semantic difference.

3520
02:57:54,900 --> 02:57:58,900
Like a regional variants are still a distinct creature.

3521
02:57:58,900 --> 02:58:00,900
In Pokemon, yeah.

3522
02:58:00,900 --> 02:58:03,900
I guess the idea is regional variants in the real world are like,

3523
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:06,900
oh, it's like the same species.

3524
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:09,900
But a different kind of food or something.

3525
02:58:09,900 --> 02:58:12,900
I know, but that Pokemon doesn't follow a real world.

3526
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:14,900
Well, that's what I mean.

3527
02:58:14,900 --> 02:58:20,900
It's like if the regional variants and this new thing are following real life rules

3528
02:58:20,900 --> 02:58:25,900
and naming conventions, then I guess they're not regional variants.

3529
02:58:25,900 --> 02:58:31,900
It's just kind of the difference between like a white bunny and a dark brown body

3530
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:35,900
that's bigger and like a horse and a sea horse.

3531
02:58:35,900 --> 02:58:39,900
They're trying something there.

3532
02:58:39,900 --> 02:58:43,900
I mean, to me, it's like...

3533
02:58:43,900 --> 02:58:47,900
This is sort of like, I don't know, like a patcherisu.

3534
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:55,900
A patcherisu is not Pikachu, but it's sort of a similar creature inspired by the other thing.

3535
02:58:55,900 --> 02:58:57,900
And that's not a variant of Pikachu.

3536
02:58:57,900 --> 02:58:59,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3537
02:58:59,900 --> 02:59:03,900
Like there's like a lowland, right?

3538
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:05,900
There's an lowland right you, yeah.

3539
02:59:05,900 --> 02:59:09,900
That's kind of just different color than psychic type or something.

3540
02:59:09,900 --> 02:59:12,900
And that's...

3541
02:59:12,900 --> 02:59:14,900
I don't know.

3542
02:59:14,900 --> 02:59:16,900
I think it's neat when they try new things.

3543
02:59:16,900 --> 02:59:17,900
I mean...

3544
02:59:17,900 --> 02:59:22,900
I still don't think there's like a rule that says you can't have a bug variant of a region.

3545
02:59:22,900 --> 02:59:24,900
It just hasn't happened yet.

3546
02:59:24,900 --> 02:59:35,900
I mean, you could easily have like a regional variant of like Butterfree that's like bug ghost type or something.

3547
02:59:35,900 --> 02:59:37,900
And it just like is purple, I don't know.

3548
02:59:37,900 --> 02:59:40,900
It's a dead bug.

3549
02:59:40,900 --> 02:59:43,900
Yeah, when the butterflies go to this region, they will die.

3550
02:59:43,900 --> 02:59:48,900
It has like a needle in it that's like on styrofoam.

3551
02:59:48,900 --> 02:59:51,900
Like it's been preserved.

3552
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:52,900
Very nice.

3553
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:55,900
Yeah, I like it.

3554
02:59:55,900 --> 03:00:05,900
Yeah, I mean, I guess I get what you're saying, that like it would be weird if something were a bug.

3555
03:00:05,900 --> 03:00:07,900
That's a good quote.

3556
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:11,900
I mean, they could make like, what if they made like a regional variant of Krabby that was like a land crab.

3557
03:00:11,900 --> 03:00:15,900
And it was like bug rock or bug round or something.

3558
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:16,900
Yeah.

3559
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:17,900
Something like that.

3560
03:00:17,900 --> 03:00:19,900
I guess it's still like the same...

3561
03:00:19,900 --> 03:00:24,900
It's still the same like basic species kind of.

3562
03:00:24,900 --> 03:00:27,900
Crabs are just sea bugs.

3563
03:00:27,900 --> 03:00:30,900
So fucked up that it's just pure water type.

3564
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:32,900
I mean, bug is not a scientific term.

3565
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:40,900
If there's a rule that says mammals have to be mammals and they can't be bugs, then I don't want to live in that world.

3566
03:00:41,900 --> 03:00:44,900
I mean, we don't have a bug evolution.

3567
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:47,900
Not yet.

3568
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:49,900
They'll have to do it at some point.

3569
03:00:49,900 --> 03:00:51,900
I don't think they're ever gonna add a new one.

3570
03:00:51,900 --> 03:00:55,900
What do you mean they don't have a bug evolution?

3571
03:00:55,900 --> 03:00:56,900
Oh, for Eevee?

3572
03:00:56,900 --> 03:00:57,900
Oh, yeah.

3573
03:00:57,900 --> 03:01:02,900
You don't think they'll add more Eeveelutions?

3574
03:01:02,900 --> 03:01:05,900
I mean, the last time was like three games ago or something.

3575
03:01:05,900 --> 03:01:08,900
I feel like they might add another one.

3576
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:11,900
I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't.

3577
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:15,900
I see no reason not to add a new one every now and then.

3578
03:01:15,900 --> 03:01:16,900
Like what is left?

3579
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:23,900
Dragon, bug, round, rock, fighting.

3580
03:01:23,900 --> 03:01:25,900
Do they not have a ground or a rock?

3581
03:01:25,900 --> 03:01:26,900
No, I don't think so.

3582
03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:27,900
No.

3583
03:01:27,900 --> 03:01:29,900
Those are obvious ones.

3584
03:01:29,900 --> 03:01:30,900
You gotta have a rock.

3585
03:01:30,900 --> 03:01:31,900
Yeah.

3586
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:35,900
It just feels like there's so many obvious ones that it's weird that they haven't done any

3587
03:01:35,900 --> 03:01:38,900
for Thunderborn and Sword and Shield.

3588
03:01:38,900 --> 03:01:39,900
I agree.

3589
03:01:39,900 --> 03:01:42,900
Why stop with Fairy?

3590
03:01:42,900 --> 03:01:45,900
Why stop at, you know, what do they got?

3591
03:01:45,900 --> 03:01:47,900
Like eight or something?

3592
03:01:47,900 --> 03:01:51,900
They didn't even stop just with the normal elemental things.

3593
03:01:51,900 --> 03:01:53,900
No, they did Dark and Psychic.

3594
03:01:53,900 --> 03:01:54,900
Elemental ones missing.

3595
03:01:54,900 --> 03:01:57,900
Yeah, they did Dark and Psychic, which are weird.

3596
03:01:57,900 --> 03:01:58,900
It feels random.

3597
03:01:58,900 --> 03:01:59,900
They could totally do.

3598
03:01:59,900 --> 03:02:01,900
They could totally do a whole bunch more.

3599
03:02:01,900 --> 03:02:03,900
I don't know why they wouldn't.

3600
03:02:03,900 --> 03:02:05,900
Got an order and chaos.

3601
03:02:05,900 --> 03:02:06,900
Maybe.

3602
03:02:06,900 --> 03:02:10,900
I mean, with the bug one, like what would be like a weird bug cat?

3603
03:02:10,900 --> 03:02:14,900
Like just a cat that has like a segmented, like off body.

3604
03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:20,900
Yeah, I feel like it would be like a fluffy sort of like moth, like like a neck fruff.

3605
03:02:20,900 --> 03:02:22,900
And maybe you would have little little bug wings.

3606
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:27,900
Maybe you could just have compound eyes, maybe.

3607
03:02:27,900 --> 03:02:29,900
I think it would be cool.

3608
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:32,900
I think they could do a cool, a cool one.

3609
03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:38,900
You know, I was, I was shocked to see that they made a frickin.

3610
03:02:38,900 --> 03:02:41,900
What are they called?

3611
03:02:41,900 --> 03:02:44,900
Oh God, what are they called?

3612
03:02:44,900 --> 03:02:50,900
The golems with the dots on them.

3613
03:02:50,900 --> 03:02:51,900
No.

3614
03:02:51,900 --> 03:02:52,900
Oh, no.

3615
03:02:52,900 --> 03:02:53,900
I was shocked to make this.

3616
03:02:53,900 --> 03:02:55,900
They made a frickin dragon Reggie.

3617
03:02:55,900 --> 03:02:57,900
Like what the fuck is that?

3618
03:02:57,900 --> 03:03:01,900
Like what the fuck is that?

3619
03:03:01,900 --> 03:03:03,900
I forgot about this game.

3620
03:03:03,900 --> 03:03:05,900
I think it looks cool though.

3621
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:07,900
It looks cool, but like.

3622
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:09,900
That one looks better than the other Reggie's.

3623
03:03:09,900 --> 03:03:16,900
It looks, I mean, it's, it's weird that like what it's like made of like, it's made of dragon.

3624
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:18,900
Like what the fuck?

3625
03:03:18,900 --> 03:03:20,900
What the fuck?

3626
03:03:20,900 --> 03:03:23,900
But I mean, if they'll do that.

3627
03:03:23,900 --> 03:03:26,900
I mean, what are, what are all any of the Reggie's?

3628
03:03:26,900 --> 03:03:35,900
I mean, it's, it's pretty clear that like the first three are, or the first four are like creatures that are made of stuff.

3629
03:03:35,900 --> 03:03:45,900
And the, you know, they're like a golem made of ice, a golem made of rock, a golem made of steel, a golem made of, I don't know, nothing for his Reggie Giggis.

3630
03:03:45,900 --> 03:03:49,900
Made of normal stuff.

3631
03:03:49,900 --> 03:03:53,900
And, and then, oh yeah, how about a golem that's made of electricity?

3632
03:03:53,900 --> 03:04:00,900
How about a golem that's made of the concept of being a dragon?

3633
03:04:00,900 --> 03:04:02,900
Do they even have a Reggie water?

3634
03:04:02,900 --> 03:04:05,900
I, I think it's just those six.

3635
03:04:05,900 --> 03:04:07,900
I mean, that's an ice.

3636
03:04:07,900 --> 03:04:08,900
Yeah, Reggie.

3637
03:04:08,900 --> 03:04:09,900
Yeah, Reggie.

3638
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:10,900
Yeah.

3639
03:04:10,900 --> 03:04:17,900
Well, that was, it was, it was ice rock steel, and then they, and Giggis, and then they added, they added electric and dragon and that's right.

3640
03:04:17,900 --> 03:04:20,900
They just added the two.

3641
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:22,900
I don't even know.

3642
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:23,900
They do have an electric one.

3643
03:04:23,900 --> 03:04:24,900
They do have an electric one.

3644
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:25,900
I still like his design.

3645
03:04:25,900 --> 03:04:26,900
He's just, he's just a guy.

3646
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:28,900
He's just an orb with little feet.

3647
03:04:28,900 --> 03:04:30,900
Which one?

3648
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:32,900
A Reggie dragon.

3649
03:04:32,900 --> 03:04:34,900
Let's put him in the description.

3650
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:38,900
Look at it.

3651
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:41,900
It's, he's like the uvula of a dragon or a tongue.

3652
03:04:41,900 --> 03:04:44,900
He's like the tongue of a dragon.

3653
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:54,900
I imagine it's like some kind of species that lives inside of dragon skulls, like a hermit crab or something like that.

3654
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:56,900
That gets bore or like.

3655
03:04:56,900 --> 03:04:58,900
Like what the, like what the fuck is that?

3656
03:04:58,900 --> 03:04:59,900
It's a llama.

3657
03:04:59,900 --> 03:05:00,900
It's a llama.

3658
03:05:00,900 --> 03:05:01,900
I'm sorry.

3659
03:05:01,900 --> 03:05:06,900
This one honestly, this one actually kind of bugs me a little bit because like what the fuck is it?

3660
03:05:06,900 --> 03:05:08,900
There's lots of book.

3661
03:05:08,900 --> 03:05:13,900
It's a, it's a sphere of dragon meat with a skull of itself.

3662
03:05:13,900 --> 03:05:16,900
It looks mysterious.

3663
03:05:16,900 --> 03:05:20,900
Like what is it made of?

3664
03:05:20,900 --> 03:05:21,900
Dragon.

3665
03:05:21,900 --> 03:05:22,900
Sure.

3666
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:23,900
I get.

3667
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:28,900
You know in Elton Ring you get a sword when you kill the big dragon guy and it's made out of dragon.

3668
03:05:28,900 --> 03:05:31,900
Just a dragon piece.

3669
03:05:31,900 --> 03:05:32,900
Makes sense.

3670
03:05:32,900 --> 03:05:37,900
Like if there was some like rule for the Reggies being like imbued with an essence of something.

3671
03:05:37,900 --> 03:05:41,900
Then I guess if you shove a dragon in there it could make a dragon guy.

3672
03:05:41,900 --> 03:05:46,900
Just shove it, just shove a dragon in there and see what comes out.

3673
03:05:46,900 --> 03:05:51,900
If you put a ferret in there that could be like a Reggie ferret.

3674
03:05:51,900 --> 03:05:55,900
The thing is like the concept of being a dragon is so loose too.

3675
03:05:55,900 --> 03:05:59,900
Like it makes sense if something is like electric because it has electric power.

3676
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:01,900
But what does it even mean to have a dragon?

3677
03:06:01,900 --> 03:06:03,900
It's really, it's even, yeah.

3678
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:05,900
It's just a social construct.

3679
03:06:05,900 --> 03:06:06,900
Kind of like bug.

3680
03:06:06,900 --> 03:06:07,900
Yeah.

3681
03:06:07,900 --> 03:06:09,900
There's no, there's no such thing as a bug.

3682
03:06:09,900 --> 03:06:11,900
There's a bit more to bug.

3683
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:13,900
There's a bit more biology to bug.

3684
03:06:13,900 --> 03:06:15,900
Like they're all like off reports.

3685
03:06:15,900 --> 03:06:16,900
Right.

3686
03:06:16,900 --> 03:06:20,900
But I mean like Krabby is not a bug even though it's also an arthropod.

3687
03:06:20,900 --> 03:06:21,900
Yeah.

3688
03:06:23,900 --> 03:06:25,900
There's always weird exceptions.

3689
03:06:25,900 --> 03:06:26,900
I mean.

3690
03:06:26,900 --> 03:06:28,900
Yeah, but it'd be a dragon that's even more like.

3691
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:31,900
What's the name of the fire?

3692
03:06:31,900 --> 03:06:33,900
What about the starter fire dragon?

3693
03:06:33,900 --> 03:06:34,900
I forgot his name.

3694
03:06:34,900 --> 03:06:35,900
Fuck.

3695
03:06:35,900 --> 03:06:36,900
Charizard.

3696
03:06:36,900 --> 03:06:38,900
He's the dragon type evil, right?

3697
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:40,900
How would you forget Charizard?

3698
03:06:40,900 --> 03:06:43,900
I, well, first of all, I didn't grow up with Pokemon.

3699
03:06:43,900 --> 03:06:46,900
I played my first Pokemon game like three years ago.

3700
03:06:46,900 --> 03:06:49,900
And also I know the German names.

3701
03:06:49,900 --> 03:06:50,900
It's Grumanda.

3702
03:06:50,900 --> 03:06:51,900
Grumanda?

3703
03:06:51,900 --> 03:06:52,900
Grumanda.

3704
03:06:52,900 --> 03:06:54,900
Like, like glued.

3705
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:58,900
Like glooming, no, embers.

3706
03:06:58,900 --> 03:07:00,900
It's like, it's named after embers basically.

3707
03:07:00,900 --> 03:07:01,900
Hmm.

3708
03:07:01,900 --> 03:07:02,900
Neat.

3709
03:07:02,900 --> 03:07:07,900
Well, you know, they made him, he has the dragon type mega evolution, but like whatever.

3710
03:07:07,900 --> 03:07:08,900
Oh yeah.

3711
03:07:08,900 --> 03:07:09,900
Yeah.

3712
03:07:09,900 --> 03:07:10,900
Grumanda.

3713
03:07:10,900 --> 03:07:14,900
He's clearly a dragon, but they didn't make him one because I don't know, for balancing

3714
03:07:14,900 --> 03:07:15,900
reasons, I guess?

3715
03:07:15,900 --> 03:07:17,900
I guess because the dragon type was too good in gen one.

3716
03:07:17,900 --> 03:07:19,900
I think that, I think that's probably why.

3717
03:07:23,900 --> 03:07:28,900
Yeah, it's just funny that's the most iconic looking dragon just looks like a normal European

3718
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:31,900
idea of a dragon more than anyone else.

3719
03:07:31,900 --> 03:07:35,900
I really liked, I really liked Drampa.

3720
03:07:35,900 --> 03:07:37,900
I thought Drampa was really cool.

3721
03:07:37,900 --> 03:07:41,900
You know him from, I think he's from, I think he's from X and Y.

3722
03:07:41,900 --> 03:07:43,900
No, he might be from Alola.

3723
03:07:43,900 --> 03:07:45,900
What one was that?

3724
03:07:45,900 --> 03:07:48,900
The one that sort of, it sort of looks like a Chinese dragon.

3725
03:07:48,900 --> 03:07:52,900
Oh yeah, no, that's from, that's from Alola.

3726
03:07:52,900 --> 03:07:53,900
Okay.

3727
03:07:53,900 --> 03:07:54,900
Yeah.

3728
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:56,900
That looks kind of watery.

3729
03:07:56,900 --> 03:07:57,900
Yes.

3730
03:07:57,900 --> 03:08:01,900
It's like the white, the white like furry tail and stuff.

3731
03:08:01,900 --> 03:08:03,900
Yeah, that's neat.

3732
03:08:03,900 --> 03:08:04,900
I like him a lot.

3733
03:08:05,900 --> 03:08:06,900
Yeah.

3734
03:08:08,900 --> 03:08:10,900
There's a lot of cool dragons.

3735
03:08:10,900 --> 03:08:11,900
I like dragon.

3736
03:08:11,900 --> 03:08:14,900
They should just make Pokemon but just with dragon.

3737
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:17,900
Hey, was Temtem any good?

3738
03:08:17,900 --> 03:08:19,900
Anyone play Temtem?

3739
03:08:19,900 --> 03:08:21,900
No idea.

3740
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:30,900
You know, they made some indie devs made like a Pokemon MMO called Temtem.

3741
03:08:30,900 --> 03:08:33,900
I mean, it wasn't officially Pokemon.

3742
03:08:33,900 --> 03:08:40,900
And then I heard a lot of buzz around it when it came out and then I haven't really really heard anything about it in a while.

3743
03:08:40,900 --> 03:08:46,900
I mean, I think I got like wins or falls of the monster designs, right?

3744
03:08:46,900 --> 03:08:50,900
Like they got to be really good to like be a competitor.

3745
03:08:50,900 --> 03:08:51,900
Yeah.

3746
03:08:51,900 --> 03:08:54,900
I was like, I don't really remember.

3747
03:08:54,900 --> 03:08:56,900
I didn't really see that many of them.

3748
03:08:56,900 --> 03:08:58,900
So I don't know if they were any good or not.

3749
03:08:58,900 --> 03:09:00,900
They look all right.

3750
03:09:00,900 --> 03:09:05,900
Some of them look a bit too much like Pokemon and some of them don't really look too much like anything.

3751
03:09:08,900 --> 03:09:11,900
Here's a picture of their poster, I guess.

3752
03:09:13,900 --> 03:09:14,900
Okay.

3753
03:09:15,900 --> 03:09:16,900
All right.

3754
03:09:18,900 --> 03:09:27,900
They look like fun creatures, but I don't know if they probably don't have the same degree of iconosism as Pokemon signs have.

3755
03:09:27,900 --> 03:09:34,900
When I, when I heard about it, I was really excited about it because I'd always thought a Pokemon MMO would be super cool.

3756
03:09:34,900 --> 03:09:37,900
So I kind of in the back of my mind said I should play that.

3757
03:09:37,900 --> 03:09:43,900
But like, yeah, I haven't heard, haven't heard much about it for a while now.

3758
03:09:43,900 --> 03:09:44,900
So I don't know.

3759
03:09:44,900 --> 03:09:50,900
I wonder if it was any, I wonder if it was any good.

3760
03:09:50,900 --> 03:10:04,900
I think people overlook the marketing of the original Pokemon games and how it's just sort of like aesthetically pleasing to have like a blue Pokemon and a red Pokemon and a green Pokemon and choose.

3761
03:10:04,900 --> 03:10:07,900
Yeah, these are immediately two complex, I think.

3762
03:10:09,900 --> 03:10:11,900
Yeah, there's no like a theme.

3763
03:10:11,900 --> 03:10:13,900
I couldn't tell which one's the starters.

3764
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:14,900
With the color design.

3765
03:10:14,900 --> 03:10:15,900
Who's the starters?

3766
03:10:15,900 --> 03:10:17,900
It's just sort of like, what if they were cool monster designs?

3767
03:10:17,900 --> 03:10:19,900
I was like, yeah, I'm sure.

3768
03:10:19,900 --> 03:10:20,900
But like, who's your mascot?

3769
03:10:20,900 --> 03:10:23,900
I don't know who Temtemon's mascot is.

3770
03:10:23,900 --> 03:10:32,900
That's why they keep the Gen 1 Pokemon and every Pokemon game almost like to like, yeah, these are so iconic and get rid of them.

3771
03:10:32,900 --> 03:10:38,900
There's a an old Tim Rogers video for Kotaku where he talks about Pokemon.

3772
03:10:38,900 --> 03:10:52,900
Yeah, and he says that like the marketing of Pokemon with like the red and blue, like it's like layers and layers of like making you make decisions about it.

3773
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:58,900
Like before you even play the game, you have to choose red or blue and you're already invested.

3774
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:05,900
And even before that, like even when you hear about Pokemon, you have to choose like, which one would you play, red or blue?

3775
03:11:05,900 --> 03:11:14,900
And then it's like, well, you have to pick one or the other or like, or else you have to make the conscious decision not to play it.

3776
03:11:14,900 --> 03:11:19,900
Like in order to not play it, you have to make a conscious decision not to do that.

3777
03:11:19,900 --> 03:11:20,900
Yeah.

3778
03:11:20,900 --> 03:11:21,900
Yeah.

3779
03:11:21,900 --> 03:11:24,900
It's, it's pretty genius actually.

3780
03:11:24,900 --> 03:11:25,900
Yeah.

3781
03:11:25,900 --> 03:11:34,900
It's like immediately presenting you with this binary set of options and it's like, well, you're all you're already playing the game much like Undertale.

3782
03:11:34,900 --> 03:11:39,900
You're already playing the game, whether you want to or not.

3783
03:11:39,900 --> 03:11:42,900
I'm probably going to play the new one.

3784
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:47,900
I don't have a switch, but my, I'm sometimes babysitting my little cousin and he has a switch.

3785
03:11:47,900 --> 03:11:54,900
So I can just like, when he goes to bed, I can just play on switch and it usually gets a new Pokemon games and stuff.

3786
03:11:54,900 --> 03:12:00,900
Mercifully, I do not have a switch.

3787
03:12:00,900 --> 03:12:02,900
Wait, didn't you play Animal Crossing?

3788
03:12:02,900 --> 03:12:05,900
I played it on my roommate switch.

3789
03:12:05,900 --> 03:12:06,900
Yeah.

3790
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:07,900
The roommate's gone now.

3791
03:12:07,900 --> 03:12:08,900
Yeah.

3792
03:12:08,900 --> 03:12:10,900
So I guess I'll, I guess I'll never go.

3793
03:12:10,900 --> 03:12:14,900
I guess I'll never go back to Yakitori Island.

3794
03:12:14,900 --> 03:12:16,900
What about your roses?

3795
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:18,900
Make like a billion black roses.

3796
03:12:18,900 --> 03:12:19,900
Yeah.

3797
03:12:19,900 --> 03:12:21,900
All those roses are gone.

3798
03:12:21,900 --> 03:12:22,900
Damn.

3799
03:12:22,900 --> 03:12:23,900
Oh well.

3800
03:12:23,900 --> 03:12:25,900
That actually makes me a little sad.

3801
03:12:25,900 --> 03:12:26,900
Oh well.

3802
03:12:26,900 --> 03:12:28,900
It passed, it passed the time.

3803
03:12:28,900 --> 03:12:29,900
I was going to.

3804
03:12:29,900 --> 03:12:30,900
It's like a whole arc.

3805
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:31,900
Yeah.

3806
03:12:31,900 --> 03:12:32,900
That's true.

3807
03:12:32,900 --> 03:12:37,900
I was, I was going to build a, I sort of had built up sort of a little piece of the island.

3808
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:41,900
I was going to make a little like industrial city complex, like in one corner.

3809
03:12:41,900 --> 03:12:43,900
That was the goal anyway.

3810
03:12:43,900 --> 03:12:51,900
It ended up, I kind of ended up sort of like, sort of struggling with like what my options were and like how I could even make that really happen.

3811
03:12:51,900 --> 03:12:53,900
So, I don't know.

3812
03:12:53,900 --> 03:12:54,900
It's okay.

3813
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:58,900
Is the, is the new leaf?

3814
03:12:58,900 --> 03:12:59,900
Am I crossing?

3815
03:12:59,900 --> 03:13:00,900
Is that good?

3816
03:13:00,900 --> 03:13:01,900
Because I have it.

3817
03:13:01,900 --> 03:13:02,900
On the DS?

3818
03:13:02,900 --> 03:13:03,900
Yeah.

3819
03:13:03,900 --> 03:13:06,900
I think it's for the 2DS, 3DS.

3820
03:13:06,900 --> 03:13:09,900
I, I think I played it a bit.

3821
03:13:09,900 --> 03:13:16,900
I don't know if I, I didn't play, I definitely didn't play it as much as New Horizons.

3822
03:13:16,900 --> 03:13:20,900
I mean, I think it's gotten most of what New Horizons has.

3823
03:13:20,900 --> 03:13:21,900
Oh.

3824
03:13:21,900 --> 03:13:22,900
Well.

3825
03:13:23,900 --> 03:13:30,900
Maybe not, maybe not as much item variety as that, but.

3826
03:13:30,900 --> 03:13:33,900
Anyway, where was I?

3827
03:13:33,900 --> 03:13:37,900
We were on the next, the next voicemail.

3828
03:13:37,900 --> 03:13:41,900
The next voicemail was.

3829
03:13:41,900 --> 03:13:44,900
By the way, I may need to go in like 40 minutes.

3830
03:13:44,900 --> 03:13:46,900
Then I'll stretch for 10.

3831
03:13:46,900 --> 03:13:48,900
Well, let's try and get through these.

3832
03:13:48,900 --> 03:13:55,900
The next one is called Week of 10, 29, 22.

3833
03:13:55,900 --> 03:13:57,900
I think this is Vinny's stuff.

3834
03:13:57,900 --> 03:13:59,900
It's a, it's an album.

3835
03:13:59,900 --> 03:14:00,900
Yeah.

3836
03:14:00,900 --> 03:14:01,900
Yeah, it's an album.

3837
03:14:01,900 --> 03:14:08,900
Why is the, why is the, the thumbnail of a fat molecule?

3838
03:14:08,900 --> 03:14:10,900
We'll find out in context.

3839
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:12,900
Co-worker saw me doodling.

3840
03:14:12,900 --> 03:14:17,900
They're making it harder to, they're making it harder to stay sane at work.

3841
03:14:17,900 --> 03:14:20,900
I couldn't draw as much as I'd like to.

3842
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:23,900
Co-worker saw me doodling and asked if I could do a dragon.

3843
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:24,900
So I did.

3844
03:14:24,900 --> 03:14:26,900
Good dragon.

3845
03:14:26,900 --> 03:14:27,900
Then Saint.

3846
03:14:27,900 --> 03:14:32,900
God, I hope he didn't see you drawing Ben Saint's stand slime time and ask like, hey,

3847
03:14:32,900 --> 03:14:33,900
what are you drawing?

3848
03:14:33,900 --> 03:14:35,900
Like, hey, what's.

3849
03:14:35,900 --> 03:14:40,900
The first figure closest to him is Lipid, the, then Uwupadi, then to the right is Toxicity.

3850
03:14:40,900 --> 03:14:46,900
Toxicity is Ben's bile and expulsions compressed into a dense structure to make its touch lethal.

3851
03:14:46,900 --> 03:14:50,900
Then Saint is filth and fury down to the bone.

3852
03:14:50,900 --> 03:14:51,900
So what's Lipid?

3853
03:14:51,900 --> 03:14:53,900
Is it my fat?

3854
03:14:53,900 --> 03:14:54,900
Is it my keto?

3855
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:55,900
Yeah, I guess.

3856
03:14:55,900 --> 03:14:59,900
I think it's your fat, your slime and your bile.

3857
03:14:59,900 --> 03:15:04,900
Great.

3858
03:15:04,900 --> 03:15:09,900
Buffalo Uwupadi is very distracting, very scary.

3859
03:15:09,900 --> 03:15:13,900
I'm checking my phone somehow one sec.

3860
03:15:14,900 --> 03:15:15,900
One sec.

3861
03:15:15,900 --> 03:15:17,900
Checking Twitter.

3862
03:15:17,900 --> 03:15:19,900
Lol, take your time.

3863
03:15:19,900 --> 03:15:20,900
I know what you're doing.

3864
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:22,900
Wait, do I have another guitar there?

3865
03:15:22,900 --> 03:15:25,900
Is it like a little ukulele case?

3866
03:15:25,900 --> 03:15:27,900
Yes.

3867
03:15:27,900 --> 03:15:29,900
So what's in the smaller guitar case?

3868
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:33,900
I know you play the one.

3869
03:15:33,900 --> 03:15:34,900
Oh, this.

3870
03:15:34,900 --> 03:15:35,900
It's actually a gift.

3871
03:15:35,900 --> 03:15:36,900
I was given.

3872
03:15:36,900 --> 03:15:37,900
I was given for you.

3873
03:15:37,900 --> 03:15:40,900
Isomoto Ligo Sakura.

3874
03:15:40,900 --> 03:15:41,900
Oh, shit.

3875
03:15:41,900 --> 03:15:42,900
Holy shit.

3876
03:15:42,900 --> 03:15:43,900
Yep.

3877
03:15:43,900 --> 03:15:46,900
I can't believe it.

3878
03:15:46,900 --> 03:15:49,900
Why would I carry it in a little ukulele case?

3879
03:15:49,900 --> 03:15:53,900
It's like a Breaking Bad Blue Crystal Man.

3880
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:55,900
The fat molecule.

3881
03:15:55,900 --> 03:16:00,900
This is what Ben Saint stands original shape is.

3882
03:16:00,900 --> 03:16:01,900
What?

3883
03:16:01,900 --> 03:16:02,900
These are Lipid.

3884
03:16:02,900 --> 03:16:03,900
I know what these are.

3885
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:04,900
These are Lipids.

3886
03:16:04,900 --> 03:16:06,900
That's fats, right?

3887
03:16:06,900 --> 03:16:07,900
Yeah.

3888
03:16:07,900 --> 03:16:09,900
This is just a diagram of variations.

3889
03:16:09,900 --> 03:16:12,900
I was looking for designing the stand for Ben Saint.

3890
03:16:12,900 --> 03:16:15,900
Wait, I'm looking at...

3891
03:16:15,900 --> 03:16:20,900
Oh, the shape of the head is like a molecule.

3892
03:16:20,900 --> 03:16:23,900
I think that's very strange.

3893
03:16:23,900 --> 03:16:26,900
I get so many stands.

3894
03:16:26,900 --> 03:16:29,900
I'm just a wash with stands.

3895
03:16:29,900 --> 03:16:31,900
Very cool.

3896
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:32,900
Thanks, Vinny.

3897
03:16:32,900 --> 03:16:35,900
I just feel like that they added the dragon.

3898
03:16:35,900 --> 03:16:37,900
That's very...

3899
03:16:37,900 --> 03:16:38,900
Here's a dragon.

3900
03:16:38,900 --> 03:16:41,900
I want to see all the dragons.

3901
03:16:41,900 --> 03:16:43,900
Please draw more dragons.

3902
03:16:43,900 --> 03:16:44,900
More dragons.

3903
03:16:44,900 --> 03:16:46,900
More dragons.

3904
03:16:46,900 --> 03:16:47,900
Next one is...

3905
03:16:47,900 --> 03:16:48,900
And dragon types.

3906
03:16:48,900 --> 03:16:50,900
An untitled album.

3907
03:16:50,900 --> 03:16:52,900
We finally...

3908
03:16:52,900 --> 03:16:54,900
We finally found it.

3909
03:16:54,900 --> 03:16:56,900
A mammoth.

3910
03:16:56,900 --> 03:16:58,900
It's Poptropica Lego.

3911
03:16:58,900 --> 03:16:59,900
Oh, it's a...

3912
03:16:59,900 --> 03:17:00,900
Poptropica.

3913
03:17:00,900 --> 03:17:02,900
It's a Lego mammoth.

3914
03:17:02,900 --> 03:17:03,900
Cool and white.

3915
03:17:03,900 --> 03:17:05,900
She said I don't even know what I said.

3916
03:17:05,900 --> 03:17:06,900
Pretty cool.

3917
03:17:06,900 --> 03:17:11,900
This little custom bespoke piece for a mammoth trapped in an ice block.

3918
03:17:11,900 --> 03:17:12,900
Yeah.

3919
03:17:12,900 --> 03:17:14,900
Very, very nifty.

3920
03:17:14,900 --> 03:17:19,900
I actually had a Playmobil, like, Playworld that was the same thing,

3921
03:17:19,900 --> 03:17:22,900
but with dinosaurs trapped in ice cubes and stuff.

3922
03:17:22,900 --> 03:17:23,900
And like...

3923
03:17:23,900 --> 03:17:24,900
Do you know Playmobil?

3924
03:17:24,900 --> 03:17:26,900
Is there a thing over there?

3925
03:17:26,900 --> 03:17:28,900
Oh, yeah, I know.

3926
03:17:28,900 --> 03:17:30,900
Yeah, I never had it.

3927
03:17:30,900 --> 03:17:32,900
But I know...

3928
03:17:32,900 --> 03:17:34,900
Is it like Duplo?

3929
03:17:35,900 --> 03:17:38,900
It's not building blocks.

3930
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:41,900
But it's still kind of like...

3931
03:17:41,900 --> 03:17:45,900
The similarity is the little people have removable hair

3932
03:17:45,900 --> 03:17:49,900
and they can put little things in their Lego mittens.

3933
03:17:49,900 --> 03:17:51,900
Yeah, and they're still kind of made of different segments

3934
03:17:51,900 --> 03:17:53,900
that you can build in different ways.

3935
03:17:53,900 --> 03:17:56,900
But it's not as...

3936
03:17:56,900 --> 03:17:58,900
It's not tiny pieces.

3937
03:17:58,900 --> 03:18:00,900
It's bigger segments.

3938
03:18:00,900 --> 03:18:02,900
And it's way cheaper than Lego.

3939
03:18:02,900 --> 03:18:05,900
It's definitely way cheaper than Lego and they just make better sets for your money.

3940
03:18:05,900 --> 03:18:07,900
But like...

3941
03:18:07,900 --> 03:18:08,900
Yeah.

3942
03:18:08,900 --> 03:18:11,900
Plastic is used more efficiently.

3943
03:18:11,900 --> 03:18:13,900
I always liked it with Playmobil.

3944
03:18:13,900 --> 03:18:16,900
You could take their hair off and replace it with different hair.

3945
03:18:16,900 --> 03:18:19,900
But inside their head is like a...

3946
03:18:19,900 --> 03:18:22,900
It's just a hollow little sphere.

3947
03:18:22,900 --> 03:18:24,900
So if you take their hair off and you misplace it,

3948
03:18:24,900 --> 03:18:26,900
they are now like an open skull.

3949
03:18:26,900 --> 03:18:27,900
They're Maggie.

3950
03:18:27,900 --> 03:18:30,900
They're Maggie from me.

3951
03:18:30,900 --> 03:18:32,900
Put a little maggot inside.

3952
03:18:32,900 --> 03:18:33,900
Oh, right, right, right.

3953
03:18:33,900 --> 03:18:34,900
Oh, yeah.

3954
03:18:34,900 --> 03:18:38,900
Okay, then next one is called Wild Tails.

3955
03:18:38,900 --> 03:18:40,900
Use Streamio.

3956
03:18:40,900 --> 03:18:42,900
Shish piracy.

3957
03:18:42,900 --> 03:18:45,900
Three, two, one, go.

3958
03:18:47,900 --> 03:18:50,900
Very cool, very interesting.

3959
03:18:50,900 --> 03:18:52,900
Argentinian movie.

3960
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:54,900
Wild Tails.

3961
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:57,900
I think Ben would really like it.

3962
03:18:57,900 --> 03:18:59,900
It's like human.

3963
03:19:00,900 --> 03:19:04,900
Human thesis, human dissertation.

3964
03:19:04,900 --> 03:19:07,900
Inspire me for a lot of stuff.

3965
03:19:10,900 --> 03:19:11,900
What did he say?

3966
03:19:11,900 --> 03:19:12,900
Ben would like it.

3967
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:13,900
It's like...

3968
03:19:13,900 --> 03:19:15,900
There's a human thesis in it.

3969
03:19:15,900 --> 03:19:18,900
Human thesis?

3970
03:19:18,900 --> 03:19:19,900
Yeah.

3971
03:19:19,900 --> 03:19:22,900
Yeah, like a thesis on human condition or something.

3972
03:19:22,900 --> 03:19:23,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3973
03:19:23,900 --> 03:19:25,900
Is that all he said about it?

3974
03:19:25,900 --> 03:19:27,900
I think so.

3975
03:19:27,900 --> 03:19:32,900
Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior

3976
03:19:32,900 --> 03:19:35,900
involving people in distress.

3977
03:19:35,900 --> 03:19:37,900
I love people in distress.

3978
03:19:37,900 --> 03:19:40,900
True, true.

3979
03:19:40,900 --> 03:19:42,900
I mean, I like...

3980
03:19:42,900 --> 03:19:45,900
I'm down for vignettes, I guess.

3981
03:19:45,900 --> 03:19:47,900
I don't know, it could be good.

3982
03:19:48,900 --> 03:19:51,900
All right, next one is called Ben St.

3983
03:19:51,900 --> 03:19:53,900
More Like Ben Stupid.

3984
03:19:53,900 --> 03:19:55,900
I'm on it.

3985
03:19:55,900 --> 03:19:58,900
That's just mean, that's just uncalled for.

3986
03:19:58,900 --> 03:20:00,900
Three, two, one, go.

3987
03:20:01,900 --> 03:20:05,900
The late China QOCs.

3988
03:20:05,900 --> 03:20:08,900
Is that what China QOCs?

3989
03:20:08,900 --> 03:20:13,900
Literally 20 years plus of using the internet

3990
03:20:13,900 --> 03:20:17,900
and you don't know what Sonic OCs look like.

3991
03:20:17,900 --> 03:20:19,900
Wow, Ben St.

3992
03:20:19,900 --> 03:20:21,900
I thought you were the smart one.

3993
03:20:21,900 --> 03:20:23,900
Yes, I do.

3994
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:25,900
What is he talking about?

3995
03:20:25,900 --> 03:20:27,900
You made a brief goof

3996
03:20:27,900 --> 03:20:30,900
where you thought something was a Sonic QOC

3997
03:20:30,900 --> 03:20:32,900
rather than just a Sonic OC.

3998
03:20:32,900 --> 03:20:35,900
Right, right, right, right.

3999
03:20:35,900 --> 03:20:37,900
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right.

4000
03:20:37,900 --> 03:20:38,900
My mind just went...

4001
03:20:38,900 --> 03:20:39,900
I just think...

4002
03:20:39,900 --> 03:20:41,900
I'm sorry, I'm literally more familiar with Sonic Q

4003
03:20:41,900 --> 03:20:43,900
than I am with Sonic the Hedgehog.

4004
03:20:43,900 --> 03:20:46,900
I have consumed more Sonic 2 media, so...

4005
03:20:46,900 --> 03:20:47,900
Terrifying.

4006
03:20:47,900 --> 03:20:49,900
It's just where my mind goes.

4007
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:52,900
I'm sorry, I've never played a Sonic game and I never will.

4008
03:20:52,900 --> 03:20:54,900
Incredible, even I've played a Sonic game.

4009
03:20:54,900 --> 03:20:57,900
I mean, I've played a little bit of like

4010
03:20:57,900 --> 03:21:00,900
and knuckles on like my friend's Genesis

4011
03:21:00,900 --> 03:21:02,900
when I was like a little kid.

4012
03:21:04,900 --> 03:21:06,900
Next one is called...

4013
03:21:08,900 --> 03:21:11,900
Ben St. More Like Ben's Stupid 2.

4014
03:21:12,900 --> 03:21:14,900
The sequel, okay.

4015
03:21:14,900 --> 03:21:16,900
Wait, sorry, I'm posting it now.

4016
03:21:16,900 --> 03:21:18,900
There it is.

4017
03:21:18,900 --> 03:21:20,900
3, 2, 1, go.

4018
03:21:21,900 --> 03:21:23,900
An addendum to that last one.

4019
03:21:23,900 --> 03:21:27,900
Like, literally, you were a Brony Ben St.

4020
03:21:27,900 --> 03:21:29,900
You were Brony St.

4021
03:21:29,900 --> 03:21:31,900
Phantom Horn.

4022
03:21:31,900 --> 03:21:33,900
Did you forget that?

4023
03:21:33,900 --> 03:21:34,900
No.

4024
03:21:34,900 --> 03:21:36,900
Have you literally forgotten?

4025
03:21:36,900 --> 03:21:37,900
No.

4026
03:21:37,900 --> 03:21:38,900
Like the Pony O'Sauce?

4027
03:21:38,900 --> 03:21:40,900
What do you mean Pony O'Sauce?

4028
03:21:40,900 --> 03:21:44,900
Like fucking wow.

4029
03:21:44,900 --> 03:21:45,900
Gotcha.

4030
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:49,900
What did I do to deserve this?

4031
03:21:50,900 --> 03:21:52,900
This guy's really pissed off.

4032
03:21:53,900 --> 03:21:55,900
He was really offensive.

4033
03:21:55,900 --> 03:21:56,900
He had his feelings.

4034
03:21:56,900 --> 03:21:57,900
Yeah.

4035
03:21:58,900 --> 03:22:01,900
Next one is called...

4036
03:22:01,900 --> 03:22:03,900
Is This Cannon?

4037
03:22:03,900 --> 03:22:04,900
Gwib?

4038
03:22:04,900 --> 03:22:06,900
I think it's meant to say Gib.

4039
03:22:07,900 --> 03:22:10,900
There it is, it's an Imgur album.

4040
03:22:10,900 --> 03:22:13,900
British people having sex be like...

4041
03:22:13,900 --> 03:22:14,900
Scrumptious.

4042
03:22:14,900 --> 03:22:16,900
It's Tuesday in it.

4043
03:22:16,900 --> 03:22:18,900
Why would you say it's Tuesday?

4044
03:22:18,900 --> 03:22:20,900
You're in a sex.

4045
03:22:20,900 --> 03:22:22,900
That's got nothing to do with it.

4046
03:22:22,900 --> 03:22:24,900
Oh, Eleazar, don't link this one

4047
03:22:24,900 --> 03:22:28,900
because it gives you the mature content

4048
03:22:28,900 --> 03:22:31,900
warning like RU18+.

4049
03:22:31,900 --> 03:22:34,900
Yeah, well last time when we linked Vinny's album

4050
03:22:34,900 --> 03:22:35,900
even though there was nothing bad in it

4051
03:22:35,900 --> 03:22:37,900
because it asked RU18+,

4052
03:22:37,900 --> 03:22:40,900
it gave us a freaking content strike

4053
03:22:40,900 --> 03:22:43,900
so Eleazar, do not link this album

4054
03:22:43,900 --> 03:22:45,900
please, although I'm pretty sure

4055
03:22:45,900 --> 03:22:47,900
you can show the image.

4056
03:22:47,900 --> 03:22:49,900
Yes, it's true.

4057
03:22:49,900 --> 03:22:51,900
It is always Tuesday

4058
03:22:51,900 --> 03:22:55,900
when British people have sex.

4059
03:22:55,900 --> 03:22:57,900
It's always Tuesday,

4060
03:22:57,900 --> 03:22:59,900
but I'm waiting for shit Wednesday.

4061
03:22:59,900 --> 03:23:01,900
That's after.

4062
03:23:01,900 --> 03:23:05,900
When the Holy Spirit will give me my tongues.

4063
03:23:06,900 --> 03:23:07,900
There's only one more,

4064
03:23:07,900 --> 03:23:11,900
only one more of these damnable things.

4065
03:23:11,900 --> 03:23:13,900
It is...

4066
03:23:17,900 --> 03:23:18,900
Wait, I found it.

4067
03:23:18,900 --> 03:23:20,900
It's called I Scream Halloween

4068
03:23:20,900 --> 03:23:22,900
into my mic for 40 seconds.

4069
03:23:22,900 --> 03:23:23,900
Oh, no.

4070
03:23:23,900 --> 03:23:25,900
Okay, let's do it.

4074
03:23:34,900 --> 03:23:37,900
Come with us and you will see

4075
03:23:37,900 --> 03:23:40,900
this entire town of Halloween.

4076
03:23:40,900 --> 03:23:42,900
This is Halloween.

4077
03:23:42,900 --> 03:23:43,900
This is Halloween.

4078
03:23:43,900 --> 03:23:46,900
This is not what he said it would be.

4079
03:23:46,900 --> 03:23:48,900
This is Halloween.

4080
03:23:48,900 --> 03:23:50,900
Everybody make a scene.

4081
03:23:50,900 --> 03:23:51,900
We're going to get a copyright.

4082
03:23:51,900 --> 03:23:52,900
We're gonna get a copyrighted idea

4083
03:23:52,900 --> 03:23:54,900
for the movie song.

4084
03:23:54,900 --> 03:23:56,900
We go home, everybody

4085
03:23:56,900 --> 03:23:58,900
heads to the pumpkin song.

4086
03:23:58,900 --> 03:24:01,900
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.

4087
03:24:01,900 --> 03:24:03,900
That's what I thought it would be.

4088
03:24:03,900 --> 03:24:05,900
Yeah, I was hoping for him to scream

4089
03:24:05,900 --> 03:24:07,900
Scream the word

4090
03:24:09,380 --> 03:24:14,540
That's what he advertised so I feel I feel disappointed. Yeah, I feel like I was misled

4091
03:24:15,460 --> 03:24:17,560
does remind me of of the

4092
03:24:18,140 --> 03:24:19,460
the

4093
03:24:19,460 --> 03:24:24,700
Nalaka calm version the endless war version that everybody did. Oh, that's why I know the song from

4094
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:31,180
That I mean first I got us just yes, that was that was so great

4095
03:24:31,420 --> 03:24:35,460
But what do you mean you would you don't know the original? I don't think so

4096
03:24:35,940 --> 03:24:43,180
It's the nightmare before Christmas Tim Burton film skeleton guy. That's so funny. Oh god. I actually haven't seen you in the Nalaka calm version

4097
03:24:44,260 --> 03:24:46,260
Haven't seen it yet. Well, I

4098
03:24:46,860 --> 03:24:51,500
Was I mean I said I was I was I was too scared to watch it as a kid. I thought it looked spooky

4099
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:58,900
Maybe I should watch it was spooky, but I did watch it and I was scared by the bugs coming from the big guy

4100
03:24:59,020 --> 03:25:01,020
That sounds great. I should watch it. Oh

4101
03:25:01,660 --> 03:25:05,860
Yeah, there's a guy who's filled with bugs and it is disturbing
