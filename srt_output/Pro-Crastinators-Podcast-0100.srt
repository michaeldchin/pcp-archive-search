00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
How are we gonna read the Super Chats at the end?

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Hello everyone. Welcome to episode 100 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero, one zero zero,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, alright, I'm the best guy ever. Today we have with us Hippocrite. Hello!

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why don't you wear his tiny hat?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's me! You better fucking believe this is the most exciting podcast you've ever seen in your fucking life!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Have your ass glow to that fucking scene!

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I blew out my voice with this shit and you're gonna fill the full brute force of my fucking spiritual cock up your ass pretty soon, bitch!

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've got Digi, bro!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey, it's me! It's the one! You know the one! He's the Bippity Boppity with the Flippity Flappity!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And, uh, Tom's next to me.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Tom Oliver, everybody!

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't even know what to say in response to that. What's a Flippity Flappity?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm getting bad images from that, too.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know what's a Flippity Flappity?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, we've got some ideas. Mr. Ben Saint!

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Woohoo!

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Woo! What a rush!

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And let's have a shout out to our cameraman, Victoire, behind the cameraman. Yeah!

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There he is!

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah!

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Woo!

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The layers! The layers!

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The layers.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright, today's episode, everybody, is a very special episode.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ben is not in shot.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, help! Help!

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Today's episode of the Progressives Podcast.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Friendship!

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Friendship!

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, Urban Dictionary.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No!

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who's got a working phone, because my phone is not working.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're going to urbandictionary.com.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Give me everyone one of your phones.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We wrecked the internet before.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We have had, I apologize to everyone who's been waiting.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We've had some technical difficulties.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, and by the way, that's a good chance to say,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
if you're thinking of super chatting, feel free to do so,

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and we encourage you to wait until the end,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
because we're not reading, we're not distracting ourselves,

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
any of that pedantic fan bullshit.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I got it first.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Until the end of the episode,

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
when we get to the questions section,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we will be looking at all the super chats we've gotten,

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and feel free to send them then,

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and we will look at them, and we will evaluate them as we do normally,

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
because as we all know, your questions are usually trash,

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and we don't want to waste everyone's time interrupting the podcast every second.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't expect us to reach out at all during this.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, we're not reading chat at all.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Enjoy that. We'll get back to you at the question time.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What do we got for friendship?

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
True friendship is not when you go to school,

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and hang around with someone,

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
just because you have no one else to chill with.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not calling someone up when you're bored,

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
because they are fun to talk to.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's not when you can't think of a birthday gift,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and end up buying your friend a Walmart gift card.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not when you have to talk to someone about something.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh my, this actually goes on for paragraphs.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
True friendship is a group piss.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, absolutely.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Group piss!

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We just pulled out our cocks just a few moments ago,

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and the yellow snow was as fucking vast as space itself.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And not one of us looked.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I believe that,

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
because I wasn't looking or anything to see.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Trust me.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Give me the zoom, dawg.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They can just see the group piss right here.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh yeah, there it is.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Group piss!

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Look how iconic.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Look how iconic that is.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's like a fucking Adderwood cover right there.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, is that not the new banner for the PCP?

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh yeah!

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We just go shot a boomage in there.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's a good idea.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That actually would be an amazing banner for the PCP.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It would be.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Nate, what are we talking about?

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We're just going to talk about friendship.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Have you ever even had a friend?

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are your experiences?

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What friendship is.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And first of all, how it's not real.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It doesn't exist.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
As most people use it.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, all right. Here's the real thing.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's get started.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's already something.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Please edit in the entirety of the weird

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
utilitarian podcast right now.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cut the episode.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Good night, everybody.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We got ahead of five minutes. It's gone.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, here's the thing.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Here's where I want to start with a concept of friendship.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I care about you all and I enjoy working with you.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But here's the thing. If you fucking betray me,

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will drop you with the drop of a hat.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
At any moment, you could do it.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And I will drop you without a moment's

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
hesitation.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So the point I'm getting at here is how

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
this is kind of ties in with love.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Because love and friendship are pretty related.

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Unconditional love, unconditional friendship

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is highly immoral.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I don't think anyone should ever do it.

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And that's my foundational principle

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
when I'm approaching this.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't understand why it's immoral.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I understand why maybe it doesn't make

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
sense.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, it is immoral because it encourages bad behavior.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And if you have the wisdom to recognize

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that you can avoid doing that,

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
then you should do it. If you're just ignorant

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and you don't realize you're doing something wrong,

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
then that's not immoral.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
True Friends is putting up with this.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Alright.

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll get into all this.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you keep applying friendship,

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
there's no connection.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But friendship isn't about that.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Friendship is that spicy look you get in your eyes

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
whenever you look at the male form

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and you just know it's not getting sweaty

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and starting to heat up.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And you know, whenever I look at your

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
eyes, hold on.

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Whenever I look at guys,

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
shift away, I'm thinking about something else.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nate, friendship is real.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You started off saying it wasn't real.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That was his real.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That was his look.

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not real like tables and chairs are real,

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
but it's real like, I don't know,

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the law is real.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's true.

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sort of.

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's real in the way that like,

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
math is real.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We all pretend that we have our own benefit.

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, friendship is real like math is real.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because we all agree on it.

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Friendship is real like magic is real.

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, all fucking know magic is real.

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No one's debating that.

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We were talking about this before.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to share everyone.

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I decided

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
relevant to this story.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think it's a story that you all will enjoy immensely.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was telling everyone in the car.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's kind of personal.

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I've chosen to share

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
because I think it's mostly making fun of me.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So hopefully you'll all appreciate it.

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Shrap fucking in for this.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is unreal.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is no peak weird utilitarianism.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I apologize to everyone already.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone involved.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So,

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I have a girlfriend now.

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And that's pretty cool.

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Nate's always bringing up his girlfriend in the fucking car.

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sorry.

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Here's the thing though.

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So the issue of

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
love

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
eventually came up.

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As it tends to do.

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Love came up.

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And what happened was

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
when the first thing I

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
looked at the table,

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
there was questions of like,

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
how come you haven't said I love you

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and stuff.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I had to be honest and be truthful

202
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and say, listen, here's the thing.

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't believe love exists.

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's where I'm coming at.

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is so uncomfortable.

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I know.

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I apologize.

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Chemicals in your brain.

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Here's the thing.

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We had to define the term love

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
before I was comfortable saying that I love you.

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We had to define the word.

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We had to define our terms.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Which I think is how you should have

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
conducted every relationship with everyone.

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And your definition is what everyone would consider love to be.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I know.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But it was really important to me that we established that word.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Clearly had to happen as Nate had to sit down

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
with his girlfriend and be like, okay,

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
we need to establish her so let's go to

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
urbandictionary.com.

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Look, look.

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is just the thing.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I had to establish what love was

226
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and what I was willing to say because

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
like I said before,

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't want people to think when I say that I love them

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
that I love them unconditionally.

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's really important because even if my fucking son one day

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is gay,

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
he'll be out of it.

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Music is a lot like love.

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's all a feeling.

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it fills the room from the floor of the ceiling.

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's what I think about.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We all understand this.

238
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I took some magic clowns to tell us.

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Friendship is real a lot like how magics are

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
a lot like how magnets are real

241
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and mostly aren't.

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Scientists tell us they are.

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I haven't had a serious girlfriend in quite a while

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and I wanted to be quite clear

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
because I believe it is the most

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
moral way to live.

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You know that picture somebody tweeted of like

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the robot body with the human head that said like

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
this is peak the utilitarian body.

250
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sorry ladies, this is what peak ethics looks like.

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's kind of how I feel about like my moral system.

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I wanted to be clear

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that when I say

254
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
what I mean is

255
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
what I mean is that

256
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I enjoy your company immensely.

257
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to share my life with you.

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to live together.

259
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's just what it is.

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, but I wanted to be clear

261
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that what I'm not saying is if you betray me

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
that I will stay by you.

263
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If you betray me.

264
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're nate.

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I say the word

266
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I want to make sure that it's clear

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that I'm talking about a bumblebee that is

268
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
yellow and black.

269
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think one of the major problems

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
of this day and age is that people

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
are using the same words but talking about

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
different things.

273
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I agree with that.

274
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's a different subject, but I agree.

275
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I honestly think it's, I believe

276
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that what you did there was a good idea

277
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and I think I would have done the same

278
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
if I had doubts about the like

279
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you know if I had thought there was a possibility

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
nate confirmed to doubting that this is a very

281
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
stupid girlfriend.

282
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If I wasn't sure that we thought

283
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
that it meant the same thing, you know

284
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't like

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ask but I had the sense

286
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
before I was willing to

287
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I had a sense that it was

288
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the same understanding before I was

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
like you know, Michelle would just walk home

290
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and she was like, yeah, yeah, I love

291
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
getting unnecessary work and getting

292
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
shit on by my boss and I love knocking the promotion

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that I was promised. I sure love that

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and you're like, oh, maybe she thinks love is something else.

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Maybe she doesn't know that love is a good

296
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
feeling. Well, like

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
some of us have

298
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
really hardcore autism and we

299
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
need these things.

300
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Some of us?

301
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's a hundredth episode.

302
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It doesn't do to be talking with

303
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
words that like people disagree

304
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
on the definitions. So I'm giving you

305
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
shit.

306
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In principle, I'm okay with like, okay, well

307
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
let's settle what we're talking about.

308
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Love is honestly my least favorite word

309
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in the world because love is the most

310
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
loaded word.

311
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Aside from God, love

312
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
can mean literally anything.

313
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And friendship

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is similar. Friendship is similar. When some people

315
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
say they're friends, they mean one thing.

316
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
When other people say they're friends, it's totally different.

317
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you saying, Gib? Nothing. Nothing about

318
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
what? About what? I just said

319
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
my little pony friendship is similar.

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I didn't

321
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
absorb the lessons from my little pony friendship

322
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
was magic well enough. So I need to go to

323
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
UrbanDictionary.com

324
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We've already extrapolated friendship

325
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to love and gone to the

326
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
origin point of is love

327
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
real or not.

328
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We've already been

329
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
an awkward fly on the wall.

330
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But here's the thing though.

331
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
As

332
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
is defined by

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
our

334
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
explanation of the definition of the word

335
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
love, I love all of you guys.

336
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But that's the thing.

337
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There you go.

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's how it is. Love only means what it means

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
in my head that I have not explained to you.

340
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't you fucking get it, Nate? That's the problem

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
with words inherently. Everyone has their own

342
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
definition of words that exist just in your head

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and hopefully it's the same as everybody else's

344
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
but we can't guarantee that. She's on his fucking

345
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
phone. Just fucking read the chat

346
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and Michelle is in there losing her shit.

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh no!

348
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is she mad? Is she mad at me?

349
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, she's just incredulous and screaming

350
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
for the help.

351
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Michelle, I'm sorry.

352
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We're not reading chat.

353
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I just wanted to make sure we're not fucking anything up.

354
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I was actually going to ask you to check.

355
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If things start dying, I want to know.

356
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I also wanted to encourage people to like the camera setup

357
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm sure they're loving it.

358
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's pull this back. No one wants to hear about

359
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
your fucking gay awful bullshit anymore.

360
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We've already done an entire episode on it.

361
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We can tuck your ideas

362
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
into the shallow grave they deserve.

363
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We can tuck our ideas into the

364
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
between our asshole and pussy.

365
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And to our both asshole and pussy.

366
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, that's right.

367
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Alright, friends.

368
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How would you say

369
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
friends?

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Friendship is what we mean

371
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
when we say what anime

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
is about.

373
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let me just fucking give us an actual conversation time.

374
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Please God. Everybody,

375
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
how important would you say that

376
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
friends are to your life?

377
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Like, how much of your time

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
goes to friends? How much of your thoughts go to friends?

379
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, how important

380
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
this is a distinction.

381
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How important or how much do they take up?

382
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Both of those facts.

383
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The important level is like

384
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
8, but usage is like

385
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
6.

386
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So friends don't take up as much

387
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
of your time as how much you've been thinking about them?

388
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, no, that's not what I mean.

389
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Thinking about them

390
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I put that into the 6th category.

391
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How important are they

392
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because how much I like friends

393
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and how much I like the concept of friends

394
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and how much I want to be near friends

395
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
but I don't really think about

396
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
what's been doing.

397
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I really feel like

398
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
human existence

399
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
is like you do things to survive

400
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and then when you're surviving

401
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
there's not so much

402
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
we're social animals

403
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
so social

404
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
relationships with people

405
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
either a significant other

406
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
or people who you just want to spend

407
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
a time with, which could also be

408
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
a significant other, but sometimes it isn't.

409
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Are you making a distinction there between the two?

410
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, one of them you fuck and the others are just friends.

411
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But you can be friends with a significant other as well.

413
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And let's do this back.

414
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We are social animals.

415
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
None of us are like Nate, we all feel love

416
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and friendship.

417
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You guys are just too cowardly

418
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to understand that none of that shit's right.

419
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, that's right.

420
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's what I'm saying.

421
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Listen, I've watched

422
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
a lot of Rick and Morty.

423
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm fully blacked out.

424
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
On the words though.

425
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We agree with you, it's just we don't care

426
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
talking about it into such detail.

427
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But detail is important.

428
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I think what Hippo is sort of touching on

429
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is that there are a lot of people who

430
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
like... Give me a frame!

431
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Help!

432
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There he is.

433
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
When you made a distinction between

434
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
a significant other.

435
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Some people

436
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
feel...

437
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
A lot of people just want to fuck

438
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and so they find a significant other

439
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
less based on whether they are good friends

440
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and more based on whether they are good fuck.

441
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You gotta put up with them

442
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so you can get that.

443
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And other people have people they like to fuck

444
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
who are also their friends.

445
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I understand the distinction between

446
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
someone who you're not having sex with

447
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that means it's much harder to put up with them.

448
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I feel pretty passionately about the connection

449
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
you have.

450
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is where it comes

451
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
from the whole thing of

452
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
bros before a hose for example

453
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
is a pretty...

454
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And bros is gender neutral

455
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and bros is gender neutral.

456
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That is true. I generally feel that

457
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
just out in the world

458
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
there's a feeling that love between

459
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
guys is sort of a... it's purer

460
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
than the love between a man and a woman.

461
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Because men are more complete.

462
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No, that's not what I'm saying.

463
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When a man is interested in a woman

464
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
99.9

465
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
basically 100% of the time

466
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
he wants to fuck her.

467
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've told her all this in detail.

468
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Imagine all the lectures I do on this

469
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I give to her nightly as she tries to sleep

470
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
so she can.

471
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She said in the chat that the conversation Nate was describing

472
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
was four hours long.

473
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh my god.

474
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right.

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It was just a big circle.

476
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It was a big circle.

477
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Wait, if it was four hours long

478
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
your Kingdom Hearts discussion was five hours long.

479
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah.

480
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No, it's true.

481
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're not wrong.

482
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I was the only person who answered.

483
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How much has been thinking about friends

484
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and how much you give your life to friends?

485
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How much do you have a bad romance?

486
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Ooh.

487
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Wait, you went woo

488
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and I forgot the question.

489
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Do you like your friends?

490
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes.

491
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When I was young, a teenager

492
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was like very socially awkward

493
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and friendship was like scary.

494
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And friendship was witchcraft.

495
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Meeting new people and going from

496
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
primary school to secondary school

497
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
nobody came with me so I was like

498
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
a bunch of new people

499
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and I'm a stupid idiot

500
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
so I didn't bother to try and make friendships

501
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but later

502
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
it just

503
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you come to a point where you realize

504
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
that you're much more important than

505
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you would have otherwise thought

506
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
because you think in your head

507
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
oh, it's just

508
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
stupid high school politics

509
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
it's like

510
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you have to be cool and you have to be this and that

511
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and it's not about being popular

512
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
it's just about

513
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
having meaningful relationships

514
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that fulfill you

515
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and the reason I realized this

516
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the moment this crystallized in my head

517
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
is when I was playing The Sims

518
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was dedicated to getting that guy

519
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
all the skills so that he could get the big jobs

520
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and the career ups

521
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but I couldn't be bothered to call people

522
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
on the phone and have parties and stuff

523
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and he got so depressed he couldn't do anything

524
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I was like oh god, oh it's too real

525
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that's exactly the real life

526
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So did you set it out in your life to make new friends

527
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
or something like that? I set it out in my life to be better than The Sims

528
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay, excellent

529
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
By the way I just want to zoom out Victor

530
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I just want to let everyone in the audience know

531
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that all the people on this couch are doing episodes of the PCP

532
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and everyone on that couch is looking at their phones

533
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
zoning out and also zoning out

534
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
even harder and doing nothing

535
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You aren't supposed to be reading the chat!

536
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
If I don't read the chat

537
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
how will I know if the fucking stream is going okay?

538
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Re-checking constantly

539
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Re-checking is the reasonable thing to do

540
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I resent the fact that you think I'm zoning out

541
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm listening attentively

542
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I heard that Lady Gaga reference

543
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Get fucked

544
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the age team

545
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is the age team

546
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

547
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You asked him a question

548
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and we were giving him time

549
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and also I set up this in a way that it would go around

550
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
all six of us one by one

551
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to discuss these two

552
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm not listening to any of this and you shouldn't either

553
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Once again, Munchy James Johnson

554
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
is fake news

555
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay, well, so Gib,

556
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
again, I guess what Munchy is asking

557
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
is how much do you depend on

558
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and feel the need to work with your friends?

559
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
More than I used to

560
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I feel like friendships are important

561
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to continue to work on

562
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
as a thing you have to try and do

563
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and hopefully they try and do it as well

564
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and if they don't then it becomes

565
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
get better friends, I guess

566
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, go on

567
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No, no, I was done

568
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Relationships and of course friendship

569
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
because friendship and relationships are always work

570
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and work is not a bad thing

571
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that should be treated with any sort of

572
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I have to check into my nine to five

573
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
work is just something that you put in time to

574
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
work in the sense like art work

575
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
more so than work work

576
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I think it was in general

577
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Productive work

578
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I think there needs to be

579
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
invented another word

580
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
that means that, what you're saying

581
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
because work

582
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
is like production

583
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
there are people who will use it

584
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to mean like my favorite thing to do

585
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and people who use it to mean my least favorite

586
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
thing to do and those need to be two different words

587
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because like creating art when I say

588
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
like oh I love working

589
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I mean like I love working

590
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
on my art

591
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
but when I say fuck I hate working

592
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I hate going to a job

593
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You go the stuff you don't like work

594
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and the stuff you do like funk

595
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's good

596
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So anyway, friendship is

597
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
things that you need to work on continuously

598
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to reap the rewards from them

599
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
if you leave them there then you will not reap rewards

600
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and work can just be talking to them

601
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
or it can just be, this does not have to be

602
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
a daily thing but you have to put in work

603
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to get benefit from any sort of relationship

604
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
whatsoever

605
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's generally true

606
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and I guess to get to my answer to this question

607
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Friendships

608
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are important to me obviously

609
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
since I'm involved with the PCP so much

610
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and stuff

611
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You have to push your complex feelings and nebulous feelings

612
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
into a specific number from one to ten

613
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Okay, I'll try to do that but I was just going to say that

614
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
on the other hand

615
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I have noticed in myself

616
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that every friend who is no longer useful to me

617
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have abandoned

618
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That means you're not gaining reward back from your work

619
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's true

620
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If I called up a friend from my hometown

621
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
they'd be willing to talk to me

622
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and just chat them up

623
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't talk to my old friends

624
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
from

625
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
previous places I've lived that much

626
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and it's not because I don't like them

627
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
it's just because

628
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
we can talk once in a while and catch up

629
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
but we can't

630
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
we can't hang out anymore

631
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's true

632
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The way I see it

633
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Friends for the most part

634
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
are people who you want to do things with

635
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and you can zoom in on me

636
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to talk for a little bit

637
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, which is

638
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
like changing the universe over there

639
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Try to increase the audio

640
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I feel like

641
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
friends are people who you want to do stuff with

642
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and who you would rather do things

643
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
with them than do it alone

644
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I hate going

645
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I hate like

646
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, why not

647
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It moves

648
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Don't put that fucking cup there

649
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's gonna spill

650
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You might fucking special stimulate tea

651
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, don't shout out

652
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That was so distracting

653
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I forgot what I was like

654
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Friends are people

655
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't want to do this shit by myself

656
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'd rather do it with somebody

657
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So let me call up my pals

658
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and have them come over and shit

659
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But then it has to be people who you want

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to do the same things as them

661
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and I think that inevitably if that falls apart

662
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the friendship falls apart too

663
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's just like

664
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I love all my friends from back home

665
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
They're all great people

666
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They're all people who I respected

667
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
who I wanted to do things with

668
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but eventually they all got into street fighter

669
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and cars

670
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The Disney property

671
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Hell yeah, they were really into cars

672
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Fucking Lightning McQueen beds

673
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
in every household

674
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I had to hear so many fucking

675
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
truck impressors

676
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What the hell is that guy's name? The Larry the Cable Guy truck?

677
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The Major

678
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Did they actually get into

679
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Pixar's car?

680
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, they fucking did

681
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You should have seen it when Cars 3 came out dude

682
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They were going fucking ballistic

683
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You should have seen the line outside

684
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Fucking planes promo night dude

685
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Fucking boss in the first night

686
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
planes release bro

687
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Anyway

688
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So yeah because those guys

689
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
do those things

690
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
they would come over to my house every weekend

691
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
because everybody hung out in Victor's room for like

692
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
years and my friends would

693
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
all come over and they just sit there

694
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and play street fighter all night and I would come down

695
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and I'd be like hey what's up guys and I'm just like

696
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
oh yeah I don't like street fighter

697
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and that much so I just go back

698
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to my room and gradually that led to like

699
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
well once Victor moved away

700
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
like that wasn't the hangout spot

701
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
anymore and I literally have not seen most

702
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
of my friends since then except for

703
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
at a New Year's party

704
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but like yeah it's like

705
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it doesn't really matter that I like those people

706
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
if we're not going to do anything together

707
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
then there's just nothing

708
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
there's no like

709
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I can still call them my friends

710
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but I feel like friends has more of an active

711
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
role to me

712
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Victor get over here with that fucking thing

713
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
this group itself

714
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
to me

715
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
what are you fucking doing

716
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
what's happening

717
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you are the cameraman

718
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
zoom the fucking camera on me

719
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
alright tell you Victor

720
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I appreciate your reference

721
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
love does not exist

722
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
love does not this group itself

723
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
would at least to some degree

724
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
definitely have drifted apart

725
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
if it were not for me saying guys

726
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
we need a podcast to hold us together

727
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
therefore the potty the purpose

728
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
of the procrastiners podcast

729
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
really unironically was to keep

730
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
this group together that is what it was

731
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
made for that was my original intention

732
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
because everyone's getting away from pony

733
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
no one was going to be doing the same thing

734
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
people were splitting up

735
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
people used to love MLP to keep us together

736
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
unironically

737
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
for sure

738
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Ben stop joking around

739
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I can't stop goofing

740
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I can't stop screaming

741
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
but it's true I mean look at you right now

742
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
it's a stimulant T

743
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
stimulant T

744
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
stimulant T

745
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
stimulant T

746
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
stimulant T

747
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
look right now

748
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
this group itself is pretty

749
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
varied and red pilled of course

750
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Ben is just a comic guy for the most part

751
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
he makes videos sometimes

752
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
but he's kind of doing something

753
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
he's a pokey tube

754
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
he's a pokey tube

755
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
it was a big mistake to choose pokey tube

756
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
for MLP

757
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
you know I don't know whatever

758
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
like Digi's hardcore anime stuff

759
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I dabble in that and other stuff

760
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Tom does his specific type of videos with the 3D stuff

761
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and the tech reviews he was doing

762
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
much is like a draw guy who didn't really have a defined role

763
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
recently

764
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the point is we all do different stuff

765
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and the PCP was a uniting thing

766
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that kept us friends

767
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and of course we're in the same group chat

768
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
but we've already seen some of this

769
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
when people have more shit going on in their life

770
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
they'll show up in the chat less

771
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
it's perfectly natural

772
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
so to have something

773
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
if there's someone

774
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
PSA to everybody out there

775
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
if you want to stay friends with someone

776
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and you're afraid of drifting apart

777
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
evil way

778
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
you need to fucking put in work

779
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
evil can work

780
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
evil is pretty good

781
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
but if you're trying to get married

782
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
because you're afraid of someone leaving you

783
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and for only that reason

784
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
for example I would consider that an immoral thing to do

785
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
if you're trying to keep someone with you

786
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and they're like hey man you're not treating me good enough

787
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
you're like oh how about we just get married

788
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
a guy who does that to a woman

789
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
because he's afraid of her abandoning him

790
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I think it's being kind of immoral

791
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I gotta give credit

792
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
both to Nate and Munchy

793
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
for the fact that you guys are

794
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I can tell

795
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
because I've kind of disappeared

796
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't mind melded with someone

797
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
he's been mining at night a lot

798
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm always mining at night

799
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
you need to stop

800
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
PSA do not mine at night

801
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
do not

802
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
mine at night

803
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm fucking telling you

804
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you have to stop that shit for your own fucking good

805
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
like all your fucking bones

806
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
we're currently working on legislation

807
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
to allow us to come to your house

808
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
to inspect your graphics card

809
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
if you're mining cryptocurrency at night

810
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
or anything else in Minecraft I don't care

811
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
it's gotta be stopped

812
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm gonna have to get creeper

813
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
on your fucking $5,000 graphics card

814
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and blow that shit to smithereens

815
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
back to digit

816
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
don't mine at night

817
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
because of the fact that I'm kind of

818
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
just like mind melded

819
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
some kind of

820
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
what's it called in Rick and Morty

821
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the fucking bird person

822
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
he's like an intense spirit bond

823
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
or something like that

824
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm in one of those things

825
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I don't really show up in the chat that much

826
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
because of the fact that most of the stuff

827
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I used to talk to you guys about

828
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I just talk to the person I have in person

829
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
which I prefer

830
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
in person interaction is always better

831
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and if I can meet you guys in person

832
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that's the way I'd prefer to just

833
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
you don't need to know what's up with me on a day to day basis

834
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
we'll meet every three months

835
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and just talk about all of it

836
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and do a bunch of fun shit

837
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
you've not really done that though

838
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
we have

839
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I've met you

840
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
literally the two of you every couple of months

841
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
for like the last year

842
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
we have not talked about

843
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
what you've been doing

844
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
like only recently have I ever even heard

845
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
of some of the ideas you've done

846
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
oh you mean like creatively

847
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
all new

848
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
all the shit I've told you here is like brand new

849
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I guess Munchy's making a point that he feels

850
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
it's a little bit less

851
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
he feels that there's a lot here

852
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
what I'm trying to say is that you guys

853
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
have been the ones trying to make sure

854
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that I don't fall completely away

855
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
because I routinely get messages from Nate and Munchy

856
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
like just making sure I know

857
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
what the fuck is going on

858
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
because I wasn't a part of any of the planning

859
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
for Radcon 3

860
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
so I barely knew what was happening

861
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
kickstart jail everyone

862
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
when we were going to go to Boston

863
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
when we visited back in

864
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the double date times 2 plus 1

865
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
yeah the double date times 2 plus 1

866
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
when that was going on

867
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
like that morning

868
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
it was Christmas morning when I was supposed to drive out

869
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and it was like a huge snow storm

870
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and I wasn't sure if I was like comfortable

871
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
driving six hours in it

872
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and I was like I was not sure how much fun

873
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
we were actually going to have because I don't really know what we're doing

874
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
those guys might just want to be with their families

875
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
they might not really want to hang out more than a couple hours

876
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and we're going to have to be there a whole weekend

877
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
so like but then I thought

878
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
well maybe Munchy will hang out with me the whole time

879
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm sure that'll that had happened

880
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and I don't know but I didn't know anything about Boston

881
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
never been there never seen it

882
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I thought it was like I didn't know it was like a huge

883
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
fucking metropolis

884
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
everyone I tell Boston

885
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to thinks it's like some like weird bum

886
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
fuck nowhere place

887
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
where it's literally like an insanely important

888
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
part of like human history

889
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
in my mind Boston

890
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
is like I expect it to be like

891
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
a cobblestone like London looking

892
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
kind of town

893
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
we got haven yeah

894
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
because it was because Boston got ancient

895
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
it's old as fuck so I just assumed

896
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
that it's not like we stopped

897
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
building it

898
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
you have to understand where I am from

899
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
we've been making stuff

900
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you've got to understand that where I'm from in Virginia

901
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
we literally have like preserved

902
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
the old colonies that were

903
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
built when we first came

904
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and they're still like that

905
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
so I go places like that

906
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
like the place I went to college

907
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is like a town that was like 200 years old

908
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and like it just looks

909
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
old and cobblestone even though like

910
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
obviously people still live there

911
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
it's still like a functioning city

912
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
so I just kind of imagined Boston that way

913
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but then I got a text

914
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I guess he's the hardest selling title

915
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
like that morning before leaving

916
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I got a text from Nate that was just like

917
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Nate did you really looking forward to seeing you

918
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
in Boston and I was like well we got to go now

919
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
listen to this

920
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
listen to this baby boy

921
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
he wants to see me

922
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
yeah

923
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I wanted to touch that face there you go

924
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
oh god

925
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
you have no idea where that tongue has been

926
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
oh god

927
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I have no idea where that hand has been

928
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
he's tasting his own tongue

929
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
okay but anyway

930
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
the point of this is you have to

931
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
be able to talk to your friends

932
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and just that smallest amount of encouragement

933
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
wasn't enough to fucking get him

934
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
up to Boston

935
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and that's completely changed all of our fucking lives

936
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
you know right and the snow just happened

937
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
to stop right at that moment

938
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
so it was like oh the snow stopped

939
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and Nate wants me to go

940
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and it's only 12 so we still have time

941
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
or whatever we can make it

942
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and then we did it

943
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and it was great and now we all want to live there

944
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
you know a lot of this to me seems to come back

945
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to a fundamental principle about how I live my life

946
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that I talk about a lot

947
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
my content shit and it's that I take

948
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
complete responsibility for everything

949
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
that I have in my life and the things that I want

950
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
in my life so I don't

951
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
expect any of my friends

952
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
to remain my friends

953
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I have no expectation they're gonna do that

954
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
unless I make myself

955
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
valuable to them and like helpful

956
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and positive in some way

957
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
no matter how long you've been friends with someone

958
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
they don't owe you

959
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
nobody owes anyone anything

960
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
if you expect

961
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
people to want to be your friend

962
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
you need like not like

963
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you need to give them shit but like

964
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
it needs to be worth their life

965
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it needs to be worth their life

966
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
they need to get something out of it

967
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
not material stuff but like you know

968
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
like conversation someone to talk to

969
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
someone to feel like they understand what you're talking about

970
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
someone who's been with you for a long time

971
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
just comfort

972
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
like maybe it sounds kind of cynical

973
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
you know relationships are built on

974
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
like mutual

975
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
mutual benefit that people

976
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
are to each other that's exactly right

977
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
that's just what a relationship is

978
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that cynical

979
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you could read it like

980
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm only gonna be your friend if I'm getting something out of it

981
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
here's what's important about that though

982
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
if you are willing to accept friends into your life

983
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
who you don't have expectations for

984
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
you don't say like listen

985
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
if you are being a real piece of shit

986
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
this is not continuing

987
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
if you are generous enough with yourself

988
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
you are actually doing a disservice to those people

989
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
because you're not

990
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
you're not giving them barriers to rise to

991
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
so they can improve themselves

992
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
so that for like I'm a big guy who thinks that

993
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
self-improven is the root of all happiness

994
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm a big guy

995
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
like if we just allow people

996
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
like for example that's why I don't like

997
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't like enabling people

998
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to just I don't like the idea of like

999
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
giving a person a fish instead of teaching them to fish

1000
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
like obviously I think

1001
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
moral issue

1002
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
like if you give them the fish

1003
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you are

1004
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
you're choosing

1005
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
not to give them the way that's better for them

1006
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
long term you know you understand what I'm saying here

1007
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm talking about like

1008
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm getting really distracted about what's going on behind me here

1009
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
but something about

1010
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
something about fucking

1011
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm losing my goddamn training thought here

1012
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
what's going on

1013
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
nobody owes you shit

1014
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
it is best for you

1015
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
yourself so that you have more to offer the world

1016
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
because then you are just you literally

1017
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
have more value as a person

1018
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
so if your friends are just pieces of shit

1019
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
who just placate you and just over and over again

1020
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
say like everything you do is fine all your fuck ups are fine

1021
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
like don't worry about it will still be your friends no matter what

1022
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
they are doing you a disservice

1023
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
by not holding to a higher standard

1024
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
which will force you to grow and improve as a person

1025
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and if they really care about you

1026
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
if they're really your friends that's what they'll do

1027
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and that's how I approach life there you go

1028
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that's how I treat my subs that's how I treat everybody

1029
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
that's my concept

1030
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
that's a good twitter video yeah you're right

1031
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
you know what you're right I should do that

1032
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
did you touch on something that I want to talk about

1033
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
because this ties into the age difference

1034
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
grow lol concept

1035
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
show the concept we've got going on

1036
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
right in the background

1037
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
where you talk about how you prefer

1038
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
in person meetings

1039
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and obviously I agree this is quite nice

1040
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
well

1041
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I feel like

1042
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
no but

1043
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
hey that I put the impression

1044
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
how is that going to read

1045
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
in the video form

1046
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
you can't see my

1047
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
it's also in my knee

1048
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
that's what we'll tell you

1049
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
yeah that's what I'm saying

1050
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but I get the impression that everyone is very

1051
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I mean

1052
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
chatting online and going into internet calls

1053
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
is not at all something that anyone

1054
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
would desire to do

1055
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
well it's not the ideal

1056
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
it's not the ideal

1057
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
but I've lived my entire life having mostly internet friends

1058
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
because I was an introverted kid

1059
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
when I was a little babby

1060
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
just like you are right now

1061
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
well it's like

1062
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
here's the thing

1063
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
with give for example this is really relevant

1064
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
if we didn't have internet communication

1065
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
we wouldn't have any communication

1066
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
it wasn't fucking England so it's all we got

1067
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
so I don't think it's either

1068
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
we should always meet in person

1069
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
or not at all

1070
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
you take the best you can get

1071
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm just saying an interesting point

1072
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
that I've had most internet friends

1073
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
have any of you had

1074
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
serious online friends

1075
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
oh yeah I mean

1076
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
up until I started having a relationship

1077
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that period

1078
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
of me sort of burning off

1079
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
my friends from back home

1080
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
just because again

1081
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
while I liked them all fine

1082
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
we weren't doing any of the same shit

1083
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
so for a while I was just talking to the PCP

1084
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
pretty much

1085
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
all the time and then

1086
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
that was most of my

1087
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
social interaction

1088
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and funnily enough being in the PCP chat

1089
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
made me stop talking to everyone else on the internet

1090
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
because I used to have other internet friends

1091
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
outside the PCP

1092
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
but it was just that it was so much easier

1093
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
because there's a bunch of us

1094
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and if I told you guys about something

1095
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
going on we could have a whole

1096
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
conversation about it and then if I try to tell somebody else

1097
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
it's like well now I gotta have a whole fucking

1098
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
second conversation about it

1099
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
so like to me it was just

1100
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
kind of like the most convenient social interaction

1101
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
is to just post in this chat

1102
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
where all of the people most relevant to me

1103
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
will see it and if you're not in that group

1104
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it's just like too much of a pain

1105
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
in the ass for me to contact you

1106
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to tell you what's going on with me

1107
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you know

1108
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
you can tell me what's going on with you maybe I'll be interested

1109
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
probably not

1110
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
but you know

1111
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
it's a roll of the dice

1112
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
but you've had mostly

1113
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
in real life friends right

1114
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I mean for me growing up

1115
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I usually had one friend

1116
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
any place I lived that was relatively

1117
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
close and I did cherish

1118
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
those friendships but I would move

1119
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
all the time and lose those friends so like

1120
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm used to sort of transient

1121
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
friendships and that's why

1122
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
a lot of my online friendships

1123
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
they were just as valid as my offline ones

1124
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
but they were also just as likely to

1125
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
just end out of nowhere

1126
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
yeah

1127
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I stopped talking like if I don't

1128
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
maintain contact with somebody

1129
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
eventually after a couple of

1130
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
like you know let's say

1131
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
six months of not talking to somebody

1132
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
it feels like do I even still know them

1133
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you know and then sometimes

1134
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
people will come back and they'll try to establish

1135
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
like Tom there was a while where we just totally

1136
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
fucking didn't even hear from you

1137
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
like after the

1138
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
PCP got formed and I started talking to them

1139
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
you sort of were hanging out

1140
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
with like a different click

1141
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and really talk to each other until

1142
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
BronyCon when you met

1143
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
the rest of the PCP guys and were like oh these guys seem cool

1144
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I won't pay them on whatever this is

1145
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't matter it's fine

1146
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
this is a conversation

1147
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
so I'm out of the shot

1148
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
well now they're together

1149
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
once you were in there

1150
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Victor got the both of them

1151
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
did you hear this lives

1152
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000

kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss haircut

1157
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Well, okay, there's two different things I'm talking about here

1158
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,160
One is like actual social media falling like you make content whatever people are gravitate to you

1159
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,400
I mean like I met my girlfriend through my videos ultimately, you know

1160
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,720
She we connected through what I put like my snapchat info out and we eventually connected

1161
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,000
I don't like you and may met the same way. Yeah, you know

1162
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,880
It's just it sure is a pretty cool thing that we got all the social media going on. You know I'm saying

1163
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Are you going into like

1164
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,960
Fans who become friends a little bit a little bit

1165
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,080
Yeah, I think there's like a word that we might need for like people who are fans

1166
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,920
Well, he said friends fans that you like but aren't technically friends. Yeah, I guess

1167
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Like if they rise to just be friends then then you're

1168
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,920
This is great come back to this and just I'm saying but did you as an instrument

1169
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,640
They say that you feel like after six months. You don't really feel like you know the person anymore

1170
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,600
Yeah, you've been much better recently, but I felt that way about you recently

1171
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,000
Well, the funny thing is just dropped off the map

1172
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,640
The funny thing is about me that I will open my mouth every time something has changed

1173
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,440
But nothing has changed like I moved into yeah, okay

1174
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,960
I moved into a house

1175
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,520
That is in the middle of like nowhere and it basically it's just like well

1176
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,560
I'm here for the next year

1177
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,800
So I'm just gonna make videos and smoke pot until this year is over

1178
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,280
So like there's just nothing new to tell people about it's like I am in the same sort of I'm the same sort of person

1179
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,400
I was however my mind state has shifted and that's harder to describe in my mind she's shifting right now

1180
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,200
Your gender for you by the way it came up with your gender

1181
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,600
Well, you're wondering when you're sober and you're wondering when you're hot

1182
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Okay, so would you say that like like now like are you coming out of of the the dark ages would you say

1183
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
It's really changed I mean he's you know

1184
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,280
It's just a it's like I'm here cuz rad cons happening

1185
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,680
Yeah, and when rad cons over I'll go back home and I'll put my nose in my work

1186
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
And that's where I'll be until I move

1187
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,360
And then I'll put my nose in my moving and I won't be able to talk to anybody

1188
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,720
So I'll be too busy moving and then I won't be able to talk to anybody because I'll be too busy setting setting

1189
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,400
You know what my new place then I won't be able to talk to anybody

1190
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,440
So I'll be too busy trying to get back to work because I missed all that work from when I was moving

1191
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,840
And then I won't be able to talk to anybody for the next year because I'll still be catching up on work for the rest of that

1192
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,400
Year, that's what happened the last year. That's why I lost contact

1193
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,360
Well, here's a fact. Okay. Here's a here's a utilitarianism type fact

1194
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:40,400
It's just that the financial structure of the PCP was facilitated to encourage friendship

1195
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:48,840
Because it was financially structured by me as a genius to to incentivize people coming back regularly to participate

1196
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,120
That was the main goal of it. It's all like percentage based

1197
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,560
It's based on people who like come and do the most they are the ones who will acquire the most money, you know

1198
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,760
All that it's however much you put in it's how much you get out. That's right. That's that's right

1199
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,400
And so, you know basically like guys who show up a lot get you know a good chunk of guys who don't get less

1200
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,280
But there's always an incentive to contribute more and because it's all percentage the better the PCP does the better everyone

1201
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,880
Does and so basically what I'm getting to is I want to just take a moment to say everyone you're welcome for this friendship

1202
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,080
You are welcome. Yeah, I accept your attitude

1203
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
That's all I've got to say

1204
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
It's my point

1205
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,000
Talk to your friends when you get the chance not you just anyone

1206
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:43,800
I'm so bad at maintaining friendships. I know we're talking about this extensively and talking to my friends

1207
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Frame

1208
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
And look the camera just loves them

1209
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Just drink it in

1210
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:29,160
Like it doesn't matter how lonely I am sitting there being the loneliest boy of all and I'll just be thinking and I'll be like

1211
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,840
Oh, man, if only maybe I wish I talked to my friends more

1212
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,160
But then I'll like think about all the friends that I have and be like no, I bet they don't want to talk to me

1213
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,760
I don't really have anything to say to them, so I just won't even bother

1214
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,640
Here's the problem then the problem is you are not being smart enough with your brain and here's

1215
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,080
You're not being smart enough with your brain in the sense that okay, like

1216
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:11,200
When I think I recognize I recognize that I'm a weak human flawed machine

1217
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
And I know that this weak human shell

1218
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,880
Sometimes will feel loneliness and I need to

1219
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,720
Calculate in my plan for how I continue to operate this vessel that I need to account for friendship issues because I will get lonely

1220
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,120
So with that which before you get lonely because if you feel lonely you might feel like guilty about reaching out to friends

1221
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,760
Like oh, I'm just reaching out to him because he's my friend

1222
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,080
But you can trick yourself into thinking that you're actually a good friend by just

1223
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,680
Constantly doing little updates with your friends like I don't know checking in with them frequently that way you never

1224
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,080
It's like if you eat a lot throughout the day if you want to stay fit

1225
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,120
You should eat a lot of vegetables throughout the day

1226
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,560
So you don't let yourself get hungry and then you binge and you fuck it up

1227
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,640
But just like that you should you should manage you should schedule your friendship a little bit throughout the day

1228
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,320
So that you don't let your loneliness build up and then you just feel like a piece of shit

1229
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:04,320
Like the Sims yeah, just talk to your friends when you want to but yeah, but no one wants to do that. Nobody wants to do that

1230
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,440
I can't small talk to save my life

1231
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,840
Like here at radcon like we're just like constantly just like doing random shit. Yeah, that's how you know dance-off toilet seats comes around

1232
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,200
That's right, but like in terms of like online like I can't just be like hey Nate. What's up?

1233
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,080
I mean, I never do that. Hey, what's up? I'll never in my life

1234
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:32,600
Okay, I'll post memes all the time all the time sure in the chat when like when there's when there's no like

1235
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,840
Purpose that we're like that there's like when there's no like purpose that we're deliberately trying to do

1236
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,640
I find it so hard to like maintain a conversation if they're if like it's not going leading towards something

1237
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,320
Yeah, go into some end goal. I'm like, I'll just be like what's this? Oh, it's that okay done

1238
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:57,560
Yeah, I agree that it feels like that and I agree that that that is not even a bad thing to feel because did you when me

1239
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,940
Knew for started talking. I realized I was not going to get into the pants of this famous person just by asking

1240
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,800
Hey, did you have how's it going? Yeah, right?

1241
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,560
I scheduled my conversation with you specifically could emotionally manipulate you to being my friend, right?

1242
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,240
That's the right way to do it. Yeah, that's how I got into the group. Yeah first place

1243
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:20,080
Yeah, I think like I only talked to digi and Jesse at the time because when I had something to talk about

1244
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:26,840
We all loved just the stuff, but I think I'll share a kind of like weird autism where we want our social

1245
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,760
Interactions to all be like plotted and like a game and like everything is like like there's like a stat management

1246
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,920
Or like we're trying to envision at least like Vincent in the vapors like everyone stats as we analyze them

1247
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,400
Yeah, sort what combination of words will I say to make them like have this impression?

1248
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,680
And I completely agree that that is definitely what we all do

1249
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,000
But let me just pause it that maybe it shouldn't be that way

1250
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,160
Maybe we should try and change it. I the point where we are just normal people. I don't think I don't actually think that way

1251
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,560
But here's the thing in my life. I think that's how a lot of our friendships

1252
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,680
It's just that in my life overall

1253
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,240
I have certain goals

1254
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,760
I wish to reach and all I care about is reaching those goals and friendship is a great thing

1255
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,480
And that's one of my goals to have good friendships and have good friends

1256
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,920
So but my goal is to not put more effort into things that I have to

1257
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,320
There's no one has an obligation to talk to anyone

1258
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,960
No, there's an obligation to have any friends whatsoever

1259
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,880
I just think that it's a nice thing to have and it will help you emotionally physically spiritually and sexually to have friends

1260
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,960
Absolutely, I want to know something that is I think a sort of pratfall of it. Why Nate? Why Nate?

1261
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,960
I know what they want to say

1262
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,960
Oh

1263
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
What are the pratfalls of

1264
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,400
Communicating through a chat room Chris pratfall. What does pratfall mean?

1265
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,520
Pratfalls is like a stage fall. Oh, it is. I think so. Yeah, like a pitfall. Do you mean a pitfall?

1266
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,800
Like what's the like what Stephen Colbert did?

1267
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,760
He's right. A pretfall is a stage fall. That's right. I mean, if I could meet a hero John Oliver once again. Okay, one of the pitfalls

1268
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,760
Yes, there you go. Did I get on camera when I was sharing that bit of that tidbit of wisdom?

1269
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
No, you did not.

1270
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Wasted!

1271
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Do you know how hard it is to switch between six people?

1272
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,800
He's right. Do you know how hard it is to keep my gun in my home studio?

1273
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
There you go. We got it.

1274
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
That's a mean. That's a mean.

1275
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
That's a good one. That's a mean.

1276
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Oh no.

1277
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
I just put it down.

1278
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Anyway, what are the pitfalls of communicating through a chat room?

1279
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,840
Sometimes you have, you think that you're in there all the time and no one else does.

1280
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,840
Because I read every message that gets posted in the PCP chat.

1281
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
How?

1282
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,840
I just always do. I just read the whole thing every time I enter it.

1283
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
Sometimes there's just a ton.

1284
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,880
I mean, if there's like 5,000 messages, I will just skim it and see if it's something I care about.

1285
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,880
I'm not going to read all of it no matter what.

1286
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,880
But generally, the way I use the internet is just constantly clicking between the same five or six websites over and over again.

1287
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
That's how everybody uses the internet now.

1288
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,880
Unfortunately, but Discord is one of those.

1289
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,880
Although I actually had to remove it from my taskbar so I would check it less.

1290
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Because I would get so obsessed.

1291
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,920
I would just get locked into it for a whole day and I'd be like, this is so bad for productivity.

1292
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,920
That's an insanely interesting thing about how you will be able to receive messages

1293
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,920
and visually know and understand the conversation that is currently happening or that it has happened.

1294
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,920
But no one will know that because you have not typed something into the chat.

1295
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,920
It's not like where I can just talk to you and you have to say yes, Munchy.

1296
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,920
I know that you're seeing.

1297
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
I've got a sort of sense of who...

1298
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,960
I know Ben doesn't read all the chat because Ben will come in and ask a question about something that was discussed literally a minute ago.

1299
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,960
I'm really bad at not reading the chat.

1300
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,960
But generally...

1301
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,960
Even when we at Ben extensively, he will not look at his messages and his ads or what not.

1302
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,960
But generally because the PCP is the only...

1303
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,960
There's only a couple Discord groups I'm even in.

1304
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,960
It's like the PCP, my Patreon Discord, the PCP Patreon Discord, and a couple that I have muted.

1305
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So if I'm opening it, that's the only reason.

1306
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I check it so often that most of the time there is nothing new there.

1307
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But I do read it probably more than anybody.

1308
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But I just don't respond.

1309
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So it looks like I'm not there.

1310
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Tom, what is the importance of friendship?

1311
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
How much time does it take up in your life?

1312
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
How much mental energy?

1313
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
How much do you care about your friends?

1314
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,040
I mean, I care about my friends a lot.

1315
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:02,040
There was a period for a while, like last year, or maybe 2016, where I felt like I fell off the bandwagon with everybody in the PCP.

1316
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,040
Just because 2016 was a pretty shitty year for me.

1317
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,040
And I remember going into Radcon too.

1318
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,040
I was like, I want to actively try and participate more and get back into it and be...

1319
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,040
Because it was bumming me out that I wasn't...

1320
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,040
And you've taken a way more active role since then, in general.

1321
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,080
Yeah, because I just, I don't know, I'm interested in it.

1322
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,080
I like being a part of the group, I like helping out, I like doing things.

1323
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,080
That's why I was like, I'll go do all the podcast part, because I know how to do it, and somebody has to get it done.

1324
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,080
So, no, even my offline friends...

1325
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,080
It's weird, because I have a couple offline friends that I've had forever.

1326
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:44,080
And they're like two very different kinds of people, I guess, from our relationships with them.

1327
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,120
Because we're saying how friends have to be like...

1328
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,120
You have to get something out of it.

1329
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,120
One of the friends I have, I kind of don't...

1330
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,120
Do you even like hanging out with them or anything?

1331
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,120
That depends on the day.

1332
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,120
But I've known this guy forever.

1333
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,120
Maybe you get a sense of comfort, a sense of regularity.

1334
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Something like that, a sense of stability in your life.

1335
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,120
It's interesting though, because I have another friend that I've known for probably close to 15 years now.

1336
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,160
And we don't have anything really in common anymore.

1337
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,160
We're both kind of like nerds and play video games.

1338
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,160
That's like a very service level thing, and he lives like four towns over.

1339
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,160
But every time we hang out, it clicks.

1340
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:29,160
And we just throw out and just talk shit, whatever, and it's like fucking great.

1341
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,160
So, even though we don't have any really common interests anymore,

1342
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,160
we still get along really well.

1343
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,160
But in terms of friendships and relationships, my favorite is when they're into the same sort of shit I am.

1344
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Because I feel like that's so important to me.

1345
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,200
This is something that I don't think people who don't create things really get.

1346
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,200
That sometimes the friendship is the end goal.

1347
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,200
Like, oh, we're just going to go out to the club and do whatever.

1348
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,200
And that's the thing. And I'm just like, no.

1349
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Well, I mean, that can be fun and all.

1350
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Well, it can be. But for me, I don't know.

1351
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,200
Because making art and doing things is so central to who I am.

1352
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,200
If you can't, at the very least, comprehend that.

1353
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
It's almost like a deal breaker.

1354
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,240
And if you're into that in the trenches with me, it makes it so much more valuable.

1355
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,240
Because the biggest part of who I am, you understand.

1356
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,240
And we can discuss that on a deeper level.

1357
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Friendships are cool and all.

1358
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,240
But having friends is not the end goal.

1359
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,240
I have end goals of my own that I want to improve.

1360
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,240
And you're blocking your own face.

1361
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Oh, I didn't even know. Oh, wow, is the camera on?

1362
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,240
Yeah, but friendship for the sake of friendship.

1363
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,280
That's fine. I'm not saying that's bad.

1364
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,280
But a great friendship, I feel like, is something that helps you in your life

1365
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,280
as you're pursuing the things that you want to pursue.

1366
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,280
And hopefully you're doing the same for your friend.

1367
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,280
I would describe my relationship balancing work, artwork, and friendship.

1368
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,280
Due to the fact that I feel like you need to live your life in order to create good art.

1369
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,280
You need to have moments that are not art.

1370
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
So I would describe it as almost...

1371
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
This is going to get really autistic.

1372
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
And I shouldn't be thinking about like this.

1373
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I shouldn't be able to visualize it like this.

1374
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
And it should just be a normal human thing.

1375
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
But I'm autistic and it works like this.

1376
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,320
I view not working as creating coal ore in Minecraft.

1377
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

1378
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
You're banking experience.

1379
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,320
And then when I go to work, I'm mining that.

1380
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,360
You're not mining that.

1381
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,360
You're not!

1382
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,360
No!

1383
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,360
Go on the side!

1384
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,360
Thank you!

1385
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,360
Yeah, so I get my pickaxe and I mine that shit.

1386
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,360
But eventually my reservoirs will deplete.

1387
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
So I need to go out and live my life.

1388
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,360
So I can have stuff to use my art.

1389
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,360
And obviously, I just enjoy planting those coal blocks, those diamonds.

1390
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,360
I just like it.

1391
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,400
I've got the more extreme version of that.

1392
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Where I can have a difficulty justifying doing anything

1393
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
unless I know I can make it into art.

1394
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Unless I know...

1395
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
I'm only mining for diamond.

1396
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
I'm not going for anything less.

1397
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
I'm constantly...

1398
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
The shows I watch are dependent on

1399
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
do I think I'll be able to make an analysis video.

1400
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
The people I...

1401
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
I hang out with you guys because I know

1402
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
we're going to make videos together.

1403
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
And it's not going to be...

1404
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
I usually go for iron and up.

1405
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,440
Because it's not really like you can know

1406
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,440
that like this specific...

1407
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,440
I don't really think of it like, okay, we're going to a movie.

1408
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,440
What can I do with this movie?

1409
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,440
Because just hang out with your friends.

1410
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,440
You might have a conversation and you might see something in your life.

1411
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,440
I'm trying to be more like that.

1412
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
I think it was a big problem in my life that I got that way.

1413
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
And I do think...

1414
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,440
I mean, a big part of what makes a Radcon fun,

1415
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,440
like especially this house,

1416
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,440
this house has so much random shit

1417
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,440
that we've been able to take advantage of

1418
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,440
to make art out of.

1419
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,480
We know that it's going to be like that.

1420
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480
Shout out to Dan.

1421
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,480
Shout out to our boy Dan.

1422
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,480
We're coming for your ass.

1423
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,480
We're shutting you down.

1424
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
And the audience won't really know this

1425
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,480
because they haven't seen that much of the content we've made.

1426
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,480
We've filmed like countless fucking

1427
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
weird random vlogs

1428
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,480
based on the random shit in this house

1429
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,480
and what it's inspired us to do.

1430
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
Can I just remind everyone

1431
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,480
what a great fucking idea was

1432
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,480
to get the arena?

1433
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
So, shout out to my boy Gib.

1434
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,520
Rest in peace.

1435
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,520
Just real quick,

1436
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
for everyone in the audience,

1437
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Radcon 3 is not all live stream let's plays

1438
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
and vlogs. It's not all that.

1439
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,520
There's other stuff. We promise it will be here soon.

1440
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
It's not all that.

1441
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,520
I would hope that people fucking understand

1442
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
that you have to edit the videos

1443
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,520
before they can come out.

1444
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
But on every fucking live stream,

1445
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
they're like, wow, another live stream.

1446
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
We paid $9,000 for this.

1447
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
And even when the live streams are happening,

1448
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,560
there's always like another thing happening.

1449
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,560
The whole point of Radcon

1450
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,560
is that two things are always happening at the same time

1451
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,560
unless we're all in the same video.

1452
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,560
Pretty much.

1453
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,560
Well, if something happens to you right now,

1454
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,560
there's Victor's mining on my fucking CPU

1455
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,560
for that cycles.

1456
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,560
He's buying PCPine right fucking now, dude.

1457
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,560
That's right.

1458
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,560
Who's talking?

1459
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,560
Ben.

1460
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,560
How important,

1461
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,600
how much time does friendship take up in your life

1462
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,600
and how important is it to you

1463
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,600
and how much do you think about it in shit?

1464
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,600
Uh.

1465
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,600
It's like a dog.

1466
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
What is wrong with Ben?

1467
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
He's having a panic attack.

1468
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,600
I get panic when I see myself on the screen

1469
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,600
because I don't like what I see.

1470
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Then why do you ask for the camera to be on your office?

1471
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,600
I don't know.

1472
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,600
It's a real hedgehog's dilemma

1473
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
of the camera.

1474
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
Well, I mean, how much do I think

1475
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
of friendship? Probably

1476
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Seven.

1477
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,640
Like a bunch.

1478
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,640
I think about my friends

1479
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,640
and the people

1480
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
that I care about

1481
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,640
and that inspire me

1482
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,640
and I aspire to be like

1483
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,640
and everything.

1484
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,640
I think about that a lot.

1485
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,640
Seven or eight.

1486
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,640
How much do I actually interact?

1487
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,640
Two.

1488
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,640
That's pretty low.

1489
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,680
Ben has always been

1490
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,680
Ben has always been

1491
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,680
as long as I've known

1492
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,680
as long as Ben's been an independent person

1493
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,680
it's been incredibly hard to get a hold of Ben.

1494
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,680
Just across the board.

1495
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,680
It's always tough.

1496
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,680
It's true if you like call Ben with your phone

1497
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,680
maybe 50% of the time he'll answer.

1498
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,680
Less.

1499
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,680
But everything below that

1500
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,680
like trying to message him on Discord

1501
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,680
and maybe it's just that Ben's lifestyle

1502
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,680
has him less tuned into what's going on

1503
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,720
than the other types of communication apps.

1504
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,720
Well, but

1505
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,720
I don't know, tweets, messages

1506
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,720
like text messages you won't respond to

1507
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,720
is this all part of the same thing?

1508
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Tweets, I will

1509
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,720
it's like

1510
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,720
I'll see them

1511
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,720
most of the time I'll see them

1512
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,720
and I'll think

1513
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,720
okay and then I'll like

1514
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,720
think about it for a while

1515
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,720
and if I'm still thinking about it

1516
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,720
like days later

1517
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,760
what I want to say maybe then

1518
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,760
if I'm still thinking about it

1519
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,760
I'll be like I'll respond to that

1520
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,760
and then I'll do it

1521
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,760
You know, you were just telling us a story

1522
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
about how our mother

1523
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,760
our dear sweet departed mother

1524
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,760
was trying to reach you like yesterday

1525
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,760
rest in peace, the funeral was a great time

1526
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,760
It was actually here, we had a funeral pyro

1527
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,760
and everything

1528
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,760
That's what the group piss was on

1529
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,760
We had to put out the funeral pyro

1530
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,760
somehow

1531
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,800
Look forward to that in the behind the scenes

1532
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,800
ACP vlog

1533
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,800
Very Nate's

1534
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,800
And I'm not joking

1535
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,800
it will be in there

1536
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Anyway

1537
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,800
our mother, our dear sweet mother

1538
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,800
was trying to reach Ben and called him for days

1539
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
and eventually

1540
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,800
she stopped calling him eventually

1541
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Ben called her back days later

1542
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,800
and said hey mom can I help you with that

1543
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,800
and she says oh no I stopped

1544
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,800
I just called Nate and they took care of it

1545
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,840
Ben claimed that her little words were

1546
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,840
oh I gave up

1547
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,840
Yeah

1548
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,840
They gave up

1549
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,840
Mom's the same way, mom never answers a phone

1550
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,840
Only I'm a thousand times worse

1551
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,840
No, you just don't know the stats

1552
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,840
Mom won't answer her cell phone at home

1553
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,840
you have to call the home phone so she picks up at home

1554
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,840
and when she's out she's hard to reach

1555
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,840
You got to know the tips and tricks

1556
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,840
Ben, multiple times

1557
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,840
I have woken up

1558
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,840
and there will be the little discord red notification

1559
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
from Benz and I'll click on it

1560
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
One

1561
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,880
and there will be nothing there

1562
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
so this has happened multiple times

1563
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,880
where you've tried to get out of your shell

1564
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
and talk to me

1565
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
but then you're like no I can't say hi

1566
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,880
I have to delete this

1567
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
Really? Yeah

1568
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,880
Yeah, sometimes

1569
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,880
It's way too scary

1570
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
We're literally every single time

1571
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,880
you've been like Ben

1572
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
you have my full attention for like three hours

1573
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,920
How embarrassing

1574
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,920
It's fully confirmed

1575
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,920
Sometimes I'll spend a lot of time

1576
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,920
thinking about a note that I want to send to somebody

1577
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,920
or spending a lot of time debating

1578
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,920
Do I actually want to commit to talking to this person

1579
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,920
like this is going to open up a whole conversation

1580
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,920
but once I've sent a message

1581
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,920
you know sometimes I will delete it

1582
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,920
Sometimes I will delete it

1583
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,920
I've deleted these messages a few times

1584
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,920
but not very often

1585
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,920
I've done it once or twice in my entire life

1586
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,920
Yeah, I've only if it's something

1587
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,960
I'm fucking literally fucked up something

1588
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,960
Yeah

1589
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,960
I have this thing where

1590
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,960
I won't respond unless

1591
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,960
I think of something to respond with immediately

1592
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,960
and otherwise I will never respond

1593
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,960
I'm a little bit the same way

1594
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
where I'll occasionally get messages

1595
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
from certain problematic people

1596
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
and I'll be like

1597
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,960
I feel like to think about what I'm going to say to this person

1598
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,960
I don't want to talk to this person for that long

1599
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,960
I'll think about this for a while

1600
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,960
I'll come back to it

1601
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I think there's one to it now

1602
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Sometimes it'll be something

1603
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
that like it doesn't really

1604
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
need a response

1605
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
and other times it'll be something that merits a response

1606
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
but I don't know what response to give

1607
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
or that I want to give

1608
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
and then I'll just be like

1609
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
We're so fucked

1610
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
My problem

1611
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The thing is for me is that I'm constantly inundated

1612
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
with people trying to get my attention

1613
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and like it's on every different social media

1614
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
it's in my emails

1615
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,040
I can't tell the difference

1616
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,040
I can't take a response immediately

1617
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,040
You gotta put in the big toe

1618
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,040
not clickbait

1619
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,040
I'm going to

1620
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,040
I'm going to a convention

1621
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,040
next month

1622
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,040
and they keep emailing me

1623
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,040
about we need you to tell us

1624
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,040
what are your panels going to be

1625
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,040
and because I couldn't immediately

1626
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,040
give them an answer

1627
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
they had to send me 20 emails

1628
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,040
before I finally got back to them

1629
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,080
and this is how tons of people who

1630
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,080
maybe set up a collab

1631
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,080
with me or something

1632
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,080
If you're someone who's tried to reach me

1633
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,080
and I've never responded, I'm sorry

1634
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,080
but there's a thousand of you

1635
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Here's back scenes footage

1636
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,080
Did you approach me to try and give me to design

1637
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,080
t-shirts for him?

1638
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,080
I gave him designs like maybe

1639
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,080
like three days afterward

1640
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,080
have not heard back from him for like four months

1641
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,080
into this day

1642
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,080
There's a couple different

1643
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,120
I was just going to say that

1644
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,120
I feel like I'm having trouble

1645
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,120
coming up with stuff to say

1646
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,120
because I don't really have a grasp

1647
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,120
on how good I am as a friend

1648
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,120
like in terms of like

1649
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,120
responding on things

1650
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,120
You're good

1651
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,120
You're one of the high tier respondents

1652
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
I would say that you are probably

1653
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,120
the

1654
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,120
I think we're the best

1655
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,120
Me, Munchy, Tom and Gib

1656
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,120
are the ones you can rely on

1657
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,120
like fast in the PCP

1658
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,120
Everyone else will wait in eternity

1659
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,120
I'm in the chat all the time

1660
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,120
I like reading it and responding to things

1661
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,120
I know the feeling of

1662
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,120
I need acknowledgement

1663
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,120
from this person whether or not they've seen it

1664
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,120
so I will try to

1665
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,120
at least type the letter K

1666
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,120
K

1667
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,120
And then I add KK after

1668
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,120
I would consider you one of my most important friends

1669
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,120
because of the fact that you are

1670
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,120
one of the only people

1671
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,120
who not only do I

1672
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,120
love and respect your content

1673
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,120
but you actually watch mine

1674
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,120
because you're the only PCP member

1675
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,120
who watches like

1676
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
actually both of you

1677
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,120
Well, I kind of stopped recently

1678
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,120
I do watch your main channel

1679
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Yeah, but those two

1680
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,120
will watch like my obscure podcast

1681
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,120
Yeah, I will do that

1682
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,120
and it's nice

1683
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,120
that like

1684
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,120
someone at least

1685
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,120
who's friends with me

1686
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,120
actually thinks my stuff is all worth

1687
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,120
their time

1688
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,120
It's not because

1689
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,120
I don't think it's all not worth watching

1690
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,120
The reason I don't keep up with all your shit is too full

1691
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,120
Number one, you are way too

1692
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,120
way more into anime than me

1693
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,120
so lots of you talk about it

1694
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,120
I don't even...

1695
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,120
I'm sure if I clicked and watched it I'd be like

1696
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Oh, I can understand this

1697
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,120
but like the title and thumbnail I'm just like

1698
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,120
I don't fucking know what that is

1699
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,120
It's just that because

1700
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,120
I have my own stuff to do

1701
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,120
like working on my own

1702
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,120
Stopping and being like

1703
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,120
I'm gonna marathon like 75 hours

1704
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,120
I can't really...

1705
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,120
I never demand anybody to watch my shit

1706
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,120
unless I think it's like

1707
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,120
specifically this video is the one that hey

1708
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,120
you guys will actually

1709
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,120
you guys are gonna care about this one so make sure you watch it

1710
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
but like otherwise

1711
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,120
I just kind of count on the people

1712
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
who I know are gonna check it out

1713
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,120
I know I put out way too much shit

1714
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,120
to like ask people to watch all my stuff

1715
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,120
but like I'll watch everything everybody else does

1716
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,120
in the PCP, you know

1717
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,120
I am always like completely on top of the content

1718
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,120
I mean I watch...

1719
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,120
I don't know, I basically watch everything

1720
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,120
The comics I'm sometimes behind on

1721
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,120
I'm usually pretty good about instant update

1722
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,120
I'm usually pretty good about...

1723
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,120
I'm subscribed to all of you and generally watch everything

1724
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,120
I didn't think you watched subscriptions

1725
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,120
I got into them in the last couple years

1726
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,120
I mean I finally have

1727
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,120
incorporated them into my lifestyle at long last

1728
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,120
Alright, well update to the Nate lore

1729
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,120
There you go, there you go

1730
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,120
Hippo, back at Recon 2

1731
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,120
we didn't really know each other but we kind of liked each other

1732
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,120
but what brought me and Hippo to be

1733
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,120
big bros that I can consider to be a bro now

1734
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,120
Yeah

1735
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,120
Nice to meet you

1736
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,120
Nice to meet you

1737
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,120
It's fucking arm retrieval

1738
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,120
because arm retrieval, the arm retrieval cast

1739
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,120
has literally fucking like

1740
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,120
tripled friendship

1741
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,120
points ever since that fucking podcast

1742
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
that like started

1743
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,120
because here's what would happen, we would record a podcast

1744
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,120
and then just because we were so pumped up

1745
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,120
from talking about home sex so much

1746
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,120
that we would just stand the call for like

1747
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,120
fucking hours

1748
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,120
It's unfortunate because some of the funniest stuff

1749
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
was post arm retrieval recordings

1750
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,120
When we did like the...

1751
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,120
well it doesn't matter to talk about it

1752
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,120
I was in some of the arm retrievals as well

1753
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,120
not all of them, but yeah I experienced some of that

1754
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,120
except for the ones that went super duper long

1755
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
You see it with the PCP as well

1756
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,120
like it's kind of like

1757
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,120
so you know the podcast

1758
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,120
is a reason for us to stay together

1759
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,120
at this point it's a monetary reason

1760
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,120
at first there wasn't any money in it but at this point now there is

1761
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
so now there's like a hard reason for all of us to

1762
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,120
contribute and do it but like

1763
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,120
the real shit is kind of after the podcast

1764
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,120
ends and we just hang out in the call

1765
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,120
or beforehand

1766
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,120
That doesn't happen

1767
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
I hang out there for a while most of the time

1768
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,120
Well okay, there will be

1769
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,120
like maybe 20 minutes

1770
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,120
of like okay I'm giving my audio to you

1771
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,120
That's the real shit

1772
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,120
That's not the real shit

1773
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,120
That's not as real as like

1774
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,120
post arm retrieval recordings

1775
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,120
We did

1776
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,120
an entire like we found a site

1777
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,120
where you can create like

1778
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,120
generate a suburbs thing

1779
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
We just laughed about it

1780
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,120
for fucking two hours

1781
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,120
That's great but I'm thinking of the whole existence of the PCP

1782
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,120
early on in the days we used to do that more

1783
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,120
We're doing it less now

1784
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,120
but there's still some

1785
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,120
records saying that we kind of prefer text chat to voice chat

1786
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
like we never go to happen to a call

1787
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,120
for anything other than

1788
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,120
I much prefer voice chat and I want to do it more

1789
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,120
but no one else

1790
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,120
What do you mean by prefer

1791
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,120
being a voice chat is more of a commitment

1792
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,120
which I'm less willing to do

1793
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,120
because it means I have to focus

1794
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,120
If I had to voice chat

1795
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,120
I can't jack off at the same time

1796
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,120
without it being obvious

1797
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,120
It's a great way to communicate obviously

1798
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,120
via voice chat of course

1799
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,120
I like to be doing stuff

1800
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,120
Maybe cool PCP

1801
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,120
let's plays of TF2

1802
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,120
You know what it probably isn't

1803
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,120
it's probably that I draw more than I like video edit

1804
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,120
so I don't even listen to anything to draw

1805
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
so it's extremely easy for me to

1806
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,120
be at a call and draw at the same time

1807
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,120
and here, munchy fact

1808
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,120
some of the most potent and extreme

1809
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
and vivid emotional

1810
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,120
bonds I've ever had with my friends

1811
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,120
by this day were forged over

1812
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,120
video games

1813
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,120
Video games are the perfect excuse

1814
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,120
especially online

1815
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,120
I'm thinking about TF2 specifically right now

1816
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,120
where I met one of my friends

1817
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,120
to this very day who I love dearly, Paul

1818
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,120
I met him just over

1819
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,120
fucking voice chat because he was like

1820
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,120
ranting about some weird republican shit

1821
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,120
at like 3 in the morning on an Australian

1822
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,120
furry only servant

1823
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,120
he's not a furry and neither was I

1824
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,120
I didn't know he was a furry

1825
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,120
the only two non furries

1826
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,120
in the room

1827
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,120
and so

1828
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,120
it was great because video games

1829
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,120
are the perfect like you're talking one of them

1830
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,120
you have to communicate and there is an objective

1831
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,120
goal to do

1832
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
but it's not like you got to

1833
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
we're not fucking Comcasters right now

1834
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,120
we don't have to fucking continually

1835
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,120
Comcasters?

1836
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,120
Comcasts, Gestapo

1837
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,120
Stomps doing shit on your internet

1838
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,120
we need them to get here to fix our

1839
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,120
yeah

1840
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,120
you have that baseline objective

1841
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,120
you need to work with each other to do

1842
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,120
but on top of that it's all just sweet

1843
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,120
fucking game to know you

1844
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,120
fucking like lore, fucking world building

1845
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,120
fucking character building shit and that's what's good

1846
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,120
video games fucking expedite fringes a lot

1847
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,120
because it is good and I like it

1848
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,120
and there's a goal and fucking thank you for Victor

1849
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,120
well guys

1850
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,120
we've gone through a lot on friendship

1851
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,120
no we're not done

1852
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,120
it's time we have to stop being friends

1853
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
we have to stop being friends

1854
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,120
I mean we probably going

1855
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
like an hour and a half, two hours I think

1856
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,120
are we really

1857
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
I haven't even started reading like this

1858
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,120
this is episode 100

1859
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
we're going all night

1860
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,120
not really

1861
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,120
we could start taking questions if we wanted to

1862
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,120
no

1863
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
what do you have to say

1864
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
Ben has notes he asked

1865
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,120
I'm embarrassed

1866
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,120
I'll die

1867
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,120
what kind of people do you look for

1868
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,120
what kind of friends do you work for

1869
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
I want to be friends with people

1870
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,120
I admire

1871
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,120
and people that I think are cool

1872
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
what if you become friends with the people you admire

1873
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,120
and you learn their faults

1874
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,120
and then you can no longer admire them in the same way you used to

1875
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,120
it's a learning experience

1876
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,120
if they turn out to really suck

1877
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,120
then see you later

1878
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,120
sorry for the shame

1879
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,120
I guess

1880
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
I kind of like having idols that I'll never meet

1881
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,120
personally

1882
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,120
who just are gods in my mind

1883
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
I have those

1884
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,120
that's how I feel about parkourdude91

1885
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,120
because parkourdude91

1886
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,120
commented on my lecture

1887
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,120
and it was great and he

1888
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,120
tweeted me and it was fantastic and I love him

1889
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,120
and then many months later when I sent him

1890
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
just like a tweet

1891
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,120
congratulating that he was back on youtube

1892
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,120
he was like yeah I hope you're still rocking that pizza onesie

1893
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,120
like he remembers who I was

1894
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,120
and I get the impression that he's

1895
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,120
doesn't have really a lot of his play right now

1896
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
and I could message him if I want

1897
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
but like first of all I don't want to disrupt him

1898
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,120
because he's literal a fucking genius

1899
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,120
and he needs to be like a given space

1900
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,120
and not fucked with

1901
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,120
and also I almost feel like I'm not worthy

1902
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,120
to talk to him

1903
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,120
he's just so above me in every way that I cannot

1904
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,120
I don't want to soil his fucking reputation

1905
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,120
by ever having sent a message to me

1906
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,120
fascinating

1907
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,120
here's one thing that I want in friends

1908
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
and that I need in friends

1909
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
I think you'll agree with me Ben

1910
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,120
you can't be too nice

1911
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,120
now there's a culture that

1912
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
especially in here where we are fucking rude

1913
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
and rowdy and we'll just say whatever the fuck

1914
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,120
and start drama with anyone

1915
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,120
I'm not really about that

1916
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,120
I want friends to be genuinely nice

1917
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,120
but you can't be just nice

1918
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,120
there are a lot of people in my life who I've met

1919
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,120
who are just a nice guy

1920
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,120
we can be rude to each other because we know

1921
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,120
that we like each other

1922
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,120
but there'll be like milk toast

1923
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,120
like yeah I'll hold the door open for you

1924
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,120
you know like I got your back you know

1925
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,120
whatever and like that's nice and I appreciate it

1926
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,120
and I like those people

1927
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,120
but you have to have some sort of interesting

1928
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,120
quirk about you that makes me gravitate

1929
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,120
towards you you have to have a personality

1930
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,120
that I genuinely care about

1931
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,120
you can't just be nice

1932
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,120
you need to have some meat on your bones

1933
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,120
there should be a base layer of like

1934
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,120
you're a nice person you're not a murderer

1935
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,120
I almost feel like

1936
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
I have this feeling that I don't know

1937
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,120
if anyone else feels this way

1938
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,120
but I almost feel

1939
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,120
niceness is like being hot

1940
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,120
and when you're going to sleep

1941
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,120
and you have your blanket on that's really hot

1942
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,120
but sometimes you can get like too hot

1943
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,120
you can get too comfortable

1944
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,120
it'll be really cold outside and you'll walk into your bedroom

1945
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,120
like oh I can't wait to cozy up

1946
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,120
but like you'll get too hot

1947
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,120
so yeah I gotta take these covers off

1948
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,120
I'm too hot right now this is too nice

1949
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,120
I'm too comfortable I need to get more

1950
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,120
what I hate is friends who just are like

1951
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,120
yes men like if there's shit

1952
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,120
that you need to be called on and they don't do it

1953
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,120
a lot of that I think is cause

1954
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,120
you want your friends to be honest

1955
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,120
I don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of yes men

1956
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,120
who just suck my fucking dick all day

1957
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,120
I want people to give me real feedback

1958
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,120
don't get me wrong I want my dick sucked all day

1959
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,120
I want other people to do that

1960
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,120
I have some people I know

1961
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,120
or used to know who just like

1962
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
I would talk to them and I would be having a discussion

1963
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
like I have this problem I'm going to go to my friend

1964
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,120
and I try and like see if they can help me with this

1965
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,120
but I don't have the answer myself

1966
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,120
I need to bounce ideas off someone

1967
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,120
and the discussion would always go

1968
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,120
I would present a situation

1969
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,120
I would state my case and they would just kind of agree

1970
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,120
with whatever I would present

1971
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,120
there was nothing I could say that they'd like

1972
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,120
no I disagree or no try this instead

1973
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,120
they're just like you're doing everything right

1974
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,120
like good good yes good yes I agree

1975
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,120
I hate that

1976
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,120
it's just kind of useless

1977
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,120
yeah because like I feel like either A

1978
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,120
you're not actually paying attention

1979
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,120
I don't know which one's worse

1980
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,120
so it's just like oh god I can't stand that

1981
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,120
so like one of the things I really like

1982
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,120
was when Hippo called me on my shit because I asked him

1983
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,120
I was like am I fucking gay

1984
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,120
he's like yeah you're gay fix it

1985
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,120
that's not exactly what was said

1986
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,120
but that was how I interpreted it

1987
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,120
and it was good

1988
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,120
he's bi-sexual

1989
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,120
I'm like almost not gay

1990
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,120
do you want to comment on that kid

1991
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
I can't exactly remember what

1992
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,120
the conversation was about

1993
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,120
like why

1994
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,120
your place in the procrastinate

1995
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,120
is why something

1996
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,120
and I was just like am I just

1997
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
not a part of this anymore

1998
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,120
you're just like well you just haven't done anything interesting

1999
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,120
I was like oh I gotta do some interesting shit

2000
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,120
you weren't making videos

2001
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,120
you weren't making anything

2002
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,120
and yeah

2003
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,120
it really I think I guess

2004
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,120
where this group is concerned it's an active thing

2005
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,120
so like yes

2006
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,120
if you're in the PCP you're like a member of the PCP

2007
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,120
but if you like just decided like

2008
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,120
look I'm going away for like six months to do stuff

2009
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,120
that's fine but your absence will be felt

2010
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,120
it's not really

2011
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,120
but you kind of become like less of a member

2012
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,120
just in the sense of you're not in the consciousness

2013
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,120
of people who think about the show and stuff

2014
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,120
I gotta talk about the kind of people who I look to

2015
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,120
for friendship

2016
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,120
is people who are working on something

2017
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,120
because I want to work on it with them

2018
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,120
like I generally

2019
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,120
cause they end up bringing value

2020
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,120
when I have friends

2021
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,120
who I'm not really sure

2022
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,120
what they're trying to do right now

2023
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,120
it's harder for me to work with them

2024
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,120
like if my friends are telling me

2025
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,120
that like they're just like

2026
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,120
not really sure like what

2027
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,120
like oh I don't really know what kind of videos

2028
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,120
I'm trying to pursue or I don't know if I want to do

2029
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,120
YouTube or I don't know if I want to do this or that

2030
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,120
or whatever they're doing

2031
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,120
yeah well not like that

2032
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,120
but I'm just like you know

2033
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,120
if I can't follow the narrative

2034
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,120
then it's like it's hard for me to help them

2035
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,120
to work towards anything

2036
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,120
cause I'm like well what are we building here

2037
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,120
like to me when I'm hanging out with people

2038
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,120
it's like we're trying to

2039
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,120
you know like when we went to Boston

2040
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,120
part of it was like let's scope this is a place to move

2041
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,120
we're doing rad con 3 and part of it's like

2042
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
this is a test to see what it'll be like

2043
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,120
to have a you know

2044
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,120
I gave you the hardest sell I've ever sold

2045
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,120
fucking anyone in my entire life but like

2046
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,120
like in an hour and a half I just straight just talk

2047
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,120
and most of it wasn't even necessary cause you had me

2048
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,120
so irrelevant

2049
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,120
yeah

2050
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,120
but like

2051
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,120
yeah so

2052
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,120
so it's easier like for instance

2053
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,120
like Tom you and I

2054
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,120
you had also messaged me I think at the same time

2055
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,120
that you messaged him

2056
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,120
I told you something similar

2057
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,120
like that I

2058
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,120
I like your stuff but that I was

2059
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
I just like had no clear idea of

2060
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,120
what you were trying to do at the time

2061
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,120
and it's like I don't know how to promote

2062
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
your work if I don't know

2063
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,120
if I don't get what the goal is cause like

2064
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,120
right now I'm really big into the idea of

2065
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,120
trying to like promote everybody I really want

2066
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,120
to get into marketing figuring out how to

2067
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,120
like

2068
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,120
but like in order for me to do that

2069
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,120
I need to know what are you trying to sell yourself

2070
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,120
as like who are you trying to

2071
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,120
be what is the thing I should be pushing

2072
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,120
like do I mention

2073
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,120
uh

2074
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,120
for a long time you you had noticed

2075
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,120
that your rebel pixels link was still

2076
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,120
in the channel descriptions of the PCP

2077
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,120
and that was cause just at the time

2078
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,120
that we you know made the podcast

2079
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,120
that was what I had seen as your

2080
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,120
current flagship you know so that's

2081
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,120
why I linked it but like I only linked

2082
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,120
whatever I considered everyone's main thing

2083
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,120
you know and then like

2084
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,120
obviously if that shifts but

2085
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,120
like at times when it's not clear

2086
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,120
what your main thing is and once you had rebel pixels

2087
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,120
it was a lot easier cause I started

2088
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,120
like posting those videos on Twitter all the time

2089
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,120
and stuff and being like hey

2090
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
this one was interesting and

2091
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,120
I can help him grow this channel but

2092
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,120
like you know it didn't we didn't make it

2093
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,120
that far we got 10k's

2094
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,120
well you know it's a complicated thing

2095
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,120
you know it's kind of weird we

2096
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,120
are kind of merchants

2097
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,120
of social influence is sort of what

2098
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,120
we have and that kind of can be

2099
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,120
passed on from one person to another

2100
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,120
like if you just bring a person on a live stream

2101
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,120
and you've got like 10,000 subscribers

2102
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,120
or whatever and you bring someone on they can end up

2103
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,120
you know 50 subscribers after that

2104
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,120
and look at our special guest PewDiePie

2105
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,120
come on in

2106
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,120
it's just

2107
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,120
what I'm saying is that like there's kind of a weird

2108
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,120
gamification of friendship

2109
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,120
that's happened or like a monetization

2110
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,120
of friendship that is real I mean

2111
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,120
this podcast is sort of like that

2112
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,120
but really it's more of like I don't know

2113
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,120
do you ever feel the pressure of like people wanting

2114
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,120
to get close to you just because they know that

2115
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,120
that's like a currency that you can offer them

2116
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,120
yes a lot

2117
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,120
yeah I'm sure you do more than any of us

2118
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,120
yeah definitely I feel

2119
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,120
I ever really get the like the idea that

2120
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,120
they are trying to be my friends specifically because I'm famous

2121
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,120
because I'm not really famous but I definitely do

2122
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,120
ever every so often have the pressure of

2123
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,120
like someone really likes me and they

2124
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,120
want to be my friend but I don't like

2125
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,120
well there's that a lot

2126
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,120
yeah I get just when people friend me

2127
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,120
on discord as happened during this

2128
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,120
live stream buddy I'm not gonna friend you

2129
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,120
why would I friend you who the fuck are you

2130
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,120
I will not accept friends from anybody I don't

2131
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,120
know the worst oh my god the worst is

2132
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,120
when you get people to say hey can I be your friend

2133
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,120
or yeah I'm like that's

2134
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,120
I don't think that has ever been

2135
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,120
listen guys stop being

2136
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,120
arrogant just think for

2137
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,120
one second with your pea brain have you

2138
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,120
done anything that would make me want

2139
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,120
to be your friend take responsibility

2140
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,120
think to yourself do I offer anything right

2141
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,120
now or even if you're the best person in the world

2142
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,120
have I demonstrated that I have value

2143
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,120
or that I bring anything to the table

2144
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,120
if so then I might want to be your friend

2145
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,120
that's like the Gary V method where you talk about

2146
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,120
like Gary V he's like a social influencer guy

2147
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,120
like you got to work for free like if you want to

2148
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,120
like be noticed by somebody like just be like

2149
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,120
what can I do for you I mean in a sense that's true

2150
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,120
yeah in a sense did you

2151
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,120
this is how I knew I was fucking in

2152
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,120
way back in like out in like

2153
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,120
2013 you had

2154
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,120
a ton of Skype friends you're like alright I need to purge

2155
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,120
all these people because of fucking Maslow's

2156
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,120
or some fucking bullshit

2157
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,120
oh because of Dunbar's number yeah yeah

2158
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,120
that's hilarious yeah yeah

2159
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,120
I definitely exceeded it by like three times

2160
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,120
yeah so you're like alright I need to scrape all these people

2161
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
off and so you did that and I was clenching

2162
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,120
my my asshole was tucked

2163
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,120
and my balls were fluffed

2164
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,120
and I was waiting

2165
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,120
and I was waiting and then like like it turned

2166
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,120
past midnight I knew that I was fucking in

2167
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,120
and I was singing something like weird fucked up

2168
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,120
video like haha nice one munchie

2169
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,120
I was like yeah I'm his friend

2170
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,120
I'm his fucking friend

2171
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,120
I'm his fucking friend

2172
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,120
got him

2173
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,120
manipulated

2174
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,120
emotionally fucking manipulated

2175
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,120
got him

2176
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,120
that's hell yeah

2177
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,120
that's the way to do it

2178
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,120
the only difference

2179
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,120
between those munchies stand right there

2180
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,120
and what most people do is that most people just don't think

2181
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,120
about it enough to realize they're emotionally manipulating

2182
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,120
people yeah because everybody does that

2183
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,120
shit whether you think about it or not it's just

2184
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,120
you know how you choose to phrase it

2185
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,120
I mean that's what communication is

2186
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,120
like you always choose to

2187
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,120
represent your best self to people you know

2188
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,120
which is the same shit it's the same shit so

2189
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,120
you know

2190
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,120
what about those lists though you had a list or something

2191
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,120
what's going on with that

2192
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,120
it's been stupid

2193
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,120
family or friends where do you value more

2194
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,120
yeah yeah I was going to say

2195
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,120
in high school I remember I was

2196
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,120
okay because I really hated my parents

2197
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,120
my damn parents in high school

2198
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,120
was making me do it oh my

2199
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,120
what

2200
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,120
what

2201
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,120
what

2202
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,120
what

2203
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,120
what

2204
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,120
what

2205
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,120
shut up

2206
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,120
I was really angsty as a teen

2207
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,120
you still are

2208
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,120
I'm getting to that

2209
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,120
and I was really angsty as a teen and I was like

2210
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,120
man I hate my family I didn't choose

2211
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,120
these people I chose my friends

2212
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,120
friends

2213
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,120
I don't care about my friends I like my friends better

2214
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,120
than my family because I chose my friends but you know

2215
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,120
I sure I was an angsty teen but I mean that's

2216
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,120
true you know like the people

2217
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,120
you're friends with are the people that you choose

2218
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,120
to be friends with and I think that's

2219
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,120
cool I think that makes

2220
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,120
really important because you're like you know

2221
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,120
you're kind of defining yourself by who you choose

2222
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,120
to be friends with absolutely and that's important to people

2223
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,120
especially for kids I think one of the

2224
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,120
best things you can learn

2225
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,120
to grow as a person is to know

2226
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,120
that the best way to become friends

2227
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,120
with somebody is to be better

2228
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,120
at what they do than they are

2229
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,120
so that they're impressed by you that's true that was your

2230
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,120
philosophy when you met us basically back in the day

2231
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,120
some degree

2232
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,120
I totally agree with that philosophy

2233
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
and that's a lot of the people

2234
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,120
who I seek out online to this day

2235
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,120
are generally people who do

2236
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,120
usually

2237
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,120
similar content to me but that I think

2238
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,120
are really good at it either as

2239
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,120
good or better than me and that like

2240
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,120
as time goes on and I'm less

2241
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,120
and less impressed with people who are doing like

2242
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,120
not impressive work

2243
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,120
like at this point I want you to act

2244
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,120
like you have to be at least

2245
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,120
even better than I am for me to even

2246
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,120
like turn my head because

2247
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,120
like you know I want to see stuff

2248
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,120
that like I want to surround myself with

2249
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,120
people who are going to push me to be even better

2250
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,120
it's just the thing that

2251
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,120
I hate the most in life is entitlement

2252
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,120
and especially

2253
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,120
I mean where it's relevant to this is friendship entitlement

2254
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,120
and it's like people who message

2255
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,120
you and like expect

2256
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,120
you to message back okay I know I've said this before

2257
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,120
in a way but it's like I literally

2258
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,120
consider it a form of violence

2259
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,120
that you're perpetuating on me

2260
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,120
if you message me

2261
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,120
if you message me and then get mad

2262
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,120
if you just say hey

2263
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,120
if you just give me the hey and then you're like

2264
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,120
well what the fuck why didn't you message me back

2265
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,120
motherfucker I've been waiting two weeks

2266
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,120
I said hey

2267
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,120
let me tell a story real quick

2268
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,120
it's just I want to

2269
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,120
shit talk this person in my life from years ago

2270
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,120
make sure you mention Star Trek because I have to piss

2271
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,120
and it's around 55 minute mark

2272
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,120
you're right it's time to get to Star Trek

2273
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,120
in high school back when I still used Facebook

2274
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,120
after I left high school and I was in college

2275
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,120
there was a girl who had

2276
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,120
like a crush on me in high school who

2277
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,120
she messaged me like once

2278
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,120
I mean I never checked my Facebook even back then when I had

2279
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,120
was she into the vampire hunter D aesthetic

2280
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,120
yeah she was into like the long hair

2281
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,120
like sexy choir boy thing that I was doing

2282
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,120
was it that girl who would draw like comics

2283
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,120
and put you on? no no that was that was Jillian

2284
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,120
that's a different person it was not Jillian

2285
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,120
Jillian was alright we were kind of friends

2286
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,120
this is another girl

2287
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,120
she was Carrie her name was Carrie

2288
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,120
and just like I Carrie

2289
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,120
my team in League of Legends

2290
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,120
and listen

2291
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,120
so she did this thing where she messaged me on

2292
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,120
Facebook just sent me a private message

2293
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,120
just being like hey how you been that was like a year

2294
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,120
after I left and was in college I just ignored it

2295
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,120
but oh I forgot

2296
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,120
she could see that I had read the message

2297
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,120
on Facebook they can do that

2298
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,120
so that means you never read your message

2299
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,120
but this is my first experience with that

2300
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,120
and basically the point is just that

2301
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,120
several months after

2302
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,120
that initial message where I saw it

2303
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,120
and I just didn't respond I get a huge

2304
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,120
wall of text saying how mad

2305
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,120
this person isn't me for

2306
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,120
not responding to that and like I think

2307
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,120
why you think you're so much better than me

2308
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,120

with a lot in my day to day life and it's just

2368
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,120

I just want to add to the things that I

2375
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,120
look for in people yeah all of my

2376
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,120
best friends throughout my entire

2377
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,120
life have been short

2378
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,120
white people with brownish hair who get

2379
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,120
really mad when they suck shit at video

2380
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,120
games which they suck shit at everybody

2381
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,120
I don't get that mad when I suck shit at video games

2382
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,120
you're not my best friend

2383
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,120
but I do suck shit at all

2384
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,120

2385
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,120

2386
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,120

2387
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,120
what's the trend here

2388
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,120
like three I think

2389
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,120
that's good enough

2390
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,120
uh friends

2391
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,120
I want my friends

2392
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,120
to believe in me

2393
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,120
that's important but friend doesn't believe in me

2394
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,120
well we're all out that's it for us

2395
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,120
goodbye everyone

2396
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,120
but I don't want them to believe in me too much

2397
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,120
you know well like to the point where

2398
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,120
they're too nice okay and they don't fucking

2399
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,120
call me when I do something hard

2400
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,120
do you mean specifically believe in you

2401
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,120
or believe you no I mean like believe

2402
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,120
in me and like have faith in my abilities

2403
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,120
and like you know like okay I want

2404
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,120
them to think that I can accomplish my

2405
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,120
goals but not so much that they think

2406
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,120
that I'm infallible but but of course I'm sure you

2407
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,120
recognize that it is basically it's due

2408
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,120
they will determine

2409
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,120
you know at runtime in real life

2410
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,120
whether or not you are likely to determine

2411
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,120
your goals based on your performance

2412
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,120
I guess so it's really you I guess maybe it's more

2413
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,120
on me but I don't know I don't think I'd want to be

2414
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,120
friends with someone who was like this guy's

2415
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,120
I think what you're saying I mean

2416
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,120
why would this person choose to be friends with me

2417
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,120
if he thinks I'm a fuck up and he thinks I suck

2418
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,120
well the thing is I think it's more than like

2419
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,120
um people I want I want people

2420
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,120
to be supportive of my goals

2421
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,120
because like if I'm like constantly

2422
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,120
proving like I can't do them that's fine but like if I

2423
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,120
say like oh so what do you want to do I'm like

2424
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,120
oh I want to make comics like that's gay

2425
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,120
like I don't I don't want that kind of person around me

2426
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,120
I mean if you're like I want to make comics

2427
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,120
you haven't done that you need to do better

2428
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,120
you need to actually that's fine yeah that's good

2429
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,120
that's that's called being real I mean

2430
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,120
because it's about being a good friend

2431
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,120
I think and I think a good friend would do would

2432
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,120
hopefully do something like say

2433
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,120
listen if your friend says like dude I've decided

2434
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,120
I'm going to be

2435
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,120
I'm going to be a fucking pottery

2436
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,120
pottery maker

2437
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,120
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a million dollars making the best

2438
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,120
pottery in the world and then you could sit there

2439
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,120
and be like well hey man that's great I encourage you

2440
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,120
to be like I support you I'm your friend I support you

2441
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,120
or you could be what I would consider

2442
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,120
a superior friend and say I'm a fucking fag

2443
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,120
I'm a fucking fag no you say uh okay

2444
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,120
um so what's what's the economic

2445
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,120
realities of being a famous pottery man

2446
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,120
like how are you gonna pay off the loans you're gonna

2447
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,120
have to take to go to school yeah what is your plan

2448
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,120
walk me through this that's exactly

2449
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,120
what everyone should do you shouldn't say listen

2450
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,120
my end goal is to be a pottery maker

2451
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,120
therefore I will

2452
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,120
just aim for that and figure it out

2453
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,120
as I go because that's a recipe for disaster folks

2454
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,120
that's how we got the kind of

2455
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,120
student debt that America is in right now

2456
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,120
what you got to do is have the full plan

2457
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,120
for and if you fuck up along the way

2458
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,120
here's the thing if you don't want to be a dick

2459
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,120
in the process of doing that just just do like

2460
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,120
our boy Aristotle did and just ask questions

2461
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,120
and let them dig their own grave or blow your mind

2462
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,120
with this crazy plan it's like oh

2463
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,120
you convinced me that's right that's right so

2464
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,120
yeah

2465
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,120
uh was that your last note there Ben

2466
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,120
I think I have one more okay okay

2467
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,120
um

2468
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,120
um

2469
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,120
Ben eats during the podcast

2470
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,120
saying there it is everybody

2471
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,120
would you have your vape can you vape into the mic

2472
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,120
can you vape in the house you can't smoke in the house

2473
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,120
oh I'll get it in a second

2474
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,120
I'll get it in a second um

2475
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,120
it's just vapors not smoke if you're friends

2476
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,120
so

2477
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,120
I think it's really important that friends should be able to tell

2478
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,120
each other

2479
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,120
no

2480
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,120
stream you can't see it but Victor's expression

2481
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,120
right now is

2482
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,120
maniacal

2483
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,120
all of the Collins

2484
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,120
when they get that specific mood and look

2485
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,120
like literal goblins

2486
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,120
they look like literal

2487
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,120
zoom in on this

2488
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,120
zoom in on it why don't you just look at it

2489
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,120
oh yeah there he is

2490
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,120
the camera

2491
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,120
yeah

2492
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,120
thank you

2493
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,120
okay back to the

2494
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,120
action all right back to the food

2495
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,120
I really think it's important that friends should be able

2496
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,120
to criticize each other Ben stop eating

2497
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,120
on the fucking dream

2498
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,120
yeah

2499
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,120
um and tell each other when they think you're

2500
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,120
fucked up yeah okay right agreed

2501
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,120
agreed and it shouldn't be a friendship ender

2502
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,120
and if it is in your friendship

2503
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,120
probably success

2504
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,120
yeah though I mean oh to be fair it's not like

2505
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,120
if friends just come at you

2506
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,120
with constant negativity about your life

2507
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,120
that's I mean if they don't have like

2508
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,120
if they're if someone's like there's two ways to do it like dude

2509
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,120
your shit sucks you're gay I fucking hate you get

2510
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,120
die as opposed to like listen

2511
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,120
dude

2512
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,120
I mean that's a good friend right there but another approach you can take is

2513
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,120
you know of course like hey listen dude

2514
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,120
I respect your goals but listen

2515
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,120
I'm seriously concerned about you because

2516
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,120
I'm not sure the economic realities this thing work out

2517
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,120
you know just as what I think about

2518
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,120
so I mean

2519
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,120
have you thought about this you know to probe in this shit

2520
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,120
yeah there he is there's my boy

2521
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,120
wake him his shades

2522
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,120
can't be seen without his shades

2523
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,120
and you know that's another way to do it

2524
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,120
that's also good that's all I'm saying

2525
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,120
munchie yes go

2526
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,120
relationships are a two way street remember this always

2527
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,120
you gotta put in work to get rewards

2528
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,120
and you always be kind to your friends

2529
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,120
but know that you need to push them to be better

2530
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,120
just like how they should push you to be better yourself

2531
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,120
they should push you down the stairs

2532
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,120
yeah

2533
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,120
there he goes

2534
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,120

2535
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,120

01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,120

to draw a girl

2586
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,120

01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,120

2590
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,120

2591

oh I don't know

2601
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,120
this is not a good idea

2602
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,120
you'll destroy the space

2603
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,120
I could do a somersault

2604
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,120
or a car

2605
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,120
a single jump

2606
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,120
focus on my feet

2607
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,120
woo

2608
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,120
pcp 100

2609
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,120
I know I can't do a backflip

2610
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,120
alright there he goes

2611
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,120
this is the best we got

2612
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,120
alright

2613
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,120
I'm gonna hurt myself

2614
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:03,120
you're good

2615
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,120
careful you're good

2616
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,120
yeah

2617
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,120
alright well done

2618
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,120

2619
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,120
okay well we got everybody

2620
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,120
I hope that was worth 20 dicks

2621
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,120
I hope that was worth 50 dutch

2622
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,120
dutch kronen

2623
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:21,120
we got champagne

2624
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,120
our good graph

2625
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,120
killing good games

2626
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,120
our good graphics killing good games

2627
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,120
I spelt so wrong

2628
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,120
yeah cause budgets

2629
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,120
spiraling budgets

2630
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,120
okay but here's a question though

2631
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,120
is there any way to avoid it

2632
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,120
stop giving a shit about graphics

2633
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,120
stop being a coward

2634
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,120
stop being a coward and embrace

2635
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,120
stylistic restrictions

2636
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,120
the indie market has proved that there are buyers for those games

2637
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,120
that's true

2638
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:51,120
triple A is just in its own world though

2639
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,120
well that's why triple A is gay

2640
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,120
if people stopped

2641
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,120
getting a constant stream

2642
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,120
of photorealistic games

2643
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,120
then people would stop

2644
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,120
this is why I have no pity

2645
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,120
for these companies

2646
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,120
oh god games are so expensive now guys

2647
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,120
you are the ones who developed the

2648
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,120
let's make everything photorealistic

2649
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,120
mentality that wasn't on the people

2650
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,120
that was you saying we're just gonna keep releasing new hardware

2651
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,120
every couple years we keep milking you mother fuckers

2652
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,120
I mean it's a complex thing like you're saying

2653
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,120
cause it's a reciprocal cyclical

2654
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,120
cyclical process of people

2655
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:25,120
you could kind of blame for a lot of it

2656
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,120
it was the shift of emphasis

2657
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,120
towards spectacle

2658
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,120
well that was just like the console

2659
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,120
I mean everyone was doing that the Sega Saturn

2660
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,120
the Playstation 1

2661
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,120
it's a lot of other super changes

2662
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,120
it's been 100 episodes

2663
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,120
how much more must we endure

2664
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,120
you can stop watching it

2665
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,120
as long as you have things to say

2666
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,120
the PCB shall endure

2667
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:49,120
King Cobra asks Munchie are you gonna do more vids

2668
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,120
like the Jace one

2669
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,120
do they mean

2670
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,120
more lectures

2671
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,120
you'll definitely be doing another lecture

2672
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,120
more lectures in the future

2673
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,120
if he means more lectures then yes

2674
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,120
we'll be doing one this time

2675
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,120
and if you mean more Jace videos

2676
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,120
as in like performing a character

2677
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,120
then that's all my content so yes

2678
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,120
Tyler the Fancy says

2679
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,120
you'll be releasing the D&D session

2680
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,120
recorded at this year's Radcon soon

2681
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,120
I brought that up just a minute ago

2682
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:19,120
and no one could have possibly heard it

2683
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,120
so this must

2684
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,120
wait what sorry what was it

2685
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,120
Ben was talking about potentially doing a Dungeons & Dragons

2686
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,120
I thought you hate Dungeons & Dragons

2687
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,120
I do but I do it anyway

2688
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,120
we can do a D&D redemption stream

2689
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,120
or something

2690
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,120
I wouldn't do D&D but I might find like a rules light

2691
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,120
like a game system

2692
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,120
the whole stuff thing we did was way more fun

2693
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,120
well it doesn't have to be that

2694
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,120
we can look into it

2695
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,120
I actually have looked into it before

2696
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,120
but then I dropped it but now that we're here

2697
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,120
Ben I've always wanted

2698
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,120
to fucking have a homestuck D&D

2699
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,120
I've always wanted to do that

2700
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,120
I'm gonna do that now but I've always wanted to have that happen

2701
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,120
listen to this comment MattLand

2702
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,120
super chat thanks buddy

2703
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,120
how did Ben get so thick if he is so poor

2704
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,120
keep it real my dudes

2705
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,120
don't let Tom forget my shirt

2706
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,120
what do you think Ben? I eat all carbs

2707
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,120
that's the trick everybody

2708
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,120
I'm healthy I'm eating all carb diet

2709
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,120
Saad Hassan wants you to pull off a sick

2710
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,120
celebratory cloud of vape

2711
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,120
here we go

2712
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,120
here we go

2713
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,120
J-HeartBs asks opinions on fans

2714
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,120
i.e. me

2715
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,120
obviously we need

2716
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,120
yeah there she goes

2717
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,120
it's like the Ben move today

2718
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:35,120
it's pretty good

2719
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,120
he screams to cover

2720
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,120
his discomfort of being on camera

2721
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,120
yeah and it's not really covering anything

2722
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:43,120
because she's playing his day

2723
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,120
Giffy from the patreon lounge

2724
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:47,120
asks where's the best meme created

2725
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,120
well so far we're not even like

2726
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,120
it's too soon to say

2727
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,120
yeah it's too soon to say

2728
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:55,120
but so far it has to go to my vain

2729
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,120
man Dan

2730
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,120
Dan soft toilet seats

2731
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,120
oh by the way I've been liking this

2732
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,120
don't mind at night a lot though

2733
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,120
is that a new thing

2734
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,120
when did that happen

2735
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,120
first time I heard it was in the car

2736
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,120
as most memes start

2737
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,120
for some reason just said don't mind

2738
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,120
at night and then it just you know

2739
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,120
might just be bringing out the horse

2740
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,120
songs all the way

2741
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,120
I'm sorry my voice

2742
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,120
this guy's man is pure discord

2743
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,120
howling at it

2744
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,120
viewers I put my body

2745
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,120
through such physical stress

2746
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,120
and mental harm directly for you

2747
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,120
you hear this you hear that

2748
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,120
that's my voice going fucking up

2749
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:37,120
except for screaming every single

2750
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:39,120
fucking video non stop

2751
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,120
this godforsaken hellhole

2752
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,120
I do it for you

2753
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,120
I do it for you viewers I'm full in

2754
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,120
fuck yeah Rad God 3

2755
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,120
I'll blow out my fucking purse

2756
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,120
I'll blow out my hearse

2757
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,120
I'll blow out my fucking grave for you

2758
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,120
ever since we all hashtag entered the arena

2759
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,120
we've all been spiraling downward and by the way

2760
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:59,120
the final player has logged in

2761
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,120
has a bit like you know

2762
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,120
when you're on an MMO and you're waiting for my people to load in

2763
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,120
to join your server

2764
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,120
all the players have now assembled in our server

2765
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,120
for Rad Country IRL

2766
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:11,120
so the game will begin soon

2767
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,120
all we need to do is press fucking F4

2768
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:15,120
to ready up and we will be fucking in that way

2769
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,120
my boy we will be in that way

2770
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,120
also we should like hard sell Dan toilets

2771
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,120
really quick by the way because as we

2772
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,120
as we've stated before this is

2773
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:25,120
literally like the perfect incarnation of

2774
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,120
why we need PCPHQ

2775
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,120
because that video could not

2776
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,120
exist in any form

2777
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,120
if it weren't for being here

2778
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,120
go watch DanSop

2779
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,120
open letter to DanSop toilet seat on this channel

2780
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,120
if you haven't seen it

2781
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,120
that was all improbable

2782
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,120
why are you encroaching over giving so hard core

2783
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,120
DanSop toilets

2784
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,120
it could not happen

2785
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,120
because we can't do that over voice

2786
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,120
this was a pure in person thing

2787
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,120
and this kind of stuff would happen all the time

2788
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,120
would be even better if we were in PCPHQ

2789
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:57,120
so please you'll get content like

2790
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,120
DanSop toilets

2791
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,120
but even better probably even written

2792
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,120
meaning that you're doing skits now

2793
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:05,120
I wanted to mention that like

2794
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,120
doing this has made me very comfortable

2795
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:09,120
with the

2796
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,120
we're in the middle of that

2797
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,120
damn pocket

2798
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,120
he's having trouble logging into account so he can't do it

2799
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,120
well anyway

2800
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,120
I think that this has proved the

2801
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:21,120
functionality of the idea of

2802
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,120
like a

2803
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,120
PCPHQ because for me the experience

2804
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:27,120
has been what it would be because I've been

2805
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,120
leaving every night and coming every day

2806
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,120
you know like from a hotel

2807
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,120
and yeah the idea of just being

2808
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,120
able to like drive 10 minutes

2809
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:37,120
up the road and like create

2810
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,120
shit and then just go home is really

2811
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,120
nice that is the dream ultimately

2812
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,120
and uh yeah

2813
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:45,120
you know I mean I just want I

2814
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:47,120
look forward I really look forward to having the

2815
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,120
content all out and having

2816
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:51,120
the audience cast judgment on whether

2817
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,120
or not we have fulfilled our job

2818
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,120
and I think we absolutely will but I

2819
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:57,120
want the people to confirm that they are

2820
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,120
happy with what we have delivered

2821
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,120
I have to read these chats before they disappear

2822
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,120
if the PCP was a band

2823
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:05,120
what instrument would each member play

2824
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,120
trumpet I already have a trumpet I plan to learn

2825
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,120
how to play the trumpet because I really like the trumpet that I plan to do that

2826
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,120
soon it kind of fucking broke but

2827
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,120
I'll fix it

2828
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:15,120
I play guitar

2829
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,120
I sing and I play the clarinet

2830
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,120
I pick that back up

2831
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:21,120
I play jazz clarinet that's right

2832
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,120
oh

2833
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,120
I'd be the guy just managing

2834
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:27,120
the sound boards and like causing feedback

2835
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,120
you'd be the DJ like an incubus

2836
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,120
you know the designated DJ

2837
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,120
I'm thinking a little bit more like

2838
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,120
Brian Eno or something but

2839
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,120
sure I can be the incubus fucking

2840
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,120
they've got a designated DJ

2841
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:41,120
in their band I mean Lincoln Park has one too

2842
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,120
they were probably inspired by them

2843
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:45,120
I do actually play the saxophone

2844
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,120
but I think that playing the saxophone

2845
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,120
is a good encapsulation of who I

2846
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,120
am you are a good singer

2847
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,120
because I would be there I'm there

2848
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,120
I don't really need to be there

2849
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,120
but it's quirky

2850
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,120

cowbell

2853
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,120
and here's something I don't understand

2854
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,120
but maybe you do William Baker for $5

2855
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,120
that's what is the sexiest fundamental force

2856
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:13,120
what's that new one

2857
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,120
oh it's gotta be the color force

2858
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,120
the color force?

2859
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,120
is that like the speed force?

2860
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,120
no that's the strong

2861
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:23,120
the one between the one between

Dr. Wolf

2865
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,120

01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,120
like Andrew Hussey and Yannar and Kallinsky

2874
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,120
I would call them my favorites but

2875
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:51,120
it's not like they update them

2876
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,120

2877
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:55,120

2881
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,120
for Twin Perfect

2882
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,120
I also love Demolition D

2883
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,120
that's enough for now

2884
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,120
Scooby 1961

2885
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,120
Fitness Guy on YouTube is a hero

2886
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,120
Gabe and Tycho from Penny Arcade

2887
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,120
not cause I love the comic

2888
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:17,120
but I love

2889
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,120
their empire

2890
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:21,120
I love the indie stuff

2891
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,120
is it just the empire itself

2892
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:25,120
I love their podcast and I love the empire

2893
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,120
and I love their whole attitude

2894
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,120
and what they do and I wish I was them

2895
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,120
I love the freakish trollish bodies

2896
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,120
yeah I love how

2897
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,120
Tycho looks like a boiled egg

2898
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,120
yeah he sure does

2899
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,120
we're still going here

2900
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,120
my answer would probably be Dick Masterson

2901
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,120
just you know I'm

2902
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,120
fucking obsessed with this show and I've learned

2903
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,120
I feel like I've learned a lot about how

2904
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,120
to think of

2905
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,120
how to just think about the world from him

2906
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:53,120
in terms of protecting yourself

2907
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:55,120
and just not being fucked with

2908
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:57,120
and having a very aggressive attitude

2909
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,120
towards your surroundings

2910
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,120
you know

2911
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,120
I've looked through my descriptions

2912
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,120
I don't like any of them as much as Andrew has

2913
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,120
I was going to say M.D.E

2914
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,120
but from my perspective

2915
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,120
I found out of M.D.D.

2916
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,120
through Yandering Katsuki

2917
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,120
which just kind of feels like a subset of

2918
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,120
it's a million dollar extreme

2919
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:19,120
yeah a million dollar extreme

2920
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,120
Charles Carroll and Nick Roachford

2921
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,120
I mean I like them

2922
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:25,120
I think they're good

2923
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:27,120
but they're not Parkour Druid 91

2924
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,120
they don't fucking sing Weed Eater

2925
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,120
they don't sing Weed Eater

2926
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,120
that's what I care about

2927
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,120
Tom how about you

2928
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,120
I'm gonna have to go with M.D.E.P.

2929
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,120
by the way can I give one shout out to

2930
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,120
Jan Productions

01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:43,120

2932
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:45,120

2934
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:49,120

2935
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:51,120
killing Gibbon take

2936
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,120
going to a specific restaurant a museum

2937

finding a burial spot

2938
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:57,120

2939
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,120

2940
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,120

01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,120
plans that will be fulfilled here at Radcom

2947
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,120
because I want to stay here at Radcom for all of my

2948
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,120
you know most of my stuff

2949
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,120
but there are points that I want to take these guys

2950
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,120
eventually I have a lot of ideas

2951
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,120
I want to take them to fucking Newbury Street

2952
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,120
I want to take them to fucking everywhere

2953
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,120
on fucking Boston just the entire fucking road

01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,120
the common obviously Faniel Hall

2955
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,120
I want to do the walk that I did

2956
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:33,120
just the other day walking Faniel Hall to the ICA

2957
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,120
fucking ICA will blow

2958
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,120

2959
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,120

jipper air you would blow your fucking load

2961
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,120
I've never been

2962
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:45,120
Russell has emerged back

2963
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,120
from the black

2964
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:49,120
he's asking has my

2965
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,120
royal rumble form been achieved yet

2966
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,120
yes yes I have

2967
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,120
I saw it with my own eyes

2968
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,120
he has been materialized from the dark evil

2969
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,120
Pokemon hell

2970
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,120
you are really gonna fucking like it

2971
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,120
I think

2972
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,120
we did good

2973
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,120
I was like yeah

2974
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,120
why do you guys call things gay all the time

2975
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,120
why?

2976
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,120
we're gay

2977
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,120
it's because we're all gay

2978
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,120
we understand the nuance

2979
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:19,120
because I can think of no greater insult than

2980
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,120
saying you're just like me

2981
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,120
you ever had one that you're like

2982
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,120
afraid to read because you're gonna have

2983
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,120
you might suffer the consequences

2984
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,120
this is a

2985
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,120
f100 and so far not a single bottle piss

2986
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,120
bottle piss

2987
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,120
I'm sorry guys

2988
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:37,120
the group piss took it all out

2989
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,120
there you go

2990
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:41,120
that was my real purpose all along

2991
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,120
finish saying the group piss

2992
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:45,120
there's been piss capades

2993
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,120
what more do you want

2994
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:49,120
hey listen to this though Paris Pickle

2995
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,120
says why is hippo so cute

2996
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,120
please blow me a kiss

2997
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,120
what?

2998
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,120
they gave you 1.99 pounds

2999
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,120
of your own currency

3000
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:01,120
blow me a kiss

3001
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,120
there you go

3002
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,120
There he goes. No

3003
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:21,480
Look into the fate system of role-playing it's more role-playing less rule-focused and character creation is pretty

3004
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:28,960
I think it's not related. I don't think it's related to fate stay night. I don't think it is

3005
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,560
Anyone of you have had any of you had a paranormal experience. Yes

3006
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:42,600
On the ghost episode where where I was a little baby when I was a little feeling the sun was going down

3007
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:45,780
I was just I was just like walking on my soul. So we're mining at night

3008
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:55,360
And there was I just saw something like weird shadowy fucking like like shadow man figure and I ran downstairs crying

3009
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:58,640
It was super scary, but it was cool. So was I on the ghost cast

3010
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,520
I think I was and I might have told this story, so I'll tell it very quickly

3011
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:09,280
But my college was like had a reputation freeing haunted as many do and we went on like early when I first enrolled

3012
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,280
we went on like a ghost tour and

3013
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:17,200
They they took us around to some haunted spots and we went up to some room and there was supposedly a ghost there and

3014
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:22,640
There was like a flash. No someone flashed a camera and I saw in the camera flash in the window

3015
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,640
I saw what looked like people I saw a

3016
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:29,200
An old man in a poncho and a little boy and I was like, oh cool ghost

3017
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,560
I was like, hey, I just saw a ghost in the window

3018
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,520
It was an old man on a poncho little boy and the guy was like, no no no the ghost here is a woman

3019
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,800
And then some goth girl was like, oh I felt something because I have spiritual powers and I was like

3020
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,120
Yeah

3021
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:52,760
She got touched on the butt by a ghost because she was sitting on a haunted radiator

3022
01:52:52,760 --> 01:53:00,720
And that was my paranormal experience Paris Pickle followed up on the kiss. Thanks for the kiss hippo. I am actually a woman crying

3023
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:18,840
Hey, here's a thing Mars Lou Mars Louise Evans says name your favorite hentai Joe Jin Chi

3024
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:24,680
I'm gonna go with shout-out to acid head just all their work with one piece of Naruto

3025
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:29,920
They got big tits. They got big sluts. They got everything you could want everybody

3026
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,400
They put they's the same one every single time. So if you don't like it, then you're not

3027
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,920
Yeah, it's a dojin

3028
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:42,000
My circle wait, no, no, they said just what's it? What's what's a dojin?

3029
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,240
She and what's not a fan work if it's been released if it's not like published by a major publisher

3030
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:54,140
I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't have to be hentai. Well, they asked for a hentai one. Okay. Well, my favorite is probably

3031
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,480
Chinpoko sama, which is about this

3032
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:06,720
Unfathomably hot girl who gets who summons a gigantic penis monster in the night to fuck her and eat her and it's cool

3033
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:13,440
I went and read that one. Yeah, you talked about it. It works really fucking beautiful creep me out because she like dies in the end

3034
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,440
Yeah

3035
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,240
Doesn't make it

3036
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,400
Metamorphosis

3037
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:33,280
For metamorphosis, yeah, I would I would like a copy of metamorphosis. It's just it's a cultural touchstone

3038
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,960
Well, what is it? Oh, it's a it's a dojin about like an okay

3039
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:42,000
It's a portrait of the stupidest girl who ever lived basically. She's a she's a kind of nerdy girl

3040
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,120
She gets a makeover and then all of a sudden everyone's super attracted to her and she ends up just like

3041
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:49,360
Because she can't handle like the attention

3042
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,880
She starts just like fucking everyone and then nobody wants to like hang out with her

3043
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:57,960
She becomes like a bicycle everybody hates her and then her life just spiral like everybody hates her now because she's a slut

3044
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,800
She like meets a guy who likes her. He like drugs her and fucks her and just gets wrapped up in this whole thing

3045
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,000
Her father rapes her. It's this whole big

3046
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,240
She got her mom is mad at her for the dad raping her and thinks she's a slut

3047
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:13,080
She kicks her out of the house and she's she goes to that boyfriend who I'd like fucked her obviously doesn't care about her

3048
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:16,400
That guy starts using her for like prostitution

3049
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:20,200
He just keeps giving her drugs so she doesn't care and she just spirals down from there

3050
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,760
She becomes homeless sure it's fucking a lot of homeless people

3051
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:26,360
Just to like survive and eventually she gets she's pregnant

3052
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:28,160
She has an abortion that happens again

3053
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:35,240
and then she gets kicked to death by a bunch of urban youth in Tokyo and then she dies and the final thing we see is

3054
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:39,440
Like a little flash to like what her life is like her with her daughter like 20 years later

3055
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:46,640
But actually that's a dream and she died drugged and like fucking pregnant being stomped death by teenagers on a public bathroom floor

3056
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,080
It is actually terrible and like

3057
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,320
It's a good story for what it is

3058
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,320
Oh my god

3059
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,320
On the opposite of the spectrum

3060
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:08,200
The hentai that made me that gave me the biggest laugh like which I think is worth a lot of points

3061
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,680
Say say so say so to eat on shot. Hmm is really funny

3062
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:21,980
It's not even like it's not even like my thing at all like it's like it's like femdom bullying stuff

3063
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,480
It's like that's not really

3064
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,180
But it's got this the premises that the kids dick

3065
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:34,680
Magically can detach and then it can magically like reattach to other things including like girls can like put it on themselves

3066
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:41,280
And so these like bully girls like pass this dick around and it's it's just really funny and it's the arts really good

3067
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,960
Ending is hilarious

3068
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:52,080
For me to record a Vic vlog so I did Victor if you would like to

3069
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,600
They asked for shirtless Victor

3070
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,120
Why Victor is shirtless you want to comment on that at all Victor

3071
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,000
Digi bros fan black one blade asks how is Vic and hope doing?

3072
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,080
Oh

3073
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:28,760
Daynecks Jax's transform you to damn god damn it

3074
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:45,100
We're pretty much out of super chance, do we just want to like end? Oh, well, let me get a Twitter

3075
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,100
Let me get the Twitter

3076
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,280
Let's put in the hashtag

3077
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,200
The patreon lounge read some patreon lounge ones. They're all

3078
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:59,200
Come on. Let's read a horrible one. Let's read a horrible

3079
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:08,520
Exactly who would be dead now this was the Stone Age with cavemen

3080
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,520
That's the worst question ever

3081
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:13,600
I mean, we'd all be dead

3082
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:21,280
With caveman embarrassing

3083
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:26,120
Was that let's let's rag on them crafty crafty stop

3084
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:32,600
I thought had to be intentionally bad. There's no way. Oh, no, these questions are good though

3085
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,120
If the Hunger Games style competition starting the PCB house right now

3086
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:45,240
Which PCP member would come out on top shout out to my boy a faku no Alvarez. Yeah, when we do the the arena

3087
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:49,600
That's true. He's right about that. It's basically exactly the entire purpose

3088
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,600
Okay, okay

3089
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:59,880
I've got a good I got one. That's a missed super chat that was then sent by my fan into my discord

3090
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:03,440
Okay, what do you guys if you end up checking discord this week, please ask them my question

3091
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,900
Which was how much does Ben spend on vape stuff per month?

3092
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:13,760
I had a bunch of mods that these are really cheap mods and I had like two of them that broke in rapid succession

3093
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,900
So it was kind of an unusual time

3094
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:21,980
But in general, I would probably say I might spend like that's not the same pipe that you had at my house

3095
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:24,140
Is it it's a new version of it's a new model?

3096
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:26,780
Yeah version 2.0

3097
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:33,420
It's the same make. I probably buy like a bottle of juice probably like 30 much better than your previous

3098
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:36,440
For maybe like $30 and that usually they'll probably

3099
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,860
a month or

3100
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:42,860
$30 none of this

3101
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:47,700
We have a question. Yes from lethal rora mage

3102
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:54,960
Where is mage? Well, I'll tell I'll tell you boys. She is right here. Oh fuck

3103
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:00,140
Mage

3104
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:11,860
Yeah

3105
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:22,900
It's so great to see you I'm so 100 how fucking hype are you I

3106
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:33,180
Without you fucking what do you have to say?

3107
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:46,660
You guys you are getting rad content not even at the fucking house rad con is the fucking crucible of Christ

3108
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:51,260
Can we get can we get mage for Radcon 4 can we

3109
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:55,620
Had plans to get mage in for Radcon 3 that unfortunately didn't work out

3110
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:59,740
But we will put our best effort in to make sure that mage can be around for the next one

3111
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:02,180
So, yeah, I really want to I hope so

3112
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,460
Yeah

3113
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:09,020
Yeah, she'll just wear like a purple

3114
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:20,860
Let's let's ask a question to mage. Yeah, here we go. You're from the Twitter our pity question

3115
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:32,100
Maze why would I question so bad? Here's a question. That's relevant for you. No, I'm sorry. This is too embarrassing to read

3116
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:33,600
I can't do it

3117
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,920
This one

3118
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:38,240
It's loading

3119
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:44,380
Is because it doesn't know the whole thing is jealousy slash envy for a friend a good thing as in a

3120
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:50,760
Motivator to become better or more successful or doesn't rather make you unmotivated instead. What's your take mage?

3121
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:57,240
You mean in general or personally for me, I guess for you I guess for you

3122
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,600
I

3123
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:05,960
Don't get jealous necessarily have friends, but I guess it technically motivates me

3124
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:09,680
I usually take whenever I if I ever get like jealous or any yes

3125
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:16,800
I just motivate myself to get better so I wouldn't have to feel that way. Okay. I'm jealous of your ability to not be jealous

3126
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:21,560
All right. Got one more question for you. Listen to this mage. Is there any exotic dish?

3127
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:25,880
I know you're a food connoisseur that you've wanted to eat. Oh, this is from at XG upload by the way

3128
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:30,320
Is there any exotic dish you want to eat but you're too much of a pussy to eat it

3129
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
You know

3130
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,880
That's more of wanting to be a lie

3131
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,400
I would eat that shit

3132
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:55,120
Yeah

3133
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,360
I mean it's Twitter, so they're all bad

3134
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:16,600
Here's what we can all win on this at monkey away as this is a very complicated questions thoughts on the wild success of the PCP itself

3135
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:29,320
Yeah, it's um, I mean I never expected it to get as big as it did but it has not felt it hasn't been like an explosive growth

3136
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:31,760
It's been no it's been like it's felt really gradual

3137
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:37,840
But like stepping back and looking at it. I'm like wow really got a lot bigger than I ever expected

3138
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:43,600
Oh, it was it was very strange because the period where like we

3139
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:48,040
Like I was editing it in the early days and then I sort of for a while

3140
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:54,320
There was like a long period where I was editing and then like when I stopped was when I

3141
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:56,760
got really busy with my own shit and

3142
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:01,480
Like it was interesting because in order to you know for the episodes to get edited

3143
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:04,240
We had to come up with like a system and everything to figure out ways to do it

3144
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:09,440
And then it kind of became a well-oiled machine and then like I came, you know like

3145
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:15,840
Like I've been kind of not on every episode for a little while came back and was like, huh

3146
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:22,800
I can't help but notice that we've like like this is this is not the same as it was six months ago when I was editing it

3147
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:27,080
like everyone's taking it way more seriously and like in the time that it that like

3148
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:34,000
Like everything else is the PCP what you put in what you get out like be the reason that the PCB has been way more successful

3149
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:41,960
Is that we've all been working way harder on it. That's true. And especially now after the episode that shall not be named

3150
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,200
monsters

3151
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,520
Monsters to is coming by the way

3152
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:49,680
Transition into a real fan

3153
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:55,040
We've all made it concerted up. We've taken feedback and we've been listening to people's concerns and we've really been trying to make it better

3154
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,040
I think we've done a lot

3155
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:02,400
Made a Magna Carta of the reasons why the PCB is shit, which we are not gonna read

3156
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:08,000
But we know the criticisms and we're actually trying to make them better and and we really care about this project

3157
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,280
This is not just a fucking nothing show that we do for no reason at all

3158
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:16,280
We genuinely care for the show. We want to make it better. It's like it's like the content that we can do together

3159
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:20,120
But we've got lots of ideas for other stuff if things get to a place above it

3160
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:27,480
I mean, yeah, we are we are you know, we're taking we're taking things into consideration and trying to evolve the PCP show itself

3161
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,840
But also like PCP as a channel. I really

3162
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:36,640
Appreciate and and I'm excited that like, you know, like like non-main stuff

3163
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,600
I mean, this is a while ago, but when me and you did the D&D things. Yeah, that was fun

3164
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:41,800
Yeah, like things like that

3165
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:49,600
I think we should do more like side like collaborative like non-main PCP stuff. Like yeah, that kind of really nice cop killers, huh?

3166
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:55,800
Yeah, yeah, we're out of focus. We might like get the fuck hype for that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've got some in the chamber

3167
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:58,800
We got some a lot. We've got some in the chamber. That's the bullets in the chamber

3168
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,560
Yeah, yeah, you might say

3169
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:08,760
All right, well, I mean that's it for the Twitter. Thanks Twitter, everybody

3170
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,760
Let me just see if there's anything

3171
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:14,120
Let's see if there's this is your absolute fucking last

3172
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:17,320
Let's see if we can get a dope-ass question like

3173
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:25,040
Okay, this is not the last one Dane Dane says do you think there's anyone to get to do on a call this is not

3174
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,040
We asked

3175
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:37,520
And then the final question from Robert Floyd in the patron lounge are friends real

3176
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:52,480
All right, maybe just an AI in this phone for example also you are all AI's in your flesh phone bodies
