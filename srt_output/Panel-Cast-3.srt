1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Come on, you fuckers think that just cause a guy reads comics, he can't start some shit?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Aw, fucking take all you want!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Leviathan, you ready?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Home again, home again.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Gibbontake the love!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Class is paying 101.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I guess one person can make a difference.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm starting it out dick style this week.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome everybody to the panel cast.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We are back after a long hiatus.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There was no panel cast last week.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Everyone was fucking furious at me.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I got all your tweets, all one of them, from all my fan.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He was so angry with me that there wasn't a panel cast.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was like, you know, it was such a busy week.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I had to finish my big election video.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then I was busy with other stuff.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You know, I was busy being a well-laid lefario.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Traveling the country on my love quest.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But I'm back.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The election week is finally over.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The election's over people.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And I really think that America needs this.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You need the panel cast right now.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This country needs to be united in the panel cast more than ever.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You all need to come with me on the SS panel cast.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My pirate ship and sail through the cosmos

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
into my dimension of comic book panels

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and become wire frame res people with me.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I'm back.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh my god, the election's finally over.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think it's the election that won't die is what it is.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's still going on.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's still all over.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It should be over by now.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But these fucking people, these god,

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm gonna say it, these god damned millennials

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
who won't shut the fuck up.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's over.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Stop fucking whining.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You fucking brainwashed idiotic.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's, you know, all these cowardly females

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
who are so convinced that Donald Trump,

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you know, now that he's president

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that they're gonna walk outside,

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the whole world's gonna be on fire.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And there's gonna be like rape drones

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
swooping down from the sky to grab everyone's pussy.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I know I already said this stuff.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I know, I have, oh god, I can't, I hate them all so much.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I had a fucking existential crisis the other night

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
because I went to a friend's house on election night

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and saw my friends like crying,

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
like putting their hands in their faces and weeping

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because Donald Trump won,

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
because they're so fucking brainwashed by the media,

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they'll legitimately think that now

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
they're gonna like lose all their rights to vote

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and their right to have an abortion

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and the whole country is just gonna become

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the United States of Rape.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's how fucking retarded people are.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But enough about the election.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For god's sakes, enough about the election.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I know that I'm being part of the fucking problem right now.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
God, I just want it to die.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It should be dead.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's over.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's been like three days.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's Thursday now and they won't shut up about it.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They won't let it die.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The election that won't die

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
is continuing to lurch along like a fucking zombie.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I just want to bash its fucking brains in.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I want to take everyone who cared about the election,

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
all of these whiny millennials

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and delusional females on Facebook and Twitter

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
who won't stop fucking crying about Donald Trump,

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
even though it's fucking over and done with.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to take them all.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want to take all the fucking voters

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and I want to line them up on their knees

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
so fucking Negan can bash their fucking heads in

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and just, I want them all, I want all voters to die.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to run someday on the presidential platform

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
of kill all voters and I'll be the last president

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that this country ever fucking has

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
because once I'm elected, you're all fucking dead.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everyone who voted for me is dead.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Everyone who voted for the other guy is dead.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm just going to become God Emperor forever,

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
outlaw democracy and just give everyone free comics.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That'll be my tax plan.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Instead of paying taxes, you all get comics every year.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Holy shit, I'm so mad.

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anyways, welcome to the panel cast, everybody.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We're going to talk about some fucking comics this week

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and I have a special guest this week.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a two-person panel cast.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have with me, I forgot to give her a name.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I like to give my friends names.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I like to protect people's identities.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's why secretary is secretary.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I didn't give you a...

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is the amazing Alice, everybody.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hi, that was a marvel just now, witnessing all that.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh yeah, she had to sit next to that.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I hope they can hear you.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I hope this microphone can pick up both of us.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh yeah, no.

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're kind of sitting in like a lawn chair

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and you're sinking into the floor

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so you're not totally close to the microphone.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's my fault.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, it seems fine.

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But anyways, this is my loyal scribe.

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She's been staying with me for the week,

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
all the funny things I say and posting them on Twitter for me.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And she's a comic book girl.

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She owns...

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You tell them what you do.

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I help run a comic book shop company.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's about the gist of it.

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Aren't you in charge of like four stores or something?

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I help out at four stores, basically.

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She was flipping out like earlier.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She wanted to do this panel cast so bad.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
She was bothering me.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was trying to listen to all of my podcasts for the week

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and get my stuff done.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I was trying to watch my stories, watch my shows.

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I was listening to The Dick Show.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was trying to listen to Digi's Decompression Chamber

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and she's over there fucking whining.

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't do the panel cast.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I love comics and I want to tell the world

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that I know about comics and I want to show the world

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that girls can love comics too

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because girls aren't going to be allowed to read comics anymore

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and that Trump is president.

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I want to show the world that women have rights

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to read comics.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And she was just pestering me.

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm trying to listen to all of my stuff

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and then I'm like, okay, I'm ready now.

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's do the panel cast

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and then immediately she's fucking over there on her laptop

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
doing some work shit, yelling at her employees,

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
throwing a fucking fit

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and I had to fucking sit there.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Once I got ready to record this,

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
then I had to sit there and fucking twiddle my dick

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
while she went off

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and yelled at her boss on the phone for like an hour

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and then she comes back all huffing and steaming like,

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
oh god, and I'm just like, okay.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And so that was another hour.

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you have to say for yourself?

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm a nuisance.

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's about the chist of it.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
She is a nuisance, like all women.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You know, thank god that Trump's president

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is going to bring back the ancient technique

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
of putting five across the face

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
on a hysterical woman to calm her down.

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's the first order of business.

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That was trending, I think, Trump's first order, hashtag

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Trump's first order.

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's what I think it's going to be.

171
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Trump's first order is to bring back

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
slapping hysterical women to make them act right.

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, I had a dream like that once about rape drones.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It was a good dream. I liked it.

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Were they just like a helicoptering on with little dildos

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
hanging off the bottom of them?

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Beware the ghost of Boo Radley.

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He is a rapist, possibly.

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Vanguard One is not.

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Vanguard One is a noble, a feminist, a male feminist,

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but a good kind, not like a beta male.

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Boo Radley, though, is his evil alter ego.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Jesus Christ, what am I talking about?

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Anyways, so much fucking to talk about

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
on the panel cast this week because I missed a week.

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I should explain why there was no panel cast last week,

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
partly because I was busy making that big election video.

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But also, I did start recording the panel cast.

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I recorded the intro for it.

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It was this big 20-minute rant of an intro.

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It was really funny.

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You'll probably hear it next week.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll stick it on that one.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I recorded the intro for the panel cast,

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and then when I started to get into the meat

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
of talking about the comics,

197
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
what happened was the comics last week were all so terrible

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that it broke me, and I couldn't even muster any words for them.

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was so seething mad about these fucking comics that I read,

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
specifically one.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll just fucking say it.

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's this comic out right now called Champions,

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and I read the fucking, you know what I'm talking about?

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, yeah.

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
By Mark Wade, right?

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The same guy who turned Daredevil into like a San Franciscan hipster

207
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
fuckboy, sweetboy, manjina for like 10 years.

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This comic champions, where do I even start

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
with how much I fucking hated this?

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have to say it.

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Even though it came out last week,

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I won't be able to function this week unless I get this off my chest.

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It first of all takes place after the Civil War II event,

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
which is still fucking going on,

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
because Marvel can't fucking get their shit together

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and do anything right.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So every comic that you read now, half the Marvel comics that you buy now

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
are just going to spoil the story that's going on right now.

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Like, I know what happens at the end of Civil War II now

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
without having it spoiled.

221
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They spoil their own shit because their stories are so bloated

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and they take so long to get them out

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that they have to release the stories after them

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
before they're even done.

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They even extend them.

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They're like, ah, Civil War.

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You guys wanted an extra issue of that, didn't you?

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, God, it's terrible.

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah, so this champion's book, it takes place after the Civil War II

230
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
thing that's going on.

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I guess the young heroes, the teeny-bopper Avengers,

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
they're all so angry at the adult Avengers

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
for having the Civil War II,

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
for having this big, boring comic book event,

235
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that they're like, fuck you, we're going to go be actual superheroes.

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I feel like I've seen this plot in comics over and over my whole life.

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A team of heroes that says the heroes aren't doing it right,

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
so we're going to get back to basics,

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and it's always a lie.

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's always an unfulfilled promise.

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The offshoot team of heroes who wants to do it right

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and not get wrapped up in events, they do anyways.

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I mean, the prophecy repeats itself always.

244
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, it's a self-fulfilling.

245
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's like an uraboros of shitty comics

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that's perpetually eating its own tail.

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yep.

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But so the teeny-bopper Avengers,

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
they try to start their own little Avengers team

250
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and first of all, this lineup of these teeny-bopper Avengers,

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
half of them are characters that I fucking hate

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and loathe and despise.

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And, oh, I'll get to it.

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And half of them I hate, and the other half I like,

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
but were ruined in this comic,

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
because I read the first two issues.

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's two issues so far.

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But, I mean, I'll just go through the lineup.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
First of all, Nova.

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Who the fuck is Nova?

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know and I don't care.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't even explain it to me,

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
because I don't even want to know who he is.

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I hate him.

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's just some little sweet boy in a helmet

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
who fucking flies around with a rocket ass.

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can tell me who he is.

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, I mean, they're bringing back old Nova,

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so it won't matter anyway.

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, yeah, of course,

271
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
because every superhero has to be five superheroes now.

272
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There's got to be ten Captain Americas.

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We have to have a Captain America to represent

274
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
every minority and sexual orientation on the planet.

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yep.

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like you said, Marvel is Tumblr.

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, Marvel is Tumblr incarnate.

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
They are not two separate companies.

279
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They are one entity.

280
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, I hate them.

281
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't worry about Nova.

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He doesn't matter.

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, that's what I assumed.

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Nova doesn't matter.

285
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What has Nova ever done?

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What even is this character?

287
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why does he even exist?

288
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He's got a special helmet

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that lets him do special things, moving on.

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wow, that's like a Disney Channel original movie.

291
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's not a superhero origin.

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I found a magic pair of sneakers

293
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and now I can jump high.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wow.

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What a bitch.

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I hate him.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You know, so much of the cosmic Marvel stuff

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I hate anyways.

299
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't get into it.

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's so weird, but enough about that.

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So there's Nova.

302
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's fucking nobody.

303
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't care about him.

304
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He's not interesting at all.

305
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He has no like, you know, like every good superhero,

306
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
a great superhero, Spider-Man, Batman, the Hulk.

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's always something at the core of the character

308
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that everyone in the world can relate to.

309
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Some struggle that defines the character.

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I hate these like second string characters

311
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that just don't have that.

312
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They're just like one dimensional

313
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
or not even one dimensional.

314
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They're multi-dimensional

315
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
because they serve the purposes

316
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
of whatever story they're in

317
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
because they don't have a personality

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
or a backstory that anyone cares about.

319
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I think Nova's a great example of that.

320
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Fuck them.

321
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you're a big fan of Nova, you're not.

322
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, I'm not even,

323
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't even know what to say to that.

324
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No one's a big fan of Nova.

325
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So there's that guy that I hate.

326
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Next up is Amadeus Cho,

327
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the fucking, the genius intellect,

328
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
teenage fucking Bro Hulk.

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The teenage Asian Bro Hulk

330
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
who like spends this entire comic

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
like macking on all the honeys

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
because I guess the Hulk should be cool now.

333
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like, I can't imagine,

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
they do this like all the time.

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Jekyll has done this like periodically

336
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
every five years since the dawn of Marvel.

337
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They go, hey, what if the Hulk wasn't angry?

338
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, then he's not the fucking Hulk.

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He's not interesting.

340
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The whole thing that makes the Hulk interesting

341
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is that like basic,

342
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
like that iconic Jekyll and Hyde storyline

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
that everyone can relate to.

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Like everybody has like a side of themselves

345
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
they don't like.

346
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Everybody, you know, might have a temper

347
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
in security and that's what the Hulk speaks to.

348
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's why he's a great character

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
because Bruce Banner will never

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and should never be able to control the Hulk

351
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
or contain him.

352
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And every fucking five years,

353
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Marvel gets on this kick where they're like,

354
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
maybe like, you know, Dr. Banner,

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the Hulk is a genius now or Grey Hulk.

356
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He fucking works in a casino now

357
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and he beats people up with a crowbar.

358
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's like a bouncer or some shit

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
or there's a Red Hulk now.

360
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Thunderbolt Ross is a Hulk

361
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and Betty's a Hulk too.

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Everyone's a fucking Hulk now.

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And now his little sidekick,

364
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
this character, I'm frothing at the mouth.

365
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm working myself up already.

366
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's only been 13 minutes.

367
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This character they introduced in the Hulk comics, right?

368
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Or no, Hercules.

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Uh, Hercules.

370
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why are we talking about Hercules?

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm just trying to remember where

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Amadeus Cho was introduced.

373
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Uh, God, you know, it was a little while back.

374
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't even remember.

375
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I just remember the comic releasing

376
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and I was just like, oh,

377
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
what is this called?

378
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The totally awesome new Hulk?

379
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

380
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
New Hulk.

381
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I actually read the comic begrudgingly

382
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
because I immediately saw that title

383
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and I hated it.

384
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I was like, this is a stupid title.

385
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This is airing it, this is stupid

386
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and I don't want to read this.

387
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, making the Hulk cool,

388
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's just not what makes the character interesting.

389
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The Hulk is interesting because he's the Hulk.

390
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean, if you just have a big strong guy

391
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
who's also smart,

392
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that's just the thing.

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The thing already exists.

394
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There's already a big strong guy who can talk good.

395
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean, as well as the thing, can talk.

396
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, I mean...

398
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He is kind of a, like, Brooklyn trash.

399
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He is.

400
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Grumble, grumble, clobber in time.

401
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, Yancey Street.

402
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Uh, my mother,

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
poker.

404
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yankees.

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, I'm not going to lie.

406
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When I did read the totally awesome Hulk

407
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the first time, like the first issue,

408
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I sat there, like, at the end of the issue,

409
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
just holding it in my hands, going,

410
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can't believe I liked this.

411
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I know.

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And he's just...

413
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Amadeus Cho as Hulk,

414
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
he's just another one of these characters who are like,

415
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
they don't want to make new superheroes.

416
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They just want to make new versions

417
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
of the guys who already exist.

418
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They want to sap away everything that's special

419
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
about the characters we love

420
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and try to, like, put the costume

421
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
on some other character,

422
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
as though it automatically infuses them with that...

423
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A younger character, no less.

424
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A younger character, a blacker character,

425
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
a, you know, a heterosexual,

426
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
fucking non-genderqueer, binary...

427
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, you know, they have to get ready for the movies.

428
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Down syndrome.

429
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like, young Stephen Hawking

430
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in, like, a little motorized cart.

431
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They're going to put, like,

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
they're going to put a Thor helmet

433
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
on some, like, sentient tumor

434
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that's, like, growing off of some other guys.

435
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's the new...

436
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You got to be as inclusive as possible.

437
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You got to represent the sentient tumor

438
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
in total recall.

439
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I mean, technically, the helmet is already

440
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
on a cancer patient, so...

441
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, fuck.

442
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, there you go.

443
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But it's just because they're getting ready for the movies.

444
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Like, they're pushing these films so hard,

445
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and it's like, they're like,

446
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
our actors are getting old.

447
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They're going to be obsolete soon.

448
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We have to create new characters.

449
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I never thought of that.

450
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you think that's why?

451
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Because the actors will get old

452
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and they want to be able to, in the movies,

453
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
keep them going.

454
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, that is fucking insidious.

455
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's nefarious.

456
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

457
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, that's...

458
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, that's what I think.

459
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh.

460
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's why we're seeing, like, a...

461
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're probably right.

462
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's horrifying.

463
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That...

464
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, my God.

465
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You thought that...

466
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You thought that the vision of Trump's America,

467
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
you thought that future was bad.

468
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Imagine the future ten years from now,

469
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
when Robert Downey is too old to play Iron Man,

470
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and they get some little black girl

471
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
to beat Iron Man in the movies,

472
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because they're already doing it in the comics.

473
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Iron Man's a black girl now.

474
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Thor is a cancer woman now.

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Fucking Captain America's a black guy.

476
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Miss Marvel's a little girl.

477
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know about the old Miss Marvel, anyways, but...

478
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, Doom is also an Iron Man, so...

479
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, that's right.

480
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Dr. Doom is Iron Man now.

481
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Uh-huh.

482
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I forgot about that, because he's got a good face,

483
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and that made him a good person.

484
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yep.

485
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So, two Iron Men, two Captain America's.

486
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We have one Captain Marvel, one Miss Marvel.

487
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
There's fucking five Spider-Man's.

488
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
There's gonna be two noes.

489
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There's so many goddamn Spider-Man's.

490
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There's so many...

491
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh!

492
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There's Peter.

493
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's Miles.

494
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's Silk.

495
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's Kane.

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There's fucking Spider-Gwen.

497
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Kane is the best.

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Go on.

499
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, Kane...

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, I like him.

501
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He's back.

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll talk about him in a minute.

503
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then Renew Your Vows.

504
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's the thing now.

505
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yep.

506
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Mary Jane is a Spider-Man.

507
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Their daughter is a Spider-Man.

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, it seems like every couple of years, Mary Jane becomes a superhero

509
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
for like one issue, and then they forget about it.

510
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She was already an Invincible Iron Man.

511
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh, my God.

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mary Jane as Tony Stark's secretary.

513
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm getting ahead of myself, but I'm just so angry about everything having to do with Spider-Man

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
for the last ten fucking years!

515
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh!

516
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm not even there yet.

517
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm getting ahead of myself.

518
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm gonna fucking burst.

519
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,500
Thinking about Spider-Man has been like a non-stop await on my soul.

520
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Like, I'm constantly...

521
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,000
If people want to know the source of my anger, it's because for the last ten years of Marvel

522
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Spider-Man comics, I'm constantly on the verge of committing like a...

523
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like that game hatred.

524
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A genocide crusade.

525
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,260
All right, go out in black and white with a shotgun and start killing people because

526
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,760
of what they've done to Spider-Man.

527
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,000
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

528
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll get there eventually.

529
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And I'm still yelling about champions right now.

530
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay?

531
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So that's...

532
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay, so the theme is...

533
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Nova who I hate and isn't interesting.

534
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Amadeus Chohulk who I hate and isn't interesting.

535
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Fucking...

536
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Who else?

537
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What's the other...

538
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Miles Morales, the little black Spider-Man from the Ultimate Universe who isn't interesting.

539
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He was.

540
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I haven't been reading his comments lately, though.

541
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay.

542
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What is his origin now in the new Marvel Universe?

543
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It doesn't make any sense anymore.

544
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Wasn't...

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay, I think that the thing...

546
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Miles Morales was a character who was introduced in the Ultimate Comics.

547
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,400
The Ultimate Comics were like Marvel's attempt to sort of make like a second universe to

548
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,000
kind of get new readers in in like the early 2000s.

549
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And it was sort of like retelling of like contemporary origins of superheroes.

550
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And it was a really big success.

551
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There were a lot of really great stories, especially in the early part of the Ultimate Universe.

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Ultimate Spider-Man was fantastic for like the first hundred issues.

553
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh yeah.

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But eventually it kind of crumbled in on itself.

555
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the weight of its own continuity became too much.

556
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And it turned to shit.

557
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And there was a lot of weird stuff that happened.

558
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What's going on with my haunted door over there?

559
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's slowly creaking itself open.

560
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Boo Radley is going to come in here and rape us both for Trump.

561
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I had a dream like that once.

562
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But so the Ultimate Universe lasted for like ten years.

563
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And it eventually crumbled in on itself.

564
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it started having some really awful stories that everyone hated.

565
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Like Ultimatum where like the blob ate the wasp.

566
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And there was like this really graphic panel of him like munching on her intestines and shit.

567
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yep, I remember that.

568
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And like there was a tidal wave and a million people died.

569
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Anyways.

570
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And Scarlet Witch and Silver, what's his name?

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's Quicksilver.

572
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They're fucking?

573
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They're like a sinister thing going on?

574
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah.

575
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But everybody.

576
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Oh, and like Ultimate Wolverine fucked like teenage Jean Grey.

577
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yep.

578
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh, that was so creepy.

579
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That was where I like I signed out where I stopped reading the Ultimate X-Men comics.

580
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I stuck around with Ultimate Spider-Man for a while, but...

581
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Because it was Jean Grey or because she was a teenager?

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Not because she's a teenager.

583
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm a hundred percent for having sex with teenagers.

584
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I think it's what...

585
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think that'll make America great again.

586
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If we all...

587
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If we lower the age of consent to like twelve and a half,

588
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think that would make this country great again.

589
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But um, I just think Wolverine should never ever ever have sex with Jean Grey.

590
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Because it's a...

591
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's like a vital part of his character.

592
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We're like...

593
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Forever pining for the world.

594
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Well, like Wolverine...

595
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We're going off in so many different directions right now,

596
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
but I mean like Wolverine, you know, in the old Claremont X-Men stories,

597
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
he was introduced as like, you know, the rebel of the team.

598
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The guy who's always a loner and he's always grumpy.

599
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He doesn't get along with anyone.

600
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But like a huge...

601
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like he falls in love with Jean Grey,

602
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but like this huge vital part of his growth as a character

603
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is accepting that it is not meant to be with Jean Grey

604
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and accepting that, you know, he can love her deeply, passionately, forever,

605
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
but it's not to be and like going off to Japan and marrying Mariko Yoshida

606
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and like it made him be a better person.

607
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It was like his like...

608
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That was his source of growth in the X-Men comics in the Claremont era.

609
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And um, so it just feels like a weird grimy, slimy betrayal to me

610
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to ever have Wolverine fuck Jean Grey.

611
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It just kind of makes...

612
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm like totally like anti-shipping for that one.

613
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't like it.

614
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's creepy.

615
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Every time I see it in anything, it creeps me out.

616
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And now they've got...

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm going up on so many tangent.

618
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Now they've got Old Man Logan and Teenie Bopper Jean Grey

619
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and I swear to God, they're gonna have him fuck her.

620
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They're gonna have 90 year old Wolverine fuck 16 year old Jean Grey

621
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and I know that I just said that I love fucking little girls,

622
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but something about it being those two characters

623
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
really sickens me on a primal level and I don't want it.

624
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't like it.

625
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't like it.

626
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not feminist is what it is.

627
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You know, Donald Trump's gonna be president

628
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and suddenly Wolverine's gonna be fucking little baby Jean Grey.

629
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I know I'm flip-flopping on my feelings for Donald Trump,

630
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
like every five minutes.

631
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I go from making fun of him to like praising him.

632
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
To back to making fun of him.

633
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's just funny.

634
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Everything about Donald Trump is hilarious to me.

635
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Except for the fact that all my friends are turning on me

636
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
for not voting for Hillary Clinton enough.

637
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah, um...

638
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I actually really like the Old Man Logan series.

639
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh yeah, Old Man Logan.

640
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Everything like the original series was fantastic.

641
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And the news, the ongoing is really good too.

642
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Definitely marriage writing for it, if I remember right.

643
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And he's one of my favorite writers.

644
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What the fuck was I even talking about?

645
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I was talking about like Wolverine and Jean Grey.

646
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Right, winding back you were asking about Miles Morales.

647
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What is his origins?

648
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Get my fucking eye of Agamotto and fucking turn back the clock.

649
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Roll back the clock to the dawn of time.

650
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's the fucking weird back reference.

651
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You weren't expecting that, were you people?

652
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That was a Doctor Strange reference combined with a weird back.

653
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
A dinosaur story reference.

654
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That was like, nobody can do this shit but me.

655
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I've got so much in my brain.

656
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
These fucking spider webs firing off synapses

657
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
in so many fucking wild directions.

658
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's why I'm the best there is at what I do.

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And what I do ain't cool.

660
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Now you were asking about Miles Morales and like what even is...

661
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Right, okay.

662
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So the origin of Miles Morales before the ultimate...

663
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Fuck, there's so much to unpack here with comics.

664
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's why I was so like pumped up and like pacing back and forth

665
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
to like do this panel cast because there's so much to do.

666
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Everything with comics that you talk about,

667
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you have to talk about 10,000 other things.

668
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Everything has 70 years of history before it

669
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
to even get to your point.

670
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's so stressful.

671
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But Marvel in particular is bad.

672
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So okay, the ultimate universe, you know,

673
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
there was a bunch of big events where like a million superheroes died.

674
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Everyone started to hate it.

675
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The people started turning on the ultimate Marvel universe

676
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
pretty strongly and they finally decided,

677
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
okay, it's run its course.

678
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
We got to fold it.

679
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We got to sort of fold it into the main Marvel universe.

680
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So all the characters that were popular,

681
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
which I mean just Miles Morales because he was the only person

682
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
still alive in the ultimate universe by the end of it.

683
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yep.

684
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But so they did a big event last year

685
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
where Dr. Doom did some magic fuckery

686
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and became king of the world for a while.

687
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It combined like the Marvel multiverse into one planet.

688
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Secret Wars.

689
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah, and the end of it,

690
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
the fallout from it was just that, you know,

691
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
the Marvel universe sort of combined

692
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
with the ultimate Marvel universe and sort of...

693
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
They pulled the same thing that DC did with the New 52.

694
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah.

695
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Like after, it wasn't convergence.

696
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It was the one before that. Flashpoint.

697
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It wasn't as badly done as the New 52 though.

698
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I mean it was, I liked last year's event,

699
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
for an event, I hate them all,

700
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
but I thought that the Secret Wars was decent.

701
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It was fine.

702
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

703
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It just took a really long time to finish.

704
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah.

705
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And I think a lot of people lost interest in that.

706
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But yeah, the main Marvel universe

707
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
folded in on the ultimate Marvel universe

708
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and they adopted Miles Morales.

709
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm gonna barf.

710
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm barfing.

711
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
All this over the champions?

712
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, the champions...

713
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's not even finished.

714
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's a lift issue too.

715
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I know already you wanna barf.

716
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay, Miles Morales was a character

717
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
invented in the ultimate Marvel universe by Bendis.

718
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, Michael Bendis.

719
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So, he was the little black Spider-Man.

720
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He was a guy...

721
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't know...

722
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I might be wrong.

723
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Correct me if I get anything.

724
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
She was fucking giving me so much grief earlier.

725
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You go on that panel cast

726
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and everything you fucking say isn't correct.

727
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You get so much stuff wrong.

728
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What?

729
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You fucking...

730
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Why am I always made out to be the bad guy?

731
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't know, because it's funny.

732
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Because I'm a woman.

733
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Exactly.

734
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This is Trump's world now.

735
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm allowed to be sexist.

736
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's Trump's world now.

737
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So, he was a guy who got bitten.

738
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Was it the same spider that bit Peter?

739
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like the exact literal same spider.

740
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Unlike the same day?

741
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Or was it different?

742
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because I don't even know.

743
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't remember.

744
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But he had spider powers too.

745
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And I think like he wasn't doing anything with them.

746
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They had a big event called Ultimatum.

747
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Spider-Man died.

748
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Did he die in Ultimatum?

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, I think.

750
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Peter Parker died.

751
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah, he died.

752
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And, um, you know, so Spider-Man died.

753
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And everyone was really inspired by Spider-Man's heroic death.

754
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And Miles Morales, this kid who had spider powers,

755
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
but didn't do anything with them, he said,

756
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
oh my god, Spider-Man died.

757
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And here I am doing fuck all with my spider powers.

758
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And that's how he learned about responsibility

759
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and that whole thing.

760
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, but it was followed up by a whole mess of things.

761
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And then he became Spider-Man, basically.

762
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
We haven't even gotten to the meat potatoes yet.

763
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Okay, there's Nova, who I hate.

764
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Amadeus Cho, who I hate.

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Miles Morales, who I hate.

766
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That was my point.

767
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That's why I got him the Ultimate Universe fucking story.

768
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because now that he's in the-

769
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The main Marvel Universe?

770
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, in the main Marvel Universe, Spider-Man never died.

771
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So why is Miles Morales a Spider-Man?

772
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What is his new origin?

773
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I mean, if he's still got the powers, why not?

774
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What are they gonna do?

775
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Go back home?

776
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's stupid.

777
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That robs him of all of his coolness, I think.

778
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, and I saw recently some new issues coming out.

779
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I guess him and Spider-Gwen are gonna be a thing at some point.

780
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh my god.

781
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No.

782
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
How old is Spider-Gwen?

783
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I don't know.

784
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Same age?

785
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Isn't she Cradle-Grobbing?

786
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Shouldn't she be Peter Parker's age?

787
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Aren't they both like 16?

788
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
See, I don't keep up with their ages very well because they never age.

789
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Or they reverse ages.

790
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Or they just kind of-

791
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's different in every single comic.

792
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
How fucking old is Gwenpool?

793
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't know.

794
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
When she was introduced last year in Howard the Duck,

795
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
the way that she was drawn made her seem like she's 27, our age, an adult.

796
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Maybe.

797
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But then you read her ongoing, and maybe it's just because of the change in art style.

798
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Now she looks like she's a teenager.

799
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They can't even keep-

800
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That's like a real huge pet peeve of mine, is Marvel being fucky about the characters' ages.

801
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Like, in universe, the Fantastic Four were the first heroes,

802
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and they started, I mean technically like the original human torch,

803
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the robot-looking guy.

804
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But for all intents and purposes, in Marvel continuity history,

805
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the age of superhero started with the Fantastic Four,

806
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
which is generally considered to be 15 years ago.

807
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Right?

808
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And then pretty soon after them,

809
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
15-year-old Spider-Man got bit by the spider.

810
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So when I read comics, to me, I always feel like Peter Parker should be 29, 30 years old, an adult.

811
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But they always want to make him like younger, like his early 20s, and it makes no sense.

812
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The timeline of Marvel is so fucky.

813
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I hate it.

814
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I can't stand it.

815
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It drives me crazy.

816
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How old is Scott Summers?

817
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
He should also be in his 30s.

818
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No, no.

819
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That's an alternate dimension, Scott Summers.

820
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't- oh.

821
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh.

822
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh.

823
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh.

824
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Here we go.

825
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh.

826
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That's right.

827
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How could I forget about the original Five X-Men,

828
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
who got fucking shucky-ducky-quacked-quacked into the modern age?

829
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, no.

830
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That's supposed to be the Scott Summers that becomes an evil, tyrannical person.

831
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm sorry.

832
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
This is the most like cluster fuck panel cast that has ever existed.

833
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm so riled right now about everything.

834
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I haven't even like- we haven't- I have like notes here that we haven't gotten to get all

835
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
the comics that I actually read this week that I haven't talked about yet.

836
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You are technically still yelling about champions.

837
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
This is all connected.

838
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I hate champions so much.

839
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But moving on.

840
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Nova, who I hate.

841
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Amadeus Chohulk, who I hate and is not interesting.

842
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Who is the other guy?

843
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Miles Morales, who is not interesting and I don't like him and I don't care about him.

844
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Scott.

845
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, young Scott.

846
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Young Scott Summers.

847
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Teeny Bopper Cyclops.

848
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, a couple years ago in the pages of X-Men.

849
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
No, wait.

850
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I have to start this story 10 years ago.

851
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Oh no.

852
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I have to start it at like Grant Morrison's new X-Men.

853
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
This is-

854
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
When Grant Morrison, you know, after fucking years of Cyclops existing and nobody liking

855
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
him when Grant Morrison in the 2000s made Cyclops the coolest fucking character of all time

856
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and then Joss Whedon made him even fucking cooler after that.

857
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You know, he started fucking Emma Frost.

858
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
He started, you know, kicking major amounts of ass.

859
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He like, the character evolved from like, you know, Cyclops was always this like stoic,

860
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you know, the Leonardo, the nobody's favorite.

861
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The guy who's just there for Wolverine to bounce off and be the rebel who everyone likes.

862
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He was like the uptight, rule Nazi who, you know-

863
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The principal.

864
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, the principal.

865
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That was how people viewed Cyclops forever.

866
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's how I viewed Cyclops as a kid.

867
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Watching the animated series as a kid, I liked Gambit and Wolverine and I never cared about Cyclops.

868
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's like the Breakfast Club principal.

869
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah.

870
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But, you know, in the early 2000s, these two fucking, these golden gods descended from the heavens

871
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and their names were Grant Morrison and Joss Whedon and they said, hey, shouldn't Cyclops be fucking cool?

872
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
If he's the leader of the coolest fucking team, shouldn't he logically be the coolest fucking guy?

873
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And they put in all this work, they made these storylines where Cyclops like grew as a character

874
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and he turned from this uptight sort of rule Nazi who nobody liked into this sort of like maverick,

875
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
take no prisoners fucking super stud who was like always five steps ahead of the enemy.

876
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This like tactical genius who was willing to break the rules.

877
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
He fucking started like just kicking everyone's ass, you know.

878
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He started like, like, like Magneto started becoming more of a good guy

879
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and Cyclops became this like, this perfect combination of Xavier and Magneto's philosophies.

880
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Like, he took the best from both of these, like, from like the Malcolm X and the other guy, Martin Luther King.

881
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's who they always represented, those two characters.

882
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And Cyclops became this like amalgamation, taking in the best of both of their philosophies

883
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and coming this like mutant hero, this like outlaw hero, this badass

884
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
who like suddenly Cyclops is the coolest fucking character to read about

885
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and that continued for like a good ten years and they just kept upping the ante.

886
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Suddenly you get to like, like when they move to San Francisco

887
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
where like, where they started the Utopia and Cyclops, he like gets his own island fortress for all the X-Men

888
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and he's flying around in a fucking jetpack and he's like riding in convertibles

889
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and he's like, yeah, I'm fucking Cyclops, I fuck the hottest girls, I got eye beams, I'm the coolest guy ever!

890
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He's the best character ever. I fucking love Cyclops, he's awesome.

891
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And like, he became like, they like slowly had him becoming like really good friends with Wolverine

892
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and they were like, they had this like buddy cop thing going on for a while

893
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
where they like had grown to respect each other over all this and that's what I fucking love.

894
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I love like, when the continuity from all these years of stories manifests as characters,

895
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
their relationships changing and growing together because, you know, Wolverine and Cyclops

896
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
who like butted heads for like 40 years, suddenly Cyclops has become this badass

897
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and Wolverine has grown into this like mature, you know, hero

898
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and they've become like really good friends and instead of like fighting over Jean, now she's dead

899
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and they're like kind of bonded over their love for Jean and they're like best buddies and it was great

900
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and it's this beautiful era of X-Men comics where I'm like, you know, all's right with the world

901
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and then stuff started getting fucky. You know, Marvel can't let a good thing exist for too long.

902
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They gotta fuck themselves in some way. They gotta rock the boat.

903
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There was this storyline called Schism where like, in the pages of Wolverine's comic,

904
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Wolverine's ongoing by Jason Aaron who is a great writer who I love.

905
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I loved his Wolverine. I loved his Thor before he started doing the girl thing.

906
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
There was a storyline with this group of people who wanted revenge on Wolverine

907
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and it was like the brilliant plan to finally, like Wolverine had wronged them all at some point in his long life

908
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and they had planned this, they had schemed this revenge for so long

909
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and all of these guys, these like weird super villains, showed up to beat up Wolverine

910
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and he kills all of them. But then at the end you find out that the main, like his ultimate plan

911
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
was that all of these like weird super villains who Wolverine has killed were actually like his illegitimate children.

912
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like Wolverine's, like because he's been around, Wolverine fucks. He's a man who fucks.

913
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
He's been around fucking, he's sired so many illegitimate bastards that this guy collected them all

914
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and turned them into super villains and had Wolverine kill his own children so that he could reveal it to him

915
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and it's like this devastating blow. And so like Wolverine in character, this was a nice bit of character building

916
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
because Wolverine suddenly, Wolverine goes fucking crazy and he goes,

917
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
we can't fucking have children fighting our battles anymore. We have to protect kids. I murdered all my children.

918
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So Wolverine is going apeshit and he's like, I don't wanna, you know, we can't have kids fighting anymore

919
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
but at this point Cyclops has matured into the opposite direction

920
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and he's become this like badass motherfucker like no, this is a war. We're at war with the world.

921
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
We have to have children fight our battles. So they butt heads and I thought Schism was a pretty good story.

922
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You know, I hated it because it was sad to see a friendship be ruined but it was cool. It was well written.

923
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
What am I even fucking talking about? You see, you have to go so far back to even get to where we're talking about.

924
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Um, we were talking about champions and how much you hated Scott.

925
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
This is gonna be a five hour podcast and it's just gonna be champions going into the history of the Marvel Universe

926
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that you need to understand and order to understand why I hate everything about this one comic that I read last week.

927
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So we went down the list of people you hate.

928
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh no, no, no, no, I'm not even done. I'm not done talking about Teenie Bopper Scott.

929
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I haven't even gotten to him yet. That's what started this.

930
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
No.

931
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay, so we're at this point. I have to take my sweater off. I'm fucking, I got the hot sweats.

932
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Ah!

933
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Ah, comics.

934
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So this is like, now we're up to like, this was like 2009, a couple years, like seven years ago.

935
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Schism I think happened six years ago.

936
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Fuck.

937
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So now we're at this point where there's two teams of X-Men.

938
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Wolverine has taken a bunch of the children. He's gone back to New York and started a new Xavier Institute.

939
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
He calls it the Jean Grey Institute.

940
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So Wolverine is now dedicated to, I guess, protecting the kids.

941
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And like, Wolverine has become dedicated to Xavier's dream.

942
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He started a new school for gifted youngsters. He's wearing a suit and tie.

943
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
He's trying to be like a changed man, a principal.

944
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Meanwhile, Cyclops is over here in like the San Francisco area in Utopia.

945
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And he's become like a bad, like they've switched.

946
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Cyclops has become the rebel and Wolverine has become the uptight sort of rules Nazi.

947
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And it gets worse with like AVX.

948
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh yeah, I'm getting to that, baby. I'm getting to it.

949
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So, so that's how the characters had matured and that's good maturation.

950
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's good character growth. It's interesting to read about.

951
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But um, oh yeah, throughout all of this, Beast has become the worst person who ever existed.

952
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Should I get to Beast yet? I'm not even at Beast yet.

953
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh no, he's not even a part of the Chieftains.

954
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I have to, I have to, I have to start.

955
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Well, it's his fault that teeny bopper Cyclops exists.

956
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So I have to talk about Beast and that's going to be another hour.

957
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Because they ruined Beast 2 in a way that's so insidious, I'll get to it.

958
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But I have to talk about, okay, so there's fucking Wolverine has a school, Cyclops has an island.

959
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And they don't like each other anymore.

960
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And now there's this event called Avengers vs X-Men.

961
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And it's the worst thing that ever happened.

962
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
To that point. Worse things happened after it.

963
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But um, basically the Phoenix Force, it's coming back to Earth.

964
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And Cyclops and the Avengers, they don't like each other.

965
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And they got a fight. I'm getting, you have to explain this one.

966
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Because I need a break.

967
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So on AVX, the Phoenix Force returns to Earth and decides to split itself between five chosen people.

968
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's either five or six, I can't remember.

969
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Cyclops wanted it to go to Hope.

970
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Who is his...

971
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Illigent, like his child from a different dimension. I don't, whatever.

972
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
She was the first new mutant born.

973
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
She was the first new mutant born after House of M.

974
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Mutant stopped being born.

975
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And she was the most powerful mutant that anyone had ever seen.

976
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
She had the potential to reignite the mutant race.

977
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And she was raised by Cable in the future.

978
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Cable is Cyclops's son from an alternate future.

979
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And he comes back sometimes and he's a time travel guy with a big gun and he's really cool and everybody likes him.

980
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He has a lot of pouches and a big shoulder pad.

981
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Cable is a good man. He raises the girl.

982
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Her name is Hope Summers now. She's like Scott's adopted granddaughter, I guess.

983
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And she looks just like Jean.

984
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because everyone who is important in X-Men comics is a redhead who looks like Jean.

985
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I don't know why. Nobody knows why.

986
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The Phoenix Force.

987
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Cyclops wants it to go to her because it's going to come to Earth no matter what.

988
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And it might destroy everyone unless it is harnessed by the right person.

989
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So Cyclops in his infinite wisdom because Cyclops is the only smart person in the Marvel Universe.

990
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
He's the only superhero who's still a superhero. The only guy I trust anymore.

991
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Cyclops says, okay, look, it's coming here.

992
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's going to destroy everyone unless we train Hope to harness the fucking Phoenix Force.

993
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
We know how to do this. We're the X-Men. We've been handling the Phoenix for fucking 50 years.

994
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Just let me handle it. I know what I'm doing.

995
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But the Avengers, they just shit all over.

996
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No.

997
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Because...

998
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Because fuck you?

999
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Because in order for these event comics to work, in order for these superhero battles to work...

1000
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
There has to be conflict.

1001
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
One side always has to be made up of idiots.

1002
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
One side is always out of character, always retarded.

1003
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So the Avengers, Captain America becomes this weird, brain-dead, fascist asshole who's like, fuck you.

1004
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We have to kill the 15-year-old girl. We have to murder her because I'm a fearful, hate-mongering idiot.

1005
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You know, I enjoyed AVX to an extent.

1006
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So they fight, basically.

1007
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah. They do fight, and it was stupid because they separated all the fights into like its own thing.

1008
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah.

1009
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And the fights were always stupid.

1010
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's like, well, clearly, who would win in a fight with the Thing vs. Namor deep at the bottom of the ocean?

1011
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah.

1012
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Well, I guess clearly the Thing does.

1013
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah.

1014
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

1015
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Who wins in a fight between Iron Man and Magneto?

1016
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Apparently Iron Man somehow.

1017
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Even though he's made of the stuff that Magneto's one power.

1018
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Magneto has one power, killing Iron Man.

1019
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That was one of my favorite bits in the entire AVX dialogue.

1020
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Iron Man's like, you can't do nothing to me, Magneto.

1021
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
This suit isn't something that you can manipulate.

1022
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Magneto's like, oh no, whatever shall I do as he drops the Golden Gate Bridge on Iron Man.

1023
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Like, are you kidding me?

1024
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And Daredo vs. Cylock, I wonder who would win?

1025
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Nobody, I guess.

1026
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
They can just do it on the rooftop or something.

1027
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So anyways, the fallout of AVX.

1028
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Ugh.

1029
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Because Captain America, you know, stuck his dick in the punch bowl and basically fucked

1030
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
with the X-Men and made this problem 10,000 times worse than it needed to be.

1031
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What happened was the Phoenix Force ended up getting split and it went into five people.

1032
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It went into Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus, Magic, Namor.

1033
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And so they became the Phoenix Five and they took over the fucking world.

1034
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But they fixed the world.

1035
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, it wasn't even like forceful per se.

1036
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like, we want to help the Earth.

1037
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
They didn't become tyrants or despots.

1038
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
They didn't become corrupted by it.

1039
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
They literally fixed the world.

1040
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
They ended all crime.

1041
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The Marvel Universe was at peace for a brief span and Captain America fucking hated it.

1042
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That really burned his bacon.

1043
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That another superhero saved the world forever and not him.

1044
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The Avengers wanted to be the glory hogs, basically.

1045
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
How dare you create world peace forever and end hunger and end suffering throughout the entire planet?

1046
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
How dare you actually be superheroes with this power that I don't approve of?

1047
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So they kept pestering them.

1048
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They kept fucking poking the bear and kicking the hornet's nest.

1049
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You know, Captain America and the Avengers became like this weird mosquito constantly pestering Cyclops,

1050
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
who was fucking busy fixing the world.

1051
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And eventually they pushed him so far that they caused the Phoenix to briefly go corrupted.

1052
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
They caused Cyclops to lose control and the fallout was that in a moment of rage, he killed Charles Xavier.

1053
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And everyone hated him for it forever.

1054
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Even though no one in the Marvel Universe has ever respected the X-Men,

1055
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
even though nobody has ever respected Charles Xavier,

1056
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
suddenly because they have a hate boner for Scott,

1057
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Scott's the worst person who ever lived.

1058
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Scott is now mutant Hitler.

1059
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
He's worse than Magneto ever was in The Avengers Eyes.

1060
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I want a shirt that says Magneto is right.

1061
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I do want that shirt. It's a good shirt.

1062
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I want a shirt that says Cyclops was right.

1063
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's another good one.

1064
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And that became like a meme for many years.

1065
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Still to this day, unlike 4chan and Ko and stuff,

1066
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the Cyclops was right meme.

1067
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Because Cyclops was right.

1068
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
They tried to portray it.

1069
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
They still try to portray it.

1070
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Like he went evil. He went rogue.

1071
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
He's a bad guy now.

1072
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But he's not.

1073
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Everything he does is logical and noble.

1074
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But the narrative wants you to think that he's become like Magneto at his worst,

1075
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
even though he's become the greatest hero in the Marvel Universe.

1076
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's one of those weird things where the narrative doesn't understand

1077
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
how the people are reading it.

1078
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It doesn't understand how badly it's written.

1079
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Whatever makes sales, I guess.

1080
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Whatever continues it.

1081
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So the fallout of all this is that even though Scott was totally in the right

1082
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
for the entire...always.

1083
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Scott has always been in the right and he always will be.

1084
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
All the superheroes hate Cyclops.

1085
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
He's considered a pariah now.

1086
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
He's a bad guy.

1087
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
He has to live in an old Weapon X facility

1088
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
in the fucking frozen tundra in Canada.

1089
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Because it's the only place where the cops won't come for him.

1090
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
He has like a secret team of X-Men.

1091
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And okay.

1092
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So everyone hates Cyclops for no reason.

1093
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Now we get to Beast.

1094
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You remember Beast, right?

1095
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Henry McCoy on the X-Men, the animated series.

1096
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He's this...you know...

1097
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
He's an archetype.

1098
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
He's a character that everyone understands.

1099
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
He looks like a monster.

1100
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He looks like a beast.

1101
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But he has the mind of a genius.

1102
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
He's a brave, noble, compassionate soul

1103
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
dwelling in the body of this abomination.

1104
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's what makes the character interesting.

1105
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The fact that he looks like a big scary gorilla man,

1106
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but he's a great person.

1107
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Marvel didn't like that, I guess.

1108
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
At some point, slowly, this happened insidiously

1109
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
over the last decade or so.

1110
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
They slowly turned the beast that everyone knows and loves

1111
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
into the worst person who ever lived.

1112
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Like, the beast has become the supervillain

1113
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that Marvel thinks Cyclops has become.

1114
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I agreed X-Men comics and I want a barf.

1115
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Like, I don't know, he gets...

1116
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So the beast does all these horrible things for a decade

1117
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and is never called out on it in the narrative,

1118
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
except for one time, in one glorious comic

1119
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
where the Watcher showed up in Beast Room.

1120
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1121
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There was one comic where the Watcher...

1123
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The Watcher is like the narrator of the entire Marvel Universe.

1124
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Well, it was.

1125
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But, uh, you know, his job is to watch.

1126
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
He's the audience surrogate for the Marvel Universe.

1127
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
He's a cosmic guy who watches everything that happens.

1128
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The Marvel Warrior.

1129
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah.

1130
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And there was this one comic, I forget which one it was,

1131
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
but where, like, the Watcher just comes into Hank's room at night

1132
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and he wakes him up and he goes, I am the Watcher.

1133
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I have seen all that was and all that will be.

1134
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Hank McCoy, you are the worst person I've ever met.

1135
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And I'm like, I really feel like that page was written

1136
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
by, like, some disgruntled guy at Marvel

1137
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
who saw what was happening and wanted to have his say

1138
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
before they fired him.

1139
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I wish I knew who wrote it.

1140
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But, um, so they had, like, ten years of, like,

1141
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
everyone vilifying Scott while the Beast was quietly turning

1142
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
into, like, the worst person who ever lived.

1143
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And it culminated in this really awful storyline.

1144
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
This awful bloated, like, three-year storyline

1145
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
by Brian Michael Bendis where, like, the Beast,

1146
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
in order to teach Cyclops a lesson to show him

1147
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
how far Cyclops had fallen, he invented a time machine

1148
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and he brought the original five X-Men from, like,

1149
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
the 60s as teenagers back into the present.

1150
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I guess to traumatize them and show them

1151
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
how horrible the Marvel universe is.

1152
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I guess his plan that, like, his genius plan

1153
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
was that Cyclops would see his younger self and go,

1154
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
oh, I guess I've become Hitler.

1155
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I guess you were right all along, Beast.

1156
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Whoops.

1157
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But instead what happened is he brought the original five X-Men

1158
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
here, these teenagers, from the past.

1159
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Cyclops, Gene Gray, Iceman, Younger Beast, and Angel.

1160
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And, um, he couldn't get them back.

1161
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The time machine only worked one way.

1162
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
He built a one-way time machine.

1163
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That's how fucking retarded he is.

1164
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Um, so they're stuck there to this day, but...

1165
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
There's so much wrong with that.

1166
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah.

1167
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Go on.

1168
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So he's created all kinds of horrible paradox

1169
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
that really, like, that break the entire Marvel universe

1170
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
if you think about them too hard.

1171
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Um, so instead of his plan working,

1172
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
instead of showing present Scott how far he had fallen

1173
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
in Beast's eyes, it just made Scott, like, more angry at Beast

1174
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and more righteous.

1175
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And it made everyone angry at Beast,

1176
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and they kicked him out of the X-Men, and he joined the Inhumans.

1177
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
The Inhumans are, like, the bag serial X-Men.

1178
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't have the energy to talk about how much I hate the Inhumans,

1179
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
but I will next week, maybe.

1180
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Um...

1181
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You know, on that note, IVX is going to be a thing soon.

1182
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It is going to be a thing.

1183
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Um...

1184
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But after Death of X, after Death of X, we gotta wait for that.

1185
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Fucking...

1186
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The Beast was a bad guy.

1187
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So basically, he invented a one-way time machine,

1188
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
like a fucking dummy,

1189
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and he brought these teenage X-Men to the present,

1190
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and they're still there.

1191
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
This was, like, three or four years ago this happened.

1192
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
They're not even teenagers anymore.

1193
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They haven't been sent back.

1194
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
They're still there, just fucking around the Marvel universe,

1195
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
ruining continuity with their very presence,

1196
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
ruining everything, making everything dumb,

1197
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
making the whole universe dumber,

1198
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and... fuck.

1199
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Getting sweats.

1200
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I'm pouring right now.

1201
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So anyways...

1202
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And they just want to kill off Cyclops.

1203
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That's, like, the crux of why I hate it so much.

1204
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Well, they did.

1205
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah, they did.

1206
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
He's dead.

1207
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But now he's back again.

1208
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Younger, not evil yet.

1209
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah, they want Cyclops to be killed off

1210
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
so that they can have a younger version of Cyclops

1211
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and reset the character arc,

1212
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and get rid of all the character development.

1213
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
They just want to replace him,

1214
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
replace this character that has grown for 70 years.

1215
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
All this character development,

1216
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
they want to throw it in a fucking garbage can

1217
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
so they can replace this character

1218
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
literally with his younger self,

1219
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
literally with a less-developed version of him,

1220
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
so that they can have a new, like, weird status quo thing.

1221
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I hate it.

1222
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So that's four people on the Champions team.

1223
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Now you have to get to the girls.

1224
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You got Miss Marvel.

1225
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So, yeah, those are the four people that I hate.

1226
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Are we still talking about Champions?

1227
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's been an hour.

1228
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah, we're back to Champions.

1229
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm sorry, I apologize to America.

1230
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
We had to talk about why Scott,

1231
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
why bringing in Young Scott was terrible

1232
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and all the things that were connected to it.

1233
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Now we're back to Champions

1234
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and on to whether or not you hate Miss Marvel

1235
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and The Visions.

1236
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah, so that's those guys.

1237
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Miles Morales, who is not interesting and I hate him.

1238
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Nova, who is not interesting and I hate him.

1239
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Amadeus Joe, who is not interesting and I hate them.

1240
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Young Scott Summers, who is the worst thing

1241
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
ever created and I hate him.

1242
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And then there's Miss Marvel,

1243
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
who I talked about last week.

1244
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Miss Marvel's an okay character.

1245
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I have no problem with her.

1246
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
She's written poopily in this comic.

1247
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And then there's...

1248
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
She's kind of a killjoy.

1249
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah, she's being written as, like, the killjoy.

1250
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The mom.

1251
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They even address it.

1252
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
They're like this fourth wall breaking.

1253
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like, you're not gonna treat me like the woman

1254
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
is always treated on these teams.

1255
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Like a buzz kill.

1256
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
As she's being a buzz kill.

1257
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, literally as she's being a buzz kill.

1258
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So, like, Mark Wade,

1259
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
because everyone that works at Marvel is a huge SJW,

1260
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
he is aware of these storytelling tropes.

1261
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
He's aware of what he's doing,

1262
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
but he's too lazy to do something else.

1263
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So he thinks that if he addresses these stereotypes,

1264
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
he can get away with doing them by addressing them

1265
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
and seeming like he's self-aware about it.

1266
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Not that I have a problem with tropes.

1267
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I love tropes.

1268
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I have a problem with Marvel being cowardly about using tropes

1269
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and trying to fucking, like, fourth wall their way around it

1270
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and trying to be meta about it.

1271
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But anyways, and finally,

1272
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
the final member of the champions,

1273
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Viv Vision.

1274
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
My home girl.

1275
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Marvel did not waste any time ruining this character.

1276
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
She was just invented,

1277
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and she's already ruined forever.

1278
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Um, Viv Vision, I talked about her.

1279
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I talked about the Vision in the last,

1280
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
whatever the last edition is.

1281
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
She is the Vision's daughter.

1282
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
He made a little family for himself.

1283
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
He made a daughter, and he had a series,

1284
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and it was like the best series,

1285
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
the best comic in, like, five years.

1286
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It was really good.

1287
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Everyone loved it.

1288
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm still hurting over its conclusion.

1289
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah.

1290
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And, you know, Viv goes through this character arc,

1291
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
and at the end of it, you know,

1292
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
she's kind of like this kind of sad,

1293
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
kind of hurt, broken teen who's been through a lot of shit.

1294
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1295
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I mean, if you want to know more about that,

1296
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
read Vision.

1297
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah.

1298
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We can't emphasize that enough.

1299
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Read Vision.

1300
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's like, what, two volumes long?

1301
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's not that long.

1302
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Just pick it up.

1303
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's great.

1304
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So she's on this champions team,

1305
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
and I see it, and I'm like, oh, cool.

1306
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
This new character is being integrated

1307
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
into the larger Marvel universe.

1308
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm okay.

1309
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I like her.

1310
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'd like to read about her.

1311
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Issue two, the end.

1312
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You know...

1313
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Not even the end.

1314
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Before that, when...

1315
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Issue two is that all the champions

1316
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
are trying to get to know each other,

1317
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and they're sitting around a campfire,

1318
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
telling stories.

1319
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And I think Miss Marvel suggests,

1320
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
let's tell ghost stories.

1321
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah.

1322
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And there is this page that is one of...

1323
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The worst things I've ever seen in a comic.

1324
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Just like...

1325
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Viv goes...

1326
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
In this weird alien,

1327
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
star-fired,

1328
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Teen Titans Go voice

1329
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
of not understanding humanity,

1330
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
even though she was totally human before.

1331
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah.

1332
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
They're writing her as this weird robot archetype

1333
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
who doesn't understand anything.

1334
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
They want her to be the data of the team,

1335
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
learning about humanity,

1336
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
even though that's not who she is.

1337
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
She, for all intents and purposes,

1338
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
she's a human female girl.

1339
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
She goes to a high school.

1340
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
She's not like learning about humanity.

1341
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
She's learning about the grievances of the human.

1342
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah, but I mean like,

1343
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
she's not that kind of character.

1344
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah.

1345
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But they have her playing that role,

1346
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and Miss Marvel suggests telling ghost stories.

1347
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And Viv goes,

1348
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
a ghost story.

1349
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
A ghost is something that is alive,

1350
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
but not really.

1351
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Like an android.

1352
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Is that...

1353
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
a microaggression?

1354
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh my god!

1355
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
No.

1356
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
They...

1357
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
They did it.

1358
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Marvel, your tumblr is showing.

1359
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
They did it.

1360
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
They fucking did it!

1361
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
They put the word microaggression

1362
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
into a comic,

1363
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and not only did they put the word

1364
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
microaggression into a comic,

1365
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
they put it in the mouth

1366
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
of a character who had all the potential

1367
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
to be interesting.

1368
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That we all liked and wanted to see more of.

1369
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Immediately ruined.

1370
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Immediately they've taken her,

1371
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and they've perverted her

1372
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
into this weird Marvel tumblr bullshit.

1373
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It gets worse.

1374
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Oh no.

1375
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And then at the end of the book,

1376
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
she...

1377
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The Hulk fucks her.

1378
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yep.

1379
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You know,

1380
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
when I saw that,

1381
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
that last panel...

1382
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The last page of the book,

1383
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
the last page of the book,

1384
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
is Viv making out

1385
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
with the fucking

1386
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
teeny-bopper Asian Bro Hulk.

1387
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
When I saw that,

1388
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
all I could think was,

1389
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
it must be like kissing a horse.

1390
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh.

1391
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Just, he's so massive.

1392
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
How could they do this?

1393
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
How could they do this to me?

1394
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
How could they...

1395
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't like it.

1396
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Oh my god.

1397
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And you know, before that,

1398
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
before that,

1399
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
like all of that was led up to

1400
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
her and Amadeus kissing,

1401
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
making out.

1402
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You know, they're like,

1403
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
they were, you know,

1404
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
little teenage thing, you know,

1405
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
you know,

1406
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
you have your first kiss,

1407
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and she's like,

1408
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
no, I haven't had my first kiss.

1409
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And like,

1410
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
starts leaning in Nova's direction.

1411
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And then again,

1412
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
it's Amadeus' show.

1413
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Like...

1414
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Just that fucking microaggression.

1415
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
No, no, no.

1416
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I want to...

1417
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It makes my skin crawl.

1418
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
All of it does.

1419
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It's all bad.

1420
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It shows the lack of self-awareness

1421
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
on Marvel's behalf,

1422
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
that they think

1423
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
that a hyper-intelligent android

1424
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
who understands,

1425
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
who can have all information

1426
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
in the world in her brain at once,

1427
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
like a fucking genius,

1428
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
that she would have this personality

1429
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
of like,

1430
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
don't microaggression me,

1431
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
don't fucking,

1432
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
ah, whiten me up, privilege.

1433
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You know,

1434
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
but they think that is like enlightenment.

1435
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
They truly do.

1436
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
They think that that's how,

1437
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
like, a hyper-intelligent android would speak.

1438
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Don't microaggression me.

1439
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You know, champions have the potential

1440
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
to be really good.

1441
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The first issue

1442
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
was actually really good

1443
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
by itself,

1444
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
for what it is.

1445
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Like, compared to what we've been dealing with lately,

1446
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
it was sunny,

1447
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
it was upbeat,

1448
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
it was positive,

1449
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and Marvel lately has not been any of those things.

1450
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's been devastating and sad.

1451
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And inclusive.

1452
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Don't forget inclusive.

1453
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh, yeah.

1454
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Devastating, sad,

1455
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
shitty,

1456
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
miserable,

1457
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
pathetic,

1458
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
poorly written,

1459
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
but inclusive.

1460
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
They've sacrificed it all for inclusivity.

1461
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But there's,

1462
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
like, you're right,

1463
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
that second issue was really off-putting,

1464
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
for whatever reasons.

1465
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It was revolting.

1466
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And like,

1467
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
like, I imagine

1468
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
that I am Tom King,

1469
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
that I have written this story

1470
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
that is being praised,

1471
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
critically acclaimed,

1472
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
as one of the best stories

1473
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
ever told in the comics medium.

1474
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Some people are saying that.

1475
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That it's up there with,

1476
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
you know, like,

1477
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
like, Watchman,

1478
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
or fucking Swamp Thing,

1479
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
or Animal Man, or whatever.

1480
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
What is?

1481
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
The vision.

1482
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Oh, yeah.

1483
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Right, you're right.

1484
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah.

1485
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And I imagine that I've written this piece of literature

1486
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
that has touched people.

1487
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
That is like,

1488
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
that is like a,

1489
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
um, a diamond in the rough.

1490
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And in the sea of shit,

1491
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
that is like,

1492
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Marvel Comics,

1493
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
that I've written this amazing story,

1494
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and I've created this character

1495
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
who has so much potential,

1496
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and immediately,

1497
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
they sticker in a book

1498
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
and have her complaining

1499
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
about microaggressions.

1500
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
If I was,

1501
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
if I was the guy who wrote the vision,

1502
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I would be at Marvel right now

1503
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
throwing Molotovs.

1504
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'd be losing my shit.

1505
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Gotta develop avalanche for Marvel.

1506
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, God.

1507
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There was one thing

1508
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I liked about Champions.

1509
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I would be remiss

1510
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
if I didn't mention

1511
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
the one panel

1512
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
that gave me a chuckle,

1513
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
a sensible chuckle.

1514
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It was when they were asking,

1515
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
when Viv mentions

1516
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
that she emits Wi-Fi,

1517
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
so they can use their phones.

1518
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And they say,

1519
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
cool,

1520
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
what's your Wi-Fi password?

1521
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And her answer is,

1522
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
even an android can cry.

1523
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Which is right up there

1524
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
in the upper right corner

1525
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
of the panel cast background.

1526
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
One of my favorite panels of all time.

1527
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Even an android can cry.

1528
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
That was a nice,

1529
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
cute little nod.

1530
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It gave me a sensible chuckle.

1531
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I read that and like,

1532
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
hey, this comic's not bad.

1533
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
The very next page!

1534
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
She's whining about microaggressions

1535
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
and making out with a fucking,

1536
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
a weird Hulk guy

1537
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
who's not the Hulk.

1538
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Sucking his big green dick.

1539
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Filling her,

1540
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
her, her fuel canisters

1541
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
with cum,

1542
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
hulk cum.

1543
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Wonder if it's like,

1544
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
bright green like the rest of them.

1545
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Ugh.

1546
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Anyways,

1547
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
that's Champions.

1548
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It ruined my life,

1549
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and now it's ruined this podcast.

1550
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's been one hour.

1551
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Hahaha.

1552
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Everything,

1553
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I spent so long praising

1554
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the vision comics

1555
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
in the last panel cast,

1556
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
all of it's ruined now.

1557
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
They've blown it all up.

1558
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm like,

1559
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'm like,

1560
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Charlton Heston.

1561
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Those maniacs.

1562
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Charlton Heston,

1563
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and there's a giant,

1564
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
the Statue of Liberty

1565
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
is a giant,

1566
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
broken,

1567
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
viv vision on the beach.

1568
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
She's been mangled.

1569
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Her head is ripped off

1570
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and her arm is sticking out of the water.

1571
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And I'm just sitting there

1572
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
on the beach.

1573
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You maniacs!

1574
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You blew it all up!

1575
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Damn you!

1576
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Damn you,

1577
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
salt to hell!

1578
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I didn't like it.

1579
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I didn't care for Champions.

1580
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
That's fair.

1581
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Eight out of ten.

1582
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Hahaha.

1583
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Anyways,

1584
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
now we can finally

1585
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
talk about the things

1586
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
that happened this week.

1587
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This is,

1588
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
this is the giant sized

1589
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
panel cast.

1590
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This is the special

1591
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
third episode anniversary edition.

1592
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It's got to be,

1593
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
this is an 80 page panel cast.

1594
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It cost ten dollars.

1595
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So let's talk about this week.

1596
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You and I,

1597
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
yesterday,

1598
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
before we talk about the comics,

1599
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
we saw

1600
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Doctor Strange,

1601
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
the movie.

1602
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Because I've just been

1603
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
unleashing this torrent

1604
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
of sweat and rage

1605
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
for an hour.

1606
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I'll let you talk first.

1607
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
What did you think

1608
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
of the Doctor Strange movie?

1609
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Starring

1610
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Benedict

1611
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Cumberbunch

1612
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The Scrotum Supreme.

1613
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
That's his name.

1614
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
He's a great actor.

1615
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's not an insult.

1616
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
That's what I call him.

1617
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I just want to say firsthand

1618
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
that I don't find him attractive.

1619
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But,

1620
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
but I tell that to the world.

1621
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
He's a great actor.

1622
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
He was perfect for this role.

1623
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Great casting choice.

1624
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
No, he was perfect.

1625
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Like,

1626
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
within

1627
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
five minutes of watching the movie,

1628
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I didn't see Benedict Cumberbunch anymore.

1629
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Nope.

1630
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I just saw Stephen Strange.

1631
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yep.

1632
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
He totally,

1633
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
it was,

1634
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
just like when Robert Downey

1635
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
stepped into that fucking...

1636
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
He embraces it.

1637
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
He owns it.

1638
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
He is

1639
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Doctor Strange.

1640
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yes.

1641
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It's the role he was born for.

1642
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I loved it.

1643
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Doctor Strange

1644
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
is definitely up there

1645
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
as far as my favorite Marvel movies go.

1646
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I put it up there

1647
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
with Guardians of the Galaxy,

1648
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
honestly.

1649
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Give me a top five.

1650
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Top five?

1651
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Not in any kind of

1652
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
particular order,

1653
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
but for sure,

1654
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Guardians.

1655
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Doctor Strange.

1656
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I did not care that much

1657
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
for Ant-Man.

1658
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I guess I can skip that.

1659
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I still had fun

1660
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
with the first Avengers movie.

1661
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I thought that was

1662
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
really well done.

1663
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Winter Soldier was good.

1664
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Lower top five,

1665
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
probably.

1666
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
What am I even missing?

1667
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I'm going to...

1668
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Thor?

1669
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Thor was fun.

1670
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The first Thor was okay.

1671
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
The first Thor was fun.

1672
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Does anybody even remember

1673
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
the second Thor?

1674
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Honestly,

1675
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
honest to God.

1676
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I remember Ragnarok.

1677
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I don't.

1678
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I watched it.

1679
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And I don't remember anything.

1680
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Let me give a...

1681
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Let me try to give

1682
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
my top five here.

1683
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Yeah.

1684
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Descending from five.

1685
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
X-Men Days of Future Past

1686
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
was really good.

1687
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yeah.

1688
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
The Ending Alone

1689
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
was one of the best things

1690
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
ever in a movie

1691
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that I've ever seen.

1692
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
How the ending is

1693
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
totally retconned

1694
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
in the third X-Men movie.

1695
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That was such a

1696
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
fuck yeah moment.

1697
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yep.

1698
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'll remember that moment

1699
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
in the theater

1700
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
for the rest of my life.

1701
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Okay.

1702
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Are you...

1703
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Civil War?

1704
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Was it great?

1705
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Did you not like it?

1706
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I don't think

1707
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
they should have called it

1708
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
a Civil War movie.

1709
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
No.

1710
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Number three,

1711
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
The First Avengers.

1712
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
The First Iron Man.

1713
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Yeah,

1714
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
you know,

1715
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I forgot about that movie.

1716
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I love those.

1717
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And number one,

1718
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
the greatest Marvel movie of all,

1719
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
perhaps the greatest film

1720
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
of all time,

1721
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Spider-Man 2.

1722
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Which one?

1723
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The real Spider-Man 2.

1724
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Oh no.

1725
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
With Toby.

1726
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh no.

1727
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
You don't like Spider-Man 2?

1728
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Spider-Man 2

1729
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
is the citizen cane

1730
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
of movies.

1731
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Thank you.

1732
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I...

1733
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
What are you doing to me

1734
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
right now?

1735
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
What is this?

1736
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
What is this?

1737
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
This hesitation?

1738
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's like you're about to tell me

1739
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Spider-Man 2 is on me or something.

1740
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
That's the look on your face right now.

1741
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
You're about to tell me

1742
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
the kid isn't mine.

1743
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I don't remember anything

1744
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
about Spider-Man 2.

1745
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I remember the horrors

1746
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
of Spider-Man 3

1747
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and that is all I remember.

1748
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You look like

1749
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
you're about to tell me

1750
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
the secret of my black son.

1751
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
What?

1752
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
You're gonna...

1753
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You're gonna burst that bubble for me.

1754
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
What happened in Spider-Man 2?

1755
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I remember the amazing Spider-Man 2.

1756
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Spider-Man 2 was Doc Ock.

1757
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Okay.

1758
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That fucking scene on the train?

1759
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
The greatest scene

1760
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
in the history of cinema.

1761
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's like...

1762
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Dr. Alan Grant

1763
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
seeing the Brontosaurus

1764
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
for the first time.

1765
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It's that.

1766
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And it's like...

1767
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Captain Jack Sparrow

1768
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
on his sinking little boat

1769
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
stepping onto the dock

1770
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
at the beginning of Pirate of the Caribbean

1771
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and then the subway scene

1772
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
in Spider-Man 2.

1773
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
When all of those fucking New Yorkers

1774
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
they take his mask off.

1775
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I'm gonna start crying again.

1776
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
And they say...

1777
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
You know?

1778
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
He's just a kid.

1779
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
He's no older than my son.

1780
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And Dr. Ock is gonna start wrecking shit.

1781
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
He's gonna beat the shit out of Spider-Man

1782
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
and those fucking New Yorkers.

1783
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
You know?

1784
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The real America shines through.

1785
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That's something that we need

1786
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
right now in this divided country.

1787
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Okay?

1788
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
With this fucking election

1789
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
that we've just been through.

1790
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Okay?

1791
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Where we've gotten to the point

1792
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
as a country

1793
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
where we say that elections

1794
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
are something we need to heal from.

1795
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
How insane is that?

1796
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That the phrase

1797
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
we have to heal from this

1798
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
is said after a fucking election.

1799
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That's how broken this country is.

1800
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Okay?

1801
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
We've got people

1802
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
even after the election

1803
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
crying.

1804
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
People breaking down in tears

1805
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
about Donald Trump.

1806
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
People are so fucking sad right now.

1807
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
The country is tearing itself apart.

1808
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This poisonous election

1809
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
has ruined us as a people.

1810
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But I'm telling you

1811
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
just sit down

1812
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
and go watch Spider-Man 2 again

1813
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and you will feel the spirit,

1814
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
the power of the real America

1815
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
pumping through your veins,

1816
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
marching through your body

1817
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
like electric soldiers

1818
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
filling you with power

1819
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
all throughout your being.

1820
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Your essence will transcend.

1821
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
You will become,

1822
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
you will achieve broken brilliance

1823
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
as you feel the power

1824
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and clap for the new day

1825
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
of the real America.

1826
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
As you fucking see those New Yorkers,

1827
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
they come together.

1828
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
They put aside all differences

1829
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and they say,

1830
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Dr. Octopus,

1831
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
if you mess with one of us,

1832
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
you gotta mess with all of us.

1833
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
And then Spider-Man,

1834
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
he fucking gets up.

1835
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
He's not wearing his mask anymore.

1836
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
The secret identity is gone.

1837
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Everybody has phones.

1838
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Everybody has cameras.

1839
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Nobody's even so much

1840
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
as taking a picture.

1841
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
These people will keep this secret

1842
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
to their grave

1843
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
because that's how much they care

1844
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
about Spider-Man

1845
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
and he's fucking holding,

1846
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
he's holding the tray

1847
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
with his arms.

1848
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Ahh!

1849
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Ahh!

1850
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Ahh!

1851
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's the greatest film ever made.

1852
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
How dare you

1853
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
not sing the praises

1854
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
every day, every morning.

1855
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You should wake up

1856
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
the first thing you should do

1857
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
five times a day.

1858
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You should get on your hands and knees

1859
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and face towards Mecca

1860
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and praise Spider-Man 2.

1861
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I guess I'll rewatch it at some point.

1862
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I don't really remember.

1863
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
What were we talking about?

1864
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
The Doctor Strange movie.

1865
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Yeah, we were talking about

1866
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
how great Doctor Strange is.

1867
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Oh yeah, I was supposed to put

1868
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Doctor Strange somewhere

1869
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
in that top five.

1870
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Oh, somewhere.

1871
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Okay, top seven because,

1872
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
okay, Doctor Strange

1873
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and Guardians,

1874
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'll also put them in the top seven

1875
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Marvel movies.

1876
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
There you go.

1877
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
There you go.

1878
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah, no.

1879
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Spider-Man 2 is number one, though.

1880
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I really enjoy Doctor Strange.

1881
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Just everything about it.

1882
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It was fun.

1883
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Like, he really owned the character

1884
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
like we mentioned earlier.

1885
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
The effects,

1886
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
like the special effects were lone.

1887
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I don't know.

1888
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I really, it was,

1889
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
everyone's like,

1890
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
oh, it's the Marvel's inception,

1891
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
but I thought it was better.

1892
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It really looked like

1893
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
those old comic book covers

1894
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
from like Jack Kirby.

1895
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah.

1896
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Like, you know,

1897
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
all the fucking colors

1898
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and the weird shit

1899
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
in the dark dimension.

1900
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Like just the fucking scene.

1901
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
The old foil covers.

1902
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh, God, yes.

1903
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
It looked like a special edition,

1904
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
like 90s foil cover

1905
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
that glimmers in the light.

1906
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That fucking scene

1907
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
where the ancient one first

1908
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
throws him out of his body

1909
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and it's like this 10-minute scene

1910
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
of him just like

1911
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
having this total mental mind fuck

1912
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and like seeing all the

1913
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
the wonders and horrors

1914
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
of the infinite cosmos.

1915
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And that was so cool.

1916
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It was a good movie.

1917
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It really was.

1918
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I can't praise it enough.

1919
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
All the casting was great.

1920
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The ancient one was awesome.

1921
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I think this might,

1922
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
people might have complained

1923
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
about her being a woman,

1924
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
but I think that was

1925
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
probably blown out of proportion.

1926
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
They actually complained

1927
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
specifically about her

1928
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
being a white woman.

1929
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
That's right.

1930
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That's right.

1931
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It wasn't that she was a woman.

1932
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It was that she was white.

1933
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Even though she's a great fucking actress.

1934
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
She was so good.

1935
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Like,

1936
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I don't know.

1937
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I believed it.

1938
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I couldn't,

1939
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I don't know if I would have wanted

1940
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
like another,

1941
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
a different kind of ancient one

1942
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
because how many times

1943
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
have we seen that archetype

1944
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
of an old ancient wise

1945
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
like Tibetan guru

1946
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
or Chinese guru

1947
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
with like a big,

1948
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
with a fucking Paimei beard

1949
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and a fucking,

1950
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
you know,

1951
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
we've already seen that

1952
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
in every movie ever made.

1953
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It was a brilliant casting choice

1954
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
to make the ancient one a woman

1955
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and a cool woman,

1956
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
a hot babe.

1957
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
She was awesome.

1958
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
She was charismatic.

1959
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
She felt like she,

1960
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
you know,

1961
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
she embodied that,

1962
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
that simultaneous ferocity

1963
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and compassion.

1964
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
She was good.

1965
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
She was a nice thing.

1966
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
A lot of the supporting cast

1967
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
is really good.

1968
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I feel like the antagonists

1969
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
were a little bit forgettable, but...

1970
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I like what they did

1971
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
with Baron Mordo

1972
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
because in the comics

1973
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and also like,

1974
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I mean, like,

1975
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I have an old, like,

1976
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
from like 2007,

1977
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
like this Marvel animated

1978
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Doctor Strange movie

1979
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
that was really kind of boring

1980
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
and not very good,

1981
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
but I watched it like 10 times

1982
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
that, you know,

1983
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
same basic plot.

1984
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's Doctor Strange.

1985
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
He learns his powers.

1986
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
He fights Dormammu or whatever.

1987
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
You know,

1988
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
in the original Doctor Strange origin,

1989
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Baron Mordo was like the Anakin.

1990
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
He was power hungry

1991
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and it corrupted him

1992
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and he like tried to kill

1993
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
the ancient one

1994
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
and that's why he became a villain.

1995
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And this movie did something

1996
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
like a little bit more unique

1997
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and a little bit more clever with it.

1998
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
We're like,

1999
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
instead of being like

2000
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
a power hungry bad influence,

2001
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Baron Mordo was kind of like

2002
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
the moral rules not see a little bit

2003
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and he was upset

2004
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
with like the ancient one

2005
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
breaking the rules

2006
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
and it was his sort of devotion

2007
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
to the cause

2008
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
and his,

2009
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
it was his strong moral sense

2010
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
that caused him to become a villain

2011
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
by the end.

2012
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yeah.

2013
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Instead of like any kind of like

2014
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
typical overdone, greedy,

2015
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I just want to be,

2016
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
that was like the Caestilian role.

2017
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Or like in Ant-Man.

2018
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah.

2019
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Like with the wasp.

2020
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Oh, Ant-Man was a good one too.

2021
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Top eight Marvel movies.

2022
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Ant-Man is on there.

2023
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You didn't like Ant-Man?

2024
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I was,

2025
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
it was not blown away by it.

2026
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Well,

2027
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
get out of my house.

2028
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I just felt like Paul Rudd

2029
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
was a very Paul Ruddy in it.

2030
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Very watered down

2031
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
compared to what I'm used to seeing out of him.

2032
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
But anyway,

2033
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I don't know,

2034
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I really like Doctor Strange.

2035
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I really like the supporting cast.

2036
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Rachel McAdams who,

2037
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
if you're not familiar,

2038
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
she was the main antagonist

2039
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
in Mean Girls

2040
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
and now she is the

2041
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
straight shooter, I guess,

2042
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
that kind of part,

2043
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
that just kind of helps

2044
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Doctor Strange out along the way.

2045
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Oh, Wong was great.

2046
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I loved Wong.

2047
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Wong was the best.

2048
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
He was awesome.

2049
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Oh yeah.

2050
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Papa Wong.

2051
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It did a really good job of

2052
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I guess making me give a shit

2053
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
about Doctor Strange.

2054
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Because I've always felt like

2055
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Doctor Strange in the comics

2056
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
is a character that sort of

2057
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
only works as a supporting character.

2058
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Like he'll show up in like a

2059
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Gwen pool

2060
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
or in someone else's comic

2061
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and do some mystical stuff.

2062
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Or like in the original Civil War

2063
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
he just kind of shows up

2064
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
and he's like fixed.

2065
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yeah, because his powers

2066
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
are so like beyond the scope

2067
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
of what people can grasp.

2068
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Like there's no rules to them.

2069
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So like...

2070
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
If he was always on a team,

2071
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
like everything would always be fine.

2072
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Like I feel like

2073
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
reading Doctor Strange comics

2074
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
or trying to,

2075
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I always feel like

2076
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
what the hell is going on?

2077
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Like how can I get invested

2078
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
in a story with no rules?

2079
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

2080
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Maybe I haven't read enough

2081
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
of the character.

2082
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But he's always been

2083
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
like one of those

2084
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
that's been a little difficult

2085
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
for me to care about

2086
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
or to grasp.

2087
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And they did a really good job

2088
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
in this movie of making him

2089
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
understandable.

2090
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And this is who he is

2091
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and what he does.

2092
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And there he goes.

2093
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Yeah, I'm really glad that they did

2094
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
like all of the origins

2095
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
and like the traumas

2096
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
of what he went through

2097
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
as a neurosurgeon.

2098
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah.

2099
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It was really good.

2100
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And of course,

2101
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
spoiler alert,

2102
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
the actual,

2103
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
not villain,

2104
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
like just the

2105
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
the cosmic force

2106
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
in which the antagonists

2107
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
were trying to get a hold of.

2108
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I was very excited about

2109
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Oh, Dormammu.

2110
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh my God.

2111
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Yes.

2112
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yeah.

2113
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I was,

2114
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I was shaking in my chair.

2115
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I was like, yes, I need this.

2116
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
How did you feel about

2117
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
the look of Dormammu?

2118
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I had no problem with it.

2119
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I feel like it was fine.

2120
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Like the way that they portrayed

2121
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
him in the movie

2122
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
is suiting to the movie

2123
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and its theme

2124
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
and what they were going for.

2125
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
If they had just done

2126
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the actual Dormammu,

2127
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
like design him

2128
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and his like

2129
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
the guy with the scary head.

2130
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah.

2131
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Like I feel,

2132
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I feel like that would have been

2133
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
very thematic.

2134
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't like,

2135
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I don't think it's thematic.

2136
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I get what they were going for.

2137
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Like I,

2138
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
like if he's in the dark dimension,

2139
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
of course that he would be

2140
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
like some giant,

2141
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
eldritch fucking face

2142
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
in the clouds, man.

2143
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
But it just,

2144
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
it kind of gave me

2145
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
vibes of like,

2146
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
of the,

2147
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
the cloud Galactus

2148
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
in the second

2149
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Fantastic Four movie

2150
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
or like,

2151
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
or like in Green Lantern.

2152
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Oh yeah.

2153
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Parallax was just like

2154
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It was a big ol' angry cloud too.

2155
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah.

2156
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
But they did it better.

2157
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It was definitely

2158
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
better done

2159
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
than in the Fantastic Four movie.

2160
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Because in that movie is,

2161
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
that was like

2162
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
in the early days

2163
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
of the Marvel movies were like,

2164
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
they didn't want to be

2165
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
too comic booky

2166
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
or too hokey.

2167
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
They wanted to put

2168
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
like the X-Men

2169
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and weird leather

2170
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
costumes,

2171
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
which now look

2172
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
way more dated

2173
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
than the superhero

2174
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
costumes could ever look.

2175
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But um,

2176
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
yeah like,

2177
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
they can't have Galactus

2178
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
be a big purple guy

2179
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
with a helmet.

2180
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
He has to be

2181
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
a faceless cloud of

2182
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
bullshit.

2183
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Like a total,

2184
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
a maelstrom.

2185
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah.

2186
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Um.

2187
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Anyways,

2188
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
it was a minor thing that I was like,

2189
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
well,

2190
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I wish he was a guy with a scary head.

2191
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But it didn't bother me that much.

2192
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It was a great movie.

2193
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
No,

2194
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm glad that it wasn't.

2195
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Anyway.

2196
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And I really liked the ending.

2197
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Um,

2198
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and there are two

2199
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
ending credit

2200
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
or after

2201
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Oh yeah.

2202
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Oh man,

2203
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
the first one,

2204
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
the first after

2205
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
credits was so cool.

2206
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I am really excited

2207
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
for the new Thor movie.

2208
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah,

2209
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
please,

2210
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
please.

2211
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
No,

2212
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
we were standing outside the theater.

2213
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You were,

2214
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
you mentioned that you said like the

2215
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
second Thor movie was pretty

2216
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
forgettable.

2217
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And I was about to say like,

2218
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
no,

2219
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
it's not.

2220
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Remember that hat?

2221
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Uh,

2222
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
well,

2223
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
what about the part where

2224
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
the,

2225
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
the doctor,

2226
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
the doctor was in it.

2227
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
He was an elf.

2228
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
It was Malaketh.

2229
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He did.

2230
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Natalie Portman

2231
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
did something.

2232
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Two broke girls.

2233
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Um,

2234
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
shit.

2235
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah.

2236

Sorry.

2269
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You saying all this

2270
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
reminded me.

2271
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I had a customer once who,

2272
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I had an employee.

2273
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
She was black.

2274
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
She was the only black

2275
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
girl in the company.

2276
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And I had a customer who

2277
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
was a little bit mentally

2278
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
unstable and he came in

2279
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
and would hit on her and

2280
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
he was like,

2281
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Oh no.

2282
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
He's like,

2283
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I had a vision.

2284
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Oh no.

2285
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
That.

2286
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I had a

2287
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Premonition.

2288
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
He's like,

2289
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I had a vision that

2290
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
my father Odin was

2291
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
going to give me the power

2292
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
to free all the blacks.

2293
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Whoa.

2294
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I need a movie.

2295
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I want a movie about the

2296
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
mentally deranged comic

2297
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
book fan who

2298
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
frees all the blacks.

2299
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Well,

2300
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
technically there is a

2301
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
manga that you can read

2302
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
called In a Yashiki.

2303
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
That is about

2304
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
an old man.

2305
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I ain't reading,

2306
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I ain't reading no

2307
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
nip shit.

2308
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I ain't reading no

2309
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
backwards ass black and

2310
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
white fake comics

2311
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
from a fake land

2312
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
of fake people.

2313
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And

2314
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Digibro would like

2315
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
it.

2316
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
He probably

2317
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
like In a Yashiki.

2318
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Digibro is being

2319
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
converted.

2320
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Digibro loves American

2321
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
excellence.

2322
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That's good.

2323
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
That's horrifying

2324
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and good all at the same

2325
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
time.

2326
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Did you see Luke Cage?

2327
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I have not seen

2328
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Luke Cage yet.

2329
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I did see Daredevil.

2330
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I did not care for the

2331
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
second season of Daredevil

2332
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
at all.

2333
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Neither did I.

2334
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I cared about

2335
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
the first half of

2336
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
the second season of

2337
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Daredevil.

2338
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And then it just goes

2339
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
into this downward

2340
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
spiral.

2341
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It went into this

2342
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
like electrical hole.

2343
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
What did they

2344
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
fucking do to

2345
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Punisher?

2346
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh my God.

2347
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
He didn't do anything

2348
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
in the last episode.

2349
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
The whole season

2350
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
is about like

2351
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Daredevil vs. Punisher.

2352
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
This amazing

2353
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
philosophical budding of

2354
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
heads between these

2355
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
two diametrically opposed

2356
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
brilliant characters

2357
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
who are have so much

2358
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
pathos and

2359
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
characterization to them.

2360
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
This whole season

2361
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
is about these two

2362
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
characters budding heads.

2363
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And it's the greatest

2364
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
thing ever.

2365
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And they jumped the gun

2366
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
at the hands shit.

2367
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They introduced it too

2368
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
early.

2369
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And they just

2370
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
the whole thing

2371
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
went down into this fucking

2372
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
ninja hole.

2373
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And fucking

2374
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't I didn't

2375
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
like the actress

2376
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
who played

2377
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Electra at all.

2378
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I don't like the accent.

2379
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Why can't they just

2380
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
have them talk normal?

2381
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Why do they

2382
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
cast these fucking

2383
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
charisma vacuum women

2384
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
as these fucking

2385
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
characters?

2386
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
They want everyone

2387
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
to care about these

2388
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
female superheroes.

2389
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
They want representation.

2390
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
They want little girls

2391
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
to love Wonder Woman

2392
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and love Electra.

2393
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
So why don't

2394
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
they cast people

2395
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
with charisma?

2396
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Why do they

2397
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
cast these girls

2398
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
with these like

2399
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
weird accents

2400
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
that sound ridiculous?

2401
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
They don't want to talk.

2402
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
They talk like

2403
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
that fucking anime snob.

2404
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Fucking

2405
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I want to see the Wonder

2406
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Woman movie.

2407
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
She's wrong about

2408
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
sort of online

2409
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and he doesn't understand

2410
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
he's a bad guy.

2411
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I am a 35 year old bald

2412
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
man.

2413
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Wonder Woman is going to

2414
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
be a 35 year old bald man

2415
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
who reviews anime

2416
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
badly on the internet

2417
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
because she has a

2418
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
stupid fucking accent

2419
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
because they cast these

2420
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
fucking emotionless

2421
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
charisma devoid

2422
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
broads as these characters.

2423
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Electra sucked.

2424
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Wonder Woman is going to

2425
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
suck.

2426
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
She already sucked

2427
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
in the Batman v Superman

2428
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
movie.

2429
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Electra sucked in

2430
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Daredevil season two

2431
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and they focused way too

2432
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
much on her at the end.

2433
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
She's boring

2434
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
like this queer love story

2435
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
between her and Matt Murdock

2436
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
that nobody fucking

2437
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
cares about.

2438
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Electra serves one

2439
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
purpose.

2440
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
The character of

2441
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Electra is only there

2442
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
to die.

2443
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That she's not

2444
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
interesting.

2445
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
She's not cool.

2446
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I hate her.

2447
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
She should just fucking

2448
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
die and come back evil

2449
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
and then die again

2450
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and get it over with.

2451
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I don't want to hear about

2452
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
her.

2453
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I don't want to see her

2454
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
falling in love with Matt Murdock.

2455
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I don't want to fucking

2456
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
that weird scene

2457
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
in the last episode

2458
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
where there was like

2459
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
100 hand ninjas

2460
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
just patiently waiting

2461
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
outside the door

2462
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
to finish his

2463
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
20 minute fucking

2464
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I'm in love with you monologue

2465
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
locked in this broom closet

2466
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
before they go out and fight.

2467
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
The ninjas were just

2468
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
waiting there.

2469
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
They were just fucking

2470
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
standing there.

2471
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Are you done?

2472
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Are you done falling in love

2473
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
yet?

2474
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Are you done having

2475
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
your big emotional fucking

2476
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
the notebook scene?

2477
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Can we fight now please?

2478
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And then they have this

2479
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
fucking tepid fucking

2480
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
this this this soft

2481
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
fucking penis

2482
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
soft penis battle

2483
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
on the on the on the

2484
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
rooftop.

2485
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
The Punisher shows up

2486
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and shoots like one bullet

2487
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and then fucks off

2488
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
and does nothing.

2489
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
They fucking

2490
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
stuff.

2491
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yeah.

2492
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
They goofy like

2493
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
yeah.

2494
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That thumbs up.

2495
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Oh man.

2496
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
They they screwed the pooch

2497
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
on that one.

2498
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Daredevil season two

2499
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
started strong and ended

2500
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
poop.

2501
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm like

2502
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
traumatized right now.

2503
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Anyways.

2504
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh my god.

2505
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Luke Cage on the other hand.

2506
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yeah.

2507
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
How is that?

2508
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I hear good things about it.

2509
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Well,

2510
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Daredevil started strong

2511
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and then sort of went

2512
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
got a little bad

2513
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
at the end.

2514
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I thought

2515
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Luke Cage

2516
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
was consistently

2517
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
okay.

2518
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
mediocre

2519
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
for the entire run.

2520
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I mean like

2521
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
there were parts of it.

2522
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
There were certain scenes

2523
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
in Luke Cage

2524
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
that I thought were some

2525
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
of the coolest things

2526
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I've ever seen.

2527
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Some of the best scenes

2528
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
ever.

2529
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
There were like

2530
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
moments where

2531
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
it came close

2532
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
to greatness.

2533
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
But for the most part

2534
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I kind of

2535
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
was spacing out

2536
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
and I think

2537
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
binging is an unhealthy

2538
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
way to watch

2539
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
those anyways because

2540
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
you get bored by the

2541
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
seventh episode.

2542
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
No matter how good

2543
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
a show is.

2544
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
So that could be part

2545
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
of it.

2546
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But it didn't.

2547
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
There were some really

2548
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
like the scene where

2549
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
he's you know

2550
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
wearing the bullet hole

2551
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
hoodie and Method Man

2552
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
writes that cool rap song

2553
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
about the black power

2554
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and that

2555
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that part was awesome.

2556
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
You know,

2557
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
it's funny too

2558
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
because there were a lot

2559
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
of people complaining

2560
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
online

2561
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
that Luke Cage

2562
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
was a little

2563
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
too black.

2564
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
No,

2565
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
fuck that.

2566
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
That's bullshit.

2567
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And you know,

2568
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I just want to sit there

2569
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and I just want to tell them

2570
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
like,

2571
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
do you even know

2572
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
what Luke Cage is about?

2573
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Why would you say that?

2574
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Like enough.

2575
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I want him to be the blackest

2576
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
niggest ass,

2577
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
fucking

2578
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
bufarest

2579
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
jungle bunny,

2580
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
fucking

2581
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
tar baby.

2582
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
What's another one?

2583
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This is Trump's America.

2584
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I can say these things now.

2585
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I want him to be

2586
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
the niggest of all

2587
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
possible nigs.

2588
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The big nigg.

2589
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yeah.

2590
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I mean,

2591
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
yeah, he was good.

2592
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
The show was definitely

2593
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
sufficiently black.

2594
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
He could have even been blacker

2595
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and I would have been happier.

2596
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah.

2597
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You can't fucking take the blackness

2598
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
out of Luke Cage.

2599
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
The whole point of the character

2600
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
is being black.

2601
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Like,

2602
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
that's...

2603
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
They were like,

2604
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
it's just not credible

2605
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
the way he's acting.

2606
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
He's not acting.

2607
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It seems a little

2608
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
scary.

2609
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And I was like,

2610
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
stop.

2611
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Stop talking.

2612
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Read the old comics.

2613
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
If you're kind of shit

2614
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
on Luke Cage

2615
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
for how they're

2616
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
presenting him now,

2617
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
you're not going to like

2618
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
the old comics.

2619
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah.

2620
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
The inclusivity thing

2621
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
that I've complained about

2622
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
and that everyone can play.

2623
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It's not just about,

2624
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
oh, they're taking

2625
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
white characters

2626
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and white men

2627
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
and turning them into

2628
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
girls or black

2629
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
or minorities or whatever.

2630
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's just that,

2631
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
regardless of race,

2632
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
let the character

2633
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
be who the character is.

2634
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Yeah.

2635
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Like,

2636
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Luke Cage is,

2637
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
he's a fucking,

2638
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
he's a fucking

2639
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
70s exploitation.

2640
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
He's shaft.

2641
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
That's who he is.

2642
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah.

2643
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And that's who he should be.

2644
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Which anybody,

2645
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
if you're not reading

2646
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
the new Luke Cage comics,

2647
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I do recommend them.

2648
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
They're fun.

2649
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
They're only,

2650
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
there's only going to be

2651
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
four of them

2652
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and it's drawn by the same guy

2653
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
who did Samurai Jack.

2654
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Like,

2655
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
making Luke Cage less black

2656
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
would be the same as

2657
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
making Thor a woman.

2658
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
It's equally retarded.

2659
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It was definitely,

2660
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
there was a lot of good scenes.

2661
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
The scene where fucking

2662
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Cotton Mouth gets beaten up

2663
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
by the girl,

2664
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I don't want to spoil it too much,

2665
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
but that scene was fantastic.

2666
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
That was like,

2667
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
had me gripped.

2668
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And the scene,

2669
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
like right at the beginning,

2670
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
where like he,

2671
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
the guy holds him up

2672
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and tries to mug him

2673
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
and he says,

2674
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
you know, you see that

2675
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
police across the street,

2676
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
let me give you a history lesson

2677
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
about why America is great.

2678
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I love that like,

2679
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
the patriotism aspect

2680
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
of his personality

2681
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
was really cool.

2682
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
He was like,

2683
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
he's a great character

2684
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
and I liked the actor.

2685
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
There was one thing

2686
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
that really bothered me

2687
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
about Luke Cage.

2688
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
The actor has a fucking mole

2689
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
on the back of his head.

2690
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And I mean,

2691
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
like he's bald

2692
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
for the whole show.

2693
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
He shaves his head,

2694
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
but that fucking mole,

2695
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
every time I see it,

2696
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
it took me out of the show.

2697
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Like,

2698
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
can he get that removed,

2699
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
please?

2700
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
If he's going to play

2701
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
a beloved character,

2702
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
if I'm going to have to watch

2703
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Luke Cage forever

2704
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
for years and years,

2705
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and it looks weird,

2706
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
like you can see it

2707
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
from the front.

2708
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It's a mole

2709
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
on the back of his head

2710
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
and you can see it

2711
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
from the front

2712
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
because it sticks out weirdly.

2713
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And I'm just looking at it,

2714
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the whole show,

2715
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
he's like,

2716
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I'm Luke Cage,

2717
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I'm really strong

2718
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
and Black Lives Matter

2719
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and I'm going to beat

2720
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
the bad guys

2721
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
and I'm going to have a fight

2722
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
and the whole,

2723
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I can't even fucking

2724
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
focus on.

2725
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
All I can focus

2726
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
is that weird mole

2727
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
on his head

2728
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
and I just want to take it.

2729
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's like Austin Powers.

2730
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I'm just looking at

2731
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Luke Cage,

2732
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
the whole movie.

2733
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Mole,

2734
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
we talked about Steven Strange,

2735
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
we talked about Luke Cage,

2736
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
we talked about Daredevil.

2737
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Now we can finally

2738
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
talk about comics.

2739
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
An hour and a half

2740
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
into the panel cast,

2741
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
we can talk about comics.

2742
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
The new ones from this week?

2743
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah, the new ones

2744
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
from this week.

2745
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh no.

2746
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Oh no.

2747
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I know, I know.

2748
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You see it on my notes.

2749
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah.

2750
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I mean,

2751
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
so last week

2752
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
wasn't really that great.

2753
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
This week is equally

2754
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
unimpressive.

2755
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And that's not to say

2756
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
that comics are generally,

2757
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
so they released

2758
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Spider-Man Renew Your Vowels

2759
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
number one this week.

2760
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And I have been

2761
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
so excited for this one

2762
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
because I really like Mary Jean

2763
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
as a superhero.

2764
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I like Mary Jean in general.

2765
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah, she's interesting.

2766
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
She's fun.

2767
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I think taking her out

2768
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
of the Spider-Man mythos

2769
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
was one of the worst things

2770
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
they ever did.

2771
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
No, like,

2772
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Mary Jean is fun.

2773
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
She's great.

2774
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
She's Peter Parker's fucking wife.

2775
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And she should be.

2776
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yeah.

2777
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But Spider-Man Renew Your Vowels,

2778
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
which was a title

2779
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
that they released

2780
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
during Secret Wars

2781
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
as, like, just a few issues.

2782
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And now it is an ongoing series

2783
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
starring Spider-Man,

2784
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Mary Jean, his wife,

2785
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and their daughter, Annie.

2786
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And I'm just going to say this

2787
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
right now.

2788
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I do not give a fuck

2789
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
about Annie.

2790
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't give a fuck

2791
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
about anyone's daughter.

2792
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I don't want to see anyone's kids.

2793
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I hate kids.

2794
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I'm tired of,

2795
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
like, it's a consistent thing

2796
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
in Marvel.

2797
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
All the kids in Marvel

2798
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
are really fucking smart.

2799
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
We get it.

2800
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Yeah.

2801
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
We get it.

2802
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We get it.

2803
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
We get it.

2804
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I mean,

2805
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
she's sitting in her room

2806
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and she fucks up her dad's shit

2807
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
because she's trying to make it

2808
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
better and she's crying

2809
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
and she's trying to make it better.

2810
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's like, I get it.

2811
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Here's what I hear.

2812
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Here's how I feel about, like,

2813
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
about kids sidekicks in general.

2814
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
There should be one

2815
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and his name is Robin.

2816
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I like Damien.

2817
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I mean, all the Robins.

2818
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
All the Robins.

2819
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Batman can always have a Robin.

2820
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Batman always should have a Robin.

2821
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Mm-hmm.

2822
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Nobody else,

2823
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
no other superhero should have,

2824
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like, a younger sidekick.

2825
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,840
It only works for Batman because I think like the character of Batman kind of needs a Robin

2826
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,040
But um

2827
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:59,040
You know, I hate kid flash. I hate Donna Troy. I hate fucking all the little teeny boppers. I hate them

2828
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,480
They shouldn't exist

2829
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,760
Fucking if you're if you're if your name isn't Robin, then you shouldn't be a fucking sidekick

2830
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,960
You should be I hate them superheroes don't need little sidekicks

2831
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,080
Robin is the sidekick

2832
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,580
Yeah

2833
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:20,300
Either way renew your vows like I was really looking forward to this one and it and how did you describe it insipid insipid?

2834
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:25,020
Yes, yeah, that's I think that's a pretty good. I just felt nothing. It was yeah

2835
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:30,220
Well, it did not leave an impact on me like I feel like it should have like the artwork was really good

2836
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:35,060
I loved the chemistry between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but anytime they brought in Annie

2837
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:40,980
It just fucking ruined everything for me. I'm a little spider. I pooped in my web diaper

2838
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:47,660
I have to have I have to wipe my butt. Watch me catch this this item in the most fucking

2839
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:54,820
Graciously a elaborate way at the kitchen table. I get it. You're a fucking spider girl. I get it. You're a fucking genius

2840
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:08,860
So you heard me talking about spider-man 2 and you and you heard in my voice

2841
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:12,140
How much the character of spider-man means to me?

2842
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:20,020
I'm gonna go here. I'm gonna I'm gonna go go for it. So about 10 years ago

2843
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:25,260
Everything about spider-man was

2844
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,900
irreparably ruined forever

2845
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:37,700
They took it all they took everything that was good and pure about the character and they flushed it down the visitors crapper and

2846
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:45,860
The character of Peter Parker to this day has not recovered. I think I feel like the entire Marvel universe

2847
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,340
Has not recovered. I feel like this decision in a lot of ways

2848
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,180
ruined the entire Marvel universe

2849
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:58,980
There was this storyline 10 years ago called spider-man one more day

2850
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:00,780
infamous

2851
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:04,500
infamously hated for for good reason, but you know what?

2852
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:10,460
No matter how much people hate one more day, they don't hate it enough

2853
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:15,140
They don't god fucking so

2854
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,820
Civil war

2855
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:23,300
The original civil war a huge plot point was that spider-man revealed his secret identity. Yep

2856
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:29,180
He joined Tony Stark side Tony Stark assured him that this would be the safe and right thing to do

2857
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,140
Yep, and because he's spider-man it immediately backfired

2858
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,140
Of course all of his enemies

2859
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,940
Because like one of the great things about spider-man to me one of the great things

2860
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:42,660
about the character of spider-man is

2861
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:47,140
His greatest flaw, which is that he's a bully

2862
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,300
Spider-man's supervillains hate him

2863
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:54,260
They want him to suffer like

2864
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,660
Fucking

2865
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:01,660
Killer croc doesn't hate Batman. I mean he hates them because he foils his crimes

2866
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,380
Yeah, Batman's just an inconvenience

2867
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:08,540
But like on a personal level because spider-man doesn't just beat up his supervillains. He mocks them

2868
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:14,100
He makes fun of them. He belittles them because spider-man was bullied as a teenager and

2869
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:20,820
Like I feel like an un-talked-about aspect of his character is this big flaw of his that he's internalized it and

2870
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:25,180
He's always projecting even trying to be responsible and trying to be a good guy

2871
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,420
Spider-man is kind of a dick. He is a bully

2872
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:35,780
He'd be you know and so his all of spider-man's villains doc-ock green goblin electro the shocker

2873
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:41,460
They all have this personal fucking hatred of spider-man and they want to make himself for so much

2874
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:44,540
So in that way, you know spider-man

2875
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:47,860
He creates his own problems

2876
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:52,180
Because he makes these these two-time criminals these would be

2877
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:57,740
Nothing criminals he kind of elevates them to super criminals just because of how much he makes them hate him

2878
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:05,260
Yeah, that's a really good example. Yeah black cat's a legitimate super. She was like a cat woman kind of a vigilante sort of a

2879
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:11,940
On again off again girl things have definitely escalated and now she's like an evil kingpin type. Did you ever read superior spider-man?

2880
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,580
Yes

2881
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,300
Great

2882
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:25,100
But that's kind of what I like about spider-man is that um, I think that what makes him

2883
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,740
Possibly the best superhero or the best superhero character in his own way. I think every

2884
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,980
Comic book character is the best comic book character in their own way

2885
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,420
But um, I just like the fact that of all the superheroes

2886
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:43,100
I think that spider-man has always been the most corruptible the most human he will always make mistakes

2887
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:46,900
He will always be corrupted by his by power or like delusions of grandeur

2888
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:53,140
He'll always have moments where he loses his temper and does something stupid and he'll always create bigger problems for himself

2889
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:57,460
And that's kind of the character struggle and what makes him interesting to read about so

2890
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:02,580
He he gets assured by Tony Stark that removing his mask and revealing his identity

2891
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:06,820
Will be an okay thing but because he's spider-man and

2892
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,700
Everyone fucking all of his supervillains hate him so much

2893
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,420
immediately it backfires and everybody starts gunning for his family and

2894
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:21,100
eventually like an assassin hired by Wilson Fisk shoots Aunt May and Aunt May is gonna die and

2895
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:27,100
Because he has a guilt complex. He feels like it's his fault even though Aunt May is a thousand years old in any ways

2896
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:32,260
He's gonna fucking croak any day now. You know, he's desperate. He goes to everyone. He goes to read Richard's

2897
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:37,620
He goes to dr. Strange. He goes to even even supervillains like dr. Doom desperate

2898
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:42,660
Please someone who's good at science or magic save my aunt aunt

2899
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:49,700
How do you say aunt? I've always said aunt. I think I'd say aunt. I don't know you're from Texas. Yeah, I

2900
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:54,220
Don't know it always trips me up. It swings. It does swing, you know, please

2901
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:58,420
It depends on their personality somebody save my aunt. She can't die. It can't be my fault

2902
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:04,140
I will be a sad panda if that happens. I think she's an aunt may for sure though. Yeah, but um

2903
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,620
Everyone says no for whatever reason

2904
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:11,340
Even though like, you know, Reed Richards could have cured cancer a billion times by now

2905
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:16,060
I don't buy for a second that Reed Richards couldn't have cured a bullet hole in an old lady

2906
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,260
I don't believe for one second that dr. Strange couldn't have solved it, but

2907
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:25,020
Yeah, Magneto

2908
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:27,900
But um, yeah, so everyone tells him no no one can

2909
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:35,700
Solve this dilemma finally Mephisto. He goes to the demon lord Mephisto the devil of the Marvel universe

2910
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:43,060
And he says you're my last hope. He signs a deal with the devil to basically

2911
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,780
redo this and

2912
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:50,900
So Mephisto uses his powers in exchange. He says, I don't want your soul. I want your love

2913
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:57,260
I'm going to take your marriage and you're not married to Mary Jane anymore the weirdest excuse for a retcon ever

2914
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:01,860
I mean the real reason they did this is because they they wanted they didn't want spider-man to be too grown up

2915
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,460
The editor-in-chief at Marvel. He said this publicly

2916
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:10,900
He wanted spider-man. He thinks that spider-man should be relatable to younger people and he should never be too grown up

2917
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:15,620
He didn't want him to be married. He just wanted him to be like a poor struggling bachelor again

2918
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,540
Which you know, which now if you look at the

2919
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:24,300
Opposite yeah, I can't they've gone too far in the opposite direction now, but um

2920
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:28,540
So he makes a deal with the devil to retcon all this horrible stuff that happened

2921
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:33,660
And a lot of people dwell on that they do they dwell on the moral implications of it

2922
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:37,660
Like spider-man would never make a deal with the devil. That's not my problem with it

2923
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:42,660
That's because like I spider-man his whole thing is that he's a very corruptible. He makes mistakes

2924
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:48,500
Of course spider-man would make a deal with the devil. That's who he is. I mean, has anybody seen the new spider-man Deadpool?

2925
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:54,060
Yeah, I just go on. Yeah, sorry. I'll get that but um

2926
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:58,340
Yeah, so I don't have a problem with that on like a moral level

2927
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:04,100
Of course spider-man would make a deal with Mephisto. That seems totally in character for me, but

2928
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:08,500
The problem that I have is the ripple effect of this

2929
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:14,820
Retcon throughout all of spider-man continuity and all of Marvel continuity it ruined everything

2930
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:22,940
Nothing for the last decade has made any sense because of this one moment in time

2931
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:26,700
That was clever. You hear what I did there because there's another comic

2932
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:31,380
Clap for me, baby because of this one story fucking

2933
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,500
so I

2934
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:38,940
Guess the continuity became that like he did unmask during civil war

2935
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:43,060
But nobody remembered it for some reason and people were like aware that they didn't remember it

2936
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,580
They just didn't care

2937
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:46,100
like

2938
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,820
Like he was not an Avenger anymore

2939
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:54,660
No, none of the other superheroes even knew who he was which really grinds my gears because that like takes away character development

2940
01:34:54,900 --> 01:35:00,500
For so many like different characters and aspects like there was always this like weird budding friendship between him and Wolverine

2941
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:04,580
That I always loved reading that was gone because nobody fucking knows that he's Peter Parker now

2942
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:10,740
Nobody ruins everything this like this like weird bonding moment with Jessica Jones and that one issue were like

2943
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:15,060
Hey, we went to high school together and I had a crush on you Peter in high school and Luke Cage is like nigga

2944
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,100
What and that was a great moment that I don't know how that fits in anymore

2945
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,620
It doesn't make cuz nobody knows he's Peter Parker

2946
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,980
They got fucking comics now to this day

2947
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:27,860
Nothing about the Marvel universe makes any sense because the ripple effect there's so many tiny little things

2948
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:31,180
So many little stories that you now have to wonder did they even happen?

2949
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:37,940
Did they do how do they fit in anymore because because nobody knowing his identity it ruins everything like um

2950
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:43,900
Like in the new Avengers comic nobody trusts spider-man. They're like who's this weird spider-man guy?

2951
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:48,140
We don't trust him. We don't know who he is. Everybody thinks that spider-man is like a weird guy

2952
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:55,500
Even though he was an Avenger for like a decade. He everybody lived with them. They knew he was Peter Parker fucking Tony Stark

2953
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:03,260
Meets Mary Jane and he goes. Oh, who are you? I don't know who Mary Jane Watson is Mary Jane lived in Stark Tower for like 10 years

2954
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,980
Holy shit, but it doesn't make any sense

2955
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:11,980
I read and it just blows my fucking mind like every fucking thing having to do with spider-man blows my mind

2956
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:16,260
None of it makes any sense. Nobody. How does Tony Stark not know who Mary Jane is?

2957
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:20,060
She lived at his house does she just not remember living at his house for 10 years

2958
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:25,180
Does he does he not remember this does he remember like someone lived this you remember that like do they remember that like?

2959
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:30,380
Yeah, spider-man was an Avenger, but maybe we didn't see his face and we didn't we never paid attention to that to his wife

2960
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:33,180
And his aunt who lived here. What wife what aunt we don't know what?

2961
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,660
Like even though spider-man has been like

2962
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:44,740
Like it's back to this like weird old status quo of like none of the superheroes knowing if they can trust spider-man

2963
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:50,660
Even though like he's been like an Avenger. He's been like the best superhero for years and years

2964
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:57,100
X-Men he's been on the fantastic for future foundation. I'm sorry. Yeah, like spider-man

2965
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:05,500
His tangled web is a part of everything spider-man is the lynchpin of the entire Marvel universe

2966
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:10,780
Red conning that one thing about spider-man had ripple effects that ruined everything and made everything goofy like

2967
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:15,620
Like spider-man's power his real power in like a meta sense

2968
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:18,820
Not not that he can not that he's agile and can shoot webs

2969
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:26,580
The real power of the character of spider-man his place in the Marvel universe is that in an unspoken sense

2970
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:31,860
He is the best superhero that is the purpose of spider-man. He

2971
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:36,760
He's been around all these years. He's the most fucking, you know

2972
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,340
Resilient the most, you know the most tenacious

2973
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,940
Every superhero he doesn't have the best powers

2974
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:51,500
But every superhero secretly knows that a spider-man got pissed off enough. He would kill all of them spider-man

2975
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:55,060
His place in the Marvel universe is that he's the best superhero

2976
01:37:55,060 --> 01:38:00,040
He could kick anyone's ass no matter how powerful they are fucking Thor Dormammu fucking

2977
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:06,420
Anyone nobody can beat spider-man. That's his power as a narrative device. Do you agree?

2978
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,460
Sure

2979
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:15,180
Sure, do you understand what I'm saying though? Yeah, I do. I do. He's the most important superhero in the Marvel universe

2980
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,300
Anyways, there's more spider. So because so because the one more day storyline ruined everything forever

2981
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:24,720
It ruined spider-man comics forever it ruined the Marvel universe forever. Everyone hates it

2982
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:31,780
Marvel kind of has to every once in a while. They released like a what if or a what if we didn't ruin spider-man

2983
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:40,340
What if we weren't the most a comically inept comic book company literally comically inept company that ever existed

2984
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:44,700
What if we actually appreciated and valued our characters and knew how to write them?

2985
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:51,820
So every every couple of years we get like this alternate universe just to like just to tease us of like what if like he was still

2986
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:54,700
Married to Mary Jane and what if the spider-man mythos still made sense?

2987
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,180
Yeah, they did that after seeker invasion

2988
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:04,660
Yeah, things like that. I know you're talking about. Yeah, so this is another like sort of Elseworlds kind of thing

2989
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:13,460
Yeah, where it's like what if spider-man was Mary to Mary Jane and they had a daughter and she had spider-man powers too

2990
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,500
What if that?

2991
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,140
And like I don't see the point of it

2992
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:24,060
I don't see the point of an out of continuity just to sort of like tease people who want this who want things to make sense

2993
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:28,300
Again, it's kind of it to me. It's just kind of like just pouring salt on the wound

2994
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:34,220
You know, I did kind of see it that way like at the tease. Yeah, um, but I mean

2995
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:39,100
I don't know. There are things about renew your vows that I still enjoyed

2996
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:44,900
But I think I already explicitly like yelled about them the chemistry between Mary Jane and spider-man are perfect

2997
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:49,680
Annie ruins fucking everything as usual. She ruins it all the way up until the end ruins it literally

2998
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:53,740
Ruins everything. I hate it. I hate her. Why is she in this?

2999
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:57,420
Yes, and that's that's it. There's nothing really to say about it

3000
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:00,300
I mean, it's just the first issue and it's just setting up the dumb bullshit

3001
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:03,900
It's just gonna be like a fluffy meaningless out of continuity

3002
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:11,660
Salt in the wound cluster fuck up. Ha ha ha wouldn't it be funny if spider-man still made sense, but he doesn't we'll never fucking fuck you

3003
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,060
We'll never actually do this

3004
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:20,500
Right, so it just kind of annoyed me greatly everything about spider-man sends me into a blind frothing fucking rage

3005
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:26,580
The new spider-man in general has definitely been that way for me like have you been reading clone conspiracy like actually reading?

3006
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:31,340
Yeah, that was next on my notes. I was gonna get to that, but I mean fuck spider-man is so weird now

3007
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:34,980
They've taken him in such a weird direction. They've just made him into Tony Stark

3008
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,420
Yeah, he's just a rich guy now. Like I liked Peter Parker

3009
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:44,500
Spider-man who is so broke they had to run after the bus like stay on the back of the bus like yeah, I'm like

3010
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:50,260
What is the point like wasn't the whole point of one more day the reason that you that you through this?

3011
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:54,660
Wrenching to everything and ruin spider-man forever was so that you could have him like be a relatable guy

3012
01:40:54,900 --> 01:41:00,940
Yeah, supposedly, but like now they've gone the opposite way anyways, so now we have the worst of both worlds

3013
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:08,380
He's not relatable and his continuity makes no fucking sense it so now he's like he's in charge of this billion-dollar corporation

3014
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:15,380
He's just Tony Stark now. He's not even Peter Parker anymore Tony Stark isn't even Tony Stark isn't Tony Stark anymore and fucking

3015
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:22,380
I've always hated I've always kind of disliked like genius Peter Parker where they kind of elevate it

3016
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,300
Like I don't think that spider-man should be a genius

3017
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:29,300
I don't think that he should be like Reed Richards Tony Stark level. It's okay for him to be like smart and sciency

3018
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:35,580
That's part of his charm, but making him out to be like oh, I invented ten new spider suits and I invented in the top

3019
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:41,280
Like he's in the top eight smart yeah, get that shit the fuck out of here. That's stupid. That's not what that's not why people like the character

3020
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,920
No

3021
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,300
He's charismatic. He's fun. He's relatable, but now he's just rich

3022
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:54,800
Yeah, and like you can have him still be relatable and still be Peter Parker without taking away his fucking wife and all of his continuity

3023
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,760
Like it's not his his his financial status that makes him relatable

3024
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,600
It's not like his marital status that makes spider-man the most relatable superhero to a lot of people

3025
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:10,600
It's his personality. It's the fact that he's a flawed kind of doofy dipshit who creates his own problems

3026
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:15,960
And as always seems to have bad luck, right? And so they just don't understand it

3027
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:16,920
I

3028
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,880
People who write comics don't understand the characters only I do

3029
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:23,840
I'm the only person who in any kind of a meta narrative sense understands

3030
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,000
I should be writing every single fucking comic

3031
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I keep saying that and it keeps getting more true with every comic I read everyone who writes comics is incompetent

3032
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,120
I'm the only one who understands shit about fuck

3033
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:39,280
I'm having a vein is gonna pop in my fucking forehead any minute now

3034
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:44,120
So spider-man is like a rich like industrialist fucking

3035
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:51,360
Lex Luthor type basically almost and he has these comics where like the Avengers go. Oh, Peter Peter Parker is

3036
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,240
Funding the Avengers now and and we he's like an outsider

3037
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,720
Even though he lived with us and we knew he was Peter Parker for 10 years

3038
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:04,400
He's like an outsider and we don't know if we can trust spider-man and also Peter Parker is

3039
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:11,160
Friends with spider-man and we all just buy that for some reason all the superheroes who really should be savvy to this

3040
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:17,720
Because Tony Stark did it for like 60 years this iron man's my bodyguard shit, but somehow they totally fall for it again

3041
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:21,640
Oh, yeah, Peter Parker's just this weird guy and spider-man is like his bodyguard

3042
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:27,120
I guess I guess they're like friends like how fucking dumb how much of a bunch of fucking dipshits are these superheroes now

3043
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:32,080
I have an appreciation for Tony Stark in the movies who's like, yeah, my man fuck it. What of it?

3044
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,440
That was brilliant that's like

3045
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:39,440
Don't beat around the bush like I get it like I'm trying and that's totally

3046
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:43,800
That's like this moment of like this aspect of the character that is so right

3047
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:49,640
But like the comics never figured out until the movie like once you see it in the movie like yeah, of course Tony Stark wouldn't keep it

3048
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,440
a secret why would he it's just yeah like

3049
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:57,680
Peter Parker being like a rich industrialist and like spider-man being his friend

3050
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:02,680
Nobody's ever gonna buy it. It makes no sense. It doesn't make sense for the character or for the continuity

3051
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:04,440
I hate it. I you know

3052
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,880
I was really sad when superior spider-man ended like I knew eventually it would have to because Doc Ock can't be spider-man forever

3053
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,800
But it was still

3054
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:17,720
Devastating for him to go from you know that to well now

3055
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:23,600
I'm going to get all of Doc Ock's like riches and his company and it's gonna grow from there in the wow

3056
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,560
I'm gonna be great and it's just it's not just this fucking

3057
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,160
It takes me out of it

3058
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:34,240
Just the fact that like all of these new Avengers comics that came out like when I was in middle school and high school

3059
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:39,080
Where they relaunched the Avengers and it was like spider-man and Wolverine and spider-woman and Luke Cage

3060
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,360
And that that was like the best lineup ever

3061
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:46,040
It was all these cool characters and they live together and start tower and they were like friends

3062
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:50,840
They would like have scenes of them like eating takeout Chinese takeout like with their masks off and like there were scenes like that

3063
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,600
Jessica Jones see and I mentioned were like we went to high school together Peter

3064
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:59,680
Wow, you were a spider-man all along like all these great little character building moments like and all like ten years of like continuity of like

3065
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:05,520
The new Avengers becoming friends and like all of that because of the the one more day story was like wiped away

3066
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:09,120
Now the Avengers like don't know who spider-man even is they don't trust him again

3067
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:14,440
It's back to this like weird paradigm of spider-man being the outsider and being this like weird guy who isn't even

3068
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:18,160
recognizable from a character standpoint as the spider-man I know anymore and

3069
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,320
like

3070
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,520
I'm all for character development, but just like

3071
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:28,200
Taking it in like the weird direction too far too fast is not character development

3072
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:34,440
It's just like a goofy it freaks me out and the one more day thing and it ruined everything forever. I'm just repeating myself

3073
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:40,600
I'm going into a fucking loop. I'm in a loop of madness a loop of sadness because you know there was this you know

3074
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,760
Fuck one of my favorite stories of all time

3075
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:52,320
Astonishing spider-man and Wolverine where spider-man and Wolverine they go on this fucking time travel adventure and they become like best friends

3076
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,000
By the end of it

3077
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:59,640
It's like this tremendous spider-man meets this girl in like the old Wild West and they lived there for like three years and he gets married and then

3078
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,640
you know and

3079
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:06,880
He goes back to the present and she doesn't remember and and so like he's lost this love of his life

3080
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:12,520
And the only person he who knows about this like side of spider-man now is Wolverine and they have this like bonding friendship now

3081
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:17,640
That's gone because Wolverine doesn't know that he's Peter Parker anymore. Did that like not happen now?

3082
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:23,520
Nobody remembers anything about spider-man or all this character development that happened in the 2000s. It's all gone

3083
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,440
God why why did they ruin everything? Oh

3084
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,920
God oh

3085
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,400
Boy

3086
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:40,000
Are you ready to move on to the next spider-man topic? Yeah, and after I get done with mine

3087
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,520
You had comics that you read that you wanted to talk about too. He's crazy. This is truly giant-sized people

3088
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:50,200
How long are we into this already? Well, I this is the only one left to have after I'm gonna talk about this next one

3089
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:55,240
At some point I'm gonna get Digi on here and me and him are gonna talk about Gwenpool because he's been getting it

3090
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,720
Okay, um

3091
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:04,080
Okay, so the last thing on my list for this week is another spider-man. So I you get to listen to me rage about spider-man more

3092
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:10,920
Um spider-man the clone conspiracy issue number two, I believe um

3093
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:19,760
This has been okay. I'm I don't hate this. I don't hate this now granted

3094
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:27,280
It's still like the you know the modern industrialist genius Tony Stark spider-man that I have trouble caring about it all anymore, but

3095
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,200
This is a storyline that is

3096
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,440
Steeped in some of the weirder aspects of continuity

3097
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:38,440
I'm just like a continuity nerd. That's I think that's why I hate one more day so much because I

3098
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:44,520
Am a fan of it. I get off on these weird stories. That's what I love about Grant Morrison

3099
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,520
he's one of my favorite writers of all time because

3100
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,980
When Grant Morrison writes a character he fucking reads everything about them that's ever been written and he like pulls things from like the

3101
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,800
50s and the 70s and the 30s and he like reintegrates them. Did you ever read Grant Morrison's Batman?

3102
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:07,000
Amazing what he did how he took all these like different incarnations of Batman and made them cohesive into a picture that made sense as

3103
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Like one complete character brilliant

3104
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,200
I should talk about that because it makes me happy and spider-man doesn't but I'm gonna talk about spider-man. I

3105
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,520
Like continuity and this clone conspiracy storyline is a story that is sort of steeped in like

3106
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:28,000
Weird continuity it all stems from this storyline in the early 90s this infamous

3107
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,280
storyline

3108
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:35,480
Called the clone saga and it's this it's a storyline that is

3109
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:41,360
Sort of has become synonymous in people's minds with this like bloated

3110
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:47,560
Overdrawn attitude of how comics are being written in the early 90s that sort of caused like the whole market to crash

3111
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,160
The clone saga of spider-man is what people point to because it was this long

3112
01:48:55,040 --> 01:49:00,680
Super convoluted storyline that went for like five years and it was all about spider-man

3113
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:04,040
Just getting cloned a million times and he didn't know if he was the real spider-man

3114
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:07,840
And there was a sky called Ben Riley who was a clone, but maybe he wasn't a clone

3115
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,720
But then he was a clone and it was it got like way

3116
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:16,640
Complex and convoluted and everybody hated it everybody makes fun of it to this day for being so shitty and dumb

3117
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:22,520
By the end of it after like 15 years of these these clone saga stories that everyone hated

3118
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:29,200
It was revealed that it was all part of the plan of the supervillain called the jackal and the jackal was this like weird

3119
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:33,440
Fucking green furry. He was just like a furry version of the green goblin

3120
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:39,960
And he's just this goofy character who just like he loves cloning like that's his supervillain origin

3121
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:45,320
Like other supervillains have like pathos. You're looking at me like I'm getting facts wrong, but I don't care

3122
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:52,440
Like other supervillains have like this pathos like that that make them like almost as three to three-dimensional as the supergirls

3123
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:58,160
Like two faces a great character or fucking. I don't know Lex Luthor is a great character

3124
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,280
Yeah, very underrated. Yeah, Poors and Ivy is a great character

3125
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:06,800
Harley Quinn has all the potential in the world to be a great character

3126
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:11,000
But they just turned her into the new Deadpool Harley Quinn was a great character at one point in time

3127
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:19,000
It's another can of worms I'm so glad you feel that way because I think every day about unleashing that candle worms on this panel cast

3128
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:25,480
Every time I start the panel cast I think it's just gonna be the week where I open up the fucking Harley Quinn can of worms and go on that fucking

3129
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,480
five-hour rage tirade

3130
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:36,000
Yeah, so like you know some supervillains are great and they have pathos and character arcs

3131
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,560
Not the jackal the jackal just loves cloning

3132
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:45,680
He's just and like even though the clone saga was like universally reviled and it ended and nobody ever wanted to hear about it again

3133
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:51,200
Every once in a while the jackal still pops up again with some goofy cloning related

3134
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:58,720
Scheme and I just love the character because he's so stupid. It's such a dumb goofy character. He just loves cloning

3135
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:03,800
He loves cloning like the riddler loves riddles. It's his thing every time he shows up

3136
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:08,680
I'm gonna clone there's there's a line in this comic because the jackals in this comic is it's another jackal story

3137
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:13,840
It's another big clone story and it's reaching into all the clone history of spider-man and

3138
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:19,800
There's there's a line from the jackal. He's talking to spider-man. He's sort of monologuing and he's like, you know

3139
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,000
I've evolved spider-man. I got into a little bit of a rut there for a while

3140
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:32,200
Cloning you and then cloning Gwen and then you and Gwen and then you and then you and then Gwen and then you for 20 fucking years

3141
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,080
but um

3142
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:40,400
It was cute, but uh, yeah, so this clone conspiracy issue is it's another

3143
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:46,880
Big goofy clone story which I have a morbid love for I think everybody at this point like the clone saga

3144
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:52,920
Everybody hates it, but it's also sort of become like the room where like people love making fun of it

3145
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,400
Like it always gets mentioned in the comics like spider-man if you read comics

3146
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,920
He constantly quips like oh, I hope I don't have to deal with any clones today

3147
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,040
And it's always like a little wink and a nod like it's kind of like when Batman is always like

3148
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,280
Periodically Batman would just be like I hope it's not fucking vampires today

3149
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:13,240
Yeah, or it's like when like a when like a when like a contemporary Robin says like a holy fucking

3150
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:18,160
Yeah, holy rested metal Batman like sort of a little nod to how campy it used to be

3151
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:23,360
So yeah, the jackal always shows up and spider-man always has to deal with clones

3152
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:27,240
And it's become like a kind of like a running gag at this point that spider-man

3153
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:30,080
Half of his problems are clone related

3154
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,480
so in this comic um

3155
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:38,520
The jackal comes back and the jackal has been given a redesign which is great, and I love his redesign. Have you seen him?

3156
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,020
If he was on the covers in the yes, um

3157
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,960
The jackal has always been a goofy character, but I think part of the reason

3158
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:52,640
Why nobody gives a shit about him has always been his design because he just looks like a furry green goblin

3159
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:57,760
He was an uninspired lame character design and they've changed him and now the jackal

3160
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:02,080
He's like a guy in a business suit with an anubis head mask, and he looks fucking cool

3161
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,200
It's very a star versus the forces evil is it?

3162
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:09,760
Yeah, well, I mean I haven't seen that toffee. That's what it reminds me of

3163
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:16,720
He's the one of the big villains nut. I love that show by the way, but go on go. Yeah, so he meets the jackal again

3164
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:20,920
He's like he's going around and he meets doc ock doc ock's back. He has a new body

3165
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:24,280
Um shit. Yeah, okay

3166
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,320
go on doc ock man

3167
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,640
Superior spider-man

3168
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:36,400
Elevated doc ock so much. Yeah. Yeah as like as like a credible supervillain like now

3169
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,560
like I'm excited to see that doc ock's back because

3170
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:47,560
Like again, that's an example of like character growth and how continuity is so important because it takes characters that you didn't care about

3171
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:52,440
But they can grow and they can become better versions of the cells and suddenly I care about dr

3172
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:56,440
Octopus I never did before and that's why you can't just have a story like one more day

3173
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:59,960
That takes all that continuity and flushes it down the turlet

3174
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,240
You can't do it

3175
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,800
So there was a big storyline a couple years ago where doc ock

3176
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:12,280
Dr. Octopus was dying. He was on his last legs and as his final scheme

3177
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,800
He wanted to kill like a billion people right and spider-man stopped him

3178
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:21,480
But then dr. Ock had a dr. Octopus had another secret scheme where he switched bodies with peter parker

3179
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:27,480
And spider-man peter was trapped in the body of the ailing dr. Octopus and died as dr. Octopus

3180
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:32,520
Dr. Octopus was in the body of peter parker. He took over his body. He took over his life

3181
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,040
He tried to fuck mary jane. He's coming. It was some of the creepiest

3182
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:40,520
It was really creepy. It was really a good well well written. Um, he fucked a midget

3183
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:45,080
You know imagine getting your body back and finding out that you have a gross midget girlfriend

3184
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,080
I would be devastated. I would

3185
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:54,440
That was like the most sinister thing a super villain has ever done. He stole peter parker's body and body and made him fuck a midget

3186
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,680
Yep disgusting. Wow

3187
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,560
They're not in proportion. They've got weird little it's not just that there's okay, you know, I'm gonna get off this topic

3188
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,400
All of your midget viewers are

3189
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,400
They creep me out. I'm sorry

3190
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:17,800
Look, I believe that midgets should have rights, but you creep me out

3191
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,200
Um

3192
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:25,240
So

3193
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:28,440
Dr. Octopus was spider-man for a couple years

3194
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:31,240
It was really good. It was a it was a really interesting story and like

3195
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:36,840
Spider like peter parker. There was still a fragment of him in dr. Octopus's mind and they were fighting for control of his body

3196
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,800
And it got worse. Yeah, and uh, but

3197
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:43,160
Like the uh, sort of the crux of the series

3198
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:44,840
was that

3199
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,640
The the experience of being spider-man

3200
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:54,520
Changed dr. Octopus and he slowly became more of a noble person until by the end of it

3201
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:59,160
This was so brilliant how they wrote this this like slow character arc. Yeah, where by the end of it

3202
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:03,320
Um, the green goblin is like beating up the whole city and dr. Octopus

3203
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:07,000
He's been calling himself the superior spider-man this time. I'm better than parker

3204
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,960
I can be a better spider-man than he'll ever be but by the end of it

3205
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:14,120
There's green goblins everywhere. He's beating up the city and dr.

3206
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:18,520
Octopus because he's become a better person because he's fallen in love with a midget

3207
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:22,440
That's how a bad guy becomes a good guy. You fall in love with a midget and she shows you

3208
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,240
the light

3209
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:29,320
He's he's grown as a person. He's become like an actual superhero and he realizes

3210
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,320
my god

3211
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:36,600
Parker was always the superior spider-man. I can't solve this problem. I am a villain

3212
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,160
And I'm an idiot and I'm a megalomaniacal fuck. I don't have what it takes to be a superior

3213
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:46,280
He had this moment of humility where he realized that parker was the one true spider-man

3214
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:52,280
So he goes back and he just gives in the in this beautiful character arc this moment of self-sacrifice

3215
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,920
He gives peter parker his body back

3216
01:56:55,080 --> 01:57:02,520
He relinquishes control to the real spider-man and it's a beautiful moment and it elevates dr. Octopus as a character and makes him great

3217
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,840
but um

3218
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,840
so in this comic

3219
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,440
it uh

3220
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,440
The jackal has found a way

3221
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,440
Not to clone people

3222
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:16,280
But to take their memories right up until the moment of their death

3223
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:20,680
And put them in the clones. So they're not just clones. They're basically

3224
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,960
They know everything that the person knows, right? Right

3225
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:26,200
but

3226
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:27,720
dr. Octopus

3227
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:32,520
Because the because dr. Octopus's body died a long time ago. He doesn't have the memories of doc ock

3228
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:37,240
But because the superior spider-man when he did the spider-verse thing

3229
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:41,320
He learned that he would eventually lose his body back to parker. He didn't know how yet

3230
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:47,880
So he did some sneaky stuff and he put his brain in a computer and the computer got out and the computer put his brain

3231
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,760
into the clone that the jackal made so

3232
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,640
it's

3233
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:57,960
Dr. Octopus the clone has all the memories of the superior spider-man

3234
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:02,040
But not the memories where he became a good person and at the end gave up his body

3235
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:08,760
So he's just kind of so he still has that grudge like spider-man. I took over your body and somehow

3236
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,480
I don't know how it happened because i'm from an earlier part of it

3237
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,480
I don't know how you got your body back

3238
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:17,080
But you must have done something sneaky and spider-man has this moment where like no

3239
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:20,360
I don't don't you see you gave me my body back

3240
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:25,560
You became a better person and he's like i don't believe you you did something sneaky. I'm still a bad guy

3241
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,800
Fuck you. I was the superior spider-man

3242
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,520
So he's so he has

3243
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:34,600
Just enough of that character development to be the superior spider-man still

3244
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:41,000
But not enough to have completed his little arc and be a good person again. Oh, no, it's it's sad. It's I like it though

3245
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,120
it's

3246
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,400
so

3247
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:46,360
So doc ock is back and he's got his body back

3248
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:53,080
And he's he has this grudge against spider-man because all he knows is that he was the superior spider-man and somehow

3249
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:57,720
He doesn't know how somehow parker sneaky sneaked his way back into the body

3250
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:02,200
So now he hates him even more and so this this this this sort of b-list villain

3251
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:08,840
Dr. Octopus has been elevated to like want to like kind of spider-man's arch nemesis more so than the green goblin now

3252
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:12,840
And that's pretty cool. So dr. Octopus is there

3253
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:17,000
Um, and he's beating up spider-man. He's gonna take the crap out of him. Rhino's there

3254
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:22,440
Uh, there's a new electro who's a girl. Electra can't call her. There's already an electro. How do you do that?

3255
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,840
It looked Trina. Yeah, um

3256
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:28,840
So

3257
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,240
The jackal has brought all these people back to life

3258
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:35,720
He's brought um, yeah, and he's given them a pill

3259
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:39,720
So he's keeping them on a leash because if they'd stop taking this pill their clone bodies will break down

3260
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:42,600
So the jackal has brought all these spider-man villains back to life

3261
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:46,840
But he controls them his his greatest clone related scheme yet

3262
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:51,800
And so he's fighting dr. Octopus and the jackal shows up and says no dr. Octopus. Don't do it

3263
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:55,560
Um, I have to monologue for a bit. Tell him about my plan

3264
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,280
and so

3265
01:59:58,280 --> 01:59:59,640
the jackal

3266
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:03,080
Take spider-man around Gwen Stacy's there. There's a Gwen Stacy clone, of course

3267
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,880
um

3268
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,880
The jackal is telling spider-man

3269
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:09,880
About his plan

3270
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,880
And he's saying spider-man

3271
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:17,960
Look at what I've done. I've eliminated death forever and spider-man. He's going on that lame superhero. You played god shit

3272
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,680
Cry me a fucking river. Yeah jack jack me off

3273
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:28,040
Um, but he's like look what I've done spider-man and he opens up a door and it's every dead spider-man villain ever

3274
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,400
They're all back

3275
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:37,320
Everyone who's even like supporting characters like captain Stacy and like, you know all the all these guys all these people that spider-man has lost over the years

3276
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:42,280
Um, he's brought them all back the hobgoblin the green goblin. I don't know if

3277
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:47,640
Norman was actually dead. I have no idea what happened to him after the superior spider-man. Yeah, but he was in the room

3278
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:52,920
So I don't know green goblin was there hobgoblin was there the fucking the the guy with the pumpkin head

3279
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:57,800
What's his name? Oh, fuck. I loved him that punisher killed him in civil war 10 years ago

3280
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:02,840
But he's back. Well, he came back in the venom series. Oh, well, he's back. They're all back

3281
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:07,160
Everyone's back all the super villains are back and also all spider-man's dead friends are back

3282
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,800
and um happy reunion

3283
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:13,960
Yeah jackal reveals his secret plan to spider-man and it's actually a pretty

3284
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:20,280
Clever plan and it you kind of as a reader you kind of buy into it. You're like, oh, okay. Yeah

3285
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,520
um, the jackal says

3286
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,520
spider-man I've brought back

3287
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:30,840
All the villains who've died because of you and I've brought back all of your friends who've died because of you

3288
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:32,920
The reason I've done this

3289
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:38,280
Is to wipe your slate clean all the blood is off your hands. I'm giving you spider-man

3290
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:41,800
Everything you've always wanted. I'm taking the blood off your hands

3291
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:48,920
You can be a free man now free of the guilt, right? But did he bring back uncle ben? Uncle ben? I don't think was there

3292
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:53,320
It's slight oversight on this part

3293
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:59,000
The one person who who actually mattered who who could have changed spider-man's mind

3294
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:04,040
But anyways, he brings everyone back. I guess his plan is to say spider-man

3295
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:11,560
Fuck you. I did something good for you. My ultimate evil scheme doing something nice for you. How do you like that?

3296
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:15,000
That's the kind of goofy retarded villain shit that I love

3297
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,960
Um, so yeah, everyone is there

3298
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:24,440
Uh, Gwen Stacy is there and spider-man's like this is crazy. You can't do this

3299
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:29,720
You've brought back everyone who ever died around me. Oh my god. It's a crazy conundrum. But then spider-gwen

3300
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:34,920
Uh starts fighting. Oh, yeah, she's not actually Gwen. She's spider-gwen. Oh, okay

3301
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:41,400
So um, so the Gwen Stacy clone starts beating people up and they her and spider-man escape through the vents

3302
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:43,880
and um

3303
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:47,560
Gwen Stacy says I'm not actually a clone of Gwen Stacy

3304
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:53,720
The real clone of Gwen Stacy that the jackal made fucked off with kane over here and they're off somewhere else. I'm a mole

3305
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:59,080
I'm spider-gwen from a secret universe. I'm blue. I have spider powers. Whatever

3306
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,880
Whatever the fuck and then it so they escape

3307
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:09,320
Peter escapes with spider-gwen and then it cuts to kane and kane is in another city. I think he lives in Dallas, right?

3308
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:11,800
Yeah, oh well houston houston houston

3309
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:18,120
So, um kane is in houston and is driving around his spider car because there's no web slingy buildings in houston. I guess

3310
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:21,240
No, well not unless you're in downtown Dallas

3311
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:24,040
So it cuts to kane and

3312
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:27,160
He's got the actual Gwen Stacy clone with him

3313
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:34,920
And that's how it ends. He it's the reveal that the the Gwen Stacy clone and the spider-gwen have switched places

3314
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:37,480
and they've

3315
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,560
Yeah, and now they're gonna bang

3316
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,440
I do love me some scarlet spider. Yeah

3317
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:47,960
That was one of my favorite like many runs of any kind of off scarlet spider because we keep mentioning him

3318
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:52,840
But I haven't explained who he is yet. He's uh, he's one of the many many clones of spider-man

3319
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:57,480
But he's the best one. He's definitely the best one. I can't recommend scarlet spider enough

3320
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:03,560
Yeah, he's he's he's all the superpowers, but none of the responsibility. He fucking hates the responsibility

3321
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:06,760
He fucking hates peter parker. He's like a misanthrope and he's a jerk

3322
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:11,240
He ran away to houston because there were no heroes there and he's like good

3323
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:16,280
Yeah, fuck it and he's sitting on the couch like getting fat eating cheetos and

3324
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:19,880
Suddenly like his whole life is just ruined by the news

3325
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:24,280
Because he happened to save some old lady who's trying to cross the street and an 18 wheeler almost smushed her

3326
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:27,320
And he was like no fuck her. She can die. I don't care. This is okay

3327
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:32,840
But of course, you know at the last second he saves her but in the process like destroys the 18 wheeler with his body

3328
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:35,240
And hurts the 18 wheeler trucker

3329
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:36,200
um

3330
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,200
And anyway, he's like

3331
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,120
Getting a fucking home old lady. Why are you trying to cross the street? This is awful

3332
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:47,240
And like he slings off he fucks off back home and the news all of a sudden is like wow

3333
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,240
houston has a hero

3334
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:52,840
We don't know what he is, but we're gonna call him the scarlet spider and he's just like

3335
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:59,800
I'm going to mexico. Yeah, I can't I can't live here anymore. Yeah. He's a good old boy. I fucking love him

3336
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:04,440
He's my hero. Do you happen to know uh, what the fuck ever happened to ben reilly?

3337
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:08,040
Does anyone know no, I don't think anyone knows

3338
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,600
That it's also convoluted. He was he was an important character for a while

3339
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:14,040
but

3340
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:19,400
That was a long time ago. Maybe maybe spider-man's deal with mafisto got rid of him. Maybe he just doesn't exist anymore

3341
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:23,240
Just lost in the ether. Yeah

3342
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:28,760
Anyways, I liked that comic. I am enjoying spider-man the clone conspiracy

3343
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:33,000
Despite all the stuff I hate about spider-man lately. I'll read it eventually

3344
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:38,520
There's been a lot of offshoots for clone conspiracy. So I've been a little less than inclined to try it out

3345
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:40,040
um

3346
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:43,800
But you know, I'll I'll still read it eventually. It's just it's one of those things

3347
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:50,200
Um because the prowler is now a thing in clone conspiracy is an offshoot and some other shit came out. I don't know

3348
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:52,360
so next up uh

3349
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,160
What else were you any other comics? Do you want to talk about this week?

3350
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:02,200
Um, no, not really, but I do want to mention that I hope eventually you do read them and talk about them, but

3351
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:06,840
Um, I've been obsessively introducing people to the legend of luther strode series

3352
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:11,720
Oh, yeah, you gave it to me, but I haven't read it yet. No, you will eventually. I'm sure

3353
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:18,200
Um, I fucking it. It's the fantastic trilogy. It's the best trilogy. I love it. I can't recommend it enough

3354
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:22,680
It's drawn by trad moor who did the all you ghost writer at least the first six issues of it

3355
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:27,400
He's done other things. He's been doing several avengers covers um marvel covers in general. He did the latest

3356
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:32,760
Not the latest the issue the suicide issue for a fucking deadpool. He did that cover

3357
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:38,200
He's done a lot of great covers. He's got great art. I fucking love him. I fucking I fucking love luther strode

3358
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:44,200
I'll touch his wiener. I don't even care. It's it's big and scary. I'm sure or or maybe it didn't grow with the rest of them

3359
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,200
who knows um

3360
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:47,640
but

3361
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:53,800
Let me actually talk about what it actually is. So it fans of kick ass or even fans who

3362
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:55,640
You know

3363
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,280
Expected greater things at a kick ass. I don't know. Did you ever read kick ass?

3364
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:04,840
Is that's all the movie the movie I read kick ass too and I did not care for it

3365
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:09,800
I don't think anybody did good. There was there were some problems with that one. Um, but

3366
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:16,280
uh luther strode follows a run-of-the-mill nerdy kid in high school who ends up finding a book

3367
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:19,960
That it seems innocuous at first, but

3368
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:24,760
You can derive power from it depending on whether or not you're capable of understanding it

3369
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:32,120
So he takes his book he starts reading it. He starts taking, you know advice from it. He starts working out next thing

3370
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:36,760
You know, he's a big buff dude who has the like the power to

3371
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:39,160
predict

3372
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,840
anyone's movements

3373
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:44,840
Like it's interesting. He can look at somebody and he can actually

3374
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:48,040
practically see their future in every sense like all

3375
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:55,240
Like it all means um, and it makes the fight seem so he can look at a flaccid penis and see a boner

3376
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:57,560
Yeah, and he can see which way it's gonna bone

3377
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:04,200
Um, and it actually makes the fight scenes all the more interesting

3378
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:09,560
Because you know, he can predict like bullet trajectories. He can predict them

3379
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:13,640
It's just it's a mess of things that he can do and he becomes so powerful

3380
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:15,960
that

3381
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:21,240
He basically evades death because he can will his body to do whatever he wants it to

3382
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:24,440
So let's say for example, he gets shot in the chest by a bullet

3383
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:29,880
He can actually control his muscles to such a degree that he can catch the bullets with his chest and just spin him back out

3384
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:34,280
He has that much control over his body. There's an entire scene an entire fight scene

3385
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:38,840
Where him and another person just like him just like him in quotations

3386
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:40,680
um

3387
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:46,360
He's trying to kill him and you see them fight and suddenly Luther like jumps over him grabs him by his head

3388
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:50,440
And snaps his neck all the way around like it's dangling between his shoulders

3389
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:57,880
But the guy has so much control over his own body that he defies death and ends up pulling his neck back onto his fucking shoulders

3390
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:03,320
And his find like it's it's an interesting series. That's full of violence and gore

3391
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:06,680
And I love it sounds pretty groovy

3392
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:10,440
It's fucking manly. I can't get over it

3393
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:14,760
Um, that's really all I wanted to talk about if there were other things to talk about

3394
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,880
I've already forgotten because these past two weeks have been completely forgettable

3395
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:22,200
I'm sorry DC and marvel image titles have been good cannibal was good

3396
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:24,920
If you haven't read cannibal yet the second issue just released this week

3397
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:29,080
Um, but I'm a baby boy. I only know about superheroes

3398
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:36,120
Hey images superheroes trillium well not trillium. I'm sorry not trillium fucking plutona

3399
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:41,720
I only know about marvel and DC because they make movies and I'm a casual. I'm a little casual baby boy

3400
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:43,720
Fair enough

3401
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,720
I'm a little casual baby bitch

3402
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:52,680
That's about the extent of what I had to say though. I mean, there's always more that I could say but how long has this been going on for?

3403
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:55,080
Yeah, it's about two hours and 17 minutes now

3404
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,520
Good good, but um

3405
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,040
Goodbye

3406
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:04,440
Yes

3407
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:17,800
Hey everybody welcome back to the panel cast it and I I fucking

3408
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:22,600
Woo, I just recorded a fucking three hour cluster fuck goes to the most heinous

3409
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:28,200
Wonderful addition to the panel cast ever, but it's still not over. It's still I'm still here

3410
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:33,960
Uh, I have another guest here's digi bro. Oh, we're gonna talk about going by the second guest

3411
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:39,160
Yeah, I had a first guest. Yeah, I wanted to know who the history guest is

3412
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:42,120
um, so

3413
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,560
Uh

3414
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:46,520
Wait, what is this podcast? This is about comics. Yes that one

3415
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:52,200
Fuck they like go through the rolodex of all the podcast. I I literally just like I just just I just like blew my mind

3416
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:58,520
Like raging raging about like everything related to every comic ever written for like two hours

3417
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:04,440
And now we have to talk about uh the new gwen pool. I assume you because I've I've succeeded

3418
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:11,480
I've actually succeeded in swaying some people to reading comics. Yeah in particular digi who's an all comics boy

3419
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:15,800
Yeah, I gotta say man. The panel cast has changed my whole life, man

3420
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:18,920
Now I'm you could you are consuming comics at an alarming rate

3421
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:24,520
I feel like one of these weeks you'll have read more comics than I have I feel like that's gonna take a long time

3422
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:29,720
Uh, you know, I've I've come to realize that you're so much better at this than anybody else

3423
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:35,720
I know who reads comics my my brother shade tried to ask our friend brandon tolantino long time comics guy

3424
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:38,280
Like, you know, what are some good comics and tolantino's just like

3425
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:43,720
I just read iron man

3426
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:47,000
We were like it's so impossible to even talk about or like

3427
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,400
Because I was just talking about this before

3428
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:51,160
um

3429
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:55,160
Even complaining about like a comic you don't like in order to get context for it

3430
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:59,560
You have to complain about something 10 years ago that you didn't like and then go back 20 years from there

3431
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:02,520
Or something that like some act some storyline

3432
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:08,840
Like 25 years ago that set into motion this domino effect that led to the bad comic you're currently reading

3433
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:13,400
So everything i'm trying to complain about turns into an hour long history lesson on this fucking show

3434
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:20,120
Well, thankfully you've given two recommendations that I I picked up from previous episodes specifically because they didn't seem like

3435
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:25,080
They needed that much context which were gwen pool and the vision because both of them are

3436
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:27,560
They have lots of other heroes in them

3437
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:33,960
But the stories are pretty self-contained and pretty much about those characters the vision ended you already talked about it

3438
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:39,560
Great run. Um, just bought volume one yesterday got my brother reading it. Um

3439
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:45,160
Gwen pool volume one unfortunately not out yet, but chapter eight came out yesterday. I read it

3440
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:52,760
Uh, it was it was okay. It was very cute. That's the main thing. I took away from it. Um, it wasn't super eventful

3441
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:55,880
No, um, not a whole lot happened. I mean the last issue ended

3442
02:12:56,200 --> 02:13:00,600
She was on the subway and the cops are coming to get her in this episode. She fucked around

3443
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:06,760
She ran away from the cops. She did some shit. She was gonna do something to blow up those squid aliens the toothed ins

3444
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:12,920
Yeah, and um at the end of it turns out she fucked up so bad that her employer doesn't want her anymore

3445
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:16,040
Yeah, and so he's gonna kill her but then she shot him

3446
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:20,040
And but then it turns out he's a robot man. He's not even a regular man

3447
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:24,360
Yeah, I mean the thing about this comic is that it's it's it's gotten to the point

3448
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:26,840
Or it's kind of spinning its wheels a little bit in that

3449
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:33,000
We we we kind of get what gwen's big problem is is that she doesn't see this world as a real place for some reason

3450
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,720
She just thinks it's a comic that's kind of her big

3451
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:41,720
Hangup and it's it's kind of been reiterating that over and over again. So now I'm officially as of this issue

3452
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:44,600
I'm at the point where I'm like gwen when are you gonna realize?

3453
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:48,600
Yeah, there was a point in this comic where she's like she was doing her, you know

3454
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:53,000
Yeah, none of this is real stuff and it was at this at that point in this issue

3455
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:57,400
I was like hasn't she had like the sad realization twice now already

3456
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:03,080
Like she's already had her character arc twice over and she's just kind of looping it seems like

3457
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:05,640
It's a little odd and

3458
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:11,800
One of the things that I I can't decide if I do or don't really like this about the comic is that gwen herself

3459
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:18,680
Is like adorable. She's like this super cute peppy young girl who does not at all

3460
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,880
Look like a psycho murderer like the way she acts

3461
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:27,720
And so I'm wondering like is that intentional because like she just so much doesn't think this is real

3462
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:29,720
That like in her mind

3463
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:34,840
It's like playing a video game like even a normal person would go around and kill people in a video game, you know

3464
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:38,680
But like she just acts so fucking psychotic that whenever her mask is off

3465
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:42,680
I'm always like god. She's way too cute to be this crazy, you know, yeah

3466
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:51,080
Well, like it's kind of weird because I think it might to some degree just be the art style that makes it seen that way because

3467
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:53,880
She was introduced late last year

3468
02:14:54,440 --> 02:15:00,120
In uh, howard the duck as like a backup story where she showed up and she's like, hey duck man

3469
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:04,520
I'm a crazy bitch. I got guns and because of the artwork in that story

3470
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:10,120
Um, I really got the sense that she was like an adult like in her mid to late 20s or something

3471
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:16,600
Like because she looked like you know a muscly abs having like a grown-up ass deadpool knockoff

3472
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:21,240
Then in her ongoing series because the art style is so manga-y and cutesy

3473
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:26,760
He looks like she's a teenager all of a sudden and I mean when she went marvels when she came over to spider-man's house

3474
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:31,560
And she like said that she was a classmate like it really kind of implied that she is high school age

3475
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:37,960
But they've never had a good there's never been a moment of like here's exactly how old she is, you know

3476
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:40,280
yeah, um

3477
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:43,000
So I've just kind of assumed that she's like 18 or so

3478
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:50,600
Based on the spider-man part, but it's hard to say. She's she's definitely like a weird mixture of a fucking idiot and

3479
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,160
Kind of a genius in other ways

3480
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:58,280
She's good at tactics. Not so good at morals and understanding people

3481
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:02,680
But the most important thing about this issue that I wanted to talk to you about

3482
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:08,760
Is how we finally saw the crazy goth girl without her helmet on and she was mad fucking cute

3483
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:12,200
Yeah, that was awesome. I was just like, whoa

3484
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:16,840
Who's this incredibly hot character? Oh my god, it's the crazy girl

3485
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:21,160
I had so Gwen pool has this co-worker this evil co-worker

3486
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:26,520
As part of her modoc organization that she sort of runs or ran until this issue

3487
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:31,400
Um called the evil eye and she's like a crazy witch lady with a stupid helmet

3488
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,000
Who says spooky things all the time and this episode?

3489
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:40,120
She went into her room and the lady was there and she was just like a normal girl and she's like, oh my god

3490
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:45,720
Gwen we've never seen each other out of costume before and like her speech was different and she was talking like a normal person

3491
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:50,840
And uh, she sort of played it up like a kayfabe thing like when the mask when i'm in character

3492
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:57,320
I go a little I go a little too far. Yeah, well that she like I guess the the mask like lets her

3493
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:02,440
See all this crazy information that she can't perceive normally and it just makes her insane

3494
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:07,960
But as soon as she takes it off she's just back to normal and she doesn't like remember what the mask was showing her

3495
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:14,360
That was adorbs. I definitely I just said the word adorbs. Yeah, you did adorable total sincerity

3496
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:22,440
Yeah, um, I definitely I love her supporting cast. I love bat rock. I like that bat rock isn't a comic doing something

3497
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:26,200
He's a cool guy. Yeah. Well, that's a that's the funny thing for me is

3498
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,920
When it wasn't until

3499
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:34,520
The evil eye took her helmet off that I realized she's from Gwen pool like

3500
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:40,280
For me as a new comics reader every comic I read there's always like a shitload of characters

3501
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:44,680
And some of them you can tell are new like if you're reading a the current dr. Strange run

3502
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,320
There's like dr. Strange. He's got his sidekick the uh, the asian guy

3503
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:50,920
There's the grand mask

3504
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:54,680
You know you can tell which characters are there from older comics

3505
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:59,480
But then there's this new girl who's like an assistant that he picks up to like manage his library

3506
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:05,560
Who shows up in issue number one and like she's kind of an important character now in this current run of the comics

3507
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:07,560
But she's totally new

3508
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:13,720
And now i'm wondering am I gonna start seeing this girl turn up in other marvel comics now that she's been introduced

3509
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:20,040
In this one and then i'm reading Gwen pool and like obviously like you said, uh, what's his name the the french guy?

3510
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:26,680
Uh bat rock zele pair. Yeah, he's he's like they like she explains to him that he's from

3511
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:29,720
Previous comics like he's obviously an older character

3512
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:32,680
I love how they're using him because he's just like this sort of

3513
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:36,600
Kind of forgotten about like old sea list captain america villain

3514
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:41,960
And they sort of like the way he's utilized in this story like even though he's like a sea listener and a nobody

3515
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:46,840
He's a veteran of this world and he's sort of the mentor to this idiotic teenage girl

3516
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:49,800
Would you say this is the most interesting his character's ever been?

3517
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:52,600
Definitely, yeah

3518
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:56,360
And and then but but he's yeah, there's these other two members of the team and like

3519
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:00,280
I have no idea if these these guys are have ever been in anything before

3520
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:03,000
You know or will they be in something from now because like

3521
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:10,680
The vision just ended and now all of a sudden the vision's daughter is showing up in other comics being turned into an sjw

3522
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:14,120
Yeah, I said my piece about that already this week

3523
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:19,080
What comic was that? Yeah, like that was in champions number two

3524
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:23,960
And wish I I literally raged about for a full hour

3525
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:26,440
Amazing at the beginning of this podcast

3526
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,160
Yeah, um

3527
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:34,120
Yeah, you always want when you read comics like this that have a cool little cast or they introduce new characters

3528
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:39,000
You always want to see them pop up in other comics, but then when they do

3529
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:42,520
Kind of regret it. Yeah, like you like oh, no

3530
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:44,840
I have a

3531
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:48,840
You know being new to comics and all I read the vision and it never even occurred to me

3532
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:54,440
That the daughter might show up again until all at once jesse said like

3533
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:59,160
She showed up and they ruined her and it was like within the same page

3534
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:04,520
That you showed me. I was like, oh the vision's daughter is in another comic. That's awesome. Oh

3535
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:12,600
I real I have already been introduced to the gross disappointment that comes with caring about anything

3536
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,920
It was a it was a sad time

3537
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:19,800
Indeed. Um, yeah, so anyways, I definitely hope that uh

3538
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:23,400
That this series like you know goes somewhere

3539
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:29,320
Yeah, I'd like and I hope that it completes itself or has like an arc to it. Yeah, or I don't know

3540
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,760
It's it kind of the the modoc arc felt

3541
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:35,480
Fairly complete. She killed him

3542
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:40,600
And since then it feels like it's it hasn't really gotten its footing on the start of this new arc

3543
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:45,400
But there's still yeah, there's like the plot threads that we need to have concluded are very obvious

3544
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,480
It's like we need to know what's up with ghost boy

3545
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:55,400
Uh, yeah, she needs to make up with spider-man somehow and like learn that this world is uh a real place

3546
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:59,560
You know, and I still want to see her origin. Yeah, and that too. We need to know her

3547
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:04,840
We talked about that not on a pipe. We talked about that amongst ourselves. Yeah, I'll like uh, it's cool how like

3548
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:09,640
Because she's been so unwilling to give us her origin because it's so overdone

3549
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:11,800
Yeah, that it's created this like

3550
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:15,960
Weird like reverse psychology thing where now I want to see her origin

3551
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:20,120
And I want to see like how the hell she got here because they keep like slightly alluding to it

3552
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:23,720
Like dr. Strange and that one is she was like, oh, what how the hell did you get here?

3553
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:27,240
And she's like, I don't want to talk about it ever. It's a bad time and I'm like, yeah

3554
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:34,280
Yeah, I want it. I want the fact that she's so adamant about the idea that she doesn't want to talk about it because it's clearly something traumatic

3555
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:39,320
Makes it even more like well now I like what was so traumatic about it

3556
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:46,120
I gotta know, you know, uh, yeah, it is a good reverse psychology. I definitely I want to see her be like

3557
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:50,760
Um a popular character. I don't know if she is or how well

3558
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:55,720
I'm getting I'm getting a nod yes from the person here who is works at a comic book store. Oh really?

3559
02:21:56,120 --> 02:22:00,360
Yeah, I just uh, uh, I didn't even know you had a guest in the room. Hi guest

3560
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:03,320
He says hi

3561
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:07,720
Um, yeah at the start of gwen pool eight when she's doing the recap thing

3562
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:11,800
She she describes herself as like surely the best-selling character

3563
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:16,200
And I wasn't sure like when I read that I was like either she's selling really well

3564
02:22:16,360 --> 02:22:20,520
Or this is a joke about how badly this comic is selling like it's got to be one or the other

3565
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:23,400
But I'm glad to know it's yeah

3566
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:26,040
I definitely hope that she continues to be

3567
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,200
sort of a

3568
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:31,080
Mainstay in the marvel universe. I hope she shows up in other comics

3569
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:36,280
I'm I want to see her interact with as many other characters as possible. That's kind of the best part of it

3570
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:38,280
Is seeing her

3571
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:43,320
Interact with all the all the established superheroes and stuff because she's got such a weird outsider perspective

3572
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:47,640
I want to see her hang out with deadpool because that's the character that she's sort of ripping off

3573
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:53,800
Obviously has to happen right like yeah, surely that's the unspoken thing that we're building up to somehow

3574
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:56,600
Yeah, that's gotta be like the final boss or something

3575
02:22:57,160 --> 02:23:02,520
Yeah, because like because deadpool part of his whole thing is the break in the like he knows he's in the comic too

3576
02:23:03,480 --> 02:23:06,040
So it seems only logical to have

3577
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:14,120
Them meet and bond over it. I mean surely she's aware of deadpool because that's who she modeled herself after right? Yeah, so

3578
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:20,040
Yeah, it's interesting how they have like deliberately not made mention of deadpool as if

3579
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:26,040
Like in order for her to breathe as her own character like we can't mention deadpool because then it'll just seem like

3580
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:29,240
But then you know, it has to happen someday

3581
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:33,080
So I kind of like that it's being I feel like that's when we'll know

3582
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:36,520
If the comic is wrapping up is when deadpool finally shows up

3583
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:41,160
We'll be like, okay, this means that we're we're hitting the uh the end of this narrative. Yeah

3584
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:45,240
Uh, she's definitely a hot sexy little girl

3585
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:50,520
And I want to fuck her and rape her and the whole grab her by the pussy the whole part where she was doing her

3586
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:53,240
like descriptions of uh each

3587
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:58,840
Like scenario like when she was describing what they were gonna do and the art style gets like really

3588
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:00,840
cutesy and like uh

3589
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:06,280
Drawn with like crayon it looked like and that was fucking adorable. It was I was like man

3590
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:10,760
I want to see this artist do more just cutesy stuff, you know

3591
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:15,240
Yeah, good time not a super

3592
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:21,880
Exciting or eventful issue, but still generally speaking a good series and a good time. Yeah

3593
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:24,680
Thanks for having me on the panel cast

3594
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:30,200
Oh, yeah, that was digi bro, and that was the panel cast. It's finally over

3595
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:36,760
I'm I I'm sorry that I did this to all of you. You could all go home now. It's done

3596
02:24:37,480 --> 02:24:39,480
Goodbye
