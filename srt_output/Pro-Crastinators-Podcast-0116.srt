00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Welcome to the PCP. Here we are on the Pro Crastinators Podcast. You all know what we're

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,360
doing here. It's me, of course, Munchy, and we have Nate here as well.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,000
I am metrosexual.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh, nothing new there. We have Mage.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It is I, here again, to ruin your day.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We might have been. I don't know if he's secured that deal yet. I don't know if he's signed that contract yet.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I am contractually obligated not to affirm or deny that I am here. Continue as you were, gentlemen.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
On our news site, we posted an extremely ugly story about how Hippocrit here actually turned out to be a transsexual.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Would you care to elaborate on that?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Uh, it's all true. The rumors, Avery, and all rumors, even ones that don't make sense, that's the truth.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Post-op, non-op, coin-op, give us all the deeds.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Uh, my trainer code is 182797624568 for my, uh, my trans-go-game-community-video-game-gamer.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are the, what are the three numbers in the back, and what did, what did datas expire on?

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Um...

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Alright, speak, speak, speak.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Uh, uh, hello. I, I, I am here.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Enough. Ditty.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, goodbye.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Moshi moshi.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Uh, watashi umai umai suika.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Watashi wa.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Umai umai suika.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Umai umai suika.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Umai umai suika.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Umai umai suika.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Umai umai suika.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Umai umai suika.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Umai umai suika.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Umai umai.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Umai umai.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Umai umai.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Umai umai.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What?

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Prosecut, uh, okay, okay, I must, okay, we're on the PCP.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You know, you know, you, you heard, you guys all heard, you're all serial viewers, and you all heard two episodes ago when there was that big old funny fucking farce that we had where you're talking about, oh, topics aren't cool.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, here we are.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There was that formless cast, Digi, and Davoo, and Tom did, and now we're trying it out here on the actual show itself.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We're gonna try and just kick it back in now.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So it's just gonna be laid back, we're gonna do an old, an old formless cast.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've, I've pulled up the, uh, urban dictionary definition of top list.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No!

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, I wouldn't hear it.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No, I wouldn't hear it.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's do it.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's do it.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't actually.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Aw.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That was a joke.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank God.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A medical joke.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I, I do not like the slant eyes.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I do not like the slant eyes, Digi arc.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think we're gonna have to take that back out.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Uh, I, I, I have multiple things that I've written down here to talk about.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Does anyone want to go first?

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I, I want to, I want to hear about Tom.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Did you, am I, am I, am I crazier or did you start playing Pokemon Go this week?

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Uh, I restarted playing Pokemon Go.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I did play it, uh, back, back in the day.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I got to like level 18.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I did my shit.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, okay.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, okay.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're not as much of a noob as I thought.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, no, no, no, no.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I just, the reason is like back when I was playing, they didn't have like raids.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They didn't have like the appraisals and like IVs and shit.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They didn't, and like battles like were fucked up.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The game was trash.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It was, it was broken at launch.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, it was better at launch because they had the, because they had the footprint system.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The footprint tracking system was the most fun.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That was super dope.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And it will never come back.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And the fact that it's gone is of travesty to me.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to let you know by virtue of you trying to act cool, you've actually made yourself

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
out to be a noob because you thinking that 18 is not a noob makes you a noob.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, no, no.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I thought that Tom was, because he was saying like, how do, I thought he said, how do I

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
get rid of my Pokemon?

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I felt like he didn't even know how to transfer.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I thought he was like level one.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought he was like just started.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And that was like,

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Can we talk about the fact that Tom just this week, finally at long last, actually started

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
living in his car.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And the most thing you were excited about, about what's going on with him is that he's

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
playing Pokemon going.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That is the most important thing ever in the group.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Like I fucking dominoes are tumbling to the Pokemon Go influence.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How, how credit personally.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I bet, I bet you can hit like so many fucking Pokestops living in a car dude.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was going to say his lifestyle is perfectly calibrated for optimizing Pokemon Go.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I bet you can, I bet you can hit 10 raids a day.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What I've been doing.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Car charger too.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It'll be perfect.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, well, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty silly.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So like I'm at home right now because I have a bunch of eBay stuff that like is, needs to

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
be shipped out.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that's what I'm doing today.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But the last couple of days, it's just like, oh, everything's closing at 11.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I'm just going to go do Midnight Pokemon Go for like two hours.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's just what I do.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Same.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, being homeless is so fucking productive.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's so, it's so romantic.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, I know you're around Boston, but like Boston's a city that kind of shuts down kind

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
of early, but maybe there's sections of it that are like open later or something like

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
stuff.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I mean, I think I was going to be living in my garage before very long.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, that's true.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's true.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, my, my topic is actually directly related to Pokemon Go.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it might be a good time to, to get into it.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Does anyone mind?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I mind.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I would rather elaborate on all the Pokemon that I caught this week.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let me see here.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I got, I got a low tad.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I got, I got a sir skit.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I did not get a low tad.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I got a lowland, a lowland geodude.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I still think back with you.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Didn't you have a lowland bullpicks?

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, but I would love one.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I dreamt that I hatched in a lowland bullpicks, but I'm so sad.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Only in your dreams, Mage.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Only in your dreams.

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What are you going to say?

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you going to say?

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So, so my title was everybody's getting back into Pokemon Go here.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I certainly am.

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I've been playing it a ton.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm loving it.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Some fucking cuck, instinct piece of shit just took back my gym.

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh yes.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Fucking bitch.

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Praise yellow.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Praise yellow.

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Me and Michelle are pretty pissed about it.

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,500
But what, what I want to talk about was all this talk about Pokemon Go and whatnot.

150
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,800
I want to talk about gamification of the human condition and how I think it's the only

151
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,640
way that we're going to survive longterm.

152
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,800
I think it is, it is a great idea.

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
It's not happening like everything.

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
It's so powerful.

155
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,680
It's really happening to like all aspects of society.

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,800
But everyone complained when they did that in China.

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Was it, was it China?

158
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Did they?

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Did they?

160
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,120
Some con, some Asian country instituted this like social gamification where like you

161
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,480
get scored based on, I don't know, like how well you follow the laws and like some

162
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
other stuff.

163
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Like if you associate with other people that have low scores, your score will go down.

164
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm into that.

165
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,160
That's a really, I think it's a system I can get behind.

166
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,360
With gamification, there's a real danger in the fact that like you have to make sure

167
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,800
you're gamifying the right things, you know, like gamify, like if we gamified like eating

168
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,120
nutritionally and like going for jogs and like, you know, things that will actually

169
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,760
make people's life better.

170
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
That's a good idea.

171
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,440
Like if we're just like, if we're just gamifying like the numbers at work, it's like, you

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,240
know, that's, I feel like that will do worse for people because you're turning yourself

173
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,640
into just numbers, you know, and that's like the opposite of what we want.

174
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,800
I hear what you're saying, but like every time Nate says, I hear what you're saying,

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,000
what he really says is, well, that was fucking retarded.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let me correct.

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,520
I do say it a lot, don't I?

178
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,000
No, no, those are all things that I agree with.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,920
But it's like, when I think about it, I think about how like, like human beings are hardware.

180
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,640
The hardware of a human being is really old and dated and it's calibrated for a completely

181
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,040
different game than what we're playing right now.

182
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,400
And I see absolutely no way outside of like cyborgification of ourselves to like literally

183
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,560
fix ourselves so we can handle it.

184
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,520
So I think what we need to do, what is so broken, I mean, for example, look at me, everything's

185
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
broken about me.

186
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,200
I would argue that like social media use is making people like more and more timid and

187
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,320
like not like social creatures, which we are predicated to being and that's creating a

188
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
lot of depression and people.

189
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,720
You know, the funny thing about that, I've been thinking about this a lot.

190
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,560
Like why I think social media existed and like what it's been for all this time, especially

191
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,120
YouTube has been for like people who don't think they have a place trying to find one.

192
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,320
But the problem is that people get on Twitter and instead of like realizing, oh, I'm a human

193
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,280
being, I should participate in the world.

194
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,840
They realize, oh, I'm like a this whatever the specific gender slash sexuality category

195
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,920
is and I'm going to hang out with exclusively those people on Twitter and assume that everyone

196
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
else is an evil monster who wants me dead.

197
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,600
And it's like it just I think it has the opposite of intended effect in a way where like, yeah,

198
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,640
people do find a sense of community and that's great and they start talking to people, but

199
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,840
they they talk to their little bubble and then they hate everyone else even more.

200
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,040
I mean, that's like that's regressive, you know, I've been weirded out by that because

201
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,080
like clearly a lot of these groups are formed by like superficial things that don't actually

202
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,600
make you a different sort of person.

203
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,680
It's just like a label that anybody could say that they're part of this group.

204
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,280
And I I've always wondered whether or not the people in the group like everyone else

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,520
in the group or whether they because like clearly there's lots of different types of

206
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,160
people like incompatible types of people that would be in a group and like be like, yes,

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
we're on this side, but they like why do they not fight?

208
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,720
I've never really understood how that they can stay together.

209
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
Oh, that's true.

210
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
That's true.

211
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,400
Well, it's just like in person, in person.

212
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,720
I mean, this has been said a million times, but in person, no one is as rude as they are,

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,000
like in a comment section or just online on Twitter.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,240
I don't know about that.

215
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,520
Way nicer.

216
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,400
And like, like, like, give a saying, like, I could choose to hang out with only my little

217
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,680
bubble of fellow transracial Japanese people.

218
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,800
But like, you know, I recognize that there are people who are not the superior Eastern

219
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,880
bloodline, such as myself, that, you know, have things to contribute as well.

220
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,560
And it's like, yeah, the forming of bubbles is one of the major issues that goes along

221
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,480
with this. I mean, you say I mean, I think the forming is inevitable.

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,160
I don't think you can not.

223
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,720
I mean, well, this is how do you avoid being in your bubble?

224
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,880
Because like, you're going to be you're going to be seeing the people that like you have

225
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,480
you have chosen to follow the system and so on.

226
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
Yeah, I think it's OK to form bubbles in small communities.

227
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,400
The problem comes from when they just reject all the things outside the bubble.

228
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,840
Like, it's one thing. Yeah, it's one thing to live in your neighborhood and be like,

229
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,320
this is what's good for my neighborhood.

230
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,600
But like, we also have open trade with that neighborhood over there.

231
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,240
We can exchange ideas and and and products.

232
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,360
But when you just close yourself off and you're like, no,

233
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
fuck everyone else because they're not us.

234
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,560
It's like that's the same.

235
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
It's every ism.

236
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,680
You're doing the same thing as all those guys.

237
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,960
By the way, nobody nobody laughed at my transracial joke.

238
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I thought it was funny.

239
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
OK, didn't want to interrupt you by laughing.

240
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,160
I got you.

241
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Sorry. Too late.

242
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I've spent it spent.

243
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm just I'm dead because I didn't get to hear you.

244
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
Well, get used to it, sister, because I'm coming in hot.

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,840
My joke was it's all fun games when the violin pilots are fighting

246
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,920
the in the Indigo infidels.

247
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,600
Yeah, the Indigo infidels, you know, the Indigo incels.

248
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
The fucking scourge.

249
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,440
I think the trait that makes you most likely to be either insane

250
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,120
or a common Twitter user is the idea or just the feeling

251
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,520
not so much a victim complex, but just the idea that people

252
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,280
are intentionally trying to make you upset, that people are intentionally

253
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,440
like making bad decisions in the world to make it a worse place.

254
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,600
So there's some sort of super villain out there that's in charge of all the things

255
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,000
that you don't like. It's called Donald Trump. Exactly.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And like, yeah, you can talk about your dad, it's fine.

257
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
There's like a super villain in charge of, like, you know, I don't know,

258
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,040
big GMO or like the Republican Party or just any of these social issues.

259
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,960
There's someone trying to make you upset, like, and that's not how it is ever.

260
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,080
It's always reasonable people doing reasonable things that they think is a good idea.

261
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,080
Yeah. But you know, I won't say always, I will say that with those corporations

262
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,680
and like I will say that there are some pretty evil like big corporations

263
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,040
who are who are a lot, like, especially in the like the food industry,

264
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,480
who are just lying about what is nutrition to fucking, you know, like the food pyramid

265
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,520
is cancer and that shit was made up by companies who want us to eat more grains,

266
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,080
you know, and it's not good.

267
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,560
You shouldn't eat that many grains.

268
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Cereal was a famous thing because like they just said, well, why not part of a

269
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,760
well balanced breakfast? Why not make people eat breakfast with this stuff?

270
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,280
And it worked. Kellogg's killed the whole world.

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,000
But I love Kellogg's cornflakes and I eat them every day, so I don't even mind.

272
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,640
I mean, so like these are fine points and it's true, like,

273
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,040
but what we're talking about is kind of like one facet of like social media

274
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,760
is something that human beings were not built to handle.

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And but I think like the way that we fix it and I don't have as usual,

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't have an actual solution or anything here.

277
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,640
But like like gamification at large is just like we like this is how we adapt

278
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,040
for our lagging software.

279
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,600
We we we test, we figure out some way to like make things fun that we don't want to do.

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Like like everyone in America is a fat piece of shit.

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,080
For example, here's how you fix it.

282
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Like a lot of people have done this and they've been effective,

283
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,320
like these running apps where you can like compete with your friends

284
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,080
and like go for high scores. Oh, yeah.

285
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,520
And and like all this stuff is good for that.

286
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,840
Is that is that a joke? Is that true?

287
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,680
No, no, no, I'm serious for a video.

288
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,600
No, yeah, they have these things like the the Apple Watch has these things

289
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,680
called rings and like the thing is you have to close the rings.

290
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,800
You have to do enough like exercise and stuff to close your ring.

291
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,600
And as you look at your watch, you can see them shrinking as it goes on.

292
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,280
And so like it keeps track of you and all your contacts that you accept.

293
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,440
So like you can challenge people and like, oh, like Nate's closing his ring

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,920
faster than me today, that fuck, I got to get back at him.

295
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
Well, I can think of when I hear rapidly right now.

296
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,120
All I can think of when I hear closing rings is

297
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,400
prostate and anus. And that's exactly what I was thinking.

298
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,600
I've never thought of that before.

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
And now it's ruined. I will never buy an Apple Watch.

300
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,760
Whenever, whenever anyone says the word Apple Watch,

301
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,800
everyone immediately braces for some sort of ironic joke.

302
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Like there's no way that is true.

303
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
Preface with an Apple Watch.

304
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
I just think Pokemon Go is such a great thing.

305
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,920
It like that's it makes me feel hopeful that, like, yes,

306
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,280
human beings are weak, foolish creatures, but we could theoretically come up with

307
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,600
systems that trick our shitty hardware.

308
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,080
I am so much more active as a person.

309
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,240
Exactly. Now that I'm playing Pokemon Go again.

310
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,480
But see, the only thing I actually leave my house and do the only problem

311
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,280
with doing it with with doing it that way is that, like,

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,400
you all stopped playing Pokemon Go for a long while when, like, it was shitty.

313
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
And when there wasn't any updates and, like, I think that no,

314
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
it's because where I lived was shitty.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,280
That's the only reason. All right, all right, same.

316
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,960
But I well, I mean, and that's a consequence for a lot of people.

317
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,440
Like if I mean, from the time the game first came out,

318
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,240
the biggest problem has always been if you don't live in a big city,

319
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,640
it's a far worse game. You know, so it's true.

320
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,160
We need to like Pokemon Go is a good first step,

321
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,920
but we need something that actually works for everyone, you know.

322
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,640
And like, I don't think the people who live in big cities are the ones

323
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,120
who were the most worried about not walking enough because they probably walk

324
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,560
way more. What they should do is they should make polling stations

325
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,240
at Pokestops so that when you Pokemon Go to the polls,

326
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,080
a special Pokestops. No, because when you go to Pokemon Go to the polls

327
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,800
and you vote for the correct candidate as sanctioned by the government,

328
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,400
the government pays Niantic and you get like a shiny dragonite for free.

329
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,040
And then the Niantic helps people take over the world.

330
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,960
And then it would be very far. Here's what I'm going to do, though.

331
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,560
As an evil corporate chill, I'm going to only put the shiny dragonite

332
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,440
in the Republican booth. So you have to go vote Republican.

333
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,400
Oh, that is the point. Oh, OK.

334
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah, that's that's how Niantic will make loads of money.

335
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
Oh, I see. And that is my modus operandi for some reason.

336
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm really excited for all sorts of like, even though I all I all joke

337
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,040
about Jurassic World Live because it's a Jurassic World Live.

338
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
And I actually actually played a little bit of it.

339
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,200
The way you capture the dinosaurs is you have to like control

340
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,520
a drone that shoots arrows.

341
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
It's fucking crazy.

342
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

343
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
Yeah, I know. Munchy, munchy, munchy.

344
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,480
That's that's cool and all.

345
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,600
But but but Jurassic World Live is old hat. All right.

346
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,280
It's old hat. It's it's the old walking dead.

347
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,000
The walking dead, dude. That's the new one.

348
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,640
What about the Harry Potter wizards?

349
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
What about the walking dead?

350
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,520
There's a walking dead Pokemon.

351
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,600
Glamon. Yeah.

352
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
OK, literally, what do you catch?

353
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,240
What do you catch?

354
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,880
I you catch a virus that turns into a zombie.

355
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,560
What if what if you were walking around with like your VR camera on it?

356
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,200
And you know how you can catch Pokemon like with the real world background?

357
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,080
You know, it sucks like we do at that legendary time.

358
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,520
Yeah, like you could you do that.

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,480
But you see zombies and you tap on your screen and you're like you're

360
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,000
shooting you're shooting zombies like in your field of view.

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,240
You know, and you like maybe you're standing on like the sidewalk

362
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,600
and you move in your camera and like there's so you have to go find zombies

363
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,560
so you can kill them.

364
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Like, yeah, yeah, why not?

365
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
The whole point of the show that you avoid zombies

366
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,240
at all costs and stay in one place and don't wander around.

367
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,360
Well, you have a small issue, though, guys.

368
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,120
I have a small issue, though, like how can I play Pokemon Go

369
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,240
and the walking dead go at the same time?

370
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,960
Two phones, two phones, two phones, two phones.

371
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,400
Can't afford like a drug dealer.

372
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,320
My fucking phone is literally unbelievably

373
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,760
the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

374
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,840
It like I can I can minimize my like Google Maps thing

375
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
and to get a little preview of where to go

376
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,280
while having the big Pokemon Go app open at the same time.

377
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,800
So I can do a screen.

378
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,240
It's on. It's like like I can look in the little finder thing.

379
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,880
It can tell me where the Pokestop is with the Pokemon I'm looking for.

380
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,280
I put that in Google Maps.

381
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,720
I like make that a small window on my screen while Pokemon Go is open.

382
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm on my way to getting that rare Alolan executor

383
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,120
while I fucking him, you know, just guide it.

384
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,120
It's amazing, so that you can sort of track where was within Pokemon Go.

385
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,600
Like, you just you got a shiny puzzle yesterday.

386
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Feeling pretty good. Oh, my God, you and hippos.

387
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,400
Shiny Minin got a fucking fuck or something. Yeah.

388
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,640
I got a little hippo that's what I said.

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
I thought you got a puzzle

390
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,360
and you said you would look boring and a shiny Minin would look great.

391
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
But yeah, today, today, I got I got three shiny Minin.

392
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,480
I went to London and I went fucking ham and it was too hot and I died.

393
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,240
There must be like way more Pokemon in the city because I find

394
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,360
like maybe like 20 Pokemon a day, if I'm walking.

395
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,120
Hmm. I was at Pokemon Go,

396
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,080
the procrastinator's podcast episode one hundred and twelve.

397
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,600
OK, well, I wanted I wanted to I was saying that with all these clones,

398
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm excited for the day where one day it won't be a clone

399
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,840
and there will just be more games that are set in this air environment.

400
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,760
I retreat this other day when I am tick is going fucking crazy,

401
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
advancing air technology.

402
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,360
OK, by the way,

403
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,640
that's literally what the Sword Art Online movies about.

404
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,520
OK, it's about them like building an air like overlay on the world.

405
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,440
Well, Apple has this whole technology right now.

406
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
They've been working on for a couple of years called air kit.

407
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,800
And it's designed to like have really like fucking dope air.

408
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,280
And like they demo it every year that they're making progress on it.

409
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,360
And the rumor right now is that because like they have like this demonstration

410
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,080
where like it just builds, you can like point your phone camera at a table

411
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,600
and just builds an entire like battlefield on the table.

412
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,240
And like it just sticks to the table so you can like do stuff

413
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,760
and move troops around or whatever.

414
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,320
And like that's like they're demoing it.

415
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,280
And the rumor right now is that they're developing this air stuff

416
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,600
because their next like big release they want to do is like a pair of glasses.

417
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,640
That's just air glasses.

418
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,440
Literally, they're making the Sword Art Online movie real.

419
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,120
That's literally what the movie is.

420
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
It's like I'm just I'm just excited for that

421
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,960
because we can finally game world.

422
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,720
We can finally have the Yu-Gi-Oh game.

423
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,400
We've all wanted since we were like, oh, shit, you're I will actually get into that.

424
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,800
If they actually make Yu-Gi-Oh with the fucking with the dual disc system or whatever,

425
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,000
you'll see me finally get into a new set of Yu-Gi-Oh cars with QR codes.

426
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,320
You just look at them, then they appear.

427
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,920
Exactly. I only want this if they rebuild it.

428
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,280
Like if they restructure the card game from the ground up

429
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,600
so we don't have to play with like the modern Yu-Gi-Oh cars,

430
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,240
we have to read like a fucking paragraph on every card.

431
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,040
And then read your whole deck to even understand what any of it means.

432
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,440
I retreated the other day.

433
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,680
But but but but Niantic made updates to AR.

434
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
I think it's just called Niantic AR because they're narcissistic.

435
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,440
And here's the fucking thing.

436
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,640
Pokemon, you know how it would just like like the AR was is just that it would be

437
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,920
a Pokemon that was overlaid on top of like, you know, a picture of what you're looking at.

438
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,160
Pokemon can pass behind objects in the real world now.

439
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,200
Whoa.

440
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

441
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Check out this shit.

442
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,360
Check out this fucking shit.

443
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
Niantic real world platform.

444
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
Pokemon can like pass behind flowerpots.

445
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
So you've got some guy standing right in front of you.

446
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,760
A Pokemon can pass behind him in the real world.

447
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,200
You can like detect where all this video it's it's like the end, I believe.

448
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh, yeah, this is fucking sick.

449
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,360
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

450
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,240
Whoa. Yeah.

451
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,960
It's like a minute 30. Oh, damn.

452
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,040
That's dope. Nice.

453
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,840
Lincoln show notes.

454
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,160
Yeah. Yeah.

455
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,760
I'll just put it on the screen right here.

456
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,520
Hey, did did did Shadman's Twitter get deleted?

457
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,840
No, he got suspended, I think.

458
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh, again. Huh?

459
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Again.

460
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,320
Why do you know anything about Shadman?

461
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,760
Well, I'll tell you why, because just the other just the other day on V,

462
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,920
somebody posted a screen cap that was and I couldn't be more in favor of what he said.

463
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,680
He said, guys, this is this is Shadman saying this, guys,

464
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,920
there are actually people in the real world

465
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,360
that believe that fictional illustrated characters have human rights.

466
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,640
These people are trying to fuck with me in what I do, despite, you know,

467
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,040
he claims he's not into Lollie.

468
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,560
He's not into any of the Gurosha he just likes to draw because it's funny and provocative.

469
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,240
And that's fine. You know, whatever he says, so I believe him.

470
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,120
But like who even gives a fuck about whether he likes it or not.

471
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,520
Yeah, it does not matter.

472
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,360
It's just utterly like I mean, he is saying and I'm just believing him

473
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,680
that there are people out there.

474
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,640
And I believe these people exist who claim that the fictional characters

475
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,920
he's drawing have human rights.

476
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
It's the only way that they can they can judge.

477
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,160
Like they just want that to be a law.

478
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,240
If they want to say that then literally every time you've ever drawn someone

479
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,360
getting killed, you're a fucking murderer or like people in that very thread

480
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,200
was being like, no, he like, for example, like he, you know, draws like lolly stuff.

481
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,480
Yep, he's a fucking pedophile.

482
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,520
And then other people were applying aptly so like, oh, just like how you're a murderer

483
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,320
for killing people in video games. Sounds right. Yeah.

484
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Sounds about right.

485
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,200
Well, here's the thing, Nate.

486
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,640
Like not only is there people that think that in Massachusetts,

487
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,600
lolly is illegal and it is considered pedophilia and you will go to prison.

488
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,440
Man, what the fuck?

489
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,640
You will go to prison if you don't know how to defend yourself.

490
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
I will gladly step up to the play.

491
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I guess all I can say is I'm glad that's not my thing.

492
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,400
Listen, Chad Base is in every.

493
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,120
Chad Base is Chad based, man.

494
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,280
He has every single right in the book.

495
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,040
Yeah. But Chad Base is the worst artist of all time.

496
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,640
I don't even particularly like his art, but he's just such a he's just such an institution.

497
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Yeah, like I think I'd be sad if he were gone.

498
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,360
I wouldn't be able to tell Shad's art if I used to show it to me.

499
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,400
I have no idea who he is.

500
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,840
I know he's quite well known around.

501
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,480
I've heard the name a thousand times, but I've never fucking discussed it.

502
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,720
It makes you a little bit.

503
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,320
It makes you want to throw up.

504
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,360
Is he the guy who draws those like those gumball animations?

505
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,240
No, that's salty, salty something.

506
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,080
Salty ice cream. I'm so glad I don't think I've seen any of his stuff.

507
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Salty ice cream is awesome.

508
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Salty ice cream rules.

509
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,960
Salty ice cream is a legend.

510
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,920
Yeah, well, anyway, I just I'm fully in support of all of Shad Base.

511
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,240
I don't think the salty ice cream and our fans will actually thank us for that.

512
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
Yeah, they probably will just go watch Shad Base

513
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,960
and then cleanse your palate with some salty ice cream.

514
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,360
Nate, you wanted to talk about Hawaii.

515
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
I mean, I want to stop here.

516
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,840
The guy who drew the the the the the violet fucking her mom porn.

517
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,080
Yes, that's him. Yeah, that's him. That's that's the one that I see.

518
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
Nate, Nate, I want to talk about my vacation I had recently, too.

519
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
So you go first so I can see him like I'm like I'm the same as you.

520
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
OK, did you already go to Hawaii, too?

521
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Did you already go and come back?

522
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
No, no, I'm OK.

523
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm going to many things, but I'm going to talk about an expo when you're OK.

524
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,320
Cool. So yeah, like so I just went to Hawaii recently.

525
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,160
You know, my my girlfriend's family lives there and we just took a trip to go

526
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,280
visit them and it was like a great time and like among the amazing things there.

527
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,760
OK, so like let me just say I was telling the guys before I didn't I didn't

528
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,640
finish my point, but the great thing about Hawaii is that it's it's it's a

529
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,320
full state in these United States.

530
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
So it's it's got all the great convenience of America.

531
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,080
I had an internet connection the entire time I was on this fucking island

532
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,680
and I was on Oahu, which is the most developed island.

533
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,360
But but still, like it was like Party Central in Honolulu.

534
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
It was like there was like the incredible, beautiful beach

535
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,360
like the most beautiful place I've ever seen in my life with the fucking internet

536
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,920
connections, the videos you posted, yeah, like look like, you know, travel videos.

537
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Like exactly. It was just like random shit.

538
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,840
You busted out on your phone on Instagram.

539
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,280
It looks like a fucking travel movie.

540
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,600
It was so beautiful.

541
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,760
And the water was like it's got like the low humidity with the sea breeze.

542
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,120
So like, even though it's like 80 degrees, it feels completely comfortable.

543
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,880
But anyway, like the great thing about it is it's like it's like got nature's beauty.

544
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,640
It's got the convenience of America because it is America.

545
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,920
And it's like 75 percent Japan, which is just great, which is just great.

546
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,240
Because they've got this is what I'm going to tourists.

547
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,480
Tourists, right? Yeah.

548
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,440
Like the Japanese, like they swarmed that place.

549
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,640
They they love. So so Ragon for Hawaii.

550
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
Is that is that what we're talking about right now?

551
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,480
Hawaii. Well, we literally should.

552
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,040
I got to say just the prospect that people live there

553
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,520
and the idea that just for some amount of worthless currency,

554
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,320
I could also just live there.

555
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,840
It just seems like the only logical thing to do with one's life.

556
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,440
But but the biggest thing that I like miss

557
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,560
ties into my time in Tokyo years ago, and it's the food and like the smells

558
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,440
and like just having like takoyaki stands and and being able to go to like ramen places.

559
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,600
You mean like not even like it's like Asians, right?

560
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,240
Like it just is Japanese food.

561
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,360
That yeah, it just straight up like is Japan a lot of the island.

562
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
It's so. Oh, my God. Yeah.

563
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,720
I mean, honestly, where I live in Boston,

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,520
there's like it's probably like 80 percent Asians here.

565
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,600
And sometimes it does feel like I'm just in like not not in any specific Asian country,

566
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,240
just in all of Asia, like one little microcosm because you know,

567
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,040
they're all the same. They start to blend together.

568
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,080
Well, Michelle, no, because like we were just at an Asian grocery store

569
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,080
that literally is in a plaza that has like a Thai place, a Japanese place,

570
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,560
a Korean place, a Chinese place and a Vietnamese place.

571
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Like I don't know if I said that already.

572
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,760
All surrounding an Asian grocery store.

573
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,880
And that is the entire. So it's just like you go there and it's like,

574
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,200
here's all of Asia in one fucking.

575
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,440
Like I'm not only useful parts of the Asian country.

576
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Yeah, I'm not a true.

577
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,520
I'm not a true weed.

578
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,400
But the more time I spend around Asian shit,

579
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,360
the more we've I become because it's just better.

580
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
It's just better. It's just infections.

581
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
It gets under your skin.

582
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,080
It's right. It's right.

583
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,480
You fucking redpilled me so hard in Boston.

584
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,680
Last time we were together, you reckoned me so hard.

585
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,720
Having actual ramen.

586
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,120
Oh, God.

587
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,960
It blew my mind to have like I still haven't experienced this yet.

588
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,040
You guys got to go.

589
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,680
Do you know, I have been to some ramen places.

590
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,800
I have been to some ramen places that, frankly, suck dick.

591
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,600
And maybe I have to actually like ramen is like really hit and miss.

592
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,360
But when you get ramen, it's fucking unbelievable.

593
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,120
It's unbelievable.

594
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,400
You get that real Naruto shit, my dude.

595
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,040
It's just you got to get that little that little Naruto Maki in there.

596
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,080
The little spirally fish cake.

597
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,800
Yeah, dog shout out to local business.

598
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Tajie East Village ramen over here in San Diego.

599
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,640
Fucking go there if you're in the area. It's so cool.

600
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,400
Actually, last time I was there, I think I said about this in chat.

601
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,520
I was I eavesdropped on two people who were eating behind me.

602
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,080
And they were two people who were like the marketing agents of like a mobile game.

603
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,240
And they talked about how easy it was to manipulate

604
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,960
YouTubers to advertising their mobile game for no money.

605
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,800
Hell, yeah, they were for Naruto online.

606
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,480
Probably do. Oh my god.

607
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,240
Eating fucking just stuffing their face.

608
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,160
They were doing they were doing field.

609
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,160
Oh my god. They were doing field research.

610
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,800
Holy shit. That's all we want to sell Naruto.

611
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,440
We got to think like Naruto.

612
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,600
You guys saw the images I posted last year in in Philly from the like

613
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,680
we went to a ramen shop that literally was like full of Naruto iconography.

614
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,200
Hell, yes. Hell, yes.

615
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,520
It's so happen to be in Chinatown in Philly.

616
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,800
There's a keep a look out for a place that has like a what a Luffy drawn on a sign.

617
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
One time I went.

618
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,880
Actually, why did you specifically mention Naruto online?

619
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,280
Did they like try to give you a bad deal?

620
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,680
Did they they they literally have worked with like every anime?

621
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,080
Yeah, they have. And most of them I never got a deal.

622
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,320
I mean, you get like it's a they give you like four grand.

623
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,440
It's not a bad deal.

624
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,440
But like I don't want to fucking show Naruto online.

625
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,600
The dead game is so shitty, though.

626
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,680
Yeah, well, tell that to Jeff do who made a whole video about how it's kind of OK, guys.

627
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,640
Naruto online is not terrible.

628
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,040
I played it for one hour and would never play it again.

629
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,120
But it's not terrible.

630
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,200
Will you buy it so I could make more grand?

631
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
The guys who I was addressing are not even malicious.

632
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
They're just like, yeah, like I can't believe how easy it is.

633
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,040
Like they'll just do any guy.

634
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,600
You know what? Let's talk about this.

635
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,840
Let's talk about and you guys are part of this problem.

636
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,040
Let's talk about how the millennial generation

637
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,720
has the lowest idea of what their standard of life should be ideally

638
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,000
of like any generation in history.

639
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,840
No, no, well, well, I better take Ben for example.

640
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,200
My my standard of living is lower even than that.

641
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,960
I don't I don't I don't think Ben has any problems with understanding that.

642
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,360
I think it's just that Ben legit doesn't give a fuck.

643
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,120
Like Ben is right because most most millennials are like sad about being.

644
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,160
Yeah, or like Ben is not.

645
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,240
He was like, oh, I can not work and live off of peanuts.

646
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,120
That sounds like I have a room that I can live in.

647
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm I'm set. I'm done.

648
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,280
Let's talk about that.

649
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,680
That's that's about just we don't have to get into it too deep.

650
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,400
But a Gretzko, I was really thinking about a Gretzko reason

651
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,560
because I watched a bunch of episodes.

652
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm going to finish it soon.

653
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,080
But like a Gretzko is the perfect picture of like a millennial,

654
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,800
even in America, because what she is is she is like she she chooses

655
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,040
to work this white collar job that she hates.

656
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,960
Like she's she's kind of punk in that she, you know,

657
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,400
like rebels that she hates the system and all that, but she is still 100 percent

658
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,280
complicit, a true like 80s or 70s punk would just not work there and like be poor.

659
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,200
But she willingly goes back day in day to suffer and to punish herself in this life.

660
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,280
I just got to get my my poker coins.

661
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,080
Well, I think the big part of it is that like most of these young people,

662
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,000
they just think that they have no options because they just they just go down

663
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,400
the list of like what jobs are in the area and they sign up for like whatever.

664
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,040
But like you got to be just too many people are too picky about what jobs they'll take.

665
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,400
It's like you can just go do road work or go farm or something.

666
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Like those jobs pay decently and they have openings.

667
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,640
Nobody wants to do them.

668
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,040
But like guess what?

669
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,600
No matter what job you get, it's going to fucking suck.

670
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,880
And if you get a job at like Target or something,

671
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,040
they're just going to overwork you to death and they're not going to care about you.

672
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,080
They're going to fire you as soon as you don't pull numbers.

673
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,440
And it's like, yeah, you need to just don't worry about what the job is.

674
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,240
Just do the job that pays decently and will like pick the one that is physical labor

675
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,560
because it'll put you in better health.

676
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,960
You know, like, that's true.

677
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,320
Don't get a fucking white collar job working for pieces of shit

678
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,240
because you're just going to hate yourself become another average

679
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,920
obese American and hate your life and just be unhappy in all kinds of ways.

680
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,600
Physical labor actually makes you less depressed.

681
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,440
It really does.

682
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,080
Oh, I believe labor is is like it's like a cheat code

683
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,040
that people are sort of shied away from.

684
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,640
And I don't know why that's what I do every time.

685
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,200
Every time like my dad's a drummer and every so often he has a gig

686
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,320
and he's got a big old drum set and he needs help carrying it

687
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,960
from wherever it's stored into his car and, you know, guitar amps and stuff.

688
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,760
He does gigs.

689
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,480
So like I sometimes help us like a roadie picking up heavy things

690
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,400
and moving them around.

691
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,840
And it's like, yeah, this is this is really fun.

692
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,520
This is really I feel I feel so helpful right now.

693
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,280
I love doing this.

694
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,920
In spite of what I just said about Target, the one thing I did

695
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,920
like when I worked there was that I was on the flow team,

696
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,000
which is basically just move boxes around.

697
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,640
And like I gained a lot of muscle mass doing that.

698
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,520
And as a result, I was yeah, I was just stronger and fitter

699
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,600
just from doing like this incredibly basic and granted.

700
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,720
Like that's not the best way to get that fitness.

701
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,920
But like it made me appreciate the idea of like, man, having a physical

702
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,480
element to your job is just going to make your life better.

703
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,520
It's like doing chores around the house.

704
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,400
Like I love chores that demand a great amount of physical strength

705
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,600
and an endurance.

706
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,320
What sort of demands that?

707
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,360
Well, like my mom would need help digging stuff in the garden.

708
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,080
She she does gardening sometimes.

709
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,520
So I'm like, OK, there's a there's a tree stump.

710
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,480
Can you help dig it out?

711
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,000
Sure, I'll get the sledgehammer.

712
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,840
I'll get the pickaxe.

713
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,400
I'll get the fucking everything.

714
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,360
I'll smash that.

715
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,240
But if I have to like wash dishes, that's less as fun because you're just,

716
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,600
you know, they're not it's not very hard to move dishes.

717
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,040
And dusting, I've hated ever since like I was a little boy that was like,

718
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,840
you know, little baby kids chores that little baby kids can do.

719
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,720
And it was always like polishing and dusting.

720
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,640
And they were the fucking worst because you you have to be very delicate

721
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,920
to move in your little duster around.

722
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,760
I fucking hate it. Does anyone do any of you actually dust?

723
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,360
And no, no, no, no.

724
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,240
Does anybody ever do that?

725
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,280
It's just I only does my entire room around.

726
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,160
I have to I have to dust.

727
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,640
I don't do it too often.

728
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:44,440
But my boyfriend's allergic to dust and pollen and stuff like that.

729
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,320
So that's fair enough.

730
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,280
You know, I worked at at Pier One, doing like building furniture and stuff.

731
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,120
And that was a pretty physical job.

732
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,600
The only downside about it is like, like this was when I was starting

733
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,640
Best Guy Ever and like I was working on the the girl in login videos.

734
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,480
And it was this girl in login part one at that time.

735
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,640
Like I would I would do that.

736
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,880
I would go to work all day.

737
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,000
I like a couple of days a week I had school and then I would like come home

738
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,440
and try to work on like the videos and stuff.

739
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,040
And it's like it really does tax you physically a lot.

740
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
And so like I mean, that's a lot on the side.

741
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,680
It's tough. Yeah.

742
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,320
And I will I will say that that that with the target job, too,

743
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
because I was that was when I first started my YouTube channel

744
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,920
and I was doing two videos a week.

745
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,920
And it was some days I'd come home and it doesn't help.

746
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,680
I worked from like 4 a.m. to 12 was my hours.

747
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,120
So like I'd come home and just fucking crash and be like,

748
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,880
I can't even do a video because like how am I supposed to think my body is done?

749
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
You know, but you just got to overcome.

750
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,960
Just cheat your body with caffeine and beef to work or quit.

751
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,600
I had one summer I had a I had a job doing physical labor.

752
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
It was working with these.

753
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,720
It was like a temporary job with these guys with a truck were up from Alabama.

754
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,920
And their business was going to nursing homes and loading boxes,

755
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,960
mostly of like documents and loading boxes into their truck

756
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,880
and taking them to storage facilities.

757
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,520
So it was just a lot of lifting boxes and putting it into the truck.

758
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,280
Now, the job itself was pretty all right.

759
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,760
But the people that I had to do it with were very disturbing.

760
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,200
All right, the old folks, right?

761
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
They did not work at an old folks home.

762
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,040
They were just they work with all people that will destroy.

763
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,200
No, no, no, they don't.

764
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,800
No, no, no, that wasn't it.

765
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,800
They these guys were just being contracted by the nursing homes

766
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,760
for this one job of shipping shit.

767
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,600
It was a it was like an old maybe 50 something guy

768
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,560
and his son-in-law or his prospective son-in-law.

769
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,400
The guy was marrying the guy's daughter

770
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,040
and he was like marrying into this fucking own a truck business, basically.

771
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,040
So the older guy was grooming him and they were these two racist ass

772
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,000
Alabama. Oh, yeah, no, listen, they would just casually throw out

773
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,760
fucking slurs like at people like it within our field.

774
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,960
Alabama is like that's a scary.

775
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,920
I think that we drive by a black person

776
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,680
and they'd like say some shit about it.

777
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,120
And I'd be like, is this is this is this real?

778
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,440
Well, I have to ask Ben, these guys are white, right?

779
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,160
They they are. Oh, yeah, of course.

780
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,080
OK, just check. Just check.

781
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,120
So and I was like, and I think they could tell

782
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,640
that I was really uncomfortable with it and I thought that was really funny.

783
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,160
They were like, they were like the month.

784
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,360
Yeah, true.

785
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,280
And so the other I think they just kind of like,

786
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,360
you know, they just like said more shit and like kind of chuckled

787
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,040
because I was like, do something about a pussy.

788
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,320
Defend the the the Negro race.

789
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,640
Why don't you already?

790
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,360
I won't. I won't.

791
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,600
And the other two guys that I worked with, they were they were younger guys.

792
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,000
They were cousins of each other and they were like these two, you know,

793
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
they were like lower class like white dudes and like one of them.

794
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,320
I don't know, they were just they were like one was like fat and like

795
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,360
and kind of just kind of looked a bit like an ogre.

796
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,120
And the other was like skinny and like had like a fucking dome.

797
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,480
He had a big old dome head.

798
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,800
Are you sure it wasn't Ben and Munchy is what I mean?

799
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,320
And they and they and they were just saying, I don't know,

800
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,960
they just say funny shit like I was like one.

801
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,560
OK, the the the the the guy with the dome head.

802
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,960
One time he's like, hey, you're a scientist, right?

803
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,160
Like you do science because I was and I was like, oh, yeah.

804
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,280
So he like he tilts his head down and he points it like a rash on his head.

805
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,400
And he's like, I spilled some chemicals on my head.

806
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,360
And as you can see, and as you can, and as you can see,

807
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,160
my fucking skin is flaking off and my hair is falling out.

808
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,440
Do you think that's permanent?

809
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,240
And I was like, I don't do that kind of science, my dog.

810
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,680
Ben, I have to make a recommendation for you chemicals from you with your magic.

811
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,840
Ben, I recommend you read this book called

812
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,720
it's a manga called Disappearance Diary by Hideo Azuma,

813
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,120
who was like a famous lolly con manga artist in the 70s.

814
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,360
And then he he had basically this book is a autobiography

815
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,400
about two times that he just decided to be homeless,

816
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,960
to run away from his family, that he his family as in his kids and wife.

817
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,440
Oh, oh, no, run away to go be homeless for like a month at a time.

818
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,200
And then a third time where he ran off to go get a job

819
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,000
working for like like plumbing services or something like that.

820
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,760
So they're like they're on a bio.

821
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
Yeah, it's just his.

822
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,560
But it's presented as very cheerful and like upbeat

823
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,800
because his the tone of it is he says, I want to present the story,

824
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,600
but without the dark parts.

825
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,840
So it's just like him being like, oh, yeah, I'm homeless.

826
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,280
And like, oh, I found some stuff.

827
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,200
But like, it's very clear that this is really fucked

828
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,480
that like the situation is it is very, very fucked.

829
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Because it's the first time he just like lives in the park and eats scraps.

830
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,040
The second time he gets a job for like this company.

831
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,960
And then he lives with like like they put a roof over his head.

832
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,040
But eventually he gets brought back to society by

833
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,200
who are brought back to his wife and kids,

834
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,000
because the police finally find him after the missing persons report.

835
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,560
And then the third part of them becoming like a real deep level alcoholic.

836
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,280
And let me tell you, I never actually understood what alcoholism really is

837
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,400
until I read this book.

838
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,480
Like you hallucinate shit and stuff like you're just like in the streets,

839
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,200
throwing up and seeing visions and shit like that.

840
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
Like it's fucked.

841
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,840
And then he goes to rehab and that's like the last part.

842
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,800
But it's it's really interesting to just like watch the not only this guy,

843
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,040
but especially in the plumbing chapter, the people he works with

844
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,040
like sound exactly like the people you're describing right now.

845
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,480
Like just kind of weird off kilter people who like are clearly in this job

846
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,320
because it's, you know, like this is the job weirdos end up in.

847
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,200
Yeah, yeah.

848
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,280
It's a it was I think you'd like the book a lot is why I recommend it.

849
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,040
I it sounds like I would be great friends with this fellow.

850
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,520
Yeah.

851
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,720
It's a pretty similar alternative lifestyle to Ben here.

852
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,560
Yeah, yeah, pretty much pretty much.

853
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah, he's considered the father of Lollicon by many people.

854
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,960
You can tell that they started off with a strong candidate as you can see.

855
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,560
Real real good how curious, how curious, how curious.

856
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,440
Incidentally, him and his wife like did like they they worked to get

857
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,880
like she was like his colorist or whatever like for his old Lolli shit.

858
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,960
And most of it was not even really sexual, but like kind of more of a punk

859
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,520
aesthetic thing, like they were doing it to be rebels, like to say, fuck,

860
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,240
you were drawing like shed man.

861
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,080
Yeah, a little bit like better art than shed.

862
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,360
That's cool.

863
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,880
Is that even possible?

864
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
That's I don't know, man.

865
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,040
I don't know.

866
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,280
I have a topic that I've been thinking about.

867
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,920
It's it's it's come on along after like the The New Gorillaz album came out

868
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,400
and I listened to the single with the animation and then I went back

869
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,480
and re listened to Plastic Beach and I got way into it and I love Plastic Beach.

870
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,360
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach.

871
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,200
So good.

872
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,240
And and there's this other guy on YouTube, Lewis Cole, who I've found,

873
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,680
who is like, I would describe him as like a funkier, more

874
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,720
musician-y Bill Wirtz, who does like a lot of weird, but incredibly

875
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,040
tight, musically, instrumentally music stuff.

876
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,400
And I've just been like looking at all that and I'm like, I just got to be a musician.

877
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,080
I just want to make music all the time.

878
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,600
And I just don't I don't get it.

879
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,760
I don't know how to do it.

880
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,960
It's kind of annoying.

881
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,120
It's kind of annoying how I have some talent, but I can't

882
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,000
turn it into a song that can be listened to.

883
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,080
You got to take my approach, which is open up FL Studio and just

884
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,120
fuck around for like an hour and then publish it.

885
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,840
It's not a bad idea.

886
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,480
I I tried FL Studio, but it's bad.

887
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,000
You got to try it out, I guess, I don't know.

888
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,440
Well, it's it's not as easy to like record live instruments into it.

889
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,320
The thing that sort of leads into like the talking about physical labor,

890
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,840
because I was thinking I have like trouble, like my brain is a bit

891
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,400
different from the way that I have been using it.

892
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,400
I work so much better with like physical things and with my hands,

893
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,640
like in art school, in, you know, school art class.

894
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,200
I was always like the sculpture kid, like I would make the most elaborate,

895
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,440
incredible sculptures, which would take a really long time

896
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,040
because they required like repetitive tests of like sticking things together

897
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,720
and twisting wire around things and stuff.

898
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,960
And I love that.

899
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,160
I love the whole process of like making a 3D thing with my hands

900
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,360
for a very, very long time with repetitive motions, which is why I was thinking

901
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,600
maybe I'd like and every time there's like physical.

902
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,800
I like using my hands for repetitive motions, too.

903
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, the sculpture in my head just is a dick.

904
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,040
That's what I'm. Yeah, yeah.

905
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,120
All right. Well, if you must, if you must know, my one of my pieces was like

906
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,040
an entire man made out of tape, like I molded after my own body.

907
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,320
Dude, we we used to have we used to have a tape man

908
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,560
that was made out of Victor's body and then like a mannequin head.

909
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,160
And we used him in all the old project

910
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,080
awesomeness videos, like anytime we someone was getting killed,

911
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,120
like you'd see a sword about to hit somebody and then it would just swap

912
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,200
out to the tape man getting killed.

913
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,840
Actually, we beat it up so bad that we had to throw it away.

914
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,040
Rest in peace.

915
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,200
But my point with that is like I I don't like computers,

916
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,240
despite using them for so many things.

917
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,280
I'm so much more of a physical guy in terms of like,

918
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,480
I just prefer doing things physically.

919
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,320
Looking at the studio makes makes me a spiritual guy looking at

920
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,000
FL Studio and clicking on on clicking on all the like different keypads

921
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,240
to make melodies just makes me die.

922
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,360
Makes me puke. It makes me.

923
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,560
I don't ever do that.

924
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,680
I like it is just like shit myself.

925
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,240
And I just want to go to the keyboard, which is much more physical.

926
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,520
You just tap the thing and it makes the sound.

927
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,080
And I'm like, boop, boop, boop, boop.

928
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,960
And I'm not very good at playing the keyboard, but like the drums in there is

929
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,080
like it's it's great.

930
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,240
But when I go to like click record and try to line tracks up, I fall apart.

931
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,440
I just don't I don't care anymore.

932
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,800
I need a recording monkey.

933
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,560
I need I need a digital boy.

934
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,160
Let me let me tell you, you know, I'm on your side here

935
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,760
because I just I started writing a book.

936
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,160
I'm writing a new book.

937
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,960
It's called fixed that for you.

938
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,320
And it's going to be my my my just fix for everything in the world.

939
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,400
And I'm writing it by hand.

940
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,920
I like I bought a notebook just to write by hand because I'm able to just

941
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,160
formulate sentences better because it takes so much longer than typing that

942
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,480
like in the time it takes me to write one sentence.

943
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,320
I've thought of how to say the next one much more cleverly.

944
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,320
So like it reads like just a wall of aphorisms and funny shit.

945
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,040
And I love it.

946
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,680
And yeah, I think I'm just going to any any time I want to write something

947
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,240
more personal from now on, I think I'm just going to do it by hand.

948
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,120
Hey, that's a that's a far more interesting story than what I'm about to say.

949
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,800
But I just want to say that the the Galaxy Note 8 available at retailers

950
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,840
near you now sponsored by Samsung sponsored by Samsung like has this feature

951
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,640
that I thought was going to be bullshit, but just is the best thing ever.

952
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,280
And it's that like it's just so there's a little pen thing that you click out

953
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,240
and pull out. That's the reason why it's called the note and all.

954
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,800
And when you do that, it instantly pops up.

955
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,520
It goes. I don't even have to click anything.

956
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,440
It goes straight to these right memo on screen.

957
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,640
I then just write whatever I'm thinking of with zero delay or having to fuck around.

958
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,160
Click save and boom.

959
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,960
I have like stored this information that was in my brain.

960
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,120
It is so much better than what I used to do of going into this bullshit

961
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,920
like memo app I had and then like type me on the fucking pussy keyboard.

962
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,400
Just scribbling it down with my actual words.

963
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,880
It's just so much.

964
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,160
It's a life upgrade of the highest caliber.

965
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,560
Incidentally, Samsung asked that we read their slogan.

966
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah, this ad so Samsung Galaxy 8 get one niggers.

967
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,160
They're talking to the urban market.

968
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,200
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.

969
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,640
I got to say, I, you know, I personally don't necessarily support everything

970
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,280
that our sponsors say, you know, this is not necessarily

971
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,400
represent representative of our opinions.

972
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,160
Emotionally paid a lot of money like you all understand.

973
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,320
We were just talking about how much millennials need money.

974
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,680
Like it paid us a lot to say that like intellectually.

975
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,440
How can I disagree with that sentiment?

976
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,400
But emotionally, emotionally, so if you have a problem,

977
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,600
so if you have a problem with the slogan, take it up with fucking Benjamin

978
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,680
Franklin, he says, just offering Samsung,

979
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,760
Frank proffering a hundred dollar bill was the joke there.

980
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,640
I could point to my dollar bills.

981
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,320
Yeah, it didn't.

982
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,480
That was a visual.

983
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,960
But no, it was a visual joke.

984
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,000
I got to take it up with George Washington.

985
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,680
Yeah, but he's dead.

986
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,320
Yeah, you're dead.

987
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,280
He's really, I recall they first his head, the Disney Castle,

988
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,240
and he's going to come back any one of these days now.

989
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,040
George Washington.

990
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,720
Yeah, yeah, Walt Disney and George Washington, great contemporary.

991
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,480
Dude, do you think George Washington and George Lopez are related?

992
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,520
George Washington was George of the jungle.

993
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,200
I hope my fucking mom almost stayed.

994
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,240
George Lopez, and that's not a fucking joke.

995
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,080
She was just about to go on a date with him, but my fucking on cock blocked

996
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,000
with who?

997
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,760
George Lopez.

998
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,800
Oh, I thought you said George Lucas.

999
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,600
No, I would have been way better.

1000
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,000
I mean, you should get all the Georgia's together.

1001
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,680
He got cut by C3PO.

1002
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,800
George Lucas.

1003
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,400
No, sorry.

1004
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,520
George Lopez used to do like, like, you know, before he was big,

1005
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,400
he just used to do comedy clubs around LA.

1006
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,000
He used to just fuck sluts, you know, just used to fuck sluts.

1007
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,440
And, you know, my mom was around.

1008
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Yeah, my aunt knew him, like personally, my aunt, like, was his friend,

1009
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,280
like, for real.

1010
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,440
And George was like, you know, like, I want to date your sister.

1011
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,080
And she was like, oh, no, my sister wouldn't be interested.

1012
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,720
So my fucking aunt cock blocked my mom.

1013
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,920
Even though my mom would have dated George Lopez.

1014
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,520
Dude, that's what happened.

1015
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,520
Was this was this is this like George Lopez would have been your dad?

1016
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,160
Is what you're saying?

1017
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,760
Yes, he could have been my dad.

1018
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,320
He mad.

1019
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,360
I was afraid it would have been before or after you were alive before.

1020
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,560
His seed could have made me.

1022
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,320
Well, I mean, yes, it could have been.

1023
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Don't take this from me.

1024
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,160
All right.

1025
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,160
Well, enjoy.

1026
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,360
Who else has got a thing going on?

1027
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,440
And I'm an expo.

1028
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,760
Oh, yeah, if you would give me the floor for a moment.

1029
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,840
And expo, along with like all conventions and all vacations,

1030
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,320
basically any time I'm away from the house for more than like three days,

1031
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:00,320
I have like a like a like a life crisis of varying quantities

1032
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,480
and my entire perception on life changes.

1033
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,720
And I'm now I'm happy to announce

1034
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,000
Macraman, I'm exo officially a socialist now.

1035
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,360
I just am a socialist and I now have no sympathy for capitalism

1036
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,000
or any hierarchies of any kind that I'm now communist.

1037
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,120
But you were last anime expo.

1038
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,000
It was due to our capitalist connections

1039
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,040
that we were able to get into that Illuminati party.

1040
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,840
Fucking exactly, Nate.

1041
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,160
That's exactly what I'm fucking talking about.

1042
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,760
All right, flashback flashback to last year.

1043
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,360
I'm with Digi and Nate.

1044
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,720
I'm part of the fucking bourgeoisie.

1045
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,360
I'm getting into all the spirit cooking parties.

1046
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,840
I'm getting to all the fucking secret Illuminati Suarez.

1047
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,720
I'm getting to all the crazy one rooftop.

1048
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,920
I got to go to all the fucking breakfast.

1049
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,160
Breakfast every day.

1050
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,320
I got to go to all the fucking anime expo.

1051
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,920
Orders and crabs at the Wahoo.

1052
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,480
I got fucking so many aids.

1053
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,160
I can't see straight from all the Illuminati Suarez.

1054
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
I went to an anime expo.

1055
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,000
Why don't you just do and blow off of anime hookers?

1056
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,880
Yeah, those maids were basically anime hookers.

1057
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,480
Wearing one of those masks, those French funny masks.

1058
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,280
What are they called?

1059
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh, Guy Fox.

1060
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,280
No, no, no.

1061
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,600
You know, when you go to like a secret Illuminati club meeting.

1062
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,600
And they have like a Tom Cruise mask from Eyes Wide Shut.

1063
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,880
One of those like sex masks.

1064
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
You mean like a Richard Nixon mask?

1065
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,440
You mean like the mask from the mask?

1066
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,560
It's super long nose, the fucking, the old doctor masks

1067
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,560
with the long ass nose.

1068
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1069
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Like the late night.

1070
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,160
I walked into an anime expo wearing the mask from the mask.

1071
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,600
I got so much fucking pussy.

1072
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,000
You wouldn't even be that different

1073
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,880
if you were wearing the Jim Caron mask.

1074
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,760
That'd be an acceptable costume.

1075
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,200
Why didn't the mask just fucking rule?

1076
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,680
Actually, like, munchy acting normal.

1077
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,720
Like, if you just put on the mask, you'd be like,

1078
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,160
that man's been possessed by the mask.

1079
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,320
It's like, no, it's just munchy.

1080
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
That's true.

1081
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,680
In any fucking way.

1082
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,760
Last year at an expo, I was a big shot.

1083
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,520
Everyone fucking knew my name.

1084
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,880
Jeff, it was like, I'm kind of being

1085
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,360
in your fucking arm retrieval videos.

1086
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,560
I was like, maybe I'll put you on the wait list.

1087
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,400
Anyway.

1088
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
Yeah.

1089
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
Arm retrieval.

1090
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,960
Oh my god.

1091
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,440
OK.

1092
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,600
That's how you know you made it.

1093
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,760
Yeah.

1094
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,200
Anyway, this year's fucking smash cut.

1095
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,640
Fucking, like, no transition.

1096
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,040
Do not fade out any audio or video.

1097
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,160
Like, just cut the scene mid-transition.

1098
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,320
Here we are at this year.

1099
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,960
I'm with my fucking bullshit friends

1100
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,960
who haven't made a fucking YouTube video.

1101
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,920
Fuck you, Ethan.

1102
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,760
You suck dick.

1103
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
Fucking Ethan.

1104
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,520
Fucking Ethan.

1105
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,880
Fucking Leif.

1106
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,640
They don't know shit about being a fucking god like I do.

1107
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,560
They don't even know the rituals.

1108
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,800
So we're fucking walking.

1109
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,160
We have to wait in lines.

1110
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,040
We have to fucking do our taxes.

1111
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,880
We have to fucking, we have to keep our heads,

1112
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,240
like, firmly looking at the sidewalk at all times.

1113
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,960
We can't look up unless we be fucking shackled

1114
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,320
and fucking lashed.

1115
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,800
It's an awful experience.

1116
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,960
Like, we can't do any of the bourgeoisie spirit cooking.

1117
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,720
We just have to sit in line like everyone else.

1118
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,520
We have to, like, we have to fucking bear

1119
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,680
the brute force of the sun.

1120
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,200
Guys, guys, this anime expo was so fucking hot at nighttime.

1121
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,160
At nighttime.

1122
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,840
It was pitch black at 10 fucking PM to 11 PM.

1123
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,960
It was over 100, and the wind was blowing,

1124
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,080
and there was not a cool breeze.

1125
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,720
It was not a cool breeze.

1126
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,480
It's like a fiery hell storm.

1127
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,680
It was like every time, it was like a fucking fat guy blowing

1128
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,600
spit into your fucking face, and the spit was lava.

1129
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,960
That's what it was fucking like going to anime expo.

1130
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,440
It was a fucking nightmare.

1131
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,840
It was a nightmare.

1132
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,440
So we couldn't go, you know, I don't know if you guys

1133
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,400
remember this specifically, but there's like this, like,

1134
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,960
anime expo last year, Naden, did you?

1135
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Yeah, I am.

1136
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,080
There was like this part where special select industry

1137
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,520
people could take an escalator up to a higher level.

1138
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,600
Yeah, of course, of course.

1139
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,880
You know, like a speedway was like Rainbow Road.

1140
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,040
That shit, of course, that's locked fucking off.

1141
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,400
Oh, I forgot about that.

1142
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,240
That would have been completely cucked getting around the place.

1143
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,880
I mean, for what it's worth, I thought anime expo sucked

1144
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,920
balls and cock, like, in spite of us having all those,

1145
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,840
like, I hate it when it's like for the normos,

1146
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,960
like, munchy here, you know?

1147
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,520
I know, I'm a fucking proletaire.

1148
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,840
That's the entire point of that.

1149
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,200
So I realized, I realized what it's like to be on the fucking

1150
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,880
bottom and it's not worth it.

1151
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,520
I, it's not fucking fair that these digital influencers

1152
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,240
get to have all the fucking, they have a monopoly on space

1153
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,080
and air.

1154
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,720
It's not fucking fair.

1155
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,560
I mean, that rhymes.

1156
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,080
I would say, for what it's worth, I would say that a lot of it,

1157
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,760
a lot of last year, it was not really the capitalism

1158
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,000
that allowed you all that.

1159
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,240
It was my libertarianism that allowed that,

1160
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,000
because you were not even a guest.

1161
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,680
I just snuck you into everything because I don't give a fuck

1162
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,520
about the rules.

1163
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Only I had like a password.

1164
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,440
It's superfluous.

1165
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,800
The rich rid the rich and the poor gay.

1166
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,200
That's my saying and I'll stick into it.

1167
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,640
Anyway, I will not, I would not rest.

1168
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,680
This was like day fucking one that I realized

1169
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,280
that I needed to destroy anime expo,

1170
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,360
like the entire debate and like topple the government.

1171
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,560
And I needed to fucking raise the tricolor

1172
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,440
of the four day passes and I needed to declare influencers

1173
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,520
no longer.

1174
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,240
I needed to fucking shoot up every single YouTuber

1175
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,280
that I saw.

1176
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,840
And so I went through this like character arc of like,

1177
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,080
I tried to like infiltrate this like parliamentary debate

1178
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,040
otaku debate so I could spread the world.

1179
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,680
And if you see, I believe Ethan posted them on IGTV

1180
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,000
the other day, I need to tweet them out myself.

1181
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,120
But the second round that I was in.

1182
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,400
Whoa, Ethan has an IGTV account?

1183
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,720
Yeah, yeah.

1184
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,120
What's his name on there?

1185
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,960
I have no fucking clue.

1186
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,680
Dick Sucker, one, two, three, four, I believe.

1187
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,400
On Twitter, I retweeted the first round of the debate

1188
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,560
sorry and where I got stomped.

1189
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,160
But on the second and third one, I fucking killed it.

1190
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,760
Because all I did was just say popular shit.

1191
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,400
All I said was like, more people have seen Naruto

1192
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,120
so it's better, vote for me because you have seen Naruto.

1193
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,960
I fucking guarantee you've seen Naruto, vote for me.

1194
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,680
Even though the question wasn't even about Naruto.

1195
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,720
And so I just fucking slammed that shit.

1196
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,880
It's the people want what the people want.

1197
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,040
And that's all the power, they all want power.

1198
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,160
And that's how it became a fucking revolutionary God.

1199
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,000
And it was great.

1200
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,160
So I'm literally a socialist now.

1201
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,520
I'm literally a fucking socialist.

1202
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,400
That's literally true.

1203
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,240
Like a true socialist.

1204
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,920
I don't believe being a populist and being a socialist

1205
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,960
are necessarily the same.

1206
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,640
Well, I mean, with Munchie here, in true socialist fashion,

1207
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,160
it is simply the fact that other people have things

1208
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,640
that he doesn't have that makes him decide

1209
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,720
that this whole apple cart needs to be fully turned upside down.

1210
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,240
Like cabbages.

1211
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,160
It was fucking, oh, on a tangentially related note,

1212
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,480
this made me think about my foreign policy.

1213
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,040
This made me think about my foreign policy hard.

1214
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,560
My foreign policy is fucking neutered.

1215
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,120
Related, this is like the social factor.

1216
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:54,960
This is the social question.

1217
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,400
I was talking about the political question.

1218
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,480
This is the social question.

1219
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,120
Sure, I could bypass lines and everyone bowed down

1220
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,120
to me last year.

1221
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,280
But the real thing that was important

1222
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,560
was that fucking people knew who I was.

1223
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,880
That there were people like super eye patch wolf.

1224
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,400
So I just met with Digi and by the end of it,

1225
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,520
he knew my name.

1226
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,480
He knew who I was.

1227
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,000
I don't even fucking know that guy, but he knew my name.

1228
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,200
And this year, it was eye opening

1229
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,680
because here's the thing.

1230
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,800
It's not like I was cast to the shadows

1231
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,240
and no one knew who I was.

1232
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,200
Because weirdly, bizarrely, unbelievably, in fact,

1233
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,320
I was stopped by fans constantly.

1234
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,280
Oh, no way.

1235
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,800
Every hour or more, I would run into them a new fan.

1236
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,520
And that's not a fucking exaggeration.

1237
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,600
It was unbelievably constant.

1238
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,160
And the fucking basement and the entertainment hall, it was.

1239
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,280
I was just walking by a booth and just some fucking wage

1240
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,480
cock was like, oh my god, are you Munchie?

1241
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,440
I love the PCP.

1242
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,560
I used to watch on time and I was like, oh, why'd you stop?

1243
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,160
And he was like, oh, the drama got too much.

1244
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,080
I was like, oh, hello.

1245
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,320
And then I walked away.

1246
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:01,960
Sick.

1247
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,600
He should have said pussy.

1248
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,480
Yeah, yeah.

1249
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,600
Anyway, I just was getting stopped and non-stop.

1250
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,280
So it's like, I have the power.

1251
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,360
I have the power.

1252
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:16,640
But for some reason, I've just been so neutered lately.

1253
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,760
Between last AMX show and this, I've

1254
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,080
been so neutered where I don't fucking try and reach out

1255
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,200
and tackle people who are above me anymore.

1256
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,760
Like the entire reason why I'm here

1257
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,880
is that I tackled DigiBrownie and I

1258
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,800
got him to fucking submit to my will.

1259
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
I don't do that anymore.

1260
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,280
I don't talk to anyone anymore.

1261
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,480
Well, is there anyone who you're impressed enough with

1262
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,280
to feel that you want to tackle them?

1263
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,320
Yeah, a lot of people, a lot of them.

1264
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,280
Well, go tackle those motherfuckers.

1265
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,000
I very clearly could, who are small enough and important

1266
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,080
enough to me that I very easily could do it.

1267
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,800
And it just hasn't really been in my thought process.

1268
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,600
But it is now.

1269
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,080
It is now.

1270
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I'm thinking about it a lot, really.

1271
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,480
Well, that's good.

1272
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,640
I mean, the thing is that every time you make a new friend,

1273
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,720
you complicate your life that much more.

1274
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,880
It's like, if you want to have any really meaningful

1275
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,200
connection with this person beyond like, I mean,

1276
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,080
some people are easy.

1277
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,600
It's like, my art and your art are similar enough

1278
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,080
that we could easily collaborate and then never talk again.

1279
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,520
And that's fine.

1280
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,680
But if you want to be seriously involved,

1281
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,040
it's like, I have to now know another person.

1282
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,400
And then all of their entire social circle

1283
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,000
is now on your shoulders too, because they have all the shit

1284
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,480
they're worried about.

1285
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,680
If you want to talk about meaningful connection,

1286
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,480
let's talk about the one that I established yesterday.

1287
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,480
I was just on tour.

1288
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,560
With Munchie's mom.

1289
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,120
Hi, fucking fucker.

1290
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,760
No, no.

1291
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,280
I mean, I told this on my live stream yesterday,

1292
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,120
but whatever, I mean, I'm happy to tell it again.

1293
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,640
I saw that my boy, lobster boy, Tyrar A. Deweyo,

1294
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,720
the ASMR legend and god, he just hit 100,000 subscribers

1295
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,360
recently.

1296
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,120
And got his silver play button.

1297
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,440
And he made a video where he just says the usual stuff of,

1298
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,200
like, I never gave up so hard.

1299
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,720
I make content people likes, blah, blah, blah.

1300
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,920
And I like that guy overall, even though we disagree

1301
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,840
on some stuff.

1302
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,360
I just unsolicited.

1303
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,720
Just tweet out that video with the thing.

1304
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,520
Hey, just want to give a shout out to this guy who I know

1305
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,720
I'm a weirdo who likes ASMR.

1306
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,400
ASMR is cool.

1307
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,320
Fuck you.

1308
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,880
Tyrar is great.

1309
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,680
Congrats, dude.

1310
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,440
You're the best.

1311
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,000
I know we disagree on a lot of stuff, but you rule.

1312
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,080
And like I tweeted that out, we added him.

1313
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,240
And he responded, and we just had a whole conversation

1314
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,160
about how we're both Ohio boys, and he's cool,

1315
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,640
and he likes me, he subscribed to my fucking channel.

1316
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,960
He watched the fucking, whatever it is, the fucking,

1317
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,160
right, the Thanos video.

1318
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,560
He had made a bunch of ASMR Thanos videos himself.

1319
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,480
And he told me, he commented on that video,

1320
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,280
do a video about no country for old men, which I'm seriously

1321
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,160
considering doing based on that recommendation.

1322
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,480
And it was just out of, I respect this guy?

1323
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,200
What was his name did you ask?

1324
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,040
Have you seen the movie before?

1325
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,320
Yes, I have, yes I have.

1326
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,560
I quite like it, quite fond of it.

1327
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,320
And I was actually just watching some analysis videos

1328
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,160
on it the other day, so I'm kind of up to speed.

1329
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,600
But anyway, so good things happen when you just

1330
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,520
at people in a non-obnoxious and generally positive way

1331
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,320
on Twitter or elsewhere.

1332
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:14,840
It was great.

1333
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,760
I'm constantly surprised on how true that is.

1334
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,760
It's like so many people who just like at famous people

1335
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,600
and then get a reply in like a semi nice way.

1336
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,920
People do it to me.

1337
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,200
It's like famous people are human or something.

1338
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,560
It's like Flattery will get you everywhere.

1339
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,880
It's insane.

1340
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,400
I think that's what Maryweather,

1341
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,640
do you guys know Maryweather?

1342
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,200
Post Pavilion?

1343
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,040
No, I don't know her.

1344
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,880
I don't know her.

1345
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,640
No, he's this comic guy.

1346
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,840
He has a bunch of popular series like Winter Moon

1347
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,560
and Steam Dragon Express and stuff.

1348
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,920
Oh, you were telling me about this guy.

1349
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,040
I don't know.

1350
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,560
He knows everyone.

1351
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,160
Like he knows, oh god, who are, he was named.

1352
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,800
Casey Neistat.

1353
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,640
Like he's personally in touch with the Zontan guy.

1354
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,560
He asked me to write.

1355
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,760
No, he probably knows Shadbass.

1356
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,600
Oh shit, there's more.

1357
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,760
God, I'm blanking on names.

1358
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,840
But I think he just fucking ats people.

1359
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,560
I mean, you guys remember DJ Calcos, right?

1360
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,760
From the Brony days.

1361
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,400
Where Calcos was just a guy who just got the contact

1362
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,760
of like every Brony famous person.

1363
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,160
So they all knew who he was and he didn't really do anything.

1364
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,840
Like he had a, he had like a third string radio show

1365
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,120
on Celestia Radio with like 10 listeners, you know?

1366
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,240
Like Nino's the same.

1367
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,080
Nino's the same kind of guy.

1368
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,000
Yeah, Nino's very similar.

1369
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Nino got himself onto Pantaku and everything

1370
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,640
and he actually does make decent videos and raps and shit.

1371
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,240
But like, he knew, he like writes for Gigguk

1372
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,880
because he talked to him.

1373
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,440
You know, like just messaged him.

1374
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,480
I almost, I mean, oh he knows Christian with Gigguk

1375
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,720
just by adding him in a critical way at one point.

1376
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,000
Mary, Mary knows Christian.

1377
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,560
He even got Chris to, Chris even made fan art

1378
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,400
of his characters just because he, I don't know.

1379
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,400
He's just like, yeah, this is what he does.

1380
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,920
He just talks to people.

1381
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,760
It's not hard.

1382
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,400
I mean, again, the only reason I avoid it is that

1383
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,720
like you can have lots of frivolous connections

1384
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,280
but having a meaningful connection

1385
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,760
just is a lot of work.

1386
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,600
That's why I try to keep it to the PCP

1387
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,480
because like it's easy to keep track of all you guys

1388
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,920
because we're all kind of doing the same thing

1389
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,320
and we mostly work with each other.

1390
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,680
And like, I don't really have to worry about,

1391
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,960
like none of us have such complicated home lives

1392
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,920
that it's like, you know, that I have to worry

1393
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,320
about everything else going on with you.

1394
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,720
It's like, mostly we just talk to each other.

1395
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,120
But like, it's because some of the other people I know

1396
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,680
who have like their own communities

1397
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,360
that they're a part of, like those communities hate me.

1398
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,720
And it's like, those friends of mine have to like

1399
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,160
constantly like justify being friends with me

1400
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,480
to their communities.

1401
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,200
And it's just like, this is a load of horse shit.

1402
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,240
Like, I don't want to have to worry about all your bullshit

1403
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,920
just to be friends with you, you know?

1404
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,000
Didgy, I don't know if I said this on record or not

1405
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,600
but one of my real life friends,

1406
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,600
well, more like one of my real life acquaintances

1407
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,040
has stopped talking to me because you're a pedophile.

1408
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,880
Oh, what?

1409
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
I'm not even a fucking pedophile.

1410
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,720
That's fucked up.

1411
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,080
No, what do you mean?

1412
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:02,920
Question mark?

1413
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,400
What do you mean?

1414
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,480
That you're not a pedophile?

1415
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,320
What?

1416
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,160
No, I'm not a pedophile.

1417
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,120
What?

1418
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:09,960
What?

1419
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,800
What?

1420
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,640
No, not, didgy, not real.

1421
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,480
Well, he's joking.

1422
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,320
He's joking.

1423
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,160
Oh, okay.

1424
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,840
But wait, wait, wait, but this friend is real, right?

1425
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,000
Yes, this friend is real.

1426
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,440
Yes, someone's, someone.

1427
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,280
Okay, okay.

1428
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,120
And they're not talking to you.

1429
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,880
I mean, how much do you value this friend?

1430
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,120
Were you like, oh, good riddance?

1431
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,120
No, no, no, no, no, this is not,

1432
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,840
all I'm saying is that this is really funny.

1433
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,160
That's, that's, that's, that's okay.

1434
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,000
No, it is funny.

1435
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,520
I'm just wondering if like it was a,

1436
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,120
like, was it like a good friend you lost or anything?

1437
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,040
I don't know for sure that they top talked to me

1438
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,040
because of this, but like, they stopped talking to me

1439
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,840
and I then found out that they were really upset

1440
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,560
that you were a pedophile.

1441
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,080
Oh, well, I mean, fair enough.

1442
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,240
Supposed, allegedly.

1443
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,160
Oh, yeah, allegedly.

1444
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,040
They haven't, they haven't caught me yet.

1445
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,880
Man, that's fucked up.

1446
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,640
It's really fucking funny.

1447
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,720
I mean, there's a, I have like some of my friends

1448
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,120
who were like, told me that they like unfollowed me

1449
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,360
on Twitter because I was like defending Lolliport

1450
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,000
and I was like, can we have a conversation about that?

1451
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,600
Because the fact that you did that means

1452
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,280
that I think you're a piece of shit.

1453
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,160
Like, if you think it's wrong for me to defend this stuff,

1454
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,640
please come out and say so to my face

1455
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,280
so I know that we're, that we are now in conflict.

1456
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,640
Because this is not something I want you to write off

1457
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,880
and be like, oh, that's digi bro off.

1458
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,760
No, fuck you.

1459
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,440
Like, come say it to my face.

1460
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,480
Let's have a conversation.

1461
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,320
Cause if you're not willing to accept this,

1462
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,360
then I think you're a bad person.

1463
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,680
You know, like if you are actively against,

1464
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,760
like any kind of art expression, fuck you.

1465
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,600
That's just my statement.

1466
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,320
That's a pretty informative statement

1467
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,040
on how they view like what people should

1468
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,080
and shouldn't be, it baffles me to this day.

1469
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,880
The number of people who consider themselves

1470
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,120
like libertarian-esque and yet are opposed

1471
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,840
to like Lollicon art.

1472
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,280
I think they just are not sincere in their beliefs.

1473
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,560
And you really, when you beat him over that,

1474
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,520
like, I'll tell you man, Dick Masterson,

1475
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,200
when I went on his show, he was a great example.

1476
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,080
Yeah, and he said that was one of his favorite calls

1477
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,680
because like it really made him confront it

1478
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,360
and be like, if I'm supposed to be a libertarian,

1479
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,280
I have to like, you know, like if you're,

1480
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,200
if you're gonna go around calling yourself libertarian,

1481
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,920
you can't be against Lolliport.

1482
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,440
Like it is literally, that is, you know,

1483
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,600
it's in, what's the word I'm looking for, incongruent?

1484
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,440
That's not right.

1485
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,240
Yes, it's incongruent with the belief system of-

1486
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,080
Incongruent.

1487
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:23,920
Yeah, that's a better word.

1488
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,960
Well, I mean, you can be a libertarian

1489
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,920
and still be against some things, right?

1490
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,280
If you wanna go out there with a whole nine yards

1491
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,160
and be like, no, no, no, I'm an egalitarian

1492
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,640
or I'm a libertarian, but like I do believe

1493
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,000
that this thing like actively hurts people

1494
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
so like we should do something to like discourage it,

1495
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,840
you know, in whatever way.

1496
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,760
Dude, the part that pisses me off the most

1497
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,800
is like the SJWs and shit who,

1498
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,240
because SJWs are very anti-Lolliport,

1499
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,600
which is fucking bizarre to me

1500
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,760
because they're all about having acceptance

1501
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,840
for the shit they like and then they-

1502
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,160
There's like two camps there, isn't there?

1503
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,320
Like some is kind of really, weirdly pro it.

1504
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,160
I have no idea.

1505
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,640
I've only seen like the anti people

1506
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,960
and it really fucking pisses me off.

1507
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,800
Fair enough.

1508
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,480
Fuck you guys.

1509
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,960
Well, hey, I mean, totally, totally tangent.

1510
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,800
Fair it out.

1511
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,960
I was going back to like the subject

1512
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,560
that got us two here and just wanted to say

1513
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,760
on the subject of like people like communicating

1514
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,320
with people and like adding them and stuff,

1515
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,000
I'm not trying to encourage legions of people

1516
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,320
to at me and just say hi or what's up.

1517
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,480
No, no, no, not at all.

1518
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,320
Make sure it's a meaningful connection.

1519
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,480
Bring something to the table to offer,

1520
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,320
like something good that I'll care about.

1521
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,160
That's the whole thing.

1522
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,400
If you wanna like make connections to people,

1523
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,120
like you have to offer value.

1524
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:31,960
Of course.

1525
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,240
Yeah.

1526
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,160
Well, that's part of the reason

1527
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,360
where I don't think I would be like a good person

1528
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,880
to go to a con to have people meet me.

1529
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,800
Like the time we went to BronyCon,

1530
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,680
people around, they were talking to everyone.

1531
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,520
And I was there and some of them were like,

1532
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,840
well, okay, you're here too.

1533
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,160
I may as well get a signature.

1534
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,720
And I felt really bad.

1535
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,000
Not like I wasn't cool enough for them,

1536
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,440
but I felt like just bad in general.

1537
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,160
Like they didn't think much of me.

1538
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,840
And I was like, well, I'd rather you didn't ask

1539
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,800
for a signature if you don't actually give a shit.

1540
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,880
I mean, that's fair.

1541
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,720
That's fair.

1542
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,040
I can understand that.

1543
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,640
Incredibly variable experiences with people at cons

1544
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,240
because they're definitely the ones who come up to you

1545
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,160
and they want the signature.

1546
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,960
And then they just kind of stand next to you expectantly.

1547
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Like, okay, like, I'm here to do the thing.

1548
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,800
And I'm just like, I don't know what you want me to do

1549
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,720
because I don't know you

1550
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,840
and I don't know what your connection to me is.

1551
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,840
I don't know what videos of mine you've seen.

1552
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,800
They got the signature.

1553
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,960
But it's time to get working on this best friendship now.

1554
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:30,960
Let's get going.

1555
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,800
But there are a lot of people I've met at cons

1556
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,040
who I have had interesting conversations with,

1557
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,240
you know, where like they come around

1558
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,040
and they come up and they're like, hey, Digi,

1559
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,520
I'm a big fan, let's talk about your stance on this show.

1560
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,320
You know, a lot of the times it's just like

1561
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,480
some misunderstanding that's cleared up in two seconds

1562
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,720
and they feel stupid to walk away.

1563
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,120
But like other times we get into some heavy,

1564
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,200
you know, some heavy discussions

1565
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,720
and it's like, you know, there's a lot of people

1566
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,800
who send me the message like,

1567
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,960
hey, you and I see eye to eye on lots of things.

1568
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,520
I think we'd make good friends.

1569
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,360
And I'm always just like, yeah, of course.

1570
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,320
Like if you watch my videos consistently,

1571
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,800
it's most likely that you're someone who's,

1572
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,080
who would be good friends with me.

1573
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,080
But the thing is that for you, it's like, wow,

1574
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,960
I'm seeing this Digi Bro guy,

1575
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,240
the first person I've ever heard

1576
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,400
like have the same opinions as me.

1577
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,360
I want to be his friend.

1578
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,360
And I'm like, dude, look,

1579
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,280
do you see that I have 350,000 subscribers?

1580
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,600
Go talk to any of those guys.

1581
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,920
They're all just like you.

1582
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,760
All my fans are exactly like each other.

1583
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,600
They'll look the same.

1584
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,440
They'll act the same.

1585
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,280
They're the same age.

1586
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,360
They go to the same places.

1587
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,480
They like the same shows.

1588
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,800
Just talk to each other.

1589
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,640
There's only one of me.

1590
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,560
I don't have time.

1591
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,400
You're totally right about that.

1592
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,480
But you know what's changed the game on that front?

1593
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,880
Our Discord's.

1594
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,360
Because seeing our Discord's,

1595
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,040
like bring people together to act,

1596
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,600
like there's a book club that's begun both in the potty cast

1597
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,240
and in my personal, like best guy ever Discord server,

1598
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,160
which warms my fucking heart

1599
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,840
that these people are getting together.

1600
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,200
On my Discord server,

1601
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,960
there's guys who play D&D together,

1602
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,400
that they came together through this.

1603
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,360
Yeah, all kinds of stuff.

1604
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,520
I love that.

1605
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,360
I love that.

1606
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,480
My Discord formed like a, sorry.

1607
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,840
Mine just like early on when it was pretty active,

1608
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,200
like most of the people from mine

1609
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,280
who were like pretty active in there

1610
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,200
just went off and made their own other.

1611
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,440
Cause I basically told people like,

1612
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,000
look, I want this Discord to be accessible to new fans.

1613
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So like, I don't want new people to come in here

1614
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,800
and feel like they're not a part of the clique.

1615
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,120
So like, if you guys want to be clickish,

1616
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,960
go make another Discord.

1617
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,800
We don't want a rowdy fucking.

1618
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,920
It was a super successful.

1619
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,280
God, how could you not?

1620
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,200
A bunch of people in my Discord server

1621
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,160
have like started podcasts with each other.

1622
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,600
Oh yeah, that happened in mine too.

1623
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,440
Yeah.

1624
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,280
I encourage that.

1625
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,960
Cause I made a podcasting like,

1626
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,720
I made a podcasting channel when I created the Discord,

1627
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,360
like just in case people wanted to do that.

1628
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,200
Oh, that's cool.

1629
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,960
There was for a while the Digi Boys channel,

1630
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,200
which had one podcast that was just for like

1631
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,320
group watching anime and another podcast

1632
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,880
that was two of the like,

1633
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,760
like the main guys who were doing

1634
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,240
weekly analysis of my content as a podcast.

1635
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,320
It lasted a couple of months,

1636
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,200
but yeah, again, those guys have gone on.

1637
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,640
Like a lot of people make connections in our fan groups.

1638
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,480
I love that.

1639
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,320
I love that.

1640
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,640
And I know most of us are dating fans

1641
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,960
who we met that way as well.

1642
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,800
You ain't wrong.

1643
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,120
You ain't wrong.

1644
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,480
Gross.

1645
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,760
So I also, and tell me what you think about this.

1646
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,160
I made the roles.

1647
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,960
I made the roles in my Discord server,

1648
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,960
like based on what kind of art people do,

1649
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,560
like there's like a role for draw people

1650
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,040
and a role for video editors

1651
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,280
and a role for writers and musicians.

1652
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,280
And like my idea was that if I did this,

1653
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,640
that maybe they could like collaborate with each other.

1654
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,880
That's a good idea.

1655
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,200
And even us, what was the lowly video hacks,

1656
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,040
such as myself?

1657
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,240
The lowest tier is the video hack,

1658
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,080
which Nate sadly inhabits.

1659
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,920
That's right.

1660
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:44,840
That's right.

1661
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,680
Yeah.

1662
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,160
I'm gonna, I set up a board on my Discord server.

1663
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,760
The second highest tier is the ultimate art form,

1664
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,280
the drawsman.

1665
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,720
Above that, even that is where I reside

1666
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,280
at the coveted role of Ideas Man.

1667
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,640
Yeah, that's been all right.

1668
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,480
That's the best guy.

1669
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,960
In my Discord, I created a Flash Pros board,

1670
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,600
but it very immediately became just meme cancer.

1671
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,680
That's all it is.

1672
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,800
People just posting like horse shit.

1673
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,760
Yeah, yeah.

1674
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,200
Turns out my fans are not really Flash Pros writers

1675
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,040
for the world.

1676
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,880
Imagine that, imagine that.

1677
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,480
Hey, while we're talking about just cool things

1678
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,040
about our Discord, I just wanna give a shout out

1679
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,200
to the vibrant community of the Poddy cast

1680
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,280
that me and Gib have.

1681
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,120
Is that true?

1682
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,960
I did not even know that.

1683
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,120
Do you not have its own Discord?

1684
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,560
Yeah, we've got our own Discord.

1685
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,680
It's part of the Patreon rewards.

1686
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,120
And more than that, I don't know,

1687
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,680
man, this is a great tabic actually,

1688
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,680
but like we have instituted an intense cast hierarchy

1689
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,520
between the pledge rolls.

1690
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,920
There's a literal race war.

1691
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,760
Yeah, that's right.

1692
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,600
All at all times.

1693
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,640
The lowly, because you can get into the server for free

1694
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,240
and you can get into the main chat,

1695
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,000
but you are a disgusting lowly pathetic white.

1696
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,880
We have to hashtag kill all whites.

1697
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,040
They are a disgrace.

1698
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,560
They have access to the general voice chat,

1699
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,840
but if you pledge even $1, anything above that,

1700
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,040
you are a colored and you are a supreme God in the server.

1701
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,120
And at that point, you get excellent emotions.

1702
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,240
It doesn't matter what color you are,

1703
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,080
you just have to be a baby color.

1704
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,800
So you'd be a POC or a patron of color.

1705
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,280
That's exact, a POC.

1706
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,600
Oh, oh my God.

1707
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,720
You, I mean, yeah, there is some disagreement

1708
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,520
or there's some ranking between the colors,

1709
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,680
but most important is colored versus non-colored.

1710
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,800
I mean, my favorite thing about like the way

1711
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,000
that sort of spiraled is like the main chat is,

1712
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,720
it started off slow because it was a small discord,

1713
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,880
but as the putty cuss became more popular,

1714
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,920
lots of normal fags jumped in there

1715
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,440
and they started having stupid discussions.

1716
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,160
Is the putty cuss like popular?

1717
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,000
What is going on?

1718
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,840
Dude, it's getting popular.

1719
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,920
We've had videos with like 10,000 views,

1720
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,400
which is like, you know, for that show, it's great.

1721
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,960
I think our biggest is like 20,000.

1722
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,960
One of these days, I'll catch up on one piece.

1723
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,560
Shout out to the leader of the whitey army sigh.

1724
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,520
You will be dispatched along with your low league.

1725
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,320
It's not that size, CY size, a different size.

1726
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,920
I see, you had like one chapter got like 19K views recently.

1727
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,760
That's right.

1728
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,000
That seems to be like the,

1729
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,440
there's a few of these that blew up,

1730
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,520
but it seems like I'm guessing really big chapters.

1731
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,360
That's exactly right.

1732
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,200
That's exactly right.

1733
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,040
That we get out.

1734
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,240
Once again, the highest grossing arm retrieval

1735
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,720
is the one that you guys were on.

1736
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,560
Oh, really?

1737
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,400
Oh, great.

1738
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,240
You got that potty cast bomb.

1739
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,360
What do you mean by grossing?

1740
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,640
Like just view counts or like how?

1741
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,480
Yeah, yeah, view.

1742
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,200
Yeah, there's no money, no money's here.

1743
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:28,120
You should, the way it's sort of spiraled out of control

1744
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,960
is like people in the blue tier, like it's like the $1.

1745
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,800
That's the $1.

1746
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,640
The cabin boys.

1747
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,680
They started saying, oh man, all these whites are so annoying.

1748
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,240
They have such bad ideas.

1749
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,760
We patrons are smarter because there are less of them.

1750
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,320
But then like every color up, every like higher tier patron

1751
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,640
sort of like copies that idea and then like,

1752
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,080
those stupid blues, those fucking idiots,

1753
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,200
they would have arguments in there

1754
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,120
and like the very top chat is just me and Nate

1755
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,560
and we laugh at everyone.

1756
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,480
Well, the top is the commander's lounge

1757
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,880
where the commanders and the edgy cool guys

1758
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,480
or the cool edgy mysterious guys,

1759
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,040
that's the one below commander.

1760
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,080
They're allowed in there too.

1761
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,920
Cause they're,

1762
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,760
Would Luffy's entire crew be classified as that?

1763
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,880
Like, cool edgy mysterious guys?

1764
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,720
Yeah.

1765
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,720
If you were like to build these lounges around like character,

1766
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,160
like what characters in one piece

1767
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,800
would actually live in these lounges?

1768
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,800
Would it just be like Luffy and his whole crew

1769
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,600
are all like a captain and cool edgy mysterious guy?

1770
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,880
I mean, basically, yeah.

1771
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,720
Yeah.

1772
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,160
They all, I mean, they're more of a family.

1773
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,520
We are a regimented capitalist enterprise

1774
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,680
on the body cast crew as they all know.

1775
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,600
And it's great.

1776
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,440
It's great.

1777
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,480
It funds money to the top.

1778
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,200
They have their own book club.

1779
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,440
They have a lot of their own like little things they do

1780
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,720
and they're constantly chatting in all the chats.

1781
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,280
Very active, very cool.

1782
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,120
It's great.

1783
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,960
I love that service.

1784
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,800
It's one of my favorites.

1785
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,880
My discord's fucking sick.

1786
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,320
There's like almost all the people who patron me

1787
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,240
are all art boys and do like creative stuff in some way.

1788
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,720
So I made like a chat for them to just like show off

1789
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,120
their shit so like we can easily share what everyone's doing.

1790
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,880
And then they started doing a,

1791
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,080
like sort of an accountability thing.

1792
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,360
Like every like two weeks they're like,

1793
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,200
this is what I did.

1794
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,040
This is what I worked on.

1795
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,960
So they're doing like a little micro art.

1796
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,760
What is art apologies with each other?

1797
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,600
Yeah.

1798
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,440
Basically it's fucking,

1799
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,200
they beat us to the punch on art apology.

1800
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,200
It's kind of embarrassing, but it's also kind of rad.

1801
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,520
So yeah, it's fucking dope.

1802
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,640
We'd have to apologize about that.

1803
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,280
Yeah, yeah, well, you should for sure.

1804
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,720
Apologize to the audience for doing that.

1805
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,400
Shout out to the Golden Shell Foundry,

1806
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,080
the best fan slash friend discord ever made.

1807
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,600
It's everything about it.

1808
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,440
Didn't it die?

1809
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,280
Didn't it die?

1810
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,120
I thought it was dead.

1811
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:35,960
No, no.

1812
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:36,800
Dude, what are you talking about?

1813
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,640
It's fucking a lie as well.

1814
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,480
I guess I've just never been,

1815
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,560
I've never been cool enough to come in, I guess.

1816
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,080
Nah, you've never been invited.

1817
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,000
This is an invite level only discord

1818
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,680
and there are regular purges.

1819
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,520
We're all the cool...

1820
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,040
Well, hang on, Munchy,

1821
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,160
how good can this discord server be

1822
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,200
if it doesn't even generate revenue for you?

1823
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,920
How, I don't understand, like how...

1824
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,480
I don't know if this is a good business's decision

1825
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,720
to make this discord actually.

1826
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,520
I don't know, I think we might be wasting our time

1827
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,240
inputting resources into this.

1828
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,840
This one we're doing right now.

1829
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,840
Pull out, pull out.

1830
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,680
Yeah.

1831
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,360
Yeah, shout out, shout out.

1832
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,240
I love, by the way, who else loves the awesome one?

1833
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,400
My discord is the best discord by the way.

1834
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,240
Oh yeah?

1835
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,080
I bet it sucks.

1836
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,920
I bet it's gay.

1837
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,040
I'm not even going to pretend

1838
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,640
like anything interesting happens in my discord at all.

1839
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,480
Well, to be fair, mine is really quiet,

1840
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,280
but I kind of like it because it's so chill

1841
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,280
and there's like regulars and I like,

1842
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,280
hi people, I know who you are.

1843
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,120
Let's cry.

1844
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,080
I often to the mage discord every so often

1845
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,880
to just look at the not-safe-for-work chat

1846
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,720
and then run away.

1847
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,960
Dude, Michelle has told me

1848
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,840
about your not-safe-for-work chat, Gib.

1849
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,880
In tones, in words that would terrify

1850
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,200
a less powerful man than myself,

1851
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,520
it sounds like the most debauched server of all time.

1852
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,560
And by the way, this is why I want DeVoo

1853
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,160
to make his own server as well.

1854
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,840
Cause just imagine what his not-safe-for-work.

1855
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,400
I actually have no idea what's in my NSFW one

1856
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
cause I just made it as a containment board

1857
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,360
cause a lot of people post porn everywhere if I did.

1858
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,720
I mean, I did the same thing.

1859
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,400
But I've never actually looked at it right now.

1860
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,600
It's like a fortune I had to make the pony board

1861
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,600
cause we had to contain the pony scourge, you know,

1862
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,040
on the, on the, on V and whatnot.

1863
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,280
Occasionally I will post like, you know,

1864
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,880
a hundred images of Riska in my not-safe-for-work chat

1865
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,720
at a time.

1866
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,520
It'll just be like a little, little party for everybody.

1867
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,880
Can you drag and drop a hundred images into Discord?

1868
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,720
Do you have to do them individually?

1869
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,560
Probably not.

1870
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,960
I think I did it in bunches.

1871
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,240
Damn, okay, okay.

1872
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,720
This is what I posted in my not-safe-for-work chat.

1873
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,680
Oh God, what is it?

1874
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,680
Oh no.

1875
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,320
I want to wiggle my pee pee.

1876
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,120
That's extremely sexual.

1877
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,520
It was, it was a screenshot from a video I watched

1878
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,200
and laughed so hard I had to share with people.

1879
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,200
That's explicit.

1880
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,200
I don't know if I would just do that.

1881
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,320
How would you do that NSFW?

1882
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,160
I don't know.

1883
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,640
Would you have that as your desktop background?

1884
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,000
That's, that's the joke.

1885
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,840
Yeah, good idea.

1886
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,840
I'll put that in my.

1887
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,200
We have, behind the scenes,

1888
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,560
pull the curtains back a little bit, people.

1889
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,920
We have, we have a, we have a,

1890
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,800
we have a topics list here that we,

1891
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,720
everyone just casually will put in stuff

1892
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,360
that they want to talk about so everyone's on the same page.

1893
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,200
Yeah.

1894
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,280
And on here, you know, in the show notes type of thing,

1895
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,360
I see your note is Boyga,

1896
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,360
a big juicy one in parentheses.

1897
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,200
That's right.

1898
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,040
Yeah, I'm curious.

1899
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,880
I'm curious about that.

1900
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,720
Yeah.

1901
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,560
What do you.

1902
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,400
Consider my interest.

1903
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,640
Is this just in the regular PCP topics doc?

1904
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,480
Is that a different one?

1905
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,320
Yeah, I put Boyga.

1906
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,160
It's a Boyga.

1907
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,000
A big juicy Boyga.

1908
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,840
Burger.

1909
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,680
Hamburger.

1910
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,520
Yeah.

1911
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,440
Well, a full disclosure.

1912
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,720
This was Michelle's best tweet of all time.

1913
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,680
Was simply the word Boyga with a,

1914
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,880
with a hamburger emoji and like a bunch

1915
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,960
of New York emojis next.

1916
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,720
And she was very proud and she laughed for hours.

1917
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,960
And I agreed.

1918
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,120
How many, how many likes?

1919
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:40,960
How many likes?

1920
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,120
For her, I mean, for her pathetic baby Twitter,

1921
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,480
probably like five, lol.

1922
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,160
Sad.

1923
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,480
Sad.

1924
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,320
We give her Twitter.

1925
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,520
May gets like a few hundred likes on some shit.

1926
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,440
Well, she is the greatest anime analyst of all time.

1927
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,560
So of course she does, you know?

1928
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,600
I mean, that's just a fact.

1929
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,480
So do we want to move on to questions?

1930
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,760
Are we done with, is that, was that in for the Boyga?

1931
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,600
Like, yeah.

1932
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,480
Was that why it was on the list?

1933
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,480
The reason I put it there was as a joke.

1934
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,880
And I mean, like, that's the story.

1935
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,280
Michelle said it and it was funny.

1936
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,480
There's nothing else to it.

1937
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,720
All right.

1938
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,240
Do we want to move on to question six?

1939
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,080
We've been going for almost a hour and a half.

1940
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,160
Wait, what about Mages?

1941
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,280
What about Mages' topic?

1942
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,120
She's got one here.

1943
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:20,960
Oh, bitching?

1944
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,800
No, no, no, no, no.

1945
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,120
Let's not talk about that topic.

1946
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,600
Mages, I'm calling you out.

1947
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,440
Why?

1948
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm calling you out about this topic.

1949
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,840
Which is.

1950
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,160
No, it's because we're gonna just go back

1951
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,600
to talking about Shadmin' again.

1952
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,600
And I don't want to talk about Shadmin' again.

1953
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,600
No, we aren't.

1954
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,760
Why don't you guide the discussion, Mages?

1955
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,080
Well, I mean, she doesn't want to.

1956
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,920
I don't want to do it.

1957
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:39,760
Let's not do it.

1958
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,600
Here's our first question.

1959
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did you, did you?

1960
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,880
We've got things to do before we get to the question.

1961
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,240
Now, this is, there's been updates.

1962
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,600
I don't know what the format is anymore.

1963
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,240
Okay, it seems to be different every time we want to.

1964
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,080
There's good news.

1965
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,080
Preferably no format.

1966
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,760
There is good news here, everybody.

1967
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,760
Today is, in fact, the last time

1968
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,800
we're ever doing the fan art section.

1969
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,720
Wait, wait, Nate.

1970
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,280
I have to tell you, I've stolen more of your goods.

1971
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,480
What do you mean?

1972
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,400
I stole more of your shit from our parents.

1973
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,400
Oh my God.

1974
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,760
What did you take?

1975
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,600
What did you take?

1976
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,920
Because, you know, because I had to go there

1977
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,760
because they're moving, so I had to help them pack.

1978
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,600
I just remember going back to your house,

1979
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,600
you just had to take another thing from Nate's place.

1980
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,400
Yeah, I mean, I just had to take,

1981
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,160
yeah, this was willful theft this time, okay?

1982
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,160
This one, there's no excuse for it.

1983
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,400
What the hell was it?

1984
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,280
I'll tell, I'm holding the hostage.

1985
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:28,000
I have, Nate, I have your electric globe

1986
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,800
that shoots the lightning bolts

1987
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,760
that you touch your hands on.

1988
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,120
No, I love that thing.

1989
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,840
Yes, no, it's mine now.

1990
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,680
I spent like $100 on that when I was like 10.

1991
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,840
And now I have it next to,

1992
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,640
you're gonna have to come get it in person.

1993
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,240
I'm gonna steal my shoes back, Ben,

1994
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,040
and stomp in your fucking skull to take back my like home.

1995
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,400
It's gone from Ben vehemently denying

1996
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,640
that he's done anything wrong,

1997
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,960
and there has been no benefit to the thing.

1998
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,880
Ben has completely and rapidly seated

1999
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,560
all moral high ground completely.

2000
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,280
Let's just say, oh, let's just say I'm borrowing it.

2001
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,440
I mean, parents needed to clear out space.

2002
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,280
I'm just holding it for you.

2003
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,600
Oh, he's a nice guy.

2004
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,640
He's doing your parents a favor, Nate.

2005
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,120
I'm doing you and them a favor.

2006
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,160
I really appreciate that.

2007
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,240
You're welcome.

2008
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,580
I really appreciate that.

2009
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,420
Well, you know what?

2010
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,280
You know what I'll say?

2011
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,880
Consider it, we'll consider it alone,

2012
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,640
and I'm actually glad that thing's getting used

2013
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,520
because it is cool, and I do like it.

2014
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,880
It's way cool.

2015
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,720
It warms my heart.

2016
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,160
So like any good capitalist,

2017
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,120
you're gonna be charging like 15% interest.

2018
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:24,960
Well, of course.

2019
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,040
I just need more furniture to actually put it on.

2020
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,160
Yeah, once you make it to Boston,

2021
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,160
you can take all this fucking shit back from them.

2022
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,520
That's, yeah, that's true.

2023
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,720
That's true.

2024
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,600
Just like I'll take back those shoes.

2025
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,200
Guys, it's a sad day.

2026
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,840
It's a sad day, but we desire we're not gonna do it anymore

2027
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,080
because it's kind of weird and awkward,

2028
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,000
as you can see right now,

2029
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,120
to put this visual stuff in an audio podcast.

2030
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,960
We'll retweet stuff.

2031
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,800
We love your fan.

2032
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,640
We'll be a little bit like it.

2033
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,480
Keep retweeting.

2034
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,040
We will, you know, PCP is the biggest brand in the universe.

2035
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,100
You know, we'll retweet it.

2036
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,280
You'll get your five minutes of fame.

2037
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,440
So we encourage it heavily,

2038
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,400
but this is the last time it's gonna be featured

2039
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,360
in an episode unless we figure out some of the format,

2040
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,200
but we'll worry about that.

2041
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,880
Someone in the comments suggested to just like have

2042
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,760
show a couple of them, like as the episode ends,

2043
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,440
because there's like that 30 second kind of like block

2044
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,280
when you put like a-

2045
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,120
Like a slide show.

2046
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,160
And just like cycle through a couple of them.

2047
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,720
That's not a bad idea.

2048
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,560
I kind of like that.

2049
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,640
That's not a bad idea,

2050
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,080
but I don't think it's a replacement

2051
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,800
for the like discussion of them.

2052
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,640
Well, sure, sure.

2053
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,480
It's not, but it would be a nice way to just have them,

2054
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,680
like give them more visual.

2055
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,760
Like frankly, I just want to keep encouraging people

2056
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,240
to make fan art because I love it so much.

2057
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,360
So anything you can find to encourage that.

2058
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,000
I mean, I do want it to get seen.

2059
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,840
You know what?

2060
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,680
Let's talk about that.

2061
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,520
We'll get back to you on that.

2062
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,080
Well, I'm just putting that one on the table.

2063
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,840
Thanks to whoever left that in the comment

2064
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,880
on the last episode.

2065
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,720
It was a good idea.

2066
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,560
It's not a terrible idea.

2067
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,560
That sick, the never paint sick ass fucking drawing

2068
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,040
of Mage with swords.

2069
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,360
He's going back for round two.

2070
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,560
This is a very like a 90s anime look.

2071
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,400
I dig it.

2072
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,440
Digi, you should scroll up a little bit in the chat

2073
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,440
because he made one before that we talked about last time

2074
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,920
or maybe the time before.

2075
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,920
What the fuck is it?

2076
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,760
Well, it's here somewhere.

2077
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,920
It's a bit, it's a bit above you.

2078
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,920
It's somebody like, I can't find it, but it's noticeable.

2079
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,200
This one is.

2080
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,920
It's up on June 24th.

2081
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,920
Okay, there you go.

2082
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,760
Thank you.

2083
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,600
Jesus Christ.

2084
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,600
Something about the picture that shows the markers

2085
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,080
around the drawing is so aesthetic about this area.

2086
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,800
It's like a very tiny drawing as well.

2087
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,840
It's incredible how tiny they are.

2088
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,680
That's true.

2089
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,520
That's true.

2090
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,280
Such detail.

2091
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,440
Oh God, it's so, it's such a small drawing.

2092
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,560
I kind of like, I remember like drawing on paper

2093
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,120
back in the old days.

2094
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,480
And I always felt like drawing small is way easier.

2095
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,320
Oh yeah?

2096
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,160
I just actually draw small.

2097
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,640
Like I draw really tiny just cause it's the most tiny.

2098
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,120
Cause you have so much more control over your tiny pen.

2099
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,960
I do as well.

2100
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,800
The pros.

2101
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:49,640
Well the pros they draw big.

2102
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,080
They are called Micron pens, so you know,

2103
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,440
they must be micro.

2104
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,280
Yeah, but look at that.

2105
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,000
Marker tip.

2106
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,640
Like the marker tip is so big compared to like the Marks maze.

2107
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,000
You just do a little dab, little, little, little, little.

2108
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,680
Well that's the, that's just the color pen.

2109
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,520
Oh, I'm dabbing.

2110
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,040
I think the Microns are what he like did.

2111
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,760
Yeah, those are smaller I think.

2112
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,600
Well whatever.

2113
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,440
I mean, I don't get how it works.

2114
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,520
I don't understand these art things, but this looks great.

2115
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,200
Love the city in the background on this purple bullshit.

2116
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,040
It's cool.

2117
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,280
Is that a purple smoke rising from the, from the wreckage?

2118
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,120
It sure is.

2119
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:20,960
It sure is.

2120
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,280
The funny thing is there's like one building

2121
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,800
sort of like towering.

2122
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,200
And in my city there is a church that towers just like that.

2123
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,560
Damn.

2124
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,160
Yeah, I mean that looks, looks about right.

2125
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,320
But my experience in the region.

2126
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,640
I like the little bird.

2127
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,960
I like the little bird near your leg and the cat on the shed.

2128
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:39,800
Oh, I didn't notice them.

2129
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,640
Yeah.

2130
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,480
Oh, they look cool.

2131
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,400
I noticed the bird.

2132
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,400
I wonder if it's related to my feud with the crows recently.

2133
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,960
The guy, I hope so.

2134
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,800
All right.

2135
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,520
Well, the next one we've got is from King Salmon.

2136
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,240
You have to really get to the max resolution on this

2137
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,080
to understand.

2138
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,920
Yeah.

2139
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,760
I still can't.

2140
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,920
Like it's very light.

2141
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,960
It's very light.

2142
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,200
You got to really open that shit up in a new tab.

2143
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,040
That's what I did.

2144
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,600
It's a fucking massive image, but it's awesome.

2145
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,600
It's got all of our faces fucking being,

2146
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,720
it's just really expressive face work.

2147
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,920
Kind of reminds me of like the movie Wings of Honey Mies,

2148
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,560
like old, very old Gainax like facial style, especially

2149
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,560
DeVoo.

2150
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,060
Yeah.

2151
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,200
Nate's got this awesome.

2152
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,040
I love that pose.

2153
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,640
I just noticed that's an awesome face.

2154
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,320
I'm not entirely sure because, OK, we've got me, DeVoo, Nate,

2155
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,800
Ben, Mage, Hippo, Tom.

2156
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,720
Those are all obvious and they're all colored in.

2157
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,320
And Jess.

2158
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,840
Jess has got to be the bottom right, the part.

2159
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,340
Is that?

2160
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,120
Jess isn't yet.

2161
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,320
Why is he wearing?

2162
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,720
Is that supposed to be like Asuka's hairband?

2163
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,240
I think it's a pirate.

2164
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:47,960
That's a pirate hat.

2165
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,840
It's a pirate hat.

2166
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,680
Yeah, it's a pirate hat.

2167
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,600
OK, that makes sense.

2168
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,840
Who the fuck is the lizard?

2169
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,400
Well, the lizard.

2170
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,600
I think it's supposed to be me.

2171
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,960
It's got to be Munchie by process.

2172
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,160
Well, they lose who's Donkey Kong, then.

2173
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,240
It's Munchie, probably.

2174
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,320
That's definitely Munchie for sure.

2175
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:05,080
Yeah, I think the guy said in the Discord

2176
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,960
that this was drawn a long time ago.

2177
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,440
Oh, OK.

2178
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,880
I mean, he just hadn't submitted it.

2179
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,920
I do actually love this like monkey in a car

2180
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,720
shooting two-sew machine guns.

2181
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,400
It is presumably doing a in-cell drive-by,

2182
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,640
is where my mind goes.

2183
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,840
Why is fucking Munchie a lizard?

2184
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,560
I have no idea.

2185
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,720
Yeah, that one I don't.

2186
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,640
He has this big jaw for maximum munching, obviously.

2187
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,640
That's true.

2188
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,480
Makes sense to me.

2189
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,480
His tongue is like a made form.

2190
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,240
Maybe this was drawn near the beginning

2191
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,160
of when Munchie and Munchie joined.

2192
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,120
And I guess he had a better understanding of who

2193
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,840
Munchie was and not Munchie.

2194
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:40,960
I guess so, I guess.

2195
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,000
Yeah, because it seems like he's not.

2196
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,840
I like the Tom.

2197
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,360
Tom's like a lizard guy.

2198
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,240
Tom's like scary, like foo-man-choo.

2199
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,040
Tom looks like a Voldemort.

2200
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,840
Very Dracula lizard guy.

2201
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,560
I love it.

2202
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,920
If I could look like this in real life,

2203
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,880
I'd do it in an instant.

2204
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,880
It's pretty cute.

2205
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,320
Alongside Tom being a communist,

2206
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,840
which everyone just believed because we believe it.

2207
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,120
For no reason, yeah.

2208
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,040
There's also a general design trend

2209
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,320
that I, myself, partake in and has been illustrated here,

2210
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,760
where Tom is a vampire.

2211
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,160
We draw him as an evil vampire.

2212
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,720
He kind of looks like that, though.

2213
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,960
He's a lizard person.

2214
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,920
He does have a little luminon in his mustache,

2215
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,640
and he's like a tall, skinny, dark.

2216
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,640
He's always wearing black.

2217
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,600
He's like Dracula.

2218
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,920
Yeah, yeah.

2219
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,920
Yeah.

2220
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,920
Hey, yeah.

2221
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,880
Snake dragon look.

2222
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,880
No comment, guys.

2223
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,840
Guys, think about it.

2224
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,200
Have you ever seen Tom and a vampire in the same place

2225
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,800
at the same time?

2226
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,480
Damn, that's, he's right.

2227
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,320
He's right here.

2228
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,480
He's close.

2229
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,320
I like the little mage, not found.

2230
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,320
Yeah, I know.

2231
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,680
It's great.

2232
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,000
So I'm trying to think of who I look like,

2233
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,200
because it reminds me of a cloud.

2234
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:46,800
A cloud.

2235
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,200
I mean, no, no, no, like, like a specific character.

2236
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,560
Yeah, it reminds me of something, too.

2237
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,120
Do you look at the man in the mood?

2238
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,200
Because you're a big mood change.

2239
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,000
It might be Dumbledore a little bit.

2240
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,520
Yeah, something about, like, the way your expression.

2241
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,160
Guys, what if Dumbledore and Hagrid put on the Potara

2242
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,560
earrings and fused into a more powerful being?

2243
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,840
That's what this guy, that's me.

2244
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,480
What if Dumbledore read one piece?

2245
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,040
Whoa, which is what I was referencing just now.

2246
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,040
Definitely.

2247
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,560
What if Dumbledore ate the...

2248
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,920
Can we move on to the next fan art?

2249
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,320
Yeah, let's go.

2250
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:23,200
Tadpo drew some of what I would describe as us as in that one

2251
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:28,280
world in Psychonauts, where it's like the Mexican level.

2252
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,880
The black velvet paintings.

2253
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,320
Yeah, there's actually, there's backstory for this.

2254
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:32,800
Oh.

2255
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,720
There's a story going on.

2256
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,800
I wonder about this.

2257
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,280
The backstory is, this is actually in the

2258
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,920
Radifugures Copulars universe.

2259
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,280
And one time on some stream, we alluded to some nefarious force

2260
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,280
known as the PCP, and this is around suspicion.

2261
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,920
Because no one had known, or no one knows what the PCP is

2262
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,440
in the Radifugures Copulars universe.

2263
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,680
Because, and he only presumes some evil Illuminati,

2264
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:59,280
spirit cooking, bourgeoisie-esque league.

2265
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,520
Canonically, Deben and Munchin, are they actually members

2266
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,120
of the PCP?

2267
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,680
Well, I don't even know what the PCP is.

2268
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,600
I mean, I think that these other shadowy members are probably,

2269
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:16,320
they're probably ruling over some other scary SS cities,

2270
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,840
somewhere else in this post-apocalyptic slime world.

2271
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,400
All right, all right.

2272
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:25,320
But you know, we occasionally get together and go bowling.

2273
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,160
You shoot the craps, yeah.

2274
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,160
Yeah.

2275
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,840
Well, next, we actually get back to these Gabriel Starrmangs,

2276
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,280
sir ones, a Starrman senior.

2277
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,840
Starrmang senior, whatever.

2278
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,520
You got Action Giraffe and the PCB guy, look great.

2279
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,440
I love the PCB guy one.

2280
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,640
I love the GIFs.

2281
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,040
Click on them, make sure you click on them,

2282
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,520
because Action Giraffe's got flashing aides and sunglasses.

2283
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,960
Aides, aides, aides, aides.

2284
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,880
PCP guy's got this cool static background,

2285
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:49,720
I like that a lot.

2286
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,560
PCP guy looks fucking sick.

2287
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,400
He looks dope.

2288
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,800
It's like something from off.

2289
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,040
Yeah, it's really, it's nail-less.

2290
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,520
I'm just gonna drop this.

2291
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,720
I think it looks like something that would be

2292
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,960
in the Space Ghost OP.

2293
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,080
Sure, something like that.

2294
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,320
I hear that OP in my head when I look at it.

2295
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,520
Like, d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

2296
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,360
I do.

2297
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,440
I love the fact that his eyes are also, you know,

2298
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,280
just cropped down.

2299
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,520
It reminds me of Church of the Subgenius,

2300
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,960
who I watched a bunch of videos

2301
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,720
about the Church of the Subgenius recently.

2302
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,800
The sub, whatever.

2303
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,640
No.

2304
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:21,640
It's this like post-modern, like 80s, like pseudo cult,

2305
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,720
but it's like a joke cult, basically.

2306
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,560
But it was kind of serious, like they were actually,

2307
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,360
they actually did have churches.

2308
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,240
Gabriel, I like that you wanted to do

2309
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,640
the funny manga slash flip note studio effect,

2310
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,840
where it was like, instead of just doing all black,

2311
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,440
you did a bunch of dots together

2312
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,360
to make it look like it was gray.

2313
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,200
But instead of like just doing that,

2314
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,040
you like Google searched that and they got an image of that

2315
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,440
and then upscaled it and didn't put on nearest neighbors

2316
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,280
that looks really blurry and it's really funny.

2317
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,920
Is that what happened?

2318
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,200
I don't think that's what happened.

2319
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,680
I think this is the spray tool.

2320
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:59,000
If it were a screen tone, the dots would be uniform.

2321
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,840
Are they not?

2322
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,200
No, no, no, that's what I, no, no, no, no, Ben,

2323
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,960
I'm saying his hair, his hair.

2324
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,080
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the hair, the hair.

2325
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,400
Yep, that's a screen tone.

2326
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,240
I like it.

2327
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,160
That's a screen tone.

2328
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,480
All right.

2329
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,880
We got, I just assumed it was the actual drawing,

2330
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,080
but they're not at it, that's obviously not true.

2331
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,040
No, no, it's been redone.

2332
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,440
You guys, we've heard that,

2333
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,600
we know that people want the PCB guy

2334
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,040
and we've heard those cries

2335
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,760
and hopefully we can alleviate those fears soon.

2336
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,600
We'll get back to you.

2337
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,440
Can we?

2338
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,640
Maybe.

2339
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,460
I don't know.

2340
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,300
I don't know.

2341
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,140
My interest is peaked.

2342
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,800
Well, we'll just have to see now, won't we?

2343
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,400
I don't believe it.

2344
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:36,240
Believe it, we'll be done.

2345
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,600
Next we got from Hale on Twitter.

2346
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,480
All of us being in the DeVue collective.

2347
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,320
Yeah.

2348
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:45,120
Cleverly placing mages back to the camera

2349
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,920
because nobody knows what her face is.

2350
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,720
How intelligent.

2351
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,440
I like the color fading out from each of us.

2352
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,800
I like that.

2353
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,680
You have to have a pretty high IQ.

2354
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,240
What is up with Munchie's neck?

2355
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,720
What is the double neck?

2356
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,840
He's fucking buff.

2357
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,720
He's fucking buff and he has a thick neck.

2358
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:01,560
Thick with two seams.

2359
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,680
All right, thank you for this image,

2360
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,640
but riddle me this viewers.

2361
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,840
Why is the DeVue collective still a thing

2362
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,000
and Ben stealing Nate's shoes not a funny fucking meme?

2363
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,320
That is the best thing and funniest thing

2364
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,800
to happen in the PCB today

2365
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,120
where you're still on fucking DeVue.

2366
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,000
But it never happened because it was not theft.

2367
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,600
The funniest thing about that was Nate commenting

2368
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,240
on the video where Ben was in my backyard wearing the shoes.

2369
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,920
That was what made it fucking hilarious to me.

2370
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,440
That was great.

2371
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,280
I was like, Ben,

2372
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,160
why do you have to flaunt them like this, Ben?

2373
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,800
Why? Just tell me why.

2374
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,040
You gave them up and now they're mine

2375
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,200
to do with what I please.

2376
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,480
No, this is not right.

2377
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,320
You abandoned them.

2378
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,160
This is not right.

2379
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,000
I'm saying this.

2380
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,840
And I saved them.

2381
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,560
There's a ton of meme potential in the new episode.

2382
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,600
You guys don't realize it.

2383
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,440
I agree.

2384
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,440
The shoes are a gold mine.

2385
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,640
We have to elaborate on that.

2386
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,760
That well will never run back.

2387
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,600
Never, never.

2388
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,640
This will never be a return.

2389
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,800
The arc will never end.

2390
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,640
I gotta hope so.

2391
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,800
Once you're famous, sell those shoes

2392
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,680
for like millions and millions.

2393
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,960
Do we already finish the theme contest last week?

2394
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:00,800
No, no, no.

2395
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,520
It's going until the 31st of this month.

2396
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,800
So we've got like two or maybe three more episodes.

2397
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah, technically three more episodes including this one.

2398
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,200
We've got like five to listen to.

2399
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,320
Well, let me see real quick.

2400
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,320
We do have more.

2401
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,600
We've got one, two.

2402
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,920
We've got four to listen to.

2403
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,520
Four to listen to here.

2404
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,880
So let's just not waste any fucking time

2405
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,000
and get right into it, shall we?

2406
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,840
Yeah, please do.

2407
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,680
Here we go.

2408
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,520
First one of the year.

2409
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,360
First one of my dad's biggles.

2410
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,360
Well, isn't this his third entry?

2411
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,200
I think it is.

2412
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,040
Man, it's a monster.

2413
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:25,880
This is called China.

2414
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,160
I like his, wait, hold on.

2415
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,360
Before you say anything.

2416
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,600
I like his fucking Steve Banner on Twitter.

2417
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,680
I like his Steve Banner.

2418
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,520
He has a Steve Banner.

2419
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,160
I don't know who this person is,

2420
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,920
but I mean they just have Steve as their fucking banner.

2421
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:40,960
Like in what capacity?

2422
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,480
As the, oh, well yeah, okay.

2423
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,480
And then some anime bullshit.

2424
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,480
No, no, no, there's anime bullshit

2425
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,520
and then there's Steve on the left hand, the bird.

2426
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,360
The bird.

2427
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,200
Maybe he drew that art.

2428
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,200
The anime bullshit, we mean a picture of Luluko

2429
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,680
and also Mario.

2430
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,520
Right.

2431
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,000
That's right.

2432
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,720
Alright, here we go.

2433
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,080
Let's play it.

2434
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,840
This song is called Chop Every Onion by Das Biggles.

2435
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,000
Here we go.

2436
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,480
I love it.

2437
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,600
Well, this would be good in the PCP video game.

2438
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,520
True.

2439
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,240
Very true.

2440
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,320
I'm not really sure what this conveys.

2441
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,720
Yeah.

2442
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,720
I mean, it sounds kind of...

2443
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,720
Spacey, I guess.

2444
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,720
Yeah, it's alright.

2445
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,720
It sounds like a cave to me.

2446
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:31,720
I liked it.

2447
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,720
I liked it.

2448
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,720
I don't really see how it would be a PCP theme song, but...

2449
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:35,720
It sounds like Splunkin'.

2450
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,720
That's what it sounds to me like you're going into a cave.

2451
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,720
Yeah, I'd rather...

2452
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,720
Yeah, I'd rather...

2453
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,720
Or, like, I just picture, like, Mega Man's start screen

2454
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,720
like, where he's like, against the black sky, you know?

2455
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,720
Sure, sure.

2456
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:47,720
Kind of imagery.

2457
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,720
Again, not really PCP.

2458
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,720
When we make the PCP shitty mobile game,

2459
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,720
we'll use this as the main theme.

2460
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,720
That'll be good.

2461
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:55,720
That'll be good.

2462
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:56,720
Alright, here's our next one.

2463
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:57,720
This is from...

2464
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,720
Let me see.

2465
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,720
At Robert Floyd TV, I think.

2466
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,720
It's called PCP Theme.

2467
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,720
It's name on SoundCloud is Pope Jesus.

2468
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,720
Alright, here we go.

2469
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,720
And... go.

2470
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:27,720
Well, that was pretty hype.

2471
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,720
Yes.

2472
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,720
I don't know if that was on time for you guys, but...

2473
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,720
I heard it.

2474
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,720
I got the gist.

2475
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,720
Alright.

2476
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,720
I got the gist.

2477
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,720
Wait.

2478
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,720
Wait, was that you?

2479
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,720
Was that not part of the song?

2480
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,720
That was just me rapping just now.

2481
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,720
I was just doing that.

2482
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,720
Oh, yeah.

2483
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,720
Well, that's disappointing.

2484
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,720
Oh, yeah.

2485
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,720
If we used me, like...

2486
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,720
Well, I wouldn't...

2487
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,720
You could tell it was my voice, right?

2488
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,720
I don't know.

2489
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,720
I thought maybe you'd said that at some point.

2490
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,720
Well, that was just me rapping.

2491
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,720
Okay, well, if we used that one, like, fucking rap,

2492
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,720
put that in and rap over it.

2493
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,720
And then it'll be my favorite.

2494
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,720
I would just use a better beat than that one.

2495
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,720
Well, sure.

2496
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,720
I mean...

2497
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,720
That sounded like a football match.

2498
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,720
That sounded like one of the commercials, like, you know,

2499
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:08,720
the robot, the stupid fucking football robot.

2500
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,720
Yeah.

2501
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,720
I love those, incidentally.

2502
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,720
I'm a big fan of those football robots.

2503
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,720
I always have been.

2504
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,720
I've just never had a platform to say so, so I'm saying it now.

2505
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,720
But anyway.

2506
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:19,720
There you go.

2507
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:20,720
Next up.

2508
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:21,720
I don't know what that is.

2509
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,720
One time I got Rick Royal at the football stadium.

2510
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,720
Really?

2511
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,720
Is that true?

2512
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,720
Yeah.

2513
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,720
Yeah.

2514
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,720
Damn.

2515
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:29,720
Did they just blur it over the loudspeakers?

2516
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,720
Yeah.

2517
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,720
They blurred that and then hard and smashed cut to the hamster dance.

2518
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,720
And then smashed cut to Caramel Donson.

2519
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,720
Hell yeah.

2520
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,720
And then smashed cut to me bleeding out.

2521
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,720
Let's just make Caramel Donson the opening theme.

2522
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,720
All right.

2523
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,720
The smash cut to the next fucking song.

2524
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:44,720
Right.

2525
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,720
Here we go.

2526
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:46,720
This one's from Slam Rarn.

2527
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,720
This is called Four Fun Crastinator.

2528
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,720
Oh.

2529
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,720
It's fucking Sixten.

2530
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,720
Yeah.

2531
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:52,720
Oh.

2532
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,720
Right.

2533
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,720
Right.

2534
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,720
Here we go.

2535
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,720
Boom.

2536
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:57,720
Impress me.

2537
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,720
That was not me.

2538
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,720
That was the actual song.

2539
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,720
Incidentally.

2540
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,720
Oh, the word impress me?

2541
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:03,720
Yeah.

2542
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:04,720
That was fun.

2543
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:05,720
Oh wait.

2544
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,720
I did.

2545
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,720
I did.

2546
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,720
I did.

2547
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,720
I did.

2548
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,720
I did.

2549
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,720
I did.

2550
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,720
I did.

2551
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,720
I did.

2552
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,720
I did.

2553
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,720
I did.

2554
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,720
I did.

2555
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,720
I did.

2556
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,720
I mean, that was a great song to hear.

2557
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Memento.

2558
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
I love the music.

2559
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,720
There's kind of funny music.

2560
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,720
I really don't like ASMR.

2561
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,720
I'm sorry.

2562
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,720
Oh.

2563
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,720
Do you know it.

2564
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,720
I consider it.

2565
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,720
That's the song.

2566
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,720
I'm really confused about what's real and what's fake

2567
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,720
OK.

2568
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,720
I forgot.

2569
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,720
This was already entered, but we did a meme last episode,

2570
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:42,720
where we just said, play PCP.

2571
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,720
We're like put words over the song because we like it,

2572
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:45,720
but it needs words.

2573
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,360
So he literally took those clips and put them over the sun

2574
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,200
Guess what it fucking is great?

2575
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,700
The guitar playing was really sloppy and hippo could do better

2576
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,760
Well, yeah, but he didn't so fuck

2577
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,880
Apply for the contest I have no rights. That's true. He's got no rights

2578
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,680
Okay

2579
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:14,520
Wrongs we got we got one more. We got one more today. This is from sick Rick

2580
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:22,000
It's called faggots. Hey, it's called faggots. Whoa name of the song. I got high hopes 37 seconds. Here we go

2581
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,040
Faggots

2582
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Faggots

2583
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
To faggots

2584
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,520
Faggots

2585
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:54,240
It sounds like sick Rick just wants to do a sequel to his album that he did for Jesse. Yeah

2586
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:01,480
The one person who is not even on the podcast that he was the only one featured at the theme song apparently

2587
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:06,040
Yeah, I'm not sure that which I mean is true. Anyways, this is Jesse's world. We're just living it

2588
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,920
Sam you're right. You're right. I love the album

2589
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,800
I'm wondering if he used my faggot compilation. That was what I thought that's what I assumed

2590
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:20,680
I bet he did. I like the the like really bit crushed guitar tone sound, you know, it sounded pretty good

2591
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:25,720
I kind of want to animate that kind of remind me of the song underground from a green lagoon the ending theme

2592
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,520
Yeah, it does sound like that. It was grimy. I think I think I think totally it was right on point

2593
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,880
Yeah, right on point my humble opinion. It was pretty good. Yeah. I liked it. Yeah, I really needed

2594
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:40,600
I'm just gonna make a bunch myself and submit them. I'm just gonna submit my own do it, dude

2595
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,160
I'll just be in the contest with everybody else

2596
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,080
Do it so I can downvote you to hell. I can't wait. I can't wait

2597
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:54,440
Uh, well, that's that's that we're all done with that shit. So okay, so we got I just I just realized there's seven of us in here

2598
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:00,360
It's what I said, you would have the full house true. That's what I said. Oh my god beforehand

2599
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:05,480
But you can also get fucked. Uh, well, we guys you guys got two more chances

2600
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:08,680
There's there's two more pcb episodes where we're taking submissions

2601
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,640
So that's it. You got two two weeks left basically. So good luck

2602
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,440
Then we can put this to fuck kind of and then we'll put it to rest

2603
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,640
I mean, I've been loving this personally, but uh, you know, I get it

2604
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:24,440
Do you remember that we record pcb episodes a week before you hear them? So, you know, oh, no, we'll now known wait

2605
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:29,800
Oh, fuck. That's right. No, okay. Well the fact remains that by the time you're hearing this

2606
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:35,480
Uh, we will have two more things to record. So when you hear this, you will have like eight days

2607
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,560
I love like eight days to get it in when you hear this

2608
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,960
Uh, so there you go. There you go

2609
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:44,040
All right. Well, that's done. Let's get to the fucking questions. It's time to go. It's time to go

2610
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:48,520
So far I've only found one that I even made sense as a question and it was uh,

2611
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,640
Who else do you want to have as a guest on the pcb?

2612
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:57,400
I I wouldn't mind having zen huckstable on sometime if he was interested because he's real cool and I like him a lot

2613
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:03,080
Sure. No idea who that is. Yes. I know that lad. He's a boston boy. He's he's an anime youtuber who is

2614
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:07,960
Who we we hung out with uh, he was he was in he's really I like him a lot

2615
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:10,040
Was he in the in the six and eggs video?

2616
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:16,120
He was like off camera. No, he was not I don't think he was at he was not there because he was there the night before

2617
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:18,760
He was not at our house at the time that was recorded, but uh

2618
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:25,480
But yeah, no, um, I hung out with them all day that day. It was cool. He uh, I'm a patron. So a word, you know

2619
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:30,520
Check your stuff out. He does his videos are really interesting because they're not they're they're

2620
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,640
He doesn't bother like editing them

2621
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:37,240
Like he doesn't bother trying to make them like amazing and I don't mean not editing

2622
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,680
But like he'll have blank screen and he'll just put images

2623
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:44,680
And it's like he doesn't give that much of a fuck but the videos work anyways

2624
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,160
And it kind of opened my eyes to the fact that like

2625
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:53,560
You know, it really isn't about how much effort you put in it's about that's what what images you put in

2626
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:57,320
You know, yeah, I've taken some influence from that, but uh, anyway, he's definitely

2627
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,840
There's a question directed at me

2628
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,640
Okay, all right, so what question from age

2629
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:11,480
From king salman and do you relate to slav memes and how close uh to slavs are lafianians? Well, like

2630
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,800
historically

2631
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,640
or like, um

2632
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:19,080
Genetically, I'm not too sure because like lafianians are bolts

2633
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:25,880
And slavs are slavs and like russians and polish people. I think are slavs. So like we're not the same thing

2634
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:29,480
However, like the fienia is inhabited or you know

2635
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:33,080
It has been inhabited by a lot of russians and polish people and stuff like that

2636
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,480
So like we're neighbors as well countries

2637
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:41,000
So I sort of relate to the whole slav memes in a way because I have seen people like that around

2638
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,200
And it's I found I find them funny

2639
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,080
Here's here's one. I actually am interested in answering

2640
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:54,120
Eric c bass asks if the content of your podcast slash channels didn't exist. Would you ever consider running for political office?

2641
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:58,920
Yes, I think about this all the time. Uh, I I would love to run for political office

2642
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,840
I think it'd be really cool, uh, and it would be great and I would love to do the reason that I

2643
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:08,280
Who the fuck would want the reason I don't want to do that is because to run for political office

2644
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,360
You are going to have to like

2645
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:17,080
You have to participate in the system as it is and I would rather influence people to want the system to be different

2646
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,560
So like I think I think I have a lot more

2647
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:26,360
I just think that there's a lot more potential for me to affect the system by just changing people's minds in a broad sense

2648
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,800
As opposed to

2649
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,320
Trying to be

2650
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:35,080
Even slightly clean, you know to try to like be a guy like like hunter thompson who is my idol

2651
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,160
He ran for sheriff of his town

2652
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:44,520
He almost won except that the the other two parties last minute colluded together to to prevent it like they realized that they were in

2653
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,400
Shit and so they they fucking you know blocked him out

2654
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:51,880
Using lots of dirty tactics that you can only have by having shit loads of money by being

2655
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:56,360
In the bed, you know of of the lobbyists and everything the the political machine and like

2656
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:01,720
There's no real way for that much of an outsider voice to break in because they are going to shut you out

2657
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:06,200
So rather I just run from I just go from the sidelines and make people

2658
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:10,040
Want the system to be different and that is how I'll overthrow

2659
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:15,400
I completely understand all the corruption that there is in government and all the stuff like that and and and it would be

2660
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,040
It would be for the most part just paperwork and boring

2661
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:23,400
But I just have a romantic idea of speeches and just and just like the american government as a whole

2662
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:29,960
Just just go into washington getting things done being being a patriot. I think I think it's cool. I mean, maybe when we're older

2663
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:33,320
Maybe when we're in like, you know, no we're barred forever actually

2664
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,520
Please drop munch boy goes to washington. I want to see him all dressed up on the campaign trail

2665
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,680
I want to see him in a cute and kind, the pop culture

2666
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:47,160
If the world changed to be the kind of world that we are wanting it to be that we're pushing for it to be

2667
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:51,000
There's a chance you would still be a political candidate in your later years

2668
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,800
I I think about running for office even now with everything exactly as it is

2669
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:58,920
Now, I'll probably never do it for many of the reasons that digi brought up

2670
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:04,680
But I I mean i'm agnostic as to whether or not my youtube career has made that an impossibility

2671
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,520
I mean you have said nigger a lot

2672
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:11,480
I think that like let's just say 10 years pass. I think if I just say oh, it was a crazy kid

2673
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:14,920
I think that excuse holds some I don't know. I don't know if that works

2674
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,600
I mean, please please do me a favor future future political opponents

2675
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:24,360
Do not use this clip as a way to prove that I am in fact totally

2676
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,800
Insincere about the thing that I just said and do not regret anything

2677
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:34,520
Please do me a favor. Do not cite this very clip to use that against me in my 2050 political run. Thank you

2678
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,120
uh

2679
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,120
Yeah, munchie was

2680
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:42,200
Referring to a video that I made about there was this game show in

2681
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,520
It's called i'm celebrity get me out of here

2682
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:48,760
Which is like a bunch of celebrities go in the jungle and they have to do tasks and it's like big brother

2683
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:53,880
But in the jungle and um, it's all fun and games and there was this one for this the first time

2684
01:46:54,600 --> 01:47:01,160
A youtube celebrity instead of like a regular normal television celebrity was on the show and it was a big deal

2685
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,360
um, but people

2686
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:08,120
Because he's like new media and they didn't like the fact that he was getting

2687
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:11,640
You know, he's got millions of followers and they didn't want him to get any more

2688
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:13,480
Or you know, I don't know who it was

2689
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:18,040
But like people sifted through his twitter to get something that he said when he was 17

2690
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:24,120
He said somebody was a bitch when he was 17 and that was enough to get him like in trouble

2691
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,680
And he decided to leave the show to like defend himself with his lawyers and stuff

2692
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,240
And it was really

2693
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,840
It was really like

2694
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:37,800
Because he said they dug that right up like this was like the beginning of twitter. He was really young

2695
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,920
Was it for swearing or was it because misogyny?

2696
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:45,880
I don't I don't really realize it doesn't matter all that matters is that the media created a circus about it

2697
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:51,880
And you know, you know the corporations will fire you because it doesn't even matter if people if like actual people give a fuck

2698
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:57,640
All that matters is that someone said something and the easiest way for us to cover our hassles to fire somebody

2699
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,680
You know what's interesting about this

2700
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:04,680
I've actually been kind of keeping eye on like sargon of akkad specifically is doing a thing right now

2701
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:07,960
Where he's like getting actually involved in politics in britain

2702
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,760
And like he's a guy who said a lot of bullshit online

2703
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,720
And i'm just very interested to see how it goes for him if he's like able to go badly

2704
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,680
A lot of people think that he has no chance like like uh, mr.

2705
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:23,880
Medeker has has been on a lot of live streams talking like he has said like he's called people white niggers

2706
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:29,400
He's like blah blah blah said all this bullshit like there's no way famously he he did this tweet to jess philips like his

2707
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:34,440
A p.m. Or something he said, uh, I wouldn't even say grab him by the pussy and that

2708
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,200
I mean, I would argue that grab him by the pussy is totally not sargon is no sargon is no trump

2709
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:44,440
You know, he has he does not have these are gone actually running for office

2710
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:51,080
I know he joined u-kit party. No, no, i'm not saying he's running for office. I'm saying he's getting involved in politics

2711
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:55,960
Well, he's been he's been scurred in that line for a while now. I guess you could say that sargon that yeah

2712
01:48:55,960 --> 01:49:01,560
Like if trump could get elected anyone can even someone who who's no i didn't mean to say but sargon's just not famous

2713
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,360
I didn't mean to say that anyone could get elected. I just meant that he you can say fucked things

2714
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:11,320
You just have to be you have to be trump. You have to be donald fucking trump like, you know

2715
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:16,680
If he didn't win like it's not just that he won in spite of that he won because he's he's donald trump

2716
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,680
He's way bigger than that statement

2717
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:23,080
You know, of course like sargon is someone who you could just easily bury under the dumb shit

2718
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:27,960
He said because it's innumerable. I hear what you're saying. I am just simply interested to see how it goes

2719
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,160
We'll see we'll see. All right. We got to wrap this up. So I got a poop

2720
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:38,680
So happy d says something related to me specifically. Okay. Why is munchies so angry these days?

2721
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,200
Did something happen in his personal life? Is he with a child?

2722
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,600
Am I

2723
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:51,160
Uh, maybe he's referring to your your much discussed hatred of the pcp, you know just in general

2724
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:57,640
Oh, maybe I don't know. Maybe that's what it's about. I don't know. That's not that's not hatred. That's that's that's that's

2725
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:05,320
Fucking revolutionary fever. That's that's fucking that that that's fucking i'm lying. I'm lying the candle that will explode

2726
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:09,560
Because we're surrounded by methane at all times. Well, that's what I'm that's not anger

2727
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,360
Fair enough

2728
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:20,440
I see a question here by kajuro bit of thorn, which is a very interesting question that i'm surprised hasn't been asked yet

2729
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:27,480
Okay, uh, how much time does it take to edit these podcast episodes? And what are the best and worst parts of doing it?

2730
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:30,120
Oh, well, we have an answer for this for sure

2731
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:34,120
Yeah, because a lot of us have edited the podcast and um

2732
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:39,480
Well, I have I have not edited the podcast since the new since like the new

2733
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,320
Format yeah, we've been introducing lots of new

2734
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:49,160
Styles and rules and like it really depends on who you ask like if you're talking about like

2735
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:53,960
Deveu editing or me with the uh, the ghibli cast we've been like

2736
01:50:54,680 --> 01:51:00,680
Literally like editing every fucking second of the audio to make it clean, but like pcp editing normally

2737
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,640
Half an hour, I don't know

2738
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,600
Digi that's hilarious. You think editing a pcp takes half back in my day

2739
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:12,520
It's a cat when I when I was doing it would it would take an hour tops

2740
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:17,320
Okay, well, here's the thing now that we have to do this stupid after effects glowy thing

2741
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:21,800
Just rendering that out takes about six hours and then you have to re-rendering

2742
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,880
Is not editing a rendering doesn't count

2743
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,720
I mean rendering always took a fucking eternity because it's a long-ass podcast

2744
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:34,360
I would say just what quality are you rendering it in because I've always done podcast exclusively in 480p because

2745
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:42,280
I've had fans literally tell me like don't render it above 480 because it's audio only and like

2746
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,440
It's just a bigger load on my phone

2747
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,680
That makes sense. It's a fair fair point

2748
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,560
Like it's a bigger load on the uh, I don't know. I don't know

2749
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:55,000
I mean most most phone plans now at least in the us if you're on um, if you're on cell service

2750
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:01,800
They automatically downgrade everything to 480p to save the carrier on data. So yeah, why would you look at youtube on data?

2751
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:03,480
That's insane

2752
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:08,120
Uh, that's insane because because here in america. I haven't unlimited data. Yeah, I've got unlimited data too

2753
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:11,080
Well, that's uh

2754
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,360
I hate that

2755
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:17,100
Carrots over there. I still didn't want the carrots over there in brun

2756
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,480
Huh, I still didn't know you're still dealing with the carrots over there carrots

2757
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:26,840
Yeah, yeah, the the raisin minutes the the carrots minutes the fun for raisin the carrots

2758
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,920
I have no idea what you're talking about. The fuck you saying anyway next week on the pc. Bye

2759
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:38,760
Before we go everybody remember patreon.com slash the procrastinators do us a favor give us a dollar get in our server

2760
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:41,560
Wait, I didn't even get to answer the question. Oh, oh, okay

2761
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:45,240
The worst part about editing is when one person has

2762
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,400
audio problems

2763
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,400
with such as noise

2764
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,080
Where like

2765
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:53,800
Usually you listen to it and you you make sure it's okay

2766
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:58,120
But if somebody has like a big noise thing that you can't really get rid of

2767
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:04,280
I have to like go through and like chop out every instance that whether or not talking to get rid of it

2768
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:10,600
For me, it was always just like trying to get the levels all equal like I would just impossible

2769
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:14,360
It like never works all the way through it's it's impossible because not everybody

2770
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:16,760
compresses their audio before they sense it

2771
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:21,240
And it's kind of a hassle to open it in audacity and then compress it and then put it back in

2772
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:25,400
Yeah, I have done that before. Yeah, it isn't knowing we this is why we need pcphq

2773
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:31,160
So we can all record in a controlled environment. We're all using the same equipment and this wouldn't be a big of a deal anymore

2774
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:35,880
Well, it's coming soon. I haven't patreon.com slash make it real

2775
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
Yeah, by the way everybody we

2776
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,160
Just just for the record

2777
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:48,440
We did go five hundred dollars over budget on the Kickstarter. So I didn't get paid. Oh, so just saying well actually technically

2778
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:54,680
You actually did get a little money back. Uh, oh, I did. Yeah, as it worked out. You got a little bit of money

2779
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:00,760
Um, and many of us I made a cool three dollars indeed, but you know, you know, that's the negative side

2780
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:04,600
Here's the here's the positive side guys. Well, we got to do rad rad come through

2781
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:10,600
Happen. Yeah content is unbelievable. It's mostly is that a real figure three dollars. Yeah, he really got paid that much

2782
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:15,400
Although none of the biggest stuff is out yet. So keep your hype levels up other than the rad shot

2783
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:20,120
We still have a lot of like really huge ones the good and I mean people fucking got their merch now

2784
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:23,640
So they've got the items that I see people talking about them and loving the shirts and thank god

2785
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:28,520
Thank god that that all made it. I was very afraid that like people weren't gonna get shit or something

2786
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:33,080
Like if anybody like give give it like at least another week, but if you should have gotten your shit and haven't

2787
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:36,440
Uh dm me or message me on twitter and I'll look into it

2788
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,040
But uh, yeah, I'll make tom help me to figure out how to

2789
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:44,200
Actually make all the stuff you are still owed for the plea for the weave kick starter

2790
