1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Hey everybody, welcome to yet another Pro Crastinators Podcast interview. Long, long fucking time coming, this one.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm finally interviewing the man behind the channel, really.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Yeah, the man behind the curtain.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Definitely, it's like actually an official position now. You are the manager of the channel.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You always kind of were, but now it's like we actually have like a documentation that you get paid to be that guy.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's true, and I am underpaid for all the work I do, but I understand that, and it's a passion project anyway, so I'm cool with it.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So what is it with the, like what the hell is the deal with the, you get these fucking feet away from me, you fucking dude.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I got my feet off sticking over his face, okay.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're the same room by the way, he's visiting my house.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Yeah.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
There you go, yeah.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Visiting Cincinnati.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Not doing video because this is three fucking hours long, and you know.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a hassle.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Who the fuck wants to render three hours? Who wants to look presentable for three hours?

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
That's the real thing, I don't know.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,500
We both got our pants, like, riding all the way up into our crotches and shit, trying to expose as much leg as possible in this 99 degree house.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Hey, maybe that's the problem for you, dude. I look good as fuck. Everyone loves my legs. Check that Aromanga video.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Yeah, that's true. People love it.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,500
So, Nate, you essentially started the PCP.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
True.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Well, you're the one who sort of, I guess we all had this idea that it would happen, that we would have a podcast together.

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And then we kind of sussed it out. You're the one who sort of took charge, started the channel.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
And you've been on every episode but one.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
The one that Nino was on.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Racist.

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Nate is a goddamn racist.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Yeah, I would have been there too, if I had.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I was out of town in, like, Washington or something at the time.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,500
And the funny thing about it is that, like, even though you've kind of been, like, even though you run the channel, you've been on every episode, you clearly have the most investment.

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I don't think anybody realized it, like, until we started doing the Patreon, because we created, or you created, probably, a table of, like, who all had been on every episode.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And you're on all of them. We were like, what the fuck?

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Oh, that actually wasn't me. The credit for that goes to the, like, the fans, the PCP fan chat.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
They were the ones who actually made that.

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,500
But, yeah, it was interesting to look back at it and see how Nate, on every single one, except for one.

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
What is it, like, I want to know why? Like, why are you so into the PCP?

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Because nobody else seems to give a fuck about it.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:33,500
That is true. It's really simple, dude. It's really simple. It's that I see all of you guys as incredibly valuable resources that I am interested in maintaining, excuse me, a relationship with for, you know, for whatever purposes.

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:42,500
And so, you know, because, you know, we've been saying for a long time, we used to have this countless times, but, like, we are interested in the idea of doing projects together, in general.

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:53,500
And the PCP is, like, one, just, it's just an excuse to, like, keep us together, to keep us doing stuff and involved in each other's shit.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Because, you know, as you've seen, like, I'm the guy who generally pushes for what little space for collabs there is between us, like, in the Monster Musume video and stuff.

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:11,500
So, I'm more than any of it, because, you know, like, my dream job is what Red Letter Media does, having a crew running shit, you know, making stuff, like, having a...

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
It's like, they've got a life living with their friends, doing exactly what they want to do.

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,500
And, I don't know, like, they divvy up the work and the profits amongst themselves, and they've got incentives to succeed and play the game well.

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
And that seems to me like the perfect life. So, out of purely selfish reasons, I'm interested in keeping everybody together.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:38,500
These people who are very talented, you know, all you guys, and have these skills that many of which I don't have, that are, you know, we fill each other's holes and stuff in a very gay way.

49
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah. Extra gay.

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
So, let me emphasize that.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
That's right. Please. And that's really the long and short of it, you know.

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Because, like, before the PCP, before we started that, like, we weren't doing anything together.

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,500
And we were hanging out in the fan chat, or not just, you know, like, a chat that we called Procrastinators, and that was fine.

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
But, and, you know, we've been saying, like, hey, we should do a podcast, we should do a podcast.

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I mean, we had done podcasts together before.

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
The horse cast and whatnot.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Which is sort of how we understood that we would all, like, cause the horse cast were great.

58
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,500
And we all loved them, and we all thought that they were worthwhile, so it was, like, obviously we could do this together.

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,500
It was just that someone had to, like, go through the rigmarole of making a fucking channel and, like, naming it and doing all that shit.

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
And just knowing that it...

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
That's what I'm good at, actually doing the shit no one wants to do.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,500
And it was a question of, like, how interested is any, like, whose channel is this going to be on, and if it's its own channel, how are we going to grow it?

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Like, is any of our individual audiences going to care?

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Cause, um, there's sort of a push and pull with the PCP, where this is, like, the greatest advantage and the greatest problem with it,

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
is that it inherently causes people to associate all of us with each other.

66
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Right.

67
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,500
And this is, like, the benefit of that is that, um, you know, we have lots of cross promotion.

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,500
If we do collabs and people get it, people can become a fan of us as a group and stuff like that.

69
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Uh, but then the negative parts are, like, that we just kind of get sucked into one another's enigma, in a way.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You know, like, uh, there's ways that our channels are all different, and they shouldn't necessarily be, like, having the same viewership and stuff like that.

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
It's right, right.

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:19,500
And so, in a way, it was a question at times, like, especially in the beginning of, like, well, I'm friends with best guy ever.

73
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
If we make a podcast, that makes perfect sense to each of us.

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Sure.

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
But our audiences might have no idea who one another are.

76
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Um, like, for me, the biggest problem with doing a podcast with you and Jesse, in particular, is that you guys are very edgy.

77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Uh, not, like, intentionally.

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I don't mean to say, like, oh-

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Remember, kill a kill one back in the day that you had to put a big disclaimer at the beginning of?

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Yeah.

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Well, just, like, what I mean by edgy is, like, not like you're going out of your way to be, but just like, you guys have no filter.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah.

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:56,500
And I had always had, like, much more of a, you know, I'd never tried to be, like, politically incorrect to put it simply.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Um, especially back then, because I was coming out of the pony days.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And I was like, I was borderline SJW in some ways, you know, like, not that I, I believe in joking about other stuff.

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
I believe, like, hey, I don't have to think this stuff to talk about it.

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,500
And now I do, like, insufferable social media argument, which is beyond the impossible level.

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
You've had your journey along this road, yeah.

89
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Because I see it as, like, if people don't get it, fuck them.

90
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
You know, it's not our job to make it understandable for them.

91
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,500
But back then, I was like, a lot of my audience isn't going to get this.

92
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:35,500
They're going to hear the constant misogyny jokes and be like, I don't like this and I'm upset that you participated this.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Well, you know, I mean, for me, I think a lot of it comes from, like, my many, many years spent on 4chan.

94
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:50,500
And I'll defend that place till the day I die because I love this little niche community of people who retell their own jokes endlessly.

95
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Perfect the art of telling their fucking jokes.

96
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And, you know, it is fun to have, like, a little area where, you know, you can make jokes that are incredibly offensive and everyone gets it and everyone's laughing.

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
And that's the thing about, I think the problem with 4chan is when people bring it out of 4chan.

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Like, Jesse hates 4chan to death and he hates everything about it, but it wouldn't be a problem if those people were containing it in 4chan.

99
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Sure.

100
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,500
And that's the thing is, like, when people defend 4chan, they always talk about, oh, the internet's the Wild Wild West.

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
It's the only place where you can be, like, everybody can be yourself.

102
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It's like, yeah, do that there. That is the Wild Wild West.

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
The rest of the internet has been, it's been homesteaded.

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
You know, people are, you can't, like, the internet is real life now.

105
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,500
You know, like, Facebook, your whole family's on there, your job is on there, and the things you say have consequences in the real world.

106
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
So, like, you've got to deal with that.

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
We have to get into the specifics of, like, the particular issues here.

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Because, like, if the issue is, like, people are saying shitty things to you in your YouTube comments section, like, what can you do?

109
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Like, people are always going to be jerks.

110
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
If it's, like, them, like, giving you death threats, like, I mean, that's a different, we're having a different conversation at that point.

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:10,500
What I mean really is that, like, it used to be that people saw the internet as a place where you can just be an asshole because it's not the real world.

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Even I don't subscribe to that.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,500
But the internet is the real world now, you know, so it's like, rather than see the entire internet as, oh, it's a place where you can go to be an asshole,

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
no, the internet is the real world.

115
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,500
But 4chan is a place where you can just go be an asshole, and it should be that way.

116
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
When I, when I am on 4chan...

117
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Just don't take it off 4chan.

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,500
When I'm on 4chan, I am a big shitposting piece of shit who's deliberately out there to make people angry.

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,500
When I log into my Gaia online account, you know, I'm a delight.

120
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
I'm a gentleman, a scholar.

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
I'm tipping my fedora all day, you know, when I'm not closing the pool.

122
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,500
It's just about, you know, knowing who your audience is, what company you're in, and because most of the internet is rampant autism, they don't know about it.

123
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I was going to say, it's a lack of social awareness for what you're doing.

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,500
People who bring that kind of super edgy humor out of the proper context, that's their problem.

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
They're fucking up, and, you know, they'll be probably socially punished accordingly.

126
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Guys like Jesse will shit on them and tell them to die and whatnot.

127
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:18,500
And, yeah, but like, I do want to talk to you about 4chan, because you are a long time 4chaner, and I am too.

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Like, I've never been like a huge memer.

129
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I've never been on B, like, at all.

130
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
I think I went there once, and never again.

131
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Were you ever a B-tard?

132
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I was really never a B-tard at any point.

133
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Monkey's probably a bigger B-tard than I am.

134
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
I don't even think he is.

135
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
He was like an R9K guy.

136
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

137
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,500
No, I've spent like 90%, 90% of my time on 4chan historically was on V.

138
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
And V is like B-light, in a way.

139
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Like, V is the second most popular word.

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
V is at least on topic, though.

141
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Well, I mean, the shit-poster would disagree.

142
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,500
They would complain about those fucking hot pocket eating mods,

143
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
not doing their goddamn job, keeping shit on topic.

144
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Too many fucking E-celebs, man.

145
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Yeah, I've spent...

146
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
V really is like its own little culture.

147
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, I mean, that's what I love about 4chan in general.

148
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Every board has its own culture.

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I've got a friend, John, who's a gigantic TV board goer.

150
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
And all the time, he'll tell me about these jokes that...

151
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I don't know how anyone lives on TV.

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Monkey's a TV guy, too.

153
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
They've got their own culture, dude.

154
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
TV is awful.

155
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
It seems...

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Okay, everyone says that...

157
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
That board is...

158
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
It's like literally...

159
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
It's literally 50% Bane posting.

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
And 50% is this Kino.

161
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
And that's every fucking thread.

162
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
You're missing the...

163
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Oh, God, what's that guy's name?

164
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Like, there's that pedophile from the Nickelodeon Network.

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Like, there's posting about him all the time.

166
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I don't know who you're talking about.

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I mean, Bane posting's a bit...

168
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I forget...

169
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
There's a fucking joke.

170
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
People from TV correct me in the comments.

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I forget what it is.

172
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Third Night Rises came out in, like, 2011.

173
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
It's become its own universe, dude.

174
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
It became real, as I think Monkey documented in one of his recent videos.

175
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah, the porno parody.

176
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Well, the porno...

177
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,500
But even more than that, there was an incident of a plane crash with no survivors over Le Bain in France.

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,500
And at the wreckage site, you could see, like, guys who look like Dr. Pavel and CIA in the crowd.

180
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
And the flight number was for you.

181
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
So, like, their efforts made this thing real.

182
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
It became real.

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
It was a...

184
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
What's the word?

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
It's like a standalone complex.

186
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
That's...

187
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Yeah.

188
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,500
That's what it is.

189
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Yeah.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
So...

191
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
But yeah, so you've been on V forever.

192
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Yeah.

193
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
And I was gonna say A, to a massive degree.

194
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Yeah, I've been on A forever.

195
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
And also fit.

196
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Those are the three boards that I historically went on.

197
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Yeah, you worshiped the altar of Zizz.

198
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I actually was...

199
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I mean, I like Zizz.

200
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I respect him.

201
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
He made some mistakes, which got him killed, unfortunately.

202
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
What did he die from?

203
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, he had, like, a heart issue, and he was in a Bangladesh brothel.

204
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
And he was doing a bunch of, like, speed or something.

205
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Of course.

206
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Of course.

207
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Of course.

208
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
What better fate for a member of fit...

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
It's a good way to go.

210
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
...than to die.

211
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
It's a good way to go.

212
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
It's fucking taking his feet in a brothel in Bangladesh.

213
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
There's no every fit.

214
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
This is why you worship him.

215
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Of course.

216
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
He lived the dream.

217
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
And he...

218
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
He died the dream.

219
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
He has, you know, he's heart cracked out.

220
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
His heart, like, blue or something.

221
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
But actually, you know, much more than Zizz...

222
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Did he die balls deep?

223
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I don't know, man.

224
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I hope he died balls deep.

225
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
I don't know.

226
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I don't know if that was in the police reports.

227
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I'd like to find out, though.

228
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,160
You know, Monkey wants to travel to Isla Vista to interview the people to find out what was

229
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,500
really going down with Elliot that fateful day.

230
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,140
I got to go to Bangladesh and talk some prostitutes for a little bit.

231
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:32,140
But really, Scooby 1961, or just Scooby, is my real fitness hero, who I've been watching

232
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,300
for many years.

233
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,380
He is a god of fitness.

234
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,820
He taught me everything I know.

235
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,500
Like the sticky on fit has a link to a bunch of stuff that's relevant.

236
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
And I read Starting Strength and all that stuff.

237
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,500
But Scooby's videos were really what taught me, piece by piece.

238
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,940
And you know, I've got a long way to go.

239
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,660
So like, everyone says I'm really fit, but all I see is like all the inadequacies I still

240
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,900
have in terms of that shit.

241
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
I can lose 10 pounds.

242
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,940
What body are you trying to get?

243
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,660
I would like, well, I mean, I know what he's a meme, but like, like Vegan Gaines has a great

244
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,020
body or Jack's Blade has like a great body.

245
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
I like to get that.

246
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,100
Jack's Blade is like maximum, Jack's Blade is like 3% body fat cut.

247
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Yeah.

248
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I mean, he's super cut, which is great.

249
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,220
I don't know if you're trying to be like a cut guy.

250
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,740
I know I am going for a cut guy.

251
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
I'm purely interested in these sets.

252
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,340
And then you do have a long way to go.

253
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,380
I have no interest whatsoever in like functional strength.

254
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
Just don't give a shit.

255
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm only interested in looking pretty.

256
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,460
So everybody, if you care about fitness, Scooby 1961 on YouTube, he's a god.

257
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,820
Let me tell you the quick pitch for this guy.

258
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,260
He cares about fitness incredibly, dedicatedly.

259
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,540
His whole life is devoted to it.

260
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
That's actually not true.

261
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,180
He's an engineer, which he, that's actually a great thing about the guy.

262
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,500
He's so able to devote his time efficiently between being a fucking engineer, which he's

263
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,300
retired of now, and just like builds a plane in his garage that he makes videos about.

264
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,820
And then fitness, which he does just as a pure passion thing.

265
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,820
And he's totally dedicated to doing it all for almost free, as little as possible.

266
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,660
Like he's about getting you fit for free, unlike those fucking six pack shortcuts, you

267
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,100
know, all those pieces of shit faggots.

268
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,340
They're trying to take advantage of people and this craze.

269
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,500
Scooby is a fucking philanthropist trying to better humanity and he's a hero for doing

270
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
so.

271
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
You ever end a Hodge Twins?

272
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,540
Actually, yeah, but I usually watch their, I watched a little bit of their fitness stuff.

273
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,820
I was always more interested in their, I'm doing the head shake thing.

274
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,260
They do, balls deep, them sugar walls.

275
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
Yeah.

276
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,620
I have watched a lot of their stuff.

277
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,620
I'm blowing up the fucking mic.

278
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,780
For fitness, a little bit, but Scooby's the best.

279
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,780
You can't do better than Scooby.

280
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,500
I think the, I think maybe part of the reason I've never gotten fit is that the only fitness

281
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
channel I follow is Bro Science.

282
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,380
It leads you down a dark path.

283
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,380
Yeah.

284
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,100
Well, because I had friends who were big into fitness and fit, so I know all these guys

285
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,380
are talking about just from them, but like the only one I actually followed was Bro Science.

286
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,300
Bro Science Life is just one of the funniest one, but he'll put you in, not T-Rex mode,

287
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,100
the opposite of T-Rex mode, where you only work out your upper body and don't do likes

288
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
or likes.

289
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,180
Well, they'll also put you into like heart attack at 30 mode, because it's all about

290
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,420
like drinking and during the weights and doing random shit.

291
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,140
You know, he's sometimes, guys who are intense into fitness can get a little too cut up in

292
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
the game.

293
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,980
You got to learn to enjoy life sometimes, and I'm just, I'm just saying Bro Science

294
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,940
Life is there to remind us of that sometimes.

295
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,500
So he serves, even though he's a big meme, he still serves a purpose, and he's, he's

296
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
a fit boy.

297
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
He's funny as hell.

298
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Yeah, he's great.

299
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Um, yeah, so you spent all that time on fit, you've got, you've learned how to be a fit

300
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
boy.

301
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
More or less, yeah.

302
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,500
Um, I'm surprised you're not going for Commina body.

303
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,660
Well, the thing, I've, oh, don't trust me, I've analyzed Commina's body.

304
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,420
Commina is really not that fit.

305
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,500
You can get way more fit than Commina's level.

306
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Yeah.

307
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,380
But I mean, one of my goals in life is to be able to do a decent Commina cosplay, and

308
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
I've got-

309
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,380
I think you're close.

310
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,620
You just need to lose a little midsection weight.

311
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
That's true.

312
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,340
Yeah, yeah, and get a little tan.

313
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm not doing the tattoos.

314
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
I don't know.

315
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
That's something I think about doing that.

316
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
I love Commina.

317
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Want to be him?

318
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
He's my hero.

319
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
That was like-

320
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,340
There you go.

321
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,780
My brother Victor, like his whole high school career was, I got to get Commina's body and

322
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
get the tattoos.

323
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,980
One of those guys, yeah.

324
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,180
You know, I was never, um, uh, the guy who really got me, I started my whole fitness

325
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,820
journey and I, you know, went on and off of it, but it started in really an elementary

326
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,180
school and then I took a couple of years off just because I didn't know what the fuck

327
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,180
I was doing.

328
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,060
I went to an elementary school when I saw DBZ and, uh, specifically-

329
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Everybody, man.

330
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
It was Goku.

331
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,060
Yeah, it's everybody.

332
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Everybody who grew up on DBZ, like, what the hell?

333
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,180
It's, yeah, I didn't watch Dragon Ball, I had just seen DBZ and, uh, we had, we were

334
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,260
moving around, uh, my, you know, my parents were moving us around a little bit and we

335
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,460
didn't have cable for a long time and occasionally I had seen the show and, like, when I would

336
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,220
go over to a friend's house, see the show called Dragon Ball Z and I was like, what,

337
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
what is this thing?

338
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,220
This looks crazy.

339
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,900
Like, I remember being blown away by the fact that there were, like, a story that continued

340
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
between episodes.

341
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah.

342
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,420
This is my fucking mind, dude.

343
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,340
Um, and I just, one day we finally got cable and was finally able to, like, sit down and

344
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,780
be like, oh, so this is what the show is and it fucking expanded my horizons.

345
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,940
I was like, I want to, I want to train, I want to be strong like this guy.

346
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,380
So the first time I started going to the gym was when I was like, like, younger than 12,

347
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,140
like 10, and I didn't do it very long at that point, but that was when the seed was planted

348
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,900
that would, you know, bloom to an extent later on.

349
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,740
Do you think Dragon Ball Z has done more for fitness than Naruto has done for ramen?

350
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Absolutely yes.

351
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
Absolutely yes.

352
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,500
I mean, I have never eaten, this is personal, but I've never eaten ramen because of Naruto,

353
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,820
but I have worked out because of DBZ.

354
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,100
So that's, that's what I think.

355
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,940
Well, I have the opposite experience.

356
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,540
Oh, really?

357
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,340
I've never worked out a day in my life, but I've eaten tons of ramen.

358
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,660
The funny thing about ramen was, or about Naruto is how much it was because of Naruto.

359
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,940
I didn't even realize that Naruto was like a, was like a reference to like a thing in

360
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,460
ramen.

361
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,340
You would have known that if you read Shonen Jump because they explained it all the time.

362
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,020
I, well, I mean, I, I read, I mean, I read the Naruto chapters, but I didn't study them.

363
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,780
You didn't read all the little in-between shit in Shonen Jump.

364
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,300
Oh, okay.

365
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,580
So yeah, I never got the books.

366
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,460
I read it all online as soon as I, I got into Naruto kind of late.

367
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,700
Like it was after my whole adult swim phase.

368
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,740
What I meant by read Shonen Jump is like the actual magazine that was published in America.

369
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,660
I, um, that would have explained to me.

370
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,380
I remember the day that I realized that there was something funny about Naruto's name.

371
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,540
And it was when like years and years later, it was when Jiraiya dies, like a

372
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,620
way later in the series in Shippuden, um, when, uh, Naruto, yeah, when Jiraiya dies

373
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,180
and like there's a flashback to like how Jiraiya came up with Naruto's name.

374
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,620
And it shows him like eating ramen.

375
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
And he's got like the little stars with the swirls on him.

376
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,100
That's, you know, he's what a Naruto is.

377
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,620
The Naruto, yeah, it's a fish flake.

378
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,340
And see, that's still weird to me that that thing is a Naruto because I don't

379
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,660
even have that association in my brain.

380
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,700
I just think that it's this orange ninja man, but it's like, oh my God, he was

381
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,220
like named after a fucking ramen thing.

382
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,700
And that's why he loves ramen so much.

383
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,620
It's all connected.

384
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,300
Did you go back to chapter one at all?

385
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
I had no fucking idea.

386
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:03,940
Yeah.

387
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,980
Um, yeah, man.

388
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,740
So, so DBZ inspired it.

389
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,100
Yep.

390
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,820
Fit stoked the flames.

391
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,020
Yeah.

392
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,260
Now you're a fit boy, but you have firing.

393
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,580
I would say, would you say that you're, I mean, your origins as a fitness guy,

394
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,340
are obviously more aesthetic and psychological.

395
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,540
Yes.

396
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,740
But you talk about fitness more in a philosophical terms these days, I would say.

397
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,180
Sure.

398
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,620
Sure.

399
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,060
Like it's good for like, if you want to maximize happiness in your life, yeah,

400
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,700
being a fit is a good way to help.

401
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,900
Well, in just the general, like humans should all be trying to better themselves.

402
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,220
Right.

403
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,460
Sure.

404
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,380
Which you, you go on about that kind of stuff a lot, but that's not really the

405
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,380
origin of why you're a fit boy.

406
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,180
Well, I mean, when I was 10, I wasn't really interested in the future of

407
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,020
humanity, you know, more selfish at the same time.

408
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,620
Exactly.

409
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Yeah, that's fair.

410
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,300
So I'm curious about like, I mean, normally with these interviews, I sort of

411
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,780
towards the beginning go through your whole life.

412
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,340
So tell me about where you were born and to whom and why.

413
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,940
Sure.

414
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,860
What happened?

415
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah, I don't know how much this will be a repeat from the, the Ben interview,

416
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,260
because of course Ben St. is my older brother.

417
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,540
Ben mostly started from like college.

418
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:13,980
So.

419
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,540
Okay.

420
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,300
If you want to start younger or later at all.

421
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,620
Well, you know, okay, when I was a kid, my parents moved around a bunch and I know

422
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,940
Ben was kind of carted along with him, but that was when he was very young.

423
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,260
By the time I was born, we had moved back to, or maybe like just after.

424
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,780
What is the, what is the difference in age between you and Ben?

425
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,340
Ben and I are about two years difference.

426
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,580
So yeah, right about two years.

427
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,940
We had moved back to Massachusetts, or I think we lived in like Texas for a little

428
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,540
bit, moved around maybe a little bit, but soon after I was born, we moved back to

429
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,380
Massachusetts, essentially like where my parents had started from.

430
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,540
Because my dad, he's a psychologist and he was working for this company that had

431
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,100
like a lot of chains kind of across the country.

432
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,620
And so, you know, he just got shipped from a bunch of those around, but that,

433
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,700
that company closed down.

434
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,700
And so he moved back and started his own practice in, in Massachusetts.

435
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,620
So, you know, I grew up there in this kind of, in this town, Rehoboth, in this little,

436
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,220
it's kind of pretty rural, like there's lots of farms in the town and stuff.

437
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,860
It's, it's a pretty big town.

438
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,340
But like where we lived, there was like no kids anywhere nearby.

439
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,860
So all growing up, it was just me and my siblings.

440
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,980
You know, there's me, Ben, who's two years older, and my sister, Grace, who's four

441
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,580
years younger.

442
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,860
And so it was pretty much just us.

443
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:30,020
And I think it was because we were so kind of isolated that when video games got

444
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,380
introduced into our lives, and like we, when I was like five, I was big into

445
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,100
Power Rangers.

446
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,100
It's a huge TV guy.

447
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,220
And then when video games came along, it was like, holy shit.

448
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,780
Now I've got this whole thing I can actively participate in that's, that's

449
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,660
going to change my life.

450
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,340
Our, our uncle, my mom had a sister, Maggie, who died of leukemia when she

451
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,900
was young-ish.

452
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,820
And like her boyfriend, Chuck, I believe it was his name.

453
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,860
I haven't seen him in a long time.

454
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,100
But Maggie's boyfriend, Chuck, he gave us a original Nintendo console when we

455
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,740
were very young.

456
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,300
Just thought we'd enjoy it.

457
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,220
What year would this be?

458
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,660
This would be about 1994, 1995, maybe?

459
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,140
Super Nintendo's already out, but you've got a regular Nintendo.

460
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,900
I mean, you know, it might have been before that.

461
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,980
It might have been even before that.

462
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,100
I was born in 1990.

463
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100
And Super Nintendo came out in like 1989.

464
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,140
I mean, this whole part of the story is hazy, because I don't really remember

465
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,540
like when these things happened.

466
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,620
We got a Super Nintendo sometime later, and then later on we would get like a

467
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,500
PlayStation, whatever.

468
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,180
We don't need to go into the specifics of all that, but like was introduced to

469
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,900
video games, was introduced into like TV shows, specifically like Power Rangers

470
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,300
made a big impact on me, as well as Transformers.

471
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,220
So right out of the gate, like Japanese stuff was like appealing to me on that

472
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,500
level, not that either of those is necessarily all Japanese, but not all.

473
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,340
Well, you know, they're Japanese in origin.

474
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,380
So that in Transformers is Japanese animated shit.

475
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,820
Right. Am I wrong about that?

476
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,140
It has Japanese animators on it, but it's it's an American show written by I

477
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,740
know, I know, like, you know, Hasbro makes Transformers and shit.

478
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,420
Right.

479
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,060
Okay.

480
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,020
Well, maybe I'm totally wrong then, but Power Rangers at least had its roots

481
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,300
in Japan. I'm trying to fucking connection here.

482
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,060
Did you get me out here?

483
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,780
I get out here.

484
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,500
I also grew up on Power Rangers and Beast Wars.

485
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,900
So like, yes, you know, okay, cool.

486
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,620
Yeah, I don't know.

487
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,580
I did that for a while.

488
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,580
I guess in school, in school, I was, I don't know, it was funny when I was like

489
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,460
a real young kid, and this is probably common.

490
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,780
I was a little bit more outgoing as I got older into middle school and high

491
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,700
school, I started to, I don't know, pull back and stuff a little bit.

492
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,980
I was more, I guess I'm kind of like I am now.

493
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,740
I was really focused on like achieving the stuff I wanted to do and didn't give

494
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
a fuck about the people around.

495
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,980
What did you want to do as a middle and high schooler?

496
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
I wanted to act.

497
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,780
I wanted to do films and well, not films, but I wanted to do stage plays and

498
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,380
stuff through, through mostly high school, but a little bit.

499
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,820
Well, in middle school, I started doing chorus and elementary school too.

500
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,260
But like, I was a big chorus guy through my entire childhood.

501
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,180
And this is something that hasn't really come up much in your content since the

502
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,500
Pony days, but you're a big musicals guy.

503
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,500
Yeah, I sure when, especially when I was a kid, I was really big into musicals.

504
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,820
And even now, you know, I've just enjoyed and listening to the music of

505
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,900
Hamilton quite a bit.

506
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,860
Oh, yeah, I'm not, I do like it a lot.

507
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,540
It's actually took a little while to grow on me.

508
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,980
The whole rapping thing, just it's not like typical musical fare.

509
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,820
So it's a little bit different the way I just do it.

510
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,620
But now that I've been kind of immersed in it, I am really enjoying it.

511
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,380
Though it's funny, my, my favorite song in the soundtrack is like what King

512
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,940
George sings, it's like the only like white song on the soundtrack.

513
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,420
So it's just like some dude singing like a classical musical.

514
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,180
And he's like the evil racist, you know, like slave driving evil king.

515
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,380
And he's got the best song in the album.

516
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,020
Of course you'd love that.

517
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,980
Of course I do. Of course.

518
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,420
That's that's me to a T right there.

519
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,020
Exactly.

520
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
Yeah, so I, you know, in high school was really when I when I started doing

521
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,780
bigger stuff and did did plays and musicals every single year.

522
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,300
Did a whole bunch of stuff.

523
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,940
I was some of your favorite musicals from from back in the day.

524
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,340
I mean, I really enjoyed Wicked, you know, people shit on Wicked.

525
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,980
I thought Wicked was I saw it on Broadway.

526
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,500
I went to me and we took a class trip at one point.

527
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,340
I think it was with like the musical or the performance, the theater group.

528
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,900
We went to New York and saw Wicked on Broadway and it was fucking sick.

529
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,900
It was dope.

530
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,220
Plus this girl who I liked was there and she was totally into it.

531
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,100
Was not into me, but she was there and I enjoyed having her near me.

532
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,980
So that made it a really good time.

533
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah, so that I don't know.

534
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,220
It was I just had a really good experience of musicals all through high school.

535
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
I know you like Jesus Christ, Superstar.

536
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,300
I fucking love Jesus Christ, Superstar Jesus Christ.

537
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,900
That's the meme song, but there's there's better ones.

538
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,060
It's it's not a meme.

539
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,700
It's a good song. OK, that's a good song.

540
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,980
But the best one is mine when you think of the name of the show.

541
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,180
The best one is the Overture, the opening song.

542
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,300
Exactly. That one.

543
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,380
I'm trying to remember how it goes.

544
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,420
Me too. Fuck, it's Judas is such a fucking badass.

545
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,140
Jesus, do you something, something or so?

546
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,700
Yeah, why'd you get your backwood chance?

547
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,140
It's such a strange land.

548
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,220
You'd have managed better if you'd had a play.

549
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
And now you're doing the meme song.

550
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,340
What? That's the meme song.

551
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,740
Oh, fuck, you're right.

552
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,860
That's a reprise from the opening song, I think, in the meme song.

553
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,620
God damn it. I can't fucking remember how it goes.

554
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,900
It's the one about Jesus, a Judas like being like, Jesus,

555
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,860
why are you fucking up? They're going to get mad.

556
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,220
Jesus, listen, won't you something my hand?

557
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,820
Oh, yeah, all I have is that I want us to live.

558
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,620
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.

559
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,620
You have set the world on fire.

560
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,660
They think they found the new Messiah,

561
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,460
but they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

562
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,700
Judas is fucking dope in that musical.

563
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,420
Like the ones from the 70s, the new Broadway ones are kind of shitty.

564
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
I saw it.

565
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,740
What a singer that guy is.

566
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,420
I saw the I saw the newer Jesus Christ Superstar,

567
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,620
where it had the original Jesus, but everyone else is younger.

568
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,100
That guy's been playing Jesus for like a thousand years.

569
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,980
Yeah, I think he finally retired a little while ago,

570
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,220
but yeah, he's been into it.

571
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,140
I saw him with that, which was pretty good, except the Judas is white.

572
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,460
And I was not. Yeah, that's not good.

573
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,260
That's not OK. Judas had to be black.

574
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,060
Judas is evil, so he has to be black.

575
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,420
Oh, yeah, I apologize for that one.

576
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,900
That's beyond the line.

577
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,140
All right, so a joke.

578
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,940
Oh, why do black people have light palms?

579
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,300
Why do they have white palms?

580
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,940
Because there's a little good in everybody.

581
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,580
There you go, folks.

582
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,220
Enjoy that one.

583
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,540
I've actually heard that one from real racists.

584
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,580
Oh, I'm in trouble now.

585
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,460
I'm just playing, fam. I'm just playing.

586
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,180
I really have.

587
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,460
I really have heard that from real racist people.

588
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,500
But you see, that's the trouble about being such a big four-chan guy.

589
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,860
Yeah, I make a lot of racist jokes, and they are 100 percent ironic.

590
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,580
I mean, if you just listen to like the stuff I'm passionate about

591
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,100
philosophically, it's completely contrary to all this racist shit.

592
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,460
It's just so funny.

593
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,180
It is so funny to offend people.

594
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,860
So yeah, there you go.

595
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,020
It's it's funny, especially because, like, I'll say all that kind of stuff.

596
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,340
Yeah.

597
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,500
But I do it with, like, total self-awareness of the idea

598
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,300
that this is going to offend someone.

599
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,140
And you always do it in this way that's just like, like, you like,

600
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,300
you can't even understand that someone would get offended.

601
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,380
Yeah, that's true.

602
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,020
That's like, it almost feels like you're always kind of shocked

603
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,660
when people are, like, actually, like mad about something.

604
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,100
I just wish everyone were chill.

605
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,140
Yeah, I guess I wish everyone.

606
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,020
I wish that.

607
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,100
Yeah, I suppose I'm a little naive when it comes to that.

608
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,660
Yeah.

609
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,700
Anyway, so you in high school,

610
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,140
yes, musicals, theater, trying to become a theater boy.

611
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,220
Yeah, just I was there for really just the the sheer enjoyment of performing

612
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,380
on stage. So they really got you ever like a main guy?

613
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,060
I was a main guy the entire time.

614
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,580
I was by far the best male singer of the group and was always the lead man

615
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,580
every single time.

616
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,300
OK, and did any popularity come with that?

617
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,940
Yes, as a matter of fact, in high school, I had a fan club as it happens.

618
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,460
Wow.

619
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,420
They were a bunch of, well, I don't want to shed on them, but they were,

620
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,540
they would, I think they would agree.

621
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,100
They were kind of a creepy group of like three girls, no offense to them.

622
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,780
And you didn't manage to fuck any of them.

623
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,820
Oh, boy, we don't want to get into my sexual history, but let's just say

624
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,820
that I made a few mistakes along the way in terms of being a pussy.

625
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,420
Here, I'll give you one.

626
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,060
There was one time when my friend Jillian in high school came up to me and said,

627
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,140
Nate, look at me at this time.

628
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,940
I famously I had really long hair down to my waist like all throughout high school.

629
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,620
So this is and I wore these sick Kingdom Hearts arm bands,

630
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,420
one with the nobody symbol and one with the heartless symbol.

631
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,420
Yeah, dude, four years.

632
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,780
I can only laugh because you and Victor had the same exact high school life.

633
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,140
Yeah, we've identical.

634
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,460
And not to mention he also was in theater and got popular because of it.

635
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,740
I never got really popular.

636
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,020
I mean, he was also like a quiet dude who nobody really talked to.

637
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,740
Yeah, but then there was his most famous moment was like he did a play.

638
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,660
They were doing like some shitty drug PSA play or whatever.

639
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,980
And like, you know, nobody was like really taking it seriously.

640
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,980
But like the people in the audience weren't like we're just talking over at

641
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,180
the whole time that's fucking Victor just like snapped and gets up and like

642
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:10,260
lectures the audience on how they like, like, you know, I know like look,

643
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,060
none of us care about this either, but you can at least have respect and like,

644
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,140
you know, like listen to the thing and he became like like famous after that.

645
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,940
That's like an incident or something.

646
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,940
Hey, man, those those those what is the word I'm looking for?

647
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,500
Taking charge moments.

648
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,180
You know, that's what makes you a man.

649
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,420
But he also had long hair and wore like a black trench coat and shit.

650
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,780
So I mean, like he looked like he could be in section 13 or whatever.

651
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,340
Organization 13.

652
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,260
My I don't know.

653
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,980
I mean, I've talked about this before, but famously there was a pivotal moment

654
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,940
in my life that made me like this weirdo introverted guy.

655
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,940
I also was in like marching band through all college through all high school and

656
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,860
stuff.

657
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,940
But I was I was deeply anti-social and it was all because of this fucking movie.

658
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,500
One of my favorites of all time, Vampire Hunter D.

659
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,060
Bloodlust vampire fucking Hunter D.

660
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,300
Bloodlust changed my life in the worst way.

661
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,540
It made me think like, oh my God, D is such a fucking badass.

662
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,140
All I need to do is be like because like all the bitches and all like the men

663
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,780
in that shit are like he's so he's so stoic.

664
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,940
He's such a fucking badass.

665
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,860
You never said that he's a half vampire.

666
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,300
So like he has a magnetism that like literally mind control people to fall in love with.

667
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,980
I didn't get that.

668
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,460
I didn't get I didn't realize that just being quiet in the corner all the time

669
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,100
and like thinking you were such a badass would like not do anything alone.

670
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,340
You're not drawn by Yoshitaka Amato.

671
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,860
I know that was my problem right there.

672
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,300
So I spent my high school days.

673
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,620
It had some weird effects on me.

674
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,900
But yeah, I was just like I decided to stop talking in class because I wanted to be though,

675
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,980
you know, to some to be fair, some of this might just be an internal

676
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,460
rationalization for legitimate shyness that I don't want to cop to.

677
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,780
It's possible that's true, too.

678
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,340
I can't. I really don't know.

679
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,500
But that movie sure felt like a turning point in my life after I watched that.

680
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,620
It was too good. It was too fucking good, dude.

681
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,020
They brought to the is a crime.

682
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,380
It's a crime.

683
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,340
It owes me my sex life on high school back.

684
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,940
I want that back.

685
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,180
So you spent all that time trying to be cool of a serious and it backfired.

686
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,340
Yeah, did I mention that, you know, in addition to the Kingdom Hearts wristbands,

687
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,260
I wore weighted leg bands with like weights to make me strong at all times.

688
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,620
Did you learn that from DBZ?

689
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,580
Yeah, sure did. I was copying Goku.

690
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,660
I did a lot of that.

691
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,540
Did you, too? Yeah.

692
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,580
A lot of times I thought like, oh, like instead of like, you know, like working out,

693
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,060
I'll just have like some kind of innate training going on by like wearing something heavy.

694
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
A little bit. I mean, these were like five powders.

695
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,300
And then the thing was they were full of sand and like as I walked,

696
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,100
because I wore them all the time, they would get worn out and the sand would start to leak.

697
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,820
And like people would be like, where's this sand coming from?

698
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,100
And I don't fucking know, dude.

699
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,900
I have no idea where the sand's coming from.

700
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,420
You're going to have to ask somebody else about that.

701
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,060
It was fucking great. It was pretty good.

702
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,180
So so anything else you want to share about your early life or you want to move into college?

703
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,060
Yeah, anything else of interest.

704
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,500
Oh, I didn't finish that story about that girl that one time.

705
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,620
Yeah, it was just that.

706
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,940
So my friend Jillian came up to me and said, I'm going to take a piss.

707
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,060
You can just keep talking.

708
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,300
OK, I'll probably do that at some point, too.

709
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,660
There was a time when you see, right, so my friend Jillian walks up to me and says,

710
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,340
Nate, look over there at that girl standing in that doorway.

711
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,020
And I did. And there was a, you know, an attractive, blonde, curly haired girl standing there.

712
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,020
And she said, Nate, that is Jess and she likes you.

713
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,260
She wants to date you.

714
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,700
She said these like this was the time when God was giving me my chance.

715
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,260
And and I looked over, I made eye contact.

716
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,580
You know, actually, in my, no, I did not make eye contact.

717
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,260
I was too much of a pussy. I looked at her.

718
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,300
I looked her up and down and I said, OK, and then I turned back and started reading

719
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,540
my fucking animorphs or whatever again.

720
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,860
That's that's how I handled that situation,

721
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,500
which is just indicative of my social skills in general.

722
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,580
I have a lot of stories like that from all of my school.

723
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,140
I just really remember this one because it was so clear.

724
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,980
Like, Nate, there's your chance.

725
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,460
We're giving it to you.

726
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,540
And I just, you know, I just I'm such a different guy than I was back then.

727
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,300
Different, different times, man.

728
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,380
Thank God. Thank God we're all different.

729
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,740
Yep. Thank God none of us are like our high school.

730
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,220
I would not have been a fun person to hang out with in high school.

731
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,300
Me neither.

732
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,420
You know, to this day, I'm still kind of weirdly moody sometimes.

733
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,380
Like my reaction to being mad at people will be to walk outside and just stand

734
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,860
there and wait for hours until they come out and say, Nate, what's wrong?

735
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,100
I mean, not so much anymore, but I've seen you in I've seen you in like just kind

736
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,060
of this low simmer mode of like just annoyance.

737
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,020
Remember the time there's an like there's just a there's just a thread

738
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,940
of annoyance boiling on to the surface and you just can't quite talk to anybody.

739
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,700
That happens. I've seen that that happens.

740
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,460
Remember at Radcon, too, when I started cleaning obsessively?

741
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,060
Yeah, that that was one of those.

742
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,300
Yeah, that was how I chose to express my frustrate.

743
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,540
I don't even remember what it was about, but some frustration.

744
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,660
I just started walking around and was like, I started cleaning.

745
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,860
I didn't talk to anyone.

746
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,140
I just started cleaning up and everyone was like, what's happening?

747
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,980
What's going on here?

748
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,300
Yeah. And they were like, Nate, do you want some help?

749
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,020
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

750
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,100
You feel like helping.

751
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,220
Yeah, you know, I've got it.

752
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
But if you want to help, sure.

753
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,140
And and then other people joined in.

754
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,380
Yeah, I don't know.

755
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,260
That's just how everybody felt guilty.

756
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,660
Yeah, like they hadn't cleaned up and you were doing it.

757
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,380
I guess I guess it's kind of a passive aggressive thing I do to avoid

758
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,140
confrontation, which I wish I could change about myself.

759
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,900
But hey, I've been working on it.

760
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm working on it.

761
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah.

762
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,380
Oh, so that's high school, I guess.

763
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
So that's pretty much high school.

764
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,220
So what would you study in college?

765
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,820
What did I study in college?

766
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,940
Oh, right.

767
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,260
When I started college, my plan was to become a doctor

768
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,020
because I really liked Blackjack.

769
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,180
Blackjack was like, again, my major life choices

770
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,460
controlled entirely by anime since birth.

771
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,060
I was like, Blackjack is so cool.

772
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
I want to be a doctor.

773
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,900
At least you had patrician taste.

774
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,460
That's true.

775
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,540
Like there's two characters like you weren't just trying.

776
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,700
And Blackjack.

777
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,580
Yeah, I mean, you had DBZ as a kid and that's fine.

778
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Everybody gets DBZ.

779
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,340
Everyone needs an entry point.

780
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,260
But at least you weren't trying to be like Sasuke or something.

781
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,700
True, man.

782
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,980
You had like fucking D and Blackjack.

783
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
We're both bad asses.

784
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,460
It's not bad.

785
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,740
Yeah, they are, they are.

786
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,420
Both classic 90s OVA.

787
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,180
Why not 90s OVA for Blackjack?

788
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,020
Why had you seen so many 90s OVA as a teenager?

789
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,420
Shit, man.

790
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,900
I, you know, we got you into these.

791
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,540
I saw them all on On Demand.

792
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,700
They weren't available on any channel, but they were on On Demand for some reason.

793
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,020
And why were you allowed to buy On Demand movies?

794
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,860
Because they were free.

795
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,700
If they weren't free, I never would have seen that shit.

796
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,460
Me and my siblings spent a ton of time when we were young,

797
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,260
watching shit On Demand on our fucking TV cable plant.

798
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,780
And thank God, I mean, I never would have gotten into anime.

799
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,100
Yeah.

800
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,140
Wasn't for that in like the big way that I have now.

801
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,300
Because those, I mean, those were like stuff that you could maybe find at Blockbuster,

802
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,340
but it'd be hard.

803
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,940
I never paid for shit.

804
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,620
To this day, I don't buy any anime.

805
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,220
I don't do any of that.

806
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,580
I don't support the industry at all.

807
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,540
Yeah, why are you so into that philosophy of not supporting art?

808
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,380
Okay, I'll tell you why.

809
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,180
I'll explain this right now.

810
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,420
So I don't buy any anime ever.

811
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,340
And it's not like I'm opposed to it, but I just wouldn't even think about buying any of them.

812
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:04,180
And it's entirely because it is so easy for me to get them through like, you know, torrents and stuff.

813
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:11,020
I've just developed such a rhythm of doing it that way that it is way harder for me to do something like

814
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,340
even search Crunchyroll for a show I want to watch, even if it's free.

815
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,300
It is easier to me to get it downloaded and just have the file on my computer.

816
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,300
I mean, Crunchyroll aside, I mean, the only reason I use

817
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,220
Crunchyroll is that I find it easier than torrenting because when I want to watch something,

818
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,660
it's always spur of the moment.

819
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,220
And I just want to put it on and it be there.

820
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,740
I don't want it to wait for a download.

821
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,020
But like that is a hassle.

822
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,460
But like the only reason I would ever pay for anime now is just to put money into the industry.

823
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,900
You know, and like anime aside, because honestly, I don't think your money goes anywhere.

824
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,020
Like I don't blame you for not paying for anime.

825
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,340
But like, well, if it's like an album or something or like Patreon, you've never given to a page.

826
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,980
Never patron to anyone ever at any point.

827
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,500
And is it just a philosophy of like, like if you had lots of money, would you start doing it?

828
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh, if I was like super rich and had no monetary concerns, I'd be happy to give away my money.

829
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,500
I would totally give it to the people who I think are doing like good work and deserve and like I want to see more.

830
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,100
Let's let's say in a year and a half.

831
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,780
Yeah, this is my prediction.

832
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Yeah, this is my very optimistic, happy prediction for you.

833
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,900
Things are going pretty good right now.

834
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,980
Let's say in a year and a half, your student loans are completely paid off.

835
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,420
You're living entirely off of Patreon.

836
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,780
That's crazy. That's gonna happen.

837
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,300
You're living entirely off of Patreon.

838
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,260
Let's say you're making, let's say you're making, let's be fucking generous.

839
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,980
Sure.

840
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,580
Say you're making four grand a month.

841
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,460
Okay.

842
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,900
Uh, are you patroning people?

843
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,100
Absolutely not, no one.

844
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,900
Not a chance.

845
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,740
And I'll tell you why, it's because that is not a level where I'm like 100% set.

846
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,340
If I, I would need to be a millionaire probably before I'm like comfortable giving away any money.

847
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,940
And it's all, it all comes back to the fact that if I can get away with not paying for something,

848
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,980
I will do it.

849
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,780
I will do it.

850
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:59,220
I am entirely motivated by a desire to have as much resources as my disposal as I possibly can.

851
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:04,900
And like my survival and my well-being comes first before, you know, because I'm a big guy who's into

852
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,260
like, you know, like we were saying self-improvement and self-reliance and

853
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,180
you know, not, not like fucking over people to advance yourself with that.

854
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,780
I'm completely against, but you know, just, just bettering yourself is the way you can

855
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,780
better the world, is my philosophy.

856
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,780
So I really think it is, I mean, I probably take this to an excessive degree with my like

857
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,940
never patron anyone, just have no interest in that.

858
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:31,380
If the money went 100% to that person, I'll tell you, I would be 10 times more likely to do it

859
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,820
than the fact that any of it gets snagged up by Patreon.

860
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,340
I don't give a fuck about the Patreon people.

861
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,540
They're fucking suits.

862
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,420
I don't give a shit.

863
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,020
Even though they put on that millennial face about,

864
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,420
uh, what, so do you ever feel like guilty about the fact that you

865
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,540
profit off of the existence of anime, but don't put anything into it or anything like that?

866
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:58,260
No, I don't feel guilty about it at all, but I would, I would like to contribute.

867
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,220
I would like to.

868
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,980
Or like, like, like any of the YouTubers who like were a huge influence, like if Mr.

869
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,660
Beetong opened a Patreon, would you consider or just like, if you just had a PayPal donate link,

870
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,820
would you just like, throw in $15, you know?

871
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,380
I'll tell you this.

872
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,660
I would never do it.

873
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,740
Just like, I'm feeling like donating to Mr.

874
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,540
Beetong today.

875
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,340
If Mr. Beetong was like, guys, I'm going to be a full-time YouTuber.

876
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,500
I need to make $100,000, you know, whatever.

877
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I need to raise that much for this project I'm thinking of.

878
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,540
That would tempt me much more, that if there's like-

879
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,780
Have you ever given to a kickstarter or anything?

880
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,420
Never.

881
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,900
Never?

882
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,380
Never.

883
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,740
I'm super frugal.

884
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,020
I don't give money to anyone.

885
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,900
Fuck everybody else.

886
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,620
I mean, I just, just to describe to the audience, like, I think you make the

887
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,020
at least the second most amount of money in the PCP is total.

888
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,740
At this point, yeah, at this point.

889
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,460
I don't know-

890
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,820
Though that was like, within like, that changed from like, yesterday to today.

891
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,380
So that's a very reasonable thing.

892
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,500
No, I don't just mean on Patreon.

893
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,620
I mean like, all together.

894
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,180
Oh, oh yeah.

895
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,460
Like, amount of money you make.

896
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,380
I have a real job that's like, I could live on my normal job for the rest of my life happily.

897
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:55,860
Right.

898
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,900
I mean, I don't, I don't know how much you want to say any specific numbers to try to

899
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
figure out if you make more than me or not.

900
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,420
I don't, I don't feel the need to do that.

901
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,460
I don't feel the need to do that.

902
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,620
Let's leave it ambiguous as to which of us is doing better.

903
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,980
That'll be more fun to speculate.

904
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,540
Well, the point is that I, I'm in your house right now.

905
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,140
And it is very clear to me that you are living well below your means.

906
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,700
Oh yeah, that's true.

907
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,900
Like, you could easily afford a much better place.

908
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,220
Yep.

909
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,100
I'm just going to describe to you-

910
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,580
This is the interview, but I'm going to describe the stuff that you want.

911
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,540
Okay.

912
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,020
Nate's entire apartment is three rooms.

913
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,820
And a bathroom.

914
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,020
And a bathroom.

915
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,140
That are all in a row.

916
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,940
So it's like, you start off in like, a little living room area.

917
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,980
No door is either.

918
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,820
No doors in the house.

919
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,260
So it's a little living room.

920
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,300
It goes right into the bedroom with a bathroom in the middle.

921
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,620
And then right into the kitchen, all the same size.

922
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,220
All about, let's say, oh, what, how long?

923
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,780
I'm just, I don't know, maybe, maybe like 40 to 50 feet long.

924
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,580
Is that accurate?

925
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:56,980
Is that good?

926
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,620
What?

927
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,740
You mean the whole house, right?

928
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,940
Are you talking about length, right?

929
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,980
Yeah, I was talking about one room.

930
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,540
I'm trying to think of one room size.

931
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,820
Oh, you took square footage.

932
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,940
I got no fucking idea, dude.

933
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,820
I did not know.

934
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,540
Each room's probably like-

935
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,140
Like it's a small-ish room, I guess.

936
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,260
8 by 12 feet or something.

937
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,540
Kind of high ceilings, I guess.

938
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:09,940
I don't know.

939
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,860
Anyway, point being, it's in like this kind of rinky-dink

940
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,020
apartment complex.

941
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,180
It's a shitty neighborhood in a shitty apartment complex,

942
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,260
for sure.

943
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,420
Yeah, definitely like the, like, it's weird that parts of it

944
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,340
don't seem so bad and then other parts do.

945
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,900
Well, it's because there's a university up the street.

946
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,820
Like, out on that back porch, it looks like shit.

947
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:24,900
Yeah.

948
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,580
But then out front, it looks fine.

949
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:27,940
Yeah.

950
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,900
But anyways, like, yeah, it's kind of a shitty neighborhood,

951
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,620
shitty apartment.

952
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,100
Yeah.

953
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,020
You can hear other people.

954
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,380
I'm sure other people.

955
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,700
Fuck it.

956
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,340
People can hear us.

957
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,580
Yeah.

958
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,100
You've got, there's not a lot of, like, furniture or anything.

959
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,860
Like, it's very bare bones.

960
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,980
Dude, like, your trip here has motivated me to actually get

961
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,100
some furniture.

962
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,260
Yeah.

963
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,980
So consider, like, half of what I got now just not here

964
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,860
before you got here.

965
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,340
Yeah.

966
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,980
More or less.

967
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,540
Like, what?

968
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,220
My chair, my chair, the chair you're sitting on right now

969
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,580
is a car seat from my car.

970
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,060
Yeah.

971
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,780
So that's the kind of shit you're doing.

972
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
That name brought in a couple of car seats.

973
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,220
So that was for me.

974
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,300
Like, you brought those in no way I was coming.

975
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,700
Yep.

976
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,260
That's right.

977
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,180
So I'm sitting in a car seat.

978
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,060
It's comfy though, right?

979
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,620
That's a good car seat.

980
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,180
And where did that other, like, you bought a new bed

981
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,620
and I'm sitting on your old one.

982
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,940
Well, you know, in fair, I had to mean to get a better bed

983
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,780
just because, like, mine was, it's like a, it's a twin.

984
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,180
It's like a small car.

985
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,980
I could not imagine that being my, like.

986
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,500
But you know, like, a week ago.

987
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,140
Like, like, that makes sense to me as a guest bed.

988
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,620
But the thought that you were sleeping on that full time

989
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,540
and you could easily afford a real bed.

990
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,860
A week ago, that was my permanent bed for the last,

991
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,380
like, one and a half years.

992
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,100
That's my bed.

993
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,500
I sleep on like a thousand dollar, you know, twin size.

994
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,660
This thing, this mattress, my, my good bed here.

995
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,620
Full size mattress.

996
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,020
My good mattress is like, was like 240 bucks.

997
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,500
And I was like, oh, shit, fuck.

998
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,180
I can't pay this much for a fucking mattress.

999
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,500
Do you not have any back issues or anything?

1000
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,140
I'm fine.

1001
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:49,860
I don't know.

1002
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,140
Maybe it's because you work out.

1003
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,580
Maybe it makes it easier.

1004
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,860
I was thinking about that earlier.

1005
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,700
Like, I was sitting on your bed and I was like.

1006
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,980
Is that, is that bad shitty?

1007
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,940
Is that bad?

1008
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,820
It's not bad.

1009
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,300
It's just that, like, I get bad back.

1010
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,660
Like, I had like a really bad back pains

1011
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,860
because I was on like just an average mattress

1012
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,540
and in an average chair

1013
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,940
when I literally sit or lay all day to do my job.

1014
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,740
So I bought like the nicest bed and the nicest chair

1015
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,180
and no more back problems.

1016
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,340
But I suspect if you're healthy and you work out,

1017
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,940
you don't have as many of those anymore.

1018
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,740
It probably helps.

1019
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,460
It probably helps.

1020
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,260
I mean, that's the thing.

1021
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,780
Like, like it, your house is super Spartan,

1022
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,740
but like it makes sense for, you're comfortable here.

1023
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,020
Like, you don't care.

1024
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,940
You're not even concerned about it.

1025
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,180
This was the, like, yeah, as soon as I found this place,

1026
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,020
this met my requirements.

1027
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,780
It's got internet that actually wasn't as good

1028
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,780
as I was hoping for, but it's still everything I need.

1029
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,460
Which, that was like 90% of my concern

1030
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,260
with getting the price.

1031
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,060
Right, with internet.

1032
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,420
It's in an area that is, dude,

1033
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,100
you should have seen some of the places I was scoping out.

1034
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,020
They were like shit, like garbage.

1035
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,700
Like, I crack dealers.

1036
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,420
Seemed like they would be infesting the woodwork.

1037
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,940
I didn't see any, but they would have been there

1038
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,140
if I had been there at night.

1039
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,420
So this is like a decent neighborhood

1040
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,020
compared to the places I was looking at.

1041
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,620
But all I was concerned about was just like,

1042
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,700
as low rent as possible, you know,

1043
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,820
has the bare minimum.

1044
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,740
It's got, this place is nice by comparison.

1045
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,900
I'm happy with it.

1046
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,500
I don't know, it's just great in winter.

1047
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,140
It's just that it's below what would be my standard of living.

1048
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,340
Yeah, I see your point.

1049
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,980
Yeah, that's my thing.

1050
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,260
So that's the kind of guy I am.

1051
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,940
Even though we make about the same amount of money.

1052
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,820
It's because all my money, all I give a shit about doing

1053
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,540
is getting on that grind, making them videos,

1054
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,820
and paying off my student loans.

1055
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,740
That's what I'm, that's what I'm all about.

1056
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,900
So if you, if you, let's say you pay off your student loans

1057
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,940
tomorrow, somehow, they, they magically go away.

1058
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:43,380
You leave your job, like because you live so frugal,

1059
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,220
do you really need that much money on Patreon?

1060
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,100
Like, because Ben is similar to you

1061
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,420
and that Ben lives extremely frugally.

1062
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,820
But Ben, like because of that,

1063
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,060
like Ben only needs to make like $400 a month and like he,

1064
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,740
that's, he's okay with that because he's, you know,

1065
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,700
but you're kind of similar except that you want to have

1066
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,220
all this overhead money.

1067
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,500
I got ambitious for expanding operations all over the place.

1068
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,780
I want to studio space because I do shit in my room here,

1069
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,820
which is perfectly fine.

1070
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,540
It's good.

1071
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,500
But I want like a studio where I can have all my

1072
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,380
shit ready to fucking go and make things whatever I want.

1073
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,420
And that would probably be, you know,

1074
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,700
in a separate location from my house.

1075
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,860
Yeah, man.

1076
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,060
And like, I'll tell you, like, I'm not as,

1077
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,300
well, actually, I made a big post on my Patreon today

1078
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,260
and you are a patron.

1079
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,220
Yes, I read it.

1080
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,540
Yeah.

1081
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,020
So you know that like I'm not going to drop everything

1082
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,580
as soon as I make like the amount that I'm asking for.

1083
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,580
That is the goal for like survivability.

1084
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,660
And that's, I might, I'll probably change to monthly soon,

1085
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,620
so that's going to change as well.

1086
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,820
But like I'm looking for like a middle-class lifestyle.

1087
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,820
Like that, that is really what I'm shooting for.

1088
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,940
And right now with my current job, I basically make that.

1089
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,740
So I'm hoping to like emulate that because even though

1090
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,620
I personally am willing to live super spartanly,

1091
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,220
the bitches don't come for free.

1092
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
You gots to have the green to make the scene.

1093
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,420
And that's not a joke.

1094
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,460
I want to have a place that will impress women

1095
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,540
because that is what you have to do.

1096
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,180
You got to do it.

1097
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,260
If you want to play the game, that's what you need.

1098
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,620
So, yeah, there you go.

1099
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,380
I need to make a certain amount of money to have

1100
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,940
the certain kind of lifestyle that I'm looking for.

1101
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,900
And like, I want to be able to go out and do things.

1102
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,340
I don't want to live like I did during me and Maffifa all the time,

1103
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,260
just like only focused on turning out content every single day.

1104
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,100
It'd be nice to have some time off.

1105
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,180
That's the world I'm trying to escape right now.

1106
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,940
Like I'm at your house because I'm trying to find a way out of this.

1107
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,740
Literally all I do is make videos.

1108
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,540
And I salute you for it.

1109
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,820
It's exactly the right thing to do.

1110
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,140
Yeah.

1111
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,980
So, but let's say tomorrow your Patreon makes exactly what you make it work.

1112
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,940
Do you leave your job?

1113
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,140
The only reason the answer is no is because Patreon is inherently volatile.

1114
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,820
And I'm afraid that that would change.

1115
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,660
There's no job security with Patreon.

1116
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,420
Let's say I would build up some savings first.

1117
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,260
Let's say Patreon tomorrow is making 150% of what you make it work.

1118
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,140
Do you leave your job?

1119
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,780
I mean, that's great.

1120
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,980
But what I would, I would definitely build up some savings first.

1121
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,300
I would, I mean, plus I got to pay off my student loans.

1122
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,100
I'm not doing anything till I pay those off in terms of, you know,

1123
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,140
quitting my job and shit.

1124
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,140
So I'm doing that.

1125
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,260
Then I'm building up, like, I don't know the number,

1126
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,820
but I'm going to save up some money because like, you know,

1127
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,700
as you can tell, I'm an extremely careful planner, frugal guy.

1128
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:31,940
Yeah.

1129
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,660
I want security.

1130
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,500
That is the defining characteristic of best guy ever in my, in my head is extreme planning.

1131
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,300
I really think that the people say this, but I really think it's true.

1132
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,700
I am, if you're seeing my girl in login video,

1133
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,420
I am a Ross you who desperately, desperately wants to be a commune.

1134
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,060
That's just, and I'm just not that guy yet.

1135
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,580
Maybe one day, maybe one day.

1136
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,420
I'm going to take this opportunity to take a piss.

1137
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,180
Oh, well, that was fast.

1138
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,580
Well, whatever.

1139
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,940
We'll edit this out totally.

1140
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,780
Talk about how cool my new glasses are.

1141
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,420
Nate got some cool new glasses.

1142
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:12,900
Yeah.

1143
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,820
I'm not actually in front of the microphone yet.

1144
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,140
Crank your volume audience.

1145
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:19,540
Yeah.

1146
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,860
Good thing you don't pay for this content anyways.

1147
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,580
Fuck you.

1148
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,260
I wonder if they can hear you pissing because you've left the door open.

1149
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,060
I'm just so used to peeing, you know, alone and being naked in my apartment and shit.

1150
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,460
It's weird having a guest.

1151
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:50,820
Yeah.

1152
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,940
In a goo, in a goo.

1153
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,820
Doesn't matter.

1154
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,620
I'm gay, so I will look at your pee pee.

1155
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,060
Quality content.

1156
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,060
This is high quality, high quality content.

1157
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,420
Me a math if I never ends.

1158
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,780
Me a math if I never ends.

1159
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,340
What do we do?

1160
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,220
50.

1161
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,580
Oh, it's only been 51 minutes.

1162
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,220
Holy shit.

1163
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,100
Fuck, I've gotten to my old.

1164
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,700
Hey, we haven't gotten to college yet.

1165
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,140
That's when chicken's great.

1166
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,220
These interviews are always like, you never realize how long three hours is until you limit.

1167
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,700
Yep.

1168
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,700
Anyway, what I was about to say, yeah, like no one can really appreciate the level of

1169
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,940
planning you do unless they work with you.

1170
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,620
Dude, that's entirely true.

1171
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,580
And the thing is like,

1172
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,500
have you seen my new, the final meme of AFV yet?

1173
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:49,540
Yeah.

1174
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,660
Okay, so you saw the ending.

1175
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,620
Yeah, I watched it today.

1176
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,740
So in the ending, I announced like the ghost and the shell thing.

1177
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,860
Which is hype as fuck.

1178
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,900
And it's great.

1179
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,620
And like, it's this goddamn pixel animation.

1180
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,660
And I have told exactly zero people that I commissioned that like a year ago.

1181
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,860
Yeah, well I knew.

1182
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,220
Did you know, have I shown it to you?

1183
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,460
Yeah, I've seen the pixel animation when you first got it made.

1184
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,220
Okay, I probably did for hype purpose.

1185
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:11,620
Just like show off to you guys.

1186
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,980
You just showed me and Ben.

1187
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,940
Yeah, that sounds right.

1188
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,300
But I mean, I've shown like, no, like I've got several of those things

1189
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,340
right now that are like various projects in the world.

1190
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:28,500
The video parts of this video were filmed two and a half fucking years ago.

1191
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,140
That's not true.

1192
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,380
It's getting close to slightly over two years ago.

1193
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,860
What?

1194
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,060
The one piece one was, right?

1195
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,300
The one piece one was filmed approximately

1196
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:45,140
1.8 years ago and the ghost and the shell one was filmed 2.1 years ago.

1197
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,260
I think that's about right.

1198
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,060
Okay.

1199
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,740
So over two years ago.

1200
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,220
Yeah.

1201
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,820
You filmed footage for this thing.

1202
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,220
Yep.

1203
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,540
And over a year ago, you commissioned all this pixel art animations for this thing.

1204
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,340
That's right.

1205
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,900
And it's still in the woodwork.

1206
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,340
And it's not like I've been fucking around at all.

1207
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,620
It's that I have a, I had to finish my goddamn degree

1208
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,700
and my fucking full-time job.

1209
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,900
I forgot you were working on that degree until like a couple months ago.

1210
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,140
Yeah.

1211
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,140
When I finished it in January.

1212
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,180
It was when it was finally done for final good and all.

1213
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,740
Holy shit.

1214
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,860
I forgot you were still in school.

1215
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:17,940
Yeah.

1216
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,620
So we're just just for context people.

1217
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:19,700
Remember.

1218
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,700
So the MF of O would not have been possible before the time it happened.

1219
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,500
Absolutely not.

1220
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,300
Like I could have done it a couple months ago, I guess, but not by much.

1221
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:27,540
Yeah.

1222
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,380
Yep.

1223
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,220
So to just give it like perspective, like the way I do content

1224
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,220
is I have an idea and then I write a script.

1225
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:44,820
There's no note taking, there's no planning, except for when I do like if I go into a show

1226
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,300
and tending to write about it, I might take a bunch of notes.

1227
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,060
But it's at best like a whiteboard full, you know.

1228
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,100
Yeah.

1229
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,820
You will come into like a podcast with pages.

1230
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:05,140
I mean, if you guys have watched the Aromanga podcast, you'll see that Nate had four pages

1231
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,540
of printed notes, granted lots of space that you should.

1232
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,340
Yeah, that's right.

1233
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,100
That could have probably fit on a page and a half.

1234
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:16,980
But like, yeah, he comes in with shitloads of notes, you know, always doing like double

1235
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,780
checking prep.

1236
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,380
I think you always read the one piece chapters more than once for podcast.

1237
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:21,940
That's right.

1238
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,020
That's right.

1239
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,420
And sometimes you'll even go back and read older chapters just to be completely sure

1240
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,580
that you remember what you're talking about.

1241
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,700
That's 100% accurate.

1242
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,740
Yep.

1243
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,300
The fucking Kingdom Hearts lecture.

1244
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,780
Yeah.

1245
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:38,180
You spent like three hours just drawing that whiteboard.

1246
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,540
And it didn't turn out great.

1247
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,580
It looked great.

1248
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:40,820
Yeah.

1249
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,300
I mean, you had to make sure I was correct.

1250
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,940
You probably spent half an hour just recreating the fucking logo at the top.

1251
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,340
That's true.

1252
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:48,980
That did take a while.

1253
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,580
I wanted that to be good.

1254
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,900
And like had like extensive notes.

1255
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:59,300
Like it's just, it's just funny to see the way you work because like, you know, yeah,

1256
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,420
I can watch you do all that.

1257
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:06,180
And then you'll have like me and Jesse who will literally sit down in front of a camera

1258
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,060
and just stream of consciousness, a bunch of bullshit.

1259
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,220
And like, yeah.

1260
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,580
Do you think it's, how much of the note taking do you think is like that you have to do it?

1261
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,740
And how much of it is just confidence boosting?

1262
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,740
It depends on what the topic is.

1263
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:25,940
Like every PCP, you know, I'm like the biggest talker on the PCP.

1264
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,180
And I don't do any preparation for that stuff.

1265
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,100
You know, that's like, that's like my fun.

1266
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,980
That's what I do for fun.

1267
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,460
So I'm able to do that sort of stuff when I want to.

1268
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,580
But like, I don't go into my main projects, I guess that projects into like the Aromanga stuff.

1269
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,540
Like I have a philosophy where I really hold myself to a high standard of like accuracy.

1270
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,820
Because I think about like what I ask for other people when they're talking about a show is,

1271
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,900
I don't want people to be fucking or if you're talking about Aromanga and you're criticizing

1272
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,300
Aromanga, I expect you to know your shit.

1273
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,300
I expect you to be accurate.

1274
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,180
And to a certain extent, I think guys like you and Jesse are just like better at understanding

1275
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,660
things quickly and easily.

1276
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,260
Whereas I think I need, I always think of them in Bakuman.

1277
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,380
I always think of I'm more like Ashiro Gimuto.

1278
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:20,420
The guys who think they describe like they are not the our tours.

1279
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,020
They are the hard worker.

1280
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,100
Think about things over a thousand times.

1281
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,660
I mean, if we're going to bring up the Bakuman thing.

1282
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,820
Like I read through it in 2014 and was constantly comparing everybody to the PCP.

1283
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,300
Yeah.

1284
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,820
And you and Ben were Muta Ashiro G, especially since you were actually working together at the time.

1285
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,140
That's right.

1286
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,740
But like, both of you definitely have the philosophy of like,

1287
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:46,580
you know, coming to meet the audience and like just working extra, extra hard.

1288
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:52,980
And like, it's not about like, to you, it's about making videos, not necessarily about what the videos are.

1289
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,340
I'm interested in telling a story.

1290
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:01,300
And like in my in my case, like the anime is my medium to tell my story or to like make a point.

1291
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:08,580
It's like you, you're not doing it in like this idea of like, I have a grand vision from the beginning.

1292
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,780
I mean, you, you, sometimes, sometimes, I would say that the way you create videos is like,

1293
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,780
I don't want to say based on a template, but it's like, you look at what is like,

1294
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,700
what even is a YouTube video.

1295
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,580
And then you like make that kind of, you know?

1296
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,140
I suppose so.

1297
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,980
Like, like, like, like the Guru in the Gaon one is heavily influenced by that Mr. Beetong video

1298
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,340
that you had so much respect for.

1299
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:30,420
Right.

1300
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,140
You know.

1301
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,980
And like me and Mathova is like this idea of let's try to make this

1302
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,220
more easily made and consumable content that could come out every day.

1303
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,540
Right.

1304
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:44,660
You know, it's, it's more about this like experimentation than it is about creating the specific video,

1305
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,780
which is like the opposite of Jesse, where Jesse is like,

1306
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,660
doesn't care what YouTube is.

1307
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:55,140
He just wants to make his thing, like whatever he, exactly how he came up with it, you know,

1308
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,340
which is kind of why he doesn't have the YouTube success.

1309
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:04,740
Well, you know, I would argue that I have become more in tune with that as I've gone on, that I,

1310
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,220
I feel a lot like Jesse a lot of the time when I'm making content.

1311
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:14,020
But you know, I mean, my recent success starting with Galco, you know, that was me playing the

1312
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,300
game of YouTube more.

1313
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:22,020
I mean, the video itself was when I'm making an idea for video, I'm really at that point

1314
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,220
not thinking about what YouTube wants out of it.

1315
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,460
I am, I, you know, when I was writing that script, for example, I was only thinking like,

1316
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,340
I watched Galco.

1317
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,540
Wow, it was really good.

1318
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,780
Had these thoughts about it, wrote them down.

1319
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,060
And then I'm sure there was some, you know, decision making as to like what to include,

1320
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,580
you know, based on it's going to be a fucking video.

1321
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,580
So I got to put the shit in it that makes sense.

1322
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:50,900
But it's, it's after the video is really the writing and editing are done to amuse me, you know.

1323
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,460
And I mean, that video had an editor snooping turtle.

1324
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,980
Oh God, I hope I got that right.

1325
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,780
And he did great work.

1326
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,820
He was wonderful to work with.

1327
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,260
But I was approving like every step of the way.

1328
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,820
He would show me like a minute, he was like, how was this, you know, is this good?

1329
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,500
And I would be like, okay, tweak these things.

1330
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,580
So, you know, I was involved in the whole process there.

1331
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:11,780
And it really, like the whole point of that video was kind of to get to that end shot

1332
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,020
and to like make that little speech at the end.

1333
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,340
Like I make entertaining videos as an excuse to lecture people about things I think.

1334
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,180
Like that's really what it comes down to.

1335
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:23,140
And I'm going to find a way to do it no matter what.

1336
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,660
That's what I'm interested in YouTube.

1337
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:29,860
Like YouTube is my way to feel like I'm making a difference in the world in a way that I enjoy,

1338
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,500
which is great.

1339
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,020
But, but just to get back to the original point here.

1340
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:42,660
I felt like for a long time I wasn't making content that was really working with YouTube very well.

1341
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,100
Like the, like you're looking part two.

1342
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,580
I was definitely like I was doing something very similar with Mr. Betung had done.

1343
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,820
But I don't feel like I was copying him.

1344
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,980
I just felt like my ideas were all inspired by it.

1345
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:59,140
But I mean, like at the time, there was definitely, and we all in the PCP had this.

1346
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,540
And still due to some extent, though, it's waning away as time goes on.

1347
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,020
We had this intense respect for like what we saw as the ultimate type of video,

1348
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:14,820
which was the 45 minute, in-depth, highly edited analysis that covers everything.

1349
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,140
Like that was kind of what we, we worshiped.

1350
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:24,180
You had a Cantorlot wedding by Anthony C was like your favorite and the Mr. Betung video.

1351
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,580
Climax is fucking unbelievable.

1352
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:34,020
The classic Mr. Plinkett videos, the Star Wars reviews that we all sort of look up to,

1353
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,420
Egoraptor Sequelitis, which was my big one, you know, in the beginning.

1354
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:43,460
So like all of us could kind of gotten into analysis videos by way of

1355
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,060
these gigantic, epic 45 minute, highly edited videos.

1356
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,100
And we all did ours.

1357
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,260
You know, I did the sort of online videos, YMS, another good example.

1358
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:52,980
Right, yeah, yeah.

1359
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,300
I did the sort of online videos in the Astroscore.

1360
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,940
Movie Bob, another hero of ours, yeah.

1361
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,420
I'm joking, I don't.

1362
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,980
I mean really that good is kind of this kind of video.

1363
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,540
You see, I actually have no idea what his content's like.

1364
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,660
I just hear people shit on him, so that's what that joke's based on.

1365
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,900
I actually did take a lot of influence from Movie Bob.

1366
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,420
Hey, okay, there you go.

1367
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,020
In your physique, I'm assuming you mean it.

1368
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,620
Hey, hey, hey, I'm fat and dangerous.

1369
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,660
That man is gross.

1370
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,740
He's pretty fat and dangerous himself.

1371
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,780
He is disgusting.

1372
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,380
Especially to those fucking men's rights piece of shit.

1373
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,460
Watch out for Bob Chippman, he'll fuck you up.

1374
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,540
Anyway, you did the Girl in the Gone video.

1375
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,060
Jesse had like the horseshoe reviews and the horseshoe finale.

1376
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,060
And like that was kind of like at the time just the atmosphere of what we thought

1377
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,500
like a YouTube video was supposed to be.

1378
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,220
And like because we liked it so much, we thought surely this is what everybody wants.

1379
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,380
Matthew Matosis was out by this point.

1380
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:47,860
Right.

1381
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,860
And then like there was just kind of a moment where it became apparent

1382
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,380
that no one wants that anymore.

1383
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,700
Well, you know, it's funny that you're saying it this way.

1384
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,860
Like these things I think were apparent to you.

1385
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,820
And the rest of us, I think you've always been ahead of the curve when it comes.

1386
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,260
I mean, because this is what you do.

1387
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:10,020
You're a YouTube guy on, you know, in serious ways.

1388
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,900
Right, of course.

1389
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:18,980
And to some extent, and like, you know, like the Galco video was titled

1390
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,460
and thumbnailed the way it was, because basically of your suggestions, you know,

1391
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,100
and it worked incredibly well.

1392
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,980
If I had just called that best anime ever, Oh Shit to Galco Chan,

1393
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,820
would not have worked, would not have happened.

1394
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:36,580
And Mia Mafova was, that was me saying like what I'm doing is just really not working

1395
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,780
the way that I wanted it to.

1396
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,980
Like I wanted, like if I had kept doing what I was doing, you know, to that degree,

1397
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,900
and maybe I'll fuck up and keep going and go back to that.

1398
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,300
But because Mia Mafova just fucking ended.

1399
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,900
I got to emphasize this to the audience.

1400
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:55,220
Like the the PCP, like the concept of us as a group is that we're YouTubers.

1401
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,140
Like we are friends who are YouTubers.

1402
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,380
And a lot of what we talk about is how we're doing our jobs.

1403
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:01,860
Right.

1404
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,900
Like I don't know what, like it's hard for me to imagine what other people think we

1405
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,860
do in the PCP.

1406
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,540
Like is it just a, I don't know.

1407
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,500
Oh, what's the word?

1408
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,780
Bust a link.

1409
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,340
Yeah, we're all just burst leaking out there.

1410
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,380
And I mean, yeah, we have lots of just casual conversations and shit around.

1411
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:23,060
But like, I would say, especially for for a long time, the bulk of what we talked about

1412
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:28,340
was YouTube, like what we're doing, how we're doing it, what we should be doing,

1413
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,580
sharing ideas and advice and stuff like that.

1414
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,340
Complaining when it's going bad and.

1415
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,020
Yeah, bitching about commenters.

1416
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,620
This is like probably 80% of all the interactions we've had.

1417
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:44,660
Anyway, like we, you know, but the point, like the reason we're all friends is that

1418
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:48,580
we're doing the same job and it's a weird job that not a lot of people have, you know,

1419
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,700
and so there's not so many people you can relate to about it.

1420
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:57,780
And like, yeah, sort of when, when we all stopped doing Pony and we moved out into our

1421
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,820
own channels, we all kind of were doing our own thing in a way and it was very much like,

1422
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,020
let's share notes, like how is it working for you?

1423
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,300
It's not really working for me.

1424
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:08,980
Why is it working for you?

1425
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,020
Oh, I'm doing this.

1426
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,420
Oh, well, you know, I don't know if I want to do that.

1427
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:18,260
You know, and like a lot, I would say the last year or so has been a lot of me growing

1428
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,940
more and more successful and going, guys, this is what I'm doing.

1429
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:22,580
This is what I'm doing.

1430
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,660
Everybody else going, I don't know, man, I can probably make it without doing that.

1431
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,460
That a year later going, okay, I didn't make it doing that.

1432
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,700
So you're really describing me.

1433
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,580
You're really describing me.

1434
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,500
Not just you, like Jesse and Hippo are very, like, Jesse started up not a review,

1435
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,540
essentially, for that reason.

1436
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,340
Still not committed to, I think, a-

1437
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,540
But it's, it's, Jesse knows-

1438
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:42,420
No, man, Jesse, I love you, brother.

1439
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,860
Jesse knows what to do, though.

1440
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,420
It's just that he-

1441
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,460
I think Jesse just, he feels like an anger that he has to change to adapt to YouTube,

1442
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,820
whereas I am not coming back.

1443
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,020
And also it's just that his life is so all over the place that he,

1444
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,380
Jesse will just blink off the map for a month, you know, and like, you can't do that.

1445
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,140
Yeah, he's tough to schedule things when you're-

1446
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,540
Right.

1447
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,900
He'll come in and do, like, a whole month of perfectly tailored YouTube content,

1448
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
but then he'll stop for a month, you know.

1449
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,860
He would say that, like, a lot of that recently was due to his basement

1450
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:10,900
flooding and fucking up his life.

1451
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,620
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

1452
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,940
His life situation is always the main reason.

1453
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,620
Like, Jesse, the man goes through hard times, you know.

1454
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:23,220
But like, it's because he never just fully commits to,

1455
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,340
I'm gonna be a YouTuber now.

1456
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,300
He'll do it for a little while.

1457
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,580
I mean, he still goes on about, like,

1458
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,420
I can't wait to escape this fucking hellhole of YouTube.

1459
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,260
Yeah, well, he hates YouTube, you know.

1460
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:35,380
So like, but like, he also, if you look at the way

1461
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,540
his thumbnails and titles have changed over time,

1462
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,140
you can tell he's trying to do the thing.

1463
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:43,460
The not-of-our-view is, like, my Japanese anime,

1464
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,300
some of those he works, I mean, you know, for YouTube,

1465
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,660
he works too hard on them.

1466
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,540
But like, as putting that aside, the length is great,

1467
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,580
those are really good videos, and like, even he acknowledged,

1468
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,340
like, that was his most successful channel.

1469
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:57,620
He's always said that my Japanese anime is the one he wants to protect

1470
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,820
from his bullshit.

1471
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,260
Like, he tries his hardest to make sure

1472
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:02,660
nothing that gets posted there is completely retarded.

1473
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,740
So far, so good, I think.

1474
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,140
Yeah.

1475
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:05,460
Yeah.

1476
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,540
But it's definitely been, like, a thing amongst the PCP

1477
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,300
that, like, I've been kind of being like,

1478
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,140
guys, we have to change.

1479
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,300
The only person who, like, immediately did it is Jeff,

1480
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,140
who then blasted past everybody.

1481
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:23,060
Like, if you look at the early Jeff videos,

1482
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,740
like, whatever you see as a difference

1483
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,140
in the titles and thumbnails, I taught him that.

1484
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,620
He just took it farther than I was willing to.

1485
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,260
You know?

1486
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,020
Like, respect that to some degree.

1487
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:36,180
He's even worse than that is Lachlan Still,

1488
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,620
who is a monster.

1489
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,860
I don't know if you watched The Pedantic Romantic at all.

1490
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,260
Oh, right.

1491
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,460
I forget that that's the same guy.

1492
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,820
He's blowing up, you know?

1493
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,100
He blew up because he's using, like, the dirtiest tactics

1494
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,220
because he loves it.

1495
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,340
Because he sees it as like a-

1496
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,620
He's a Jeff type, I guess.

1497
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:53,140
Dude, he literally will make, like, videos of nothing to do

1498
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,700
with Sword Art Online, and like, he made one that's called

1499
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,020
Sword Art Online is not what this video is about,

1500
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,100
and it's literally just a review of a different show.

1501
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,140
20,000 views, because Sword Art Online's in the title.

1502
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,260
That's some next level shit.

1503
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,100
Yeah, he doesn't give a single fuck.

1504
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:06,340
I should make a Sword Art Online video.

1505
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:06,820
You should.

1506
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,380
It's free.

1507
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,260
I'm not going to.

1508
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,380
I'm not going to do it.

1509
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:09,940
I can't do it.

1510
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,020
You don't even have to make it actually about Sword Art Online.

1511
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,220
Just give it a title, and says it's Sword Art Online.

1512
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,580
I don't know if I have it in me.

1513
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,020
It's literally free views,

1514
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:21,060
and like, Lachlan took it to such a fucking extreme.

1515
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,620
But I mean, this is basically just like,

1516
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,940
everyone taking the stuff that I was preaching,

1517
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,340
and just going even farther with it, you know?

1518
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,100
That's great and all, and then that's totally cool.

1519
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,060
But one thing I wonder about is,

1520
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,060
if everyone's just copying you all the time,

1521
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,900
with the bubble break, I think so.

1522
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,020
Yeah, when's the bubble break?

1523
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,940
Well, that's why I love MiaMath of us so much,

1524
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,060
because when I look at Jeff,

1525
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,260
I think Jeff's got a big problem where he shills so much,

1526
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,380
and everyone really hates it.

1527
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,340
People are getting annoyed, yeah.

1528
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,660
And he doesn't, I don't know if it's just because

1529
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,980
he has enough people who like him anyways,

1530
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,580
that I mean, you know,

1531
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,260
I have lots of people who hate my videos.

1532
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,620
Sure. People who turn on me.

1533
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,100
So, you know.

1534
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,260
Couple of heroic YouTubers outfinding the crusade

1535
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,340
against the egotistical DigiBro.

1536
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1537
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,540
Yes, a couple of valiant YouTubers

1538
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,540
who are fighting the Great Battle.

1539
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,140
Who is this enigmatic man?

1540
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:11,940
I just don't know.

1541
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,140
But like, you know, Jeff definitely has an issue

1542
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,580
where like, he's gotten to a point

1543
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,980
where there's a significant amount of his fan base

1544
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,660
who like, hates him now.

1545
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,020
His fan base you're saying.

1546
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,380
Yeah, like people who are big fans who are leaving him

1547
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,380
because they can't take the shilling,

1548
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:35,060
and they can't take the constant YouTube algorithm playing.

1549
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,900
You know, like, I do it.

1550
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,420
I even tell people I'm doing it.

1551
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,900
I give people the blueprint of how to do it like me.

1552
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,260
That self-awareness goes a long way.

1553
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,140
Yeah, exactly.

1554
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:46,180
And like, and the fact that I'm like,

1555
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,220
telling people how to do it,

1556
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,260
and then not doing it a lot of the time also helps.

1557
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,700
It makes people think you have integrity.

1558
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,140
Right, whereas Jeff, like, people don't think he does,

1559
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,300
you know, because he's not being open about it,

1560
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,540
and he's going so far.

1561
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,380
And with Lachlan, I mean, he's obviously just having fun,

1562
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,460
and he's trying to grow his channel as big as,

1563
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,620
as fast as possible, because he's trying to also leave,

1564
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,460
you know, be a full-time YouTuber.

1565
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,140
But like, I can see him adapting, changing with the times.

1566
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,820
But like, what's so great about me in Mavva

1567
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:18,180
is that you basically did it without copying me.

1568
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,380
Without being.

1569
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,980
Without copying anybody.

1570
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,740
Like, me and Mavva, most of these videos are totally.

1571
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,300
Well, some would argue Fantano was ripped off at a time or two.

1572
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,260
Sure.

1573
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,140
I mean, you definitely.

1574
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,100
Fuck you, Mellonhead.

1575
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,300
This is my shit now.

1576
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,940
You copied plenty of little things from other people,

1577
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,020
but like, there's some stuff in there.

1578
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,260
The fucking Final Fantasy Songs video,

1579
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,060
I can't believe it.

1580
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,740
I've never seen someone do that before.

1581
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,140
Like, just seeing the background music of their video.

1582
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,660
That's the funny thing about me.

1583
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,620
I am a genius, but I am such a perfectionist

1584
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,860
that all my genius ideas get bottled up,

1585
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:48,660
and they don't come out.

1586
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,180
Which is why somebody like me in Mavva

1587
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,380
is such a great thing for a guy like me.

1588
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:51,860
Right.

1589
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,460
Well, it's such a good testing ground,

1590
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,740
because like, I watched that video,

1591
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,380
and like, I don't think it worked

1592
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,860
just because the picture was too close.

1593
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,660
The mixing was fucked.

1594
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,700
Yeah, it was messed up.

1595
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,220
But like, I was like,

1596
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,460
but this is a formula you could do with anything.

1597
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,300
Like, you could have a whole channel that's just this.

1598
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:07,780
Yep.

1599
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:11,860
You know, like, I'm thinking about Smooth McGroove.

1600
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,500
That dude's been around for like five years now,

1601
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,260
and he makes one kind of video,

1602
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:19,060
which is a dude singing acapella

1603
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,260
in eight different screens.

1604
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,580
Like, me and Mavva,

1605
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,540
there's probably about seven video templates

1606
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,740
in there in total,

1607
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,660
and any one of those could have been a whole channel.

1608
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:28,980
Right.

1609
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,420
You know, like, you could have a whole channel

1610
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,740
of super energetic workout guy reviews,

1611
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,700
random manga.

1612
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,020
Yeah.

1613
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,540
You could have a whole channel of like,

1614
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,260
Nate does Let's Plays or whatever.

1615
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,620
The great thing about it,

1616
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,220
yeah, that's really cool.

1617
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,100
I do like that about it.

1618
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,860
And the great thing is people are really starting

1619
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,940
to get invested in me as a person,

1620
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,300
as a creator,

1621
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,180
and they see legitimately that I,

1622
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:50,900
like, I'm not,

1623
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,100
I'm not fucking around.

1624
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,020
I've got a lot of fucking ideas

1625
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,820
that I want to share with people.

1626
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,980
It was really the Angels Egg video

1627
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,100
that where I, like,

1628
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,300
where it was like,

1629
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,460
it was all crashing down on me,

1630
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,820
like, that I was like,

1631
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,860
oh my god,

1632
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,980
I didn't realize that I desperately want

1633
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,740
a video from Nate every day.

1634
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:09,540
Yeah, yeah.

1635
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,300
Like, I, because I,

1636
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,340
I just have always thought that you would never do this.

1637
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,940
Like, the whole time I've known you,

1638
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,860
you've been the perfectionist guy,

1639
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,340
the iceman six months on a video guy,

1640
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,620
and all those videos are great,

1641
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,980
but like, I don't know,

1642
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,540
I guess when you see someone doing that,

1643
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,940
you kind of assume that the,

1644
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,180
like, the amount of time spent

1645
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,940
is a consequence of the greatness.

1646
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,340
Like, like, you couldn't make a great video

1647
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,060
in three days.

1648
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,660
You have to put in that much work.

1649
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,060
Right.

1650
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:37,940
And then seeing me in math,

1651
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,780
I was like, no, this guy could do it.

1652
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,500
Like, he could,

1653
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
you could put out videos as frequently as I do,

1654
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,220
and they'd be at least as good as mine.

1655
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,260
You know, so like,

1656
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,340
that was kind of the thing,

1657
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,340
and it was Angel's Egg that brought that on me,

1658
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:50,820
that I was like,

1659
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,900
he's just talking unscripted about this movie,

1660
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,180
and I'm super interested, you know,

1661
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,340
like, especially because it was a movie that,

1662
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,980
I'm sorry for talking so much

1663
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,780
through Nate's interview,

1664
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,940
not that any of the audience expected it to be.

1665
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:04,340
This is relevant.

1666
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:04,980
This is relevant.

1667
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:05,780
Yeah, but everyone knows.

1668
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,740
Everyone knows what to expect.

1669
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,780
Yeah.

1670
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,340
But, and I talked to you about this.

1671
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:10,660
Right.

1672
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:15,540
Like, fucking Demolition D two years ago

1673
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,860
announced he was going to do an Angel's Egg analysis,

1674
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,420
and he was working on it,

1675
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,740
and like, this dude talked,

1676
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,780
I mean, he talked about it forever.

1677
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,540
He was like, it's one of his favorite movies,

1678
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:28,740
and I watched Angel's Egg in like 2008

1679
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,540
while like, barely awake,

1680
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,460
and like, I didn't understand any of it.

1681
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:33,620
Right.

1682
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,420
I just watched it and I was like,

1683
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,700
well, that was fucking weird.

1684
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:35,940
She was.

1685
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,540
I had no idea what happened, right?

1686
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,580
I mean, I thought it was cool,

1687
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,420
but no real opinion.

1688
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,780
I just went, oh, it's another Mamoru Oshii thing,

1689
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,580
because they're all like that.

1690
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,300
So quirky.

1691
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:45,940
Yeah.

1692
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,260
So like, he's saying he's going to do this,

1693
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,620
and I was super hyped for it.

1694
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,300
I was like, dude, fuck yeah,

1695
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,420
because he's only really done like,

1696
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:54,100
one serious analytical video,

1697
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,940
which was the Eva vs. Rebuilds,

1698
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,220
which was a great video series.

1699
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:57,780
It was.

1700
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,340
So I was like, man,

1701
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,780
I'm so hyped for Demo to get like,

1702
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,060
legit again, you know,

1703
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:04,100
and he was talking about it,

1704
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,220
and then he kept putting it off

1705
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,260
to do other things,

1706
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,140
to do like,

1707
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,580
fucking Himoto,

1708
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,220
Himatuchan,

1709
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,260
who the fuck cares.

1710
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,260
That video's a little bit of a disgrace.

1711
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,220
No, I take it back.

1712
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:13,940
I love you, Demo.

1713
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:14,580
Please come back.

1714
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,380
I worship you.

1715
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,260
But like, he'll come back

1716
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,020
and do like a little thing here and there,

1717
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,220
and then he just like,

1718
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,020
blinks off the map,

1719
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,660
and the thing is,

1720
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,700
I was following his Twitter,

1721
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,740
and he was like,

1722
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:25,860
he literally can.

1723
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,420
I mean, he's gone.

1724
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,060
He's gone.

1725
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,220
Been over a year since his last video.

1726
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,380
Yeah, and he doesn't even tweet anymore,

1727
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:31,860
or livestream.

1728
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,420
Really?

1729
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,300
No, he's still livestreams.

1730
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:33,940
That's not true.

1731
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,700
People, yeah, he does stream.

1732
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,180
Well, he, for a while,

1733
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,820
he was talking about the Angels Egg video on Twitter,

1734
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,740
and he was like posting screencaps of like,

1735
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,140
I guess there was some kind of compression problem

1736
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:45,860
with this video,

1737
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,540
so it kind of had like artifacts in it.

1738
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,380
Oh, so he gave up on the project.

1739
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:49,620
Yeah.

1740
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,420
Like a pussy.

1741
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,660
Like, he couldn't figure out

1742
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,340
how to encode the video, right?

1743
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:57,540
And like, I think he lost some of it at some point,

1744
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,140
and then just like gave up.

1745
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,580
I mean, I would feel the temptation

1746
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,780
to give up at a point like that, too.

1747
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,500
Yeah, and I even like,

1748
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,780
brought it up to him in like,

1749
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,300
Nino's livestreams that he was in.

1750
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:05,620
I was like,

1751
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,060
hey, when's the Angels Egg video coming?

1752
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,660
And he's like, uh, I don't know, man.

1753
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,860
Like, and so I'm sitting here like two years later,

1754
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,100
like, I really wanted this video

1755
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,700
because no one else has stepped up

1756
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,540
and explained Angels Egg.

1757
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,220
And I've had people ask me to do it.

1758
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:19,780
Have people be like,

1759
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,460
hey, you ever thought about doing a video on Angels Egg?

1760
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,180
And I've told them,

1761
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,460
demo's working on one.

1762
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,580
So I'm not going to do it

1763
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,460
because he's going to do it.

1764
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,660
And he already has,

1765
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,140
like, if I just go watch this movie

1766
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,140
and like try to make an analysis,

1767
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,220
like, who's to say if I'm even going to find

1768
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:34,180
the real meaning of it?

1769
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:36,660
Like, this dude clearly found something meaningful

1770
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,020
and that's why he wanted to make a video,

1771
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,860
which you also did.

1772
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:41,540
I mean, full disclosure,

1773
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:43,620
I did research to understand what was going on.

1774
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,140
It's not like I understood it immediately myself.

1775
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:45,860
But you watched it

1776
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,700
and desperately wanted to understand.

1777
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,740
Like, as soon as I finished,

1778
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,180
I was like, I need to know

1779
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,300
what the fuck is going on.

1780
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,980
Because you care a lot about

1781
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,340
Yoshitaka Amano's art.

1782
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:54,580
Yeah.

1783
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,020
You are obviously very into the visuals of the movie.

1784
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,740
This is the best Yoshitaka Amano film.

1785
01:13:59,380 --> 01:13:59,620
So.

1786
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:03,140
And Bloodlust, the one that ruined my life,

1787
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,860
is another one.

1788
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:04,980
And I'm saying this one's better.

1789
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:05,540
So there you go.

1790
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,140
Did you ever watch A Thousand One Nights?

1791
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,100
No, but I really want to.

1792
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,660
I will one time.

1793
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,180
At some point.

1794
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,140
But yeah, so you come out with this video and it's like...

1795
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,420
Are you saying it's better than Angel's Egg?

1796
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,460
I'm just, I'm just totally...

1797
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,340
No, no, no, no.

1798
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:16,740
Okay, I just want to...

1799
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,260
It's just pure.

1800
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,860
It's like no narrative whatsoever.

1801
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,460
It's just like crazy animation.

1802
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,820
Knowing that going in, it sounds great.

1803
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,140
I would love to.

1804
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:23,460
Yeah.

1805
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:27,140
It's like 20 minutes of nonstop insane Yoshitaka Amano.

1806
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,220
It looks like he animated it himself.

1807
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:29,860
That's what's good about it.

1808
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,540
Dude, like, seriously?

1809
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,740
That sounds insane, bro.

1810
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,580
Seriously, okay.

1811
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,060
All right.

1812
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:40,660
But, but, you know, you make this video and like it's just a vlog.

1813
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,940
But I didn't understand this movie and now I do.

1814
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,700
So to me, that was worth as much as Demo's video ever would have been.

1815
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,060
Like, yeah, this is not...

1816
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,780
All the Holden reviews like whacking yourself off,

1817
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,220
animating the like fucking words,

1818
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,020
moving around the screen.

1819
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,460
Who the fuck gives a shit?

1820
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,420
Yeah, exactly.

1821
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,780
No, no, no hate on you Holden.

1822
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,540
I just think you're wasting your time with that shit, dude.

1823
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,700
Total hate on you Holden.

1824
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,780
I'm not, I don't have no hatred for the guy.

1825
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:11,940
Anyway, like, yeah, like, sure, it's not like a super rewatchable,

1826
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,260
like, piece of art YouTube video.

1827
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,940
But I got something out of it in a big way.

1828
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,780
Anyone who wants to watch a fucking YouTube video

1829
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:20,500
about what the fuck Angel's Egg is about, you can watch the video.

1830
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,900
By the way, if people commented and as I was doing other research,

1831
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,940
like, there are alternate interpretations.

1832
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,860
Like, there's this whole thing about how you really can make a strong case

1833
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,460
for how the anime is like...

1834
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,860
And it's not like it excludes like my interpretation at all.

1835
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,700
It's just like, there's multiple layers here.

1836
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,940
You can also say that it's all about like masculine

1837
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,380
and female relationships.

1838
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,060
And you can say like, like, it's this woman,

1839
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,140
it's this little girl like protecting her egg,

1840
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,060
and then like a strong man comes along

1841
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,980
and like shatters it, robs her of like...

1842
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:49,940
With a huge fucking knife.

1843
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,020
With a giant fucking, you know, schlong.

1844
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,180
And like, then she immediately like turns into an adult, dies,

1845
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,540
and then like eggs are produced.

1846
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,180
So like, she's like sacrificed for like, you know,

1847
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,340
the future of mankind or whatever.

1848
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,580
So like, there's tons of parallels you can make to that shit too.

1849
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:08,180
But I mean, as I admit it, it's what I got out of it.

1850
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,140
Like, it's my interpretation.

1851
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,780
And I'm sure they put lots of loaded imagery into it

1852
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,460
just to be able to have all those different interpretations, you know?

1853
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,100
Without a doubt.

1854
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,900
Um, like, that kind of symbolism is pretty fucking blatant, you know?

1855
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,500
Like, oh, an egg and a huge weapon.

1856
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,860
What could these represent?

1857
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,460
I wonder, you know?

1858
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,940
But like, that video, it even gave me more confidence in my own stuff

1859
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:36,820
because like a problem I have is that I make shitloads and shitloads of logs.

1860
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,020
And like, I'm always explaining something I've already thought about.

1861
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:44,340
And so I watched the video back and I'm like, okay, and then I'll post it.

1862
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,620
And then like a day later, I'm like, this is worthless.

1863
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,580
Why did I make this?

1864
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,020
This is so stupid.

1865
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:53,540
But then I watched something like the Angels Egg video and I'm like, okay, this,

1866
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:58,900
like, now that I'm outside of myself and like watching someone else do what I do,

1867
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,700
I get why people enjoy it, you know?

1868
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,540
Like, I, like, because you already know what you're trying to say.

1869
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,580
So you explain it and you're like, who the fuck cares about this?

1870
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:11,620
But it's like for the audience, if they don't know this stuff,

1871
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,540
then it's like, to them, it's a total mind blow.

1872
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,340
That's a struggle.

1873
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,100
I go through with every single video.

1874
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,500
And like, considering that, like me and Gabe have talked about this a lot,

1875
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,140
like the fact that we work on a video for so long,

1876
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,900
like that feeling only gets worse.

1877
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:26,180
The longer you're looking at the same idea you came up with six months ago.

1878
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,380
That's why I, it's brutal.

1879
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,420
That's why I keep my fucking work schedule so tight.

1880
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,020
Because like, you really have to manipulate your own psychology

1881
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:37,140
and have like a grip on yourself and keep yourself disciplined.

1882
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,180
If you'd want to do that shit.

1883
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:43,140
There was a time I really wanted to do stuff like the big 45 minute edited videos.

1884
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,980
And like, you know, I can do it.

1885
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:49,700
I did it with the part one of the sort of line season two video.

1886
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:54,500
Like the reason I don't, it has nothing to do with success on YouTube.

1887
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,820
Like this was before I knew that you needed to have constant content.

1888
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:04,100
It was entirely because after about one week, I hate my video.

1889
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,420
Right.

1890
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,220
It happens to everybody.

1891
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:08,020
Like just happening, like having to hear it over and over again,

1892
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,500
you gradually are like, this doesn't make any sense.

1893
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,420
Like, does anybody get this?

1894
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,940
Like, am I saying anything?

1895
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,100
And in some cases, I might have even been right.

1896
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,020
Like there's some videos I go back and watch and I don't get the point.

1897
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:26,100
And I'm like, okay, I guess I was just totally wrapped up in my own head on this one.

1898
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,100
And like, I didn't really explain things that well.

1899
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,780
But like, um, yeah, it's really dangerous.

1900
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:34,740
Like the more time you spend on a video, the more you gradually come to hate it.

1901
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:39,060
So like when you do get it out there all at once, like, even if you don't get it,

1902
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:43,220
you know, if the audience likes it, then the audience likes it.

1903
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:47,380
Like even if you're not sure why, you know, like there's some vlogs I make where I'm like,

1904
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,220
I literally don't know what the appeal of this is.

1905
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,940
But it's got 10,000 views and it's got all upvotes and the commenters like it.

1906
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:57,300
And nobody's bitched on me on Patreon that I'm not making good enough content.

1907
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,660
So I guess it's fine.

1908
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:02,020
That's kind of the funny thing about living the Patreon lifestyle.

1909
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,140
Like really, I mean, I always, well, I don't really say this all the time,

1910
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:09,460
but I'm always thinking that like, if you're making like 10 billion,

1911
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:12,660
whatever, you're making like $10,000 a month on Patreon.

1912
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:17,220
But like what you make is like something that seems worthless.

1913
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:21,460
Like you make one fucking MS Paint drawing just as whatever, as an example.

1914
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:26,340
You're a postmodernist artist and you make shitty MS Paint drawings once a month and you make $10,000.

1915
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:32,340
Like people might be angry about that or be concerned, but that seems silly to me.

1916
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,780
It is purely a contract between you and the people giving you a money.

1917
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,380
If they are satisfied, that is literally the only thing that matters.

1918
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:43,540
And which is, which is why I mean, to a certain extent, I don't really like that people can just

1919
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,460
see what you make on Patreon.

1920
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,580
But you can hide that.

1921
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,900
I know you can hide it, but even doing that is kind of like,

1922
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,580
you have to make a choice to hide it.

1923
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,420
And I think the audience will resent.

1924
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,820
I mean, because I personally would be a little suspicious.

1925
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,020
Just I don't even know why.

1926
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:59,060
I think I'd only be suspicious if it changed from what like,

1927
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:03,060
if you started off that way, which some people do, then like,

1928
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:06,180
I don't like the idea really of people knowing how much money I make.

1929
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,780
It rubs me the wrong way a little bit.

1930
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:11,380
Because I mean, you fucking people out there don't tell everyone how much you make.

1931
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:15,220
Right, well, it's not, it's not normal to have your,

1932
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,740
your paycheck known to everybody.

1933
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,340
And really it should just be, but like,

1934
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,660
people shouldn't be basing their patron pledges on how much you've made.

1935
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,620
It should be based on how much you value the content and nothing else.

1936
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,740
Which is something that we all absolutely do.

1937
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,500
You don't patron anybody, but like the rest of me and Ben have both done this,

1938
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,380
where like, we see someone reach a certain amount and we're like,

1939
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,220
well, he's already making enough money.

1940
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,500
Exactly, exactly.

1941
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,540
Like, God, who did I do that to recently?

1942
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,620
I've done it to a lot of people.

1943
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,500
Like, like, like when they pass me and I go,

1944
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,060
That's really, that's not how it should work.

1945
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,100
That's not how it should work.

1946
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,780
Oh, that's why the, yeah, the version of Patreon where it hides the money is great

1947
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,380
because it still shows the goals.

1948
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,180
Like it says, oh, we've, we're 80% to our goal.

1949
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,100
You don't need to know what my goal is.

1950
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,540
Because it's what's comfortable for me.

1951
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,900
It's not what's comfortable for you.

1952
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,140
Right.

1953
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,180
You know, some people will be like,

1954
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,380
how come you need $2,000 a month to live?

1955
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,820
I need to fucking live, nigga.

1956
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:09,460
God damn it.

1957
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,780
I need to survive in this fucking earth.

1958
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:14,100
Oh man, I really get fired up about this issue.

1959
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,740
People like, like, this is a big thing on 4chan.

1960
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,060
This is one of the things that I hate about 4chan.

1961
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,700
Like how, it's not that they're like anti-e-celeb.

1962
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,220
Like, you can hate e-celebs all fucking day.

1963
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:23,780
That's fine.

1964
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:26,820
It's that they resent people for making money online,

1965
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,020
making content.

1966
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,580
It's because they are just so fundamentally wrong

1967
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,020
in their basic assumptions that like,

1968
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,340
what they're making is not valuable.

1969
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:35,700
And it's, that's just so wrong.

1970
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,380
It's like, why aren't you giving your money to fucking,

1971
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,500
I don't know, Comcast.

1972
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,020
Like, they deserve your money.

1973
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,700
Or, I don't know, like anything else.

1974
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,460
Comcast doesn't deserve anyone's money.

1975
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,900
Yeah, that's a bad example.

1976
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,140
But like, you should be fucking giving it to us

1977
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,460
like some, give it to fucking, I don't know,

1978
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,420
blocks news or whatever.

1979
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,380
For me, for example, give it to the anime staff.

1980
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,620
Don't pay the guy who's just talking about anime.

1981
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,620
Pay the people who make the anime.

1982
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:03,380
But for a lot of people, I'm giving them more

1983
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:04,340
than what the show is.

1984
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,020
Like, I mean, for me personally,

1985
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,780
I'm obsessed with analysis videos.

1986
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,660
And like, with video games in particular,

1987
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,940
I don't play games.

1988
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,860
I just watch videos about games.

1989
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,820
I think I beat two games last year.

1990
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,420
And that's like it.

1991
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,340
I played through Doom and Dark Souls 3.

1992
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:20,980
And that was it.

1993
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,580
This is reminding me of how excited I am

1994
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,700
now that BMMafa's done.

1995
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,460
I can finish playing Demon's Souls

1996
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,660
and I can beat Hollow Knight.

1997
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:26,740
Oh my god.

1998
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,100
Oh, you haven't beat Demon's Souls?

1999
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:28,420
Of course.

2000
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,300
I've beat it many times.

2001
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,380
But I'm playing it again because I love it so much.

2002
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,500
This is perfect.

2003
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:32,820
It's gonna be great.

2004
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:33,540
It's a perfect game.

2005
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,420
It is perfect.

2006
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,460
Okay, but was video about it?

2007
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,340
Everyone go to Hippo Creek?

2008
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,380
I haven't seen that yet.

2009
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,340
I didn't get the chance.

2010
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,340
Oh dude, you should watch the video

2011
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,980
and look at Jesse's comment from The Virtus Room.

2012
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,420
Oh, didn't he leave like a giant?

2013
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,180
It was a giant novel-sized comment.

2014
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,300
It was fucking great.

2015
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:47,540
Why?

2016
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,460
Shout out to Hippo Creek and hit this, Jesse.

2017
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,580
Write a novel-like comment.

2018
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:51,940
Because you like the video so much.

2019
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:52,100
Okay, that's awesome.

2020
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:52,980
He should just make a video

2021
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,500
out of literally that comment.

2022
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,140
It would be great.

2023
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,140
That's excellent.

2024
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,820
I love you, Hippo.

2025
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:01,220
I thought that's another thing I love about the PCP

2026
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,380
is we all love each other's shit so much.

2027
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:03,940
Yeah, we do.

2028
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,540
In spite of the fact that like,

2029
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,340
and this is funny because Jesse's always advocating

2030
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,540
for the death of the PCP,

2031
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,860
but like I don't know if people understand why.

2032
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,780
And it's because the PCP podcast brings out

2033
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,180
the worst of our interactions.

2034
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:18,580
Sometimes, yeah.

2035
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,820
We're like, it's because we overstuff it.

2036
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,700
There's, we always end up letting too many people in.

2037
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,260
We're working on it.

2038
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:25,300
We're never working on it.

2039
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,900
Like the last one I was on,

2040
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,620
there was like five people scheduled to be on

2041
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,180
and then Hippo just would not not be on.

2042
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,060
Well, I'm sure we agreed that he would be on.

2043
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,140
No, he just complained all day.

2044
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:38,900
Hippo complained?

2045
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,060
Yeah.

2046
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:39,860
Hippo's not a complainer.

2047
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,460
It's because you weren't there.

2048
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:41,700
Yeah, okay.

2049
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,100
And like, like you and Ben weren't around.

2050
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,060
And you were like, we were waiting for you guys.

2051
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,620
And Hippo was like, oh, I really want to be in this one.

2052
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,940
And we were like, there's already five people signed up.

2053
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,540
Your name's not in the thing at all.

2054
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:55,860
And he's just like, yeah, but I really want to be in this one.

2055
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,420
And we were like, well, maybe Ben won't show up

2056
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,940
because he hasn't gotten there yet.

2057
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:01,940
I want Hippo to be involved in everything I do.

2058
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:02,420
Yeah.

2059
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:02,900
He's so wonderful.

2060
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,500
That's the only reason none of us kicked him out

2061
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,460
because we always wanted there.

2062
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,100
Who could deny Hippo?

2063
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,420
But then we ended up with a six-person podcast

2064
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,020
that turned into a clusterfuck.

2065
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,620
And people always argue.

2066
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,580
And then everybody, I mean, I never do, but like,

2067
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,860
a lot, like Ben or Jesse, if we get,

2068
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,380
if they get mad in the podcast,

2069
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,340
that is real anger that stays with them all day.

2070
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,180
Like they will keep bringing it up,

2071
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,340
how mad they were about that argument, you know.

2072
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,180
And like it, it, you know, mixes our audiences

2073
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,820
in annoying ways, tons of memes and bullshit

2074
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:36,980
and the awful PCP fan chat that probably shouldn't exist.

2075
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,340
You guys hate it more than I do.

2076
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,300
I'm in there all the time.

2077
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,740
I just poke my head in every once in a while.

2078
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,420
I find them, I find them totally inoffensive.

2079
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:46,100
But, but, but all this stuff like springs out of the PCP.

2080
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:46,260
Yeah.

2081
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,300
But when you, when you look past that,

2082
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:53,540
and it's just like us as friends watching one another's videos,

2083
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,860
we are just like on each other's dicks.

2084
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,260
Like it's burst linking all fucking day.

2085
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:58,660
True.

2086
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,820
Like half of the PCP chat,

2087
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,060
if any of us actually makes a video,

2088
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,460
the PCP chat is just all of us talking about

2089
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,780
how fucking great the other person's video is.

2090
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,340
That's true.

2091
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,420
Particularly if it's you, Hippo, or Jesse.

2092
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:10,820
Yeah.

2093
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,340
Like we all kind of, you know,

2094
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,540
those are the ones that we're all like particularly invested in.

2095
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:16,100
But that might-

2096
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,860
Nobody cares about me and Mumkey's videos,

2097
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:20,660
because we post so much that nobody can possibly give a shit.

2098
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,220
That's the thing.

2099
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,020
That's the only thing.

2100
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,900
Like I don't blame anyone.

2101
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,780
Neither does Mumkey.

2102
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:28,500
It's like, no, we post like four videos a day.

2103
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,420
I can't expect anybody to care.

2104
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,460
Currently one of my favorite videos in the world is Mumkey's

2105
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,940
like Yu-Gi-Oh dual destiny playthrough.

2106
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,980
Oh, you watch that shit?

2107
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:39,780
Every morning when I wake up on my way to work,

2108
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,620
I listen to that shit and I fucking love it.

2109
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,660
It's so good.

2110
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,500
Mumkey, do that forever.

2111
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,540
It's my favorite.

2112
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,860
I prefer the Spyro playthrough.

2113
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,740
That's done though, right?

2114
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:49,300
Or is that still going?

2115
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,660
No, he started out the second game,

2116
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,460
but he's only done one.

2117
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,220
I think he said I was supposed to be the first guest

2118
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,740
that Motherfucker hasn't invited me on.

2119
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:58,180
Me either, I still have it, but he did one with Sheepover

2120
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,140
and that's the only one I saw so far.

2121
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,020
I did see that.

2122
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,540
The fuck is Spyro?

2123
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,980
Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh forever.

2124
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:03,700
That's what I want.

2125
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,420
I can't do the Yu-Gi-Oh ones because I won't watch it.

2126
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,580
I kind of watch it a little bit.

2127
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:13,220
With me, my way of watching Mumkey was that for a really long time,

2128
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:16,100
I was always getting a sandwich for lunch.

2129
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,540
Subway sandwich, you get the deluxe secret?

2130
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:22,900
Usually Wawa, but I'd go get a sandwich and I'd come back

2131
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:26,660
and it takes me exactly 18 to 20 minutes to eat a sandwich.

2132
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:30,420
So I'd always watch the latest Pokemon Nuzlocke video,

2133
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:35,060
but then I got sick of the Nuzlocke's because same fucking shit every time.

2134
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,100
You got boring with those, but he fixed it by making Yu-Gi-Oh videos.

2135
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,700
I like the Spyro.

2136
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,500
Ben, finish your fucking Nuzlocke piece of shit.

2137
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:42,660
Yeah.

2138
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:43,860
Fuck you.

2139
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:46,500
I'm literally the biggest fan and fuck you.

2140
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,100
You're the only one I think who watches all of Ben's Nuzlocke's.

2141
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,860
I love those fucking Nuzlocke's so much.

2142
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:54,100
They're really well made, I just don't have time.

2143
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,020
I got nothing but time, dude.

2144
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:58,100
When I'm at work, well, I mean, when I'm at work,

2145
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,780
I just have a lot of, because I'm working on code,

2146
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:04,180
I have a lot of time to listen to podcasts and just veg out and do my work.

2147
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,220
So it's perfect.

2148
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,300
It's great for consuming YouTube stuff.

2149
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:07,540
Right.

2150
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:08,500
All right.

2151
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:13,300
Well, to get us back to our chronological timeline,

2152
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,460
get us into your college years.

2153
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,540
What did you study?

2154
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,220
I went to the College of New Jersey,

2155
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,580
originally as like an open options science major,

2156
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,620
because I wasn't good enough to be on like the pre-med track.

2157
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,100
I might have just not been decided,

2158
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,860
but I was not that great a student.

2159
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,660
I was like a B kid.

2160
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,780
I was like a B kid.

2161
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,420
And I'll jack myself off and say it's cuz.

2162
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:38,420
I was like bored and didn't give a shit.

2163
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,100
Maybe I was just dumb, who the fuck knows.

2164
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:45,460
But so I go to college looking into science stuff in general.

2165
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,020
It takes me like a year or two to decide,

2166
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,140
and so I wasted all that time,

2167
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,580
took a bunch of classes I didn't need,

2168
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,780
which is why I spent, took so long to get my fucking degree.

2169
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,060
Yeah, you took like six years.

2170
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,060
It took me eight and a half years.

2171
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,980
Eight and a half to get a bachelor's.

2172
01:27:58,980 --> 01:27:59,700
That's correct.

2173
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,220
But that's a lot.

2174
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,860
That's literally double the time it's supposed to take.

2175
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,780
It is a long time, but in my defense,

2176
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,860
like it's not like I was taking full classes.

2177
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,820
Like I was working full time at various, you know,

2178
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,940
jobs while I was finishing up like one class per semester

2179
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,420
after I left full-time schooling.

2180
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,820
And like I made money overall,

2181
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:20,980
but like there was a life cost.

2182
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:24,340
Like that was like the worst time in my life doing that shit.

2183
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:28,020
You lost all your souls.

2184
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,300
What's a good metaphor here?

2185
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,220
What's a good video gamey metaphor

2186
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,980
for the draining effect this had?

2187
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:34,740
It was like you were cursed.

2188
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,940
You were gaining lots of souls,

2189
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,700
but you had a curse on you.

2190
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,260
That's true.

2191
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,180
And it would just get my HP bar would be lower.

2192
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,780
Like before they patched Dark Souls 1,

2193
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,580
it just kept getting lower back in those days.

2194
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,500
And I would walk up to my,

2195
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,940
I'd be in the catacombs, you know,

2196
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,380
when there's the basilisk there.

2197
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:50,820
I would see my soul pile there,

2198
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,020
and I'd be like, I'm gonna get to it.

2199
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,780
I'm gonna get to it this time to reclaim all my souls.

2200
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,660
And then I would die.

2201
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,900
And all my souls be gone, no way to recover them.

2202
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,020
And your HP's cut in half.

2203
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,940
And my HP keeps getting cut in half.

2204
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,060
That was fucking brutal.

2205
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,100
That was sick though.

2206
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,660
I like that.

2207
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:08,260
In any case, so eventually I settle on computer.

2208
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,060
Not even computer science.

2209
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,660
Did you play Dark Souls early enough

2210
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:14,980
to have the original version of the fire fucking lava place?

2211
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:15,780
What's it called?

2212
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,420
Eazelith.

2213
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:16,900
Eazelith.

2214
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:17,780
Lost Eazelith.

2215
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:21,460
Um, actually my friend got into Demon's Souls

2216
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,820
right when it came out.

2217
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:24,420
But all of us played it and all of us were like,

2218
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,460
this is shit.

2219
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,060
This game fucking sucks.

2220
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:28,900
The version I'm playing right now was bought like,

2221
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,460
like the year that it came out.

2222
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,060
And like none of us,

2223
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,420
none of my friends appreciated it at the time.

2224
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,500
We all thought it was garbage and didn't get it at all.

2225
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,980
And it was like, it was like well after Dark Souls,

2226
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:39,540
one was out.

2227
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,980
Like the hype had started to build.

2228
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,500
So you probably didn't play original Lost.

2229
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,300
I probably not.

2230
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:43,460
Why?

2231
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:44,260
What was different about it?

2232
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,740
Well, when the game shipped Lost Eazelith,

2233
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:49,060
which is the shittiest level in the game,

2234
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:49,700
but originally-

2235
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:50,260
Everyone says that.

2236
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:50,900
I think it's okay.

2237
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,020
I don't know.

2238
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,260
I mean, the Demon legs are shitty.

2239
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:54,900
Yeah.

2240
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,900
Well, originally those all had like a giant aggro range.

2241
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,820
So like the whole way through Lost Eazelith

2242
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:02,740
was just constantly fighting those

2243
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,980
like one after another in packs.

2244
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,180
Those do suck ass.

2245
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:08,660
And then they, but then they patched it

2246
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:11,140
and just made it so they have no aggro range.

2247
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:13,700
So now Lost Eazelith is you just run through.

2248
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,060
You know, I remember playing that

2249
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,060
and I remember them all getting aggroed.

2250
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:18,740
So I think I did play the original version.

2251
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,260
I literally fought none of them.

2252
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:20,900
Oh, I fought all.

2253
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:21,940
Yeah. Like they would all run at us.

2254
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,460
If you fought them all that you played the original.

2255
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,460
We fought them and the way that we beat them was

2256
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,900
because I played this with my friends back in college,

2257
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,260
like they would all like attack us,

2258
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,540
but they would hit each other

2259
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:30,740
and they would just kill each other.

2260
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,100
And that's how we managed to get through.

2261
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:32,900
Yeah.

2262
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,420
That's probably what they intended,

2263
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,660
but it was just like didn't work well enough

2264
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:37,940
and it was too hard and they-

2265
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:38,900
Not a great level.

2266
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,700
Not a great level.

2267
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,860
No, it's definitely the worst level of the game.

2268
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:42,980
I think they'll ever like remake it

2269
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,020
because like they've said like,

2270
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,140
yeah, we just didn't finish it.

2271
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,500
We just didn't have time.

2272
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,780
I would have who cares.

2273
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,940
Anyway, so you're losing all your souls

2274
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:50,740
going through college.

2275
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,380
Right. So, but before that,

2276
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:55,540
my four years in college were pretty good.

2277
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:00,900
So around latter half of like sophomore year,

2278
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:03,300
I get into like games development

2279
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,060
with my buddy Rich and my buddies John

2280
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,780
and Mike and Femi.

2281
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,500
And Mike-

2282
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,740
Wait, wait, you had a Rich and a Mike

2283
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,900
and you almost had a Jay.

2284
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,380
You had John, but you're close.

2285
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:17,700
Why was that?

2286
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,140
You almost had Red Letter Media.

2287
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,660
Like you had almost all of them.

2288
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:21,940
That's true. It was close.

2289
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,620
And yeah, like we-

2290
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:27,060
I was friends with-

2291
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:27,460
Let me see.

2292
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,220
I didn't know any of them at first,

2293
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,700
but one fateful day at Anime Club,

2294
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:33,700
we were-

2295
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,140
I don't know why they were there.

2296
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,020
Like they-

2297
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,620
None of these guys were as big anime bosses,

2298
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,100
but okay.

2299
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,700
So it was me and I'm just describing this

2300
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:40,980
because I want to jack off myself

2301
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,700
about my friends Rich and Rich, Femi and John.

2302
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:47,300
So one day at Anime Club, John and Rich,

2303
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,660
I believe happened to be there

2304
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,980
and we just met and we talked and we became friends.

2305
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:53,060
We went back to their place, played Smash Brothers,

2306
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,500
became friends, it was great.

2307
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,180
I believe it was the next year

2308
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:59,060
we were at my townhouse where I lived

2309
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,980
and I lived with her with John.

2310
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,900
And down at the end of the hall

2311
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,420
was this guy Femi,

2312
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,860
this little Chinese kid,

2313
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:06,980
in his own place,

2314
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,260
in his own room.

2315
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,820
And I don't remember how,

2316
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,860
but I believe it was a discussion

2317
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,940
about Melty Blood was going on

2318
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:14,660
and he overheard.

2319
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,340
His ears perked up when he heard Melty Blood.

2320
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:16,900
It was like-

2321
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,420
Not something you hear a lot about.

2322
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,940
If you hear about Melty Blood

2323
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,500
and you know what it-

2324
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,420
I've played literally one match

2325
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,740
of Melty Blood at Necocon before.

2326
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,940
I don't even know what the characters are in the game.

2327
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:32,100
I just know it's all Type Moon characters.

2328
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,220
He got Earth or whatever her name is.

2329
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:38,260
My point is that I don't even like Type Moon.

2330
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,420
I don't like highly technical fighters.

2331
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,580
And still, if people were talking

2332
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:43,700
about Melty Blood near me,

2333
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,340
I'd be like,

2334
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,100
Whoa, are you guys talking about Melty Blood?

2335
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,620
It's a certain type of person

2336
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,220
who would talk about Melty Blood

2337
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:51,380
that you know that they're in your wheelhouse.

2338
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:52,340
So we like-

2339
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,780
To clarify for our audience,

2340
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,980
Melty Blood is like a-

2341
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:57,300
Type Moon fighting game.

2342
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,780
Yeah, but it's like a doging game, right?

2343
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,660
Like it was sold at,

2344
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,140
I don't think it was ever professionally released.

2345
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,340
It's like a commentary-

2346
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:04,980
I didn't know that.

2347
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,020
I mean, I played it a little bit,

2348
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,140
just like fighting with some of these guys.

2349
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,060
That game's old as shit, you know?

2350
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,140
And it's from the people who later went on

2351
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,820
to make Under Night Inbirth

2352
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,220
and Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax.

2353
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,460
And they became like a major fighting game developer

2354
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,820
It was like a borderline fan game, I think.

2355
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:21,780
Yeah, yeah.

2356
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,220
That they just kind of made

2357
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:25,060
and with all the Type Moon characters

2358
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:26,260
from like back before-

2359
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:28,100
I mean, I guess Fate's Stay Night

2360
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,140
was popular at the time,

2361
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:29,540
but like,

2362
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:34,180
they were not the gigantic fucking thing

2363
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,540
that they are now, you know?

2364
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:36,100
That's true.

2365
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:38,260
It was definitely obscure.

2366
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:39,060
It was the kind of thing

2367
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,340
that if you knew about Melty Blood,

2368
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:42,420
you had to be like a deep level otaku coming back.

2369
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:42,900
That's right.

2370
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,940
So that's when, I believe,

2371
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:44,500
Femme-

2372
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,460
it might have been something else

2373
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,420
and that came up another time.

2374
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,780
But there was something that tipped off Femme

2375
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,380
that like, oh, fellow people

2376
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:50,500
interested in this shit.

2377
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,740
And he joined our circle of companions

2378
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,660
and we all became fast friends

2379
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,700
all through the end of college.

2380
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:58,180
So meanwhile, during this time,

2381
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,380
like me and my buddy Rich,

2382
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,540
we decided to make a video game

2383
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,300
to enter this contest.

2384
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,140
So at this point, like,

2385
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,500
yeah, we were doing like video game development.

2386
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,020
There was this new major

2387
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,860
at the school Interactive Multimedia

2388
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,340
that we were like,

2389
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,300
this is like the games I won.

2390
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,020
Let's get into it.

2391
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,340
And eventually I would like get away from that.

2392
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,380
But at the time I was into that,

2393
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,500
I was doing a double major of that

2394
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,300
in computer science,

2395
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:20,180
just because like Rich was a very practical guy

2396
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,060
and was like, you know,

2397
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,020
you should, you know,

2398
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,860
interact in multimedia is cool and all,

2399
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:26,020
but you should still do some computer science.

2400
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,660
It's like, you can be like an idea guy

2401
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,180
with the IMM shit,

2402
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:32,500
but like, you're going to want an actual job.

2403
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,940
So get the computer science degree.

2404
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:36,020
And that's exactly what has paid off in my life.

2405
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:37,700
But in any case,

2406
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,860
so we decided to make a game

2407
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:40,500
and we entered this,

2408
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,380
it was like a GameStop funded,

2409
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,300
like full ride to this thing called

2410
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,420
full sale university,

2411
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,300
which is like a game design school in Florida,

2412
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,020
I want to say,

2413
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,300
this is somewhere around.

2414
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:53,460
And we were competing to win it.

2415
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,740
And we, we finished our,

2416
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:57,300
it took us a full year working on this game,

2417
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,740
but we did finish it.

2418
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,340
And incidentally, you can play it.

2419
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,620
If you go to my Twitch,

2420
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:04,340
it's like twitch.com slash definitely best guy ever.

2421
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,780
There's like videos of us playing it.

2422
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,180
Oh, you know what?

2423
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:06,500
It's on,

2424
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,100
it's on Bestie Boy as well.

2425
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:08,260
Yeah.

2426
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:08,740
I think.

2427
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:08,980
Yeah.

2428
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:09,060
Yeah.

2429
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:09,140
Yeah.

2430
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:09,220
Yeah.

2431
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,100
Go to, go to like full play.

2432
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:11,300
It's on Bestie Boy.

2433
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,020
Find it on Bestie Boy.

2434
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:12,660
There's like links to it

2435
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:13,380
if you want to play it.

2436
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,020
It's this,

2437
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:15,460
it's this RPG maker.

2438
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,580
We made it like RPG maker XL

2439
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:18,900
or whatever,

2440
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,020
like the fancier one was,

2441
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:20,980
where you,

2442
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:24,100
it's like a mystery puzzle game,

2443
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:24,660
basically,

2444
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,700
with a couple of little,

2445
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,140
little bits of action in it.

2446
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:27,700
And it's,

2447
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,500
it's really fun.

2448
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,340
I call it an adventure puzzle game.

2449
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:31,300
Like an adventure puzzle.

2450
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:32,020
Sure.

2451
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,340
If you've played like Ibb or something,

2452
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,540
it's along those lines.

2453
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,500
You know, Ibb?

2454
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,460
I'm not a fan.

2455
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:37,700
No.

2456
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,340
No.

2457
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,660
We were inspired a lot by Firefly,

2458
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:41,620
or not Firefly.

2459
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,260
Oh, what's the Jonathan Blow game

2460
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,060
that was super famous?

2461
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:45,540
Braid.

2462
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:45,860
Braid.

2463
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:47,780
We were heavily inspired by Braid.

2464
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:48,660
And Rich was really the one

2465
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,620
who like had the idea

2466
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,980
for what the game was going to be.

2467
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,500
I was mostly the puzzle designer.

2468
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:52,740
I didn't,

2469
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,860
I couldn't program for shit.

2470
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:55,300
I'm still not a great programmer,

2471
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,180
even though it's my job

2472
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,060
that I do every day.

2473
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,060
He was the one in charge of doing all the,

2474
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:02,260
what I consider the hard stuff,

2475
01:36:02,260 --> 01:36:03,220
and I designed puzzles.

2476
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:04,900
So I was the idea guy

2477
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,180
where that shit's concerned.

2478
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:06,660
In any case,

2479
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,220
we finished it,

2480
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,020
we didn't win,

2481
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,460
but we loved making it.

2482
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:11,300
And Rich decided to go off to another school

2483
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:11,940
that he finished,

2484
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,820
and he got like a,

2485
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,420
it's the one that hasn't like

2486
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,940
an affiliate with Nintendo

2487
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:16,980
up in Washington state.

2488
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:18,580
Oh my god,

2489
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,100
your friend works for Nintendo?

2490
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,700
He doesn't actually work for Nintendo,

2491
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,860
but I visited him in Seattle a while ago.

2492
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,380
Like many of his friends

2493
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,100
work for Nintendo,

2494
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,780
and like Reggie works in that town

2495
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:28,740
and lives there.

2496
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,220
Like there,

2497
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:29,460
it's,

2498
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:30,980
that's Nintendo Central in America.

2499
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,820
Does he see Reggie out

2500
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,500
like eating bagels at breakfast

2501
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,140
and be like,

2502
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,300
yo Reggie, what up dog?

2503
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:40,340
Is your body ready for breakfast, Reggie?

2504
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:41,780
No,

2505
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,820
but like there was a,

2506
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:43,780
there was a friend of his,

2507
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:44,260
this girl,

2508
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,380
his name was Reggie.

2509
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,500
Is he the one who originated

2510
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,780
my body is ready or did he?

2511
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:48,500
Yeah, that was Reggie.

2512
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:48,980
He was like,

2513
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:49,460
he was like,

2514
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:50,260
get ready to do

2515
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,180
we exercise or like we fit.

2516
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:52,740
He just like,

2517
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:53,220
are you ready?

2518
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:54,100
My body is ready.

2519
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:54,420
That was,

2520
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,460
yeah, that was him.

2521
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:56,340
Wow.

2522
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:56,580
Yeah.

2523
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,540
That's an old school one.

2524
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,380
I didn't know that that's where it came from.

2525
01:36:59,380 --> 01:36:59,620
Yep.

2526
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,260
It's all Reggie.

2527
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:02,180
That's one of my favorite memes.

2528
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:03,060
I say it all the time.

2529
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:03,380
Really?

2530
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:03,940
My body.

2531
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,780
Well, I usually say my body is lady,

2532
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,660
which is a compound.

2533
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:07,140
Right.

2534
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:07,380
Right.

2535
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,580
From Idolmaster.

2536
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,460
You know this one.

2537
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:09,620
Yep.

2538
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,260
I've seen that one.

2539
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,540
It's for the audience.

2540
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:14,660
It's the Idolmaster opening song.

2541
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:15,060
They say,

2542
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:16,820
are you ready?

2543
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:18,260
I'm ready.

2544
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,220
Which is literally,

2545
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:20,340
are you ready?

2546
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,220
I'm lady.

2547
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:22,500
So,

2548
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,140
so to me,

2549
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,180
it's dumb asses.

2550
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,380
My body is lady.

2551
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,980
That's how I say it.

2552
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:27,860
Um,

2553
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,100
okay.

2554
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:28,740
Well, in any case,

2555
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:28,980
so,

2556
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:29,300
so yeah,

2557
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:29,780
as you can see,

2558
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:31,700
I had an Anderson games design a big way.

2559
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,540
I was in like the game design club

2560
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,980
that my friend Andy started.

2561
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,740
Magic Circle is what we called it.

2562
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:38,420
That was cool.

2563
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,220
I had like a little team.

2564
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,380
We actually developed this phone game.

2565
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,420
We did this thing called a,

2566
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:43,620
we did a game jam,

2567
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,460
which is like a 48 hour game development thing.

2568
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:45,860
Crunch.

2569
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:46,500
Yeah.

2570
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,140
Um,

2571
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:47,700
I had this idea for-

2572
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,340
Finding advice,

2573
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,780
it started as a game jam.

2574
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:49,940
Yeah.

2575
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,540
Yes, we learned from Florian.

2576
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:52,420
Shout out to you, Doug.

2577
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,420
There was a,

2578
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:56,500
oh, what was I saying?

2579
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,300
Oh, there was a game jam.

2580
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,100
And I came up with this idea

2581
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,700
for a game called Monochrome,

2582
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:00,180
which is,

2583
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,220
it's like,

2584
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:02,500
what's it like?

2585
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,940
It's a bit like bejeweled.

2586
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:04,260
Okay.

2587
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,540
But the idea is,

2588
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,340
so,

2589
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:09,060
you've got a field full of multicolored gems.

2590
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,140
And if you look at like a color wheel,

2591
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:11,940
you know how there's like,

2592
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:14,340
it goes from like purple leads to red,

2593
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,300
leads to orange,

2594
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,020
leads to yellow,

2595
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,660
leads to green,

2596
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:17,380
to blue,

2597
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:18,100
back to purple

2598
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:19,460
in like a circle like that.

2599
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,380
So the idea behind this game was that

2600
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,220
you would click on something like purple

2601
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:24,660
and if there was either one,

2602
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,500
like next to that color on the color wheel,

2603
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,940
either red or blue,

2604
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:29,220
if you clicked from like purple

2605
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:29,940
to one of those,

2606
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,940
it would like consume that color.

2607
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,700
So like the idea was,

2608
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:34,820
it was a puzzle game

2609
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,020
where you would kind of

2610
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:37,940
eventually spread your color to,

2611
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:38,740
it didn't matter what color,

2612
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:40,340
but you could like end the game

2613
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,020
with all the blocks as one color

2614
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,380
was the basic idea of it.

2615
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,820
And we actually developed

2616
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:47,540
a functional phone app of this game

2617
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,500
that I don't have anymore.

2618
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,300
I think got deleted,

2619
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,220
but it's on my like drive somewhere.

2620
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,500
So I could install it again.

2621
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,300
It's pretty fun.

2622
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,100
We never finished it.

2623
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,860
We wanted to make it like a full release,

2624
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:58,100
but I guess as many game,

2625
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,220
aspiring game devs did,

2626
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,740
it never got out the fucking door.

2627
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:02,340
But in any case,

2628
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:03,380
Cool concept though.

2629
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:04,580
Yeah, I really liked it.

2630
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,380
It was really good.

2631
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,740
And it was actually pretty damn fun.

2632
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,300
Don't steal that audience.

2633
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,740
I'm going to make that's my idea.

2634
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,300
So, okay.

2635
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:14,740
So I was big into game design.

2636
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:15,860
Oh, incidentally,

2637
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:17,460
my theater stuff didn't work out

2638
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,420
from high school

2639
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,180
because my grades weren't good enough.

2640
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,660
And my dad forbid me to do any more theater

2641
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,020
because he was like,

2642
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:25,780
you're spending too much time on theater.

2643
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:26,900
Even though the real problem

2644
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,340
was that it was fucking around

2645
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,940
and like not doing my homework

2646
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,980
and just didn't give a shit.

2647
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:33,540
I was just a very lazy guy.

2648
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:34,500
Just didn't give a shit

2649
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:35,300
about what I was doing.

2650
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,820
I mean, that's school for you, right?

2651
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:37,140
Right.

2652
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,220
Well, that's that that's school for you.

2653
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,660
Taking you away from the thing

2654
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,660
that you're actually passionate about

2655
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,420
because it's because it's supposedly

2656
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,940
distracting you from the bullshit

2657
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,780
that will never matter in your life.

2658
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:47,860
Yeah.

2659
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:48,500
Like, hey,

2660
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,620
which set of skills do you think

2661
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,540
is benefiting you on Patreon right now?

2662
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:54,100
The theater skills or the fucking

2663
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,620
whatever bullshit you had to do

2664
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,260
in high school?

2665
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:56,340
Yeah.

2666
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,140
Yeah.

2667
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:57,220
Yeah.

2668
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:57,940
Fair question.

2669
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,380
I think it was the theater skills.

2670
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:00,020
A little bit.

2671
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:00,660
A little bit.

2672
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:01,780
I'm a bit of a human.

2673
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:02,500
What do you think?

2674
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:05,620
You think you think you've got all those patrons

2675
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:07,140
from fucking knowing how to like

2676
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:10,260
history of English or some shit?

2677
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:10,820
No.

2678
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,140
Yeah.

2679
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,620
You got it because you gave an impassioned speech

2680
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:16,260
about the human bullshit

2681
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,700
while wearing a Picard outfit.

2682
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,780
You're literally in costume in that video.

2683
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,140
Yeah, it was great.

2684
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:23,300
That card costume was a good investment.

2685
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,540
Or it's not it's a it's a standard issue

2686
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:28,100
uniform captain uniform.

2687
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,780
So incidentally, there you go.

2688
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,980
Tight fit on me.

2689
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:31,540
Yeah.

2690
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:34,340
It's a little bit of a tight fit on me to be honest to.

2691
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:36,260
Yeah, but it's good that it's a tight fit on you.

2692
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:36,900
I guess that's true.

2693
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,140
Because it makes your chest look fucking huge.

2694
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:39,620
That's true.

2695
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,260
It does.

2696
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,340
On me, it makes my tits look fucking huge.

2697
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:44,260
My nipples were literally poking through that.

2698
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,660
Disgusting.

2699
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:48,100
Okay.

2700
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,020
So in any case, so theater was out.

2701
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:52,980
And I was just doing like game design stuff.

2702
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,260
I guess my grades were okay.

2703
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:57,140
I was never a great student at any point in my life

2704
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,740
other than when I was like a little kid

2705
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:01,140
and I could just coast by by like being

2706
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,260
kind of smart.

2707
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:04,260
And yeah, that's just how it worked out.

2708
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,820
And never had any drive to do any of that shit.

2709
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,580
But in any case, like another thing that happened

2710
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,500
to me in college that was a big deal

2711
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,580
is that I finally got a girlfriend.

2712
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:15,300
I got a girlfriend and this was a revolution.

2713
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:21,620
It was it was kind of a formative experience in my life.

2714
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:25,140
Changed me actually getting the girlfriend

2715
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,260
didn't change me at all.

2716
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:29,140
I was totally the same guy up to that point.

2717
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:32,500
I was still this like shy vampire,

2718
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:35,940
hundred D loving, you know, cool kid.

2719
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:39,060
I at that point, I never had hair that long again

2720
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:39,620
down to my waist.

2721
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,140
But I had it down to like shoulder length.

2722
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:41,300
Right.

2723
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,260
I've got kind of wavy hair.

2724
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,300
So it was kind of like curled around.

2725
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:44,500
I was like, I don't know.

2726
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,540
And this girl inexplicably was into me

2727
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,540
because I was the biggest fucking pussy.

2728
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,340
Such like I let this girl walk all over me.

2729
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:54,340
Like not to shit on her.

2730
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:55,220
She was fine.

2731
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,580
But I was not a man.

2732
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,620
I did not do the things a man needs to do

2733
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:02,420
as in assert yourself in any way.

2734
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:02,660
Yeah.

2735
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,580
Like I have a tendency to couch out of people

2736
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:06,020
and try to please people.

2737
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:09,220
And like that's nobody wants that in a relationship.

2738
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,500
It's fucking shit.

2739
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,540
So, you know, the relationship was mutually unsatisfying

2740
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,820
and went on for like a year and a half

2741
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,580
until she dumped me rightly so.

2742
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:20,500
She, however, did not sex me.

2743
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,180
And that is a big problem.

2744
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:24,500
He dated for a year and a half and didn't fuck.

2745
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:24,820
Yeah.

2746
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:26,260
Well, she gave me a couple of handys.

2747
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,460
You know, so that was nice.

2748
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,780
But she's willing to give you a hand job.

2749
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,580
Why not?

2750
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:33,220
Because she's because she was a big weirdo Christian.

2751
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:33,780
Oh, okay.

2752
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,260
And that, you know, there were two, two things.

2753
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:37,140
And this is cool.

2754
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,060
There were two things that I stood up to her on.

2755
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:41,140
One, I would constantly laugh at her

2756
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:42,660
when she talked about her Christianity,

2757
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,780
which I fucking love.

2758
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:44,900
That's great.

2759
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:49,380
And the other one was she worked as hard as she.

2760
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:52,020
She worked that little white ass as hard as she could

2761
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:55,860
to make me admit that Aris was the better girl for cloud.

2762
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,780
And I never gave in.

2763
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:01,940
It's Tifa for life, you stupid whore bitch.

2764
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:03,060
Never giving you that.

2765
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,140
You will never get the satisfaction.

2766
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,660
Aris is fucking dead.

2767
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:08,980
Tifa was cloud's destined girl from the start.

2768
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,180
You idiot.

2769
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,940
So on those two fronts, I retained my manhood.

2770
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:16,180
And everything else, I was a big pussy bitch.

2771
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,780
No, I really don't blame her at all.

2772
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:24,580
You really stood for yourself on the issues that matter.

2773
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,540
No, I know.

2774
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,300
So, I mean, the whole girlfriend thing was actually,

2775
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:32,580
it was a big deal for me.

2776
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:36,020
So, you know, this was me desperate.

2777
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:38,500
And I can admit this, I didn't give a fuck about this girl.

2778
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:43,220
I just wanted to have sex desperately.

2779
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:46,580
It was a huge deal in my life and never happened.

2780
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,540
And I was extremely upset when the relationship ended.

2781
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:52,020
And I'm like, I just dated this girl for like a year and a half.

2782
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:54,260
And I know this kind of count sounds like a psycho,

2783
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,340
but it's what I was honestly thinking.

2784
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:58,660
It doesn't if you're a fucking 23-year-old virgin.

2785
01:43:58,660 --> 01:43:59,460
Yeah, yeah.

2786
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:00,660
It's like, how old were you, 20?

2787
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:03,380
I was, no, I was like 20.

2788
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:05,780
I was like dating her from like 19 to 20.

2789
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:07,060
That range, more or less.

2790
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:11,620
And yeah, it was real fucking bad, real fucking bad.

2791
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:17,380
But in any case, so eventually, between junior and senior year,

2792
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:21,300
a grand opportunity arose for me to travel abroad.

2793
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:23,860
Because actually, one of the main reasons I chose to go to the

2794
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:26,020
College of New Jersey is because they had a mother fucking

2795
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,380
Japanese language program.

2796
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:30,900
And that was like number one on my list, needed that shit.

2797
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:33,700
And it was by far the best thing about that school.

2798
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,940
I fucking loved taking Japanese there.

2799
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:39,460
Reading those fucking Genki books, practicing vocab.

2800
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:41,780
God, I miss, I want to do more desperately.

2801
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:44,500
But I got to buy some Genki books immediately.

2802
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,340
We got to talk about that later too.

2803
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:46,580
Yeah.

2804
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,380
Because me and you are planning a possible thing.

2805
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:55,140
And my new girlfriend also wants to learn Japanese.

2806
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:56,180
Dude, don't bring your fucking girlfriend into this shit.

2807
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:56,740
No, no, no, no.

2808
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:58,420
I'm not going to bring her into our thing.

2809
01:44:58,420 --> 01:44:58,900
Okay, okay.

2810
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:02,500
I'm just saying that I'm very quickly becoming surrounded

2811
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:05,380
by people who want to learn Japanese as badly as I do.

2812
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,100
Right, right.

2813
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:07,940
And this is the perfect time.

2814
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,780
Like, I need to learn this language.

2815
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,500
I'm going to kill myself if I don't learn Japanese by the time I'm 30.

2816
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,180
Like, if I'm not fluent by the time I'm 30, I will fucking kill myself.

2817
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:16,740
That's a high bar.

2818
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,900
Go for conversation, like high level conversation.

2819
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:19,540
No, no.

2820
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,580
I got to be fluent by the time I'm 30.

2821
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,500
You don't have that much time to get fluent, dude.

2822
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,060
It takes a long time to get fluent.

2823
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,660
Five years is plenty of time.

2824
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:27,700
Well, we're not, we're not fucking beginners at Japanese.

2825
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,620
We both took three years, you know.

2826
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:30,820
That took four years.

2827
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:31,620
I took three.

2828
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:32,180
I went.

2829
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:35,060
I've been watching anime for 15 years.

2830
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:36,500
I would bet your Japanese is better than mine,

2831
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,220
because I have been completely not a professional.

2832
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,900
That's pretty likely.

2833
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,060
But so in any case, so I was taking Japanese,

2834
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,500
fucking loving it, Ogren sensei, and Yamashina sensei.

2835
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,580
Thank you for being there for me.

2836
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,420
I appreciate what you did.

2837
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:50,420
Because I'm sure they'll listen to this podcast.

2838
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,980
But in any case, I was also a Japanese language teacher.

2839
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:55,620
Oh, but that was after I came back from the thing

2840
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,660
I'm trying to get to.

2841
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:59,700
I traveled to fucking Japan and I spent two months,

2842
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:03,380
a whole summer in Tokyo, living the fucking good life.

2843
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:07,300
And it was by far the best single decision

2844
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,380
I've made in my life, except maybe deciding

2845
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:10,900
to start doing YouTube.

2846
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:13,700
And it was, it was, I mean, it wasn't like

2847
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,380
a fucking magical experience.

2848
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,380
It was just one of those things where like so many

2849
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:19,860
opportunities opened up to me when I like took

2850
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,100
the initiative to get this thing done,

2851
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,580
which is why, you know, people say yes to

2852
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:26,900
opportunities that come before you people.

2853
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,940
So I went there.

2854
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:30,980
I went to Japan and I was at this place called the,

2855
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:34,420
I believe it was the KCP International School,

2856
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:35,060
or something like that.

2857
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,980
You can, you can Google it because they take

2858
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,460
international students and they, you know,

2859
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:40,180
they teach them shit.

2860
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:43,060
They've got a lot of like Koreans and probably

2861
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:43,860
like some Filipinos.

2862
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:46,020
It's like the school is mostly full of Europeans

2863
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,780
and like a bunch of like, you know, a couple Brits

2864
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,620
and some Americans, you know, all bunch of big

2865
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:51,460
weaves, most of the Koreans though.

2866
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:53,380
But in any case, they teach them Japanese

2867
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:55,300
as good as they can.

2868
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:56,260
And they have a bunch of levels.

2869
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:57,620
I was in like the middle level one.

2870
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,620
I was actually in one that was a little bit too

2871
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:03,460
high for my actual language control ability.

2872
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:05,700
So I was a little bit like not able to keep up

2873
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,580
with things that were happening,

2874
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:07,940
which was a little bit shitty.

2875
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:10,340
But it's because I've always had this pride.

2876
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:13,220
When I was in school, like I was the only kid

2877
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:16,660
in the entire school who took every single AP class

2878
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:17,780
that was available.

2879
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,660
And it's because because I would have felt

2880
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:23,300
angry at myself for not taking the most difficult

2881
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:24,500
challenge possible.

2882
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,140
Like I would have felt dumb and our valedictorian,

2883
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,300
she didn't take every fucking AP class.

2884
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,740
Only me and my friend Doug did.

2885
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:32,740
And it's because I think we have this like weird,

2886
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:33,860
maybe his parents pressured him,

2887
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:36,500
but for me it was like, no, I've got this weird,

2888
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:41,780
um, I don't know, self critical ego thing going on.

2889
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:42,980
We're like, I need to challenge myself

2890
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:44,260
like the hardest thing is possible.

2891
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:45,140
I don't feel it anymore.

2892
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:46,500
But so I did that.

2893
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,020
And so, you know, when I was in Japan,

2894
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:50,260
I chose to take like this level that was definitely

2895
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:54,740
a little bit too hard to be 100% useful for me.

2896
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:56,020
Like you need to be at a level

2897
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:57,060
where you can actually keep up.

2898
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,900
My biggest problem in Japanese class

2899
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,380
is that I got a D all three years.

2900
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:05,300
Each year I had no idea what was going on.

2901
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,660
I never knew what was happening.

2902
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:07,380
Oh, that sucks.

2903
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,780
I spent my whole time in three years of Japanese,

2904
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:12,020
like a deer in the headlights.

2905
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:13,220
They shouldn't have asked me.

2906
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,140
I was constantly trying to play catch up.

2907
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:16,180
Like, yeah, things would blow by me

2908
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:17,140
and I would have to catch up.

2909
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,500
That was, that was tough.

2910
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,140
Like, I mean, when we, in my third year,

2911
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:24,180
we had this Russian guy of Shinnokov Sensei,

2912
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:28,100
who like he had been, he'd studied in Russia,

2913
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,420
then he'd taught, like, I think he'd taught

2914
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,180
either English or Russian in Japan.

2915
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:32,820
Yeah.

2916
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:34,820
Then had taught in America a little bit,

2917
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:37,380
like at a nicer school, then came to my school,

2918
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,540
which is dog shit, you know.

2919
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:41,460
And, like, he gets there and, like,

2920
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,780
all of us are so far below the level

2921
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,540
we're supposed to be at for that.

2922
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,700
And, like, in so varying, like,

2923
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,860
the top students in class knew everything,

2924
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,860
and the bottom students in class, like me,

2925
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:52,980
knew jack shit.

2926
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:54,340
And so he, like, the whole time,

2927
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:56,260
he was just, like, exploding with stress.

2928
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,220
I feel something, guy, that's tough.

2929
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:00,100
This dude was, like, man, he couldn't deal.

2930
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:02,740
Like, it was, like, three layers of culture shock.

2931
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:03,860
Yeah, yeah.

2932
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:05,220
Like, he'd been used to teaching

2933
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,340
at Japanese schools where kids, like,

2934
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:08,020
super diligent when he comes here.

2935
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:09,620
What the fuck is with American schools?

2936
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:10,660
We are a bunch of fuck ups.

2937
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:11,780
Why do we even have them?

2938
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,740
I don't know, because it's possible

2939
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,420
just to make us feel good about ourselves,

2940
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:17,780
you know, like, pretend like

2941
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,140
we're doing something useful.

2942
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:22,020
There is a certain service being served, but, uh...

2943
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,460
Go listen to PCP schools.

2944
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:23,860
Yeah, go listen to that one.

2945
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,420
Yeah, go listen to that one.

2946
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,180
PCP fuck school, I think it's the time of it.

2947
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,380
Fuck school, yeah, something like that.

2948
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:30,820
Okay, so I went to Japan, right,

2949
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,100
and it was fantastic.

2950
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,860
The best thing about going there, though,

2951
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:36,180
was not that I kind of learned

2952
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:37,780
how to, like, be independent a little bit.

2953
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,540
Like, college is kind of cushiony,

2954
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:40,740
but, like, I lived just in, like,

2955
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,380
an apartment by myself in Tokyo for two months

2956
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,660
and had to, like, figure shit out,

2957
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:46,260
like, how to survive.

2958
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,620
But more importantly than that,

2959
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,140
I hooked up with this dude Garf,

2960
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:51,220
and I think I've told this story a couple times before,

2961
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,740
but, like, me and this buddy Garf,

2962
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,420
he had yellow fever.

2963
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:55,300
It was ridiculous.

2964
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,380
He wanted to get laid like a motherfucker.

2965
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:58,100
That we both got...

2966
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:00,660
She described it to us as the worst yellow fever

2967
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:01,140
you've ever seen.

2968
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,980
The worst case of yellow fever I've ever encountered,

2969
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:03,540
without a doubt.

2970
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:05,300
Like, he was into deep-level, like,

2971
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,420
geisha shit.

2972
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,540
Like, that's what he wanted.

2973
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,140
That's his, like, ideal woman,

2974
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:09,860
from his own mouth.

2975
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:14,420
Deep-level geisha shit.

2976
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:14,980
Yeah, man.

2977
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:16,420
So he would...

2978
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:19,700
So we would bomb down to Roppongi at, like,

2979
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:20,980
late night.

2980
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,980
Like, even on weeknights,

2981
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,340
we would just go to Roppongi,

2982
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:26,420
get absolutely sloshed.

2983
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,700
By the way, people don't know this,

2984
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,900
the best thing about Japan

2985
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,420
is that you can drink alcohol

2986
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:32,180
outside anywhere you want at any time.

2987
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:32,820
It's wonderful.

2988
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:33,380
Beautiful.

2989
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:35,860
Um, it's really not to be underestimated

2990
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:37,060
how great and liberating that is.

2991
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,980
That's all I'm gonna do when I go to Japan.

2992
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:39,860
It's fantastic.

2993
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:41,220
It's fantastic.

2994
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:42,100
It's probably because they, like,

2995
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,780
trust their citizens to not fuck up

2996
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,820
and, like, be reasonable.

2997
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,700
But it's funny because it draws a lot of tourists

2998
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,860
and, like, foreigners who are not reasonable.

2999
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,620
And, like, me and him would just be, like,

3000
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:53,140
puking in the streets sometimes

3001
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:56,820
and just be being irresponsible in the club and, like...

3002
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,020
How old are you at this time?

3003
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:58,580
Well, let's see.

3004
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:00,580
When I was in Japan, I turned 21.

3005
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:02,420
So it was, like, right at that time.

3006
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:03,780
And by the way, the drinking age in Japan,

3007
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:04,180
I believe is 18.

3008
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,060
It's 20.

3009
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:05,620
It's 20.

3010
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,580
Okay, yeah, 20, yeah.

3011
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,540
So I was able to drink.

3012
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:09,540
I turned 21 when I was in Japan.

3013
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:10,820
So a little bit anticlimactic,

3014
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,500
but, you know, it was still a great time.

3015
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,700
I met some interesting characters,

3016
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,820
like this guy named Nash,

3017
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:17,460
who was, like, a competitive MMA fighter

3018
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:20,260
who was, like, training at various dojos across Asia

3019
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:22,020
and was, like, friends with some of the students

3020
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:22,740
at the school I was going to,

3021
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:24,180
or some of the teachers who would, like,

3022
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:25,860
help him buy plane tickets places.

3023
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:27,780
Can I have a slice of your apple pie?

3024
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:28,740
Sure, yeah, go for it.

3025
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:29,540
Thank you.

3026
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:30,820
Um, let's see what else is going on.

3027
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:34,420
So really, like, the main idea that I want to talk about here

3028
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:37,540
is, like, my life changed dramatically

3029
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:39,700
because I developed a fixation

3030
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,980
with actually going out,

3031
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,500
like, no longer being a pussy.

3032
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,700
Like, this was the time in my life

3033
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:46,340
I got really into, like, pickup artist shit.

3034
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,140
And I started obsessively consuming

3035
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,940
everything I could find,

3036
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:51,940
specifically while I was in Japan.

3037
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,940
I downloaded tons of, like, videos

3038
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:56,340
and, uh, and all that kind of shit.

3039
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:58,340
And, like, a lot of the philosophy

3040
01:51:58,340 --> 01:51:59,460
has stuck with me to this day,

3041
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,100
though the, like, the, I don't know,

3042
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,700
like, the specifics have kind of faded.

3043
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,860
But I always want to defend it

3044
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:06,580
when I talk about it,

3045
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:08,180
that pickup artist shit is, like,

3046
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,860
it's about self-improvement

3047
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:11,060
more than anything else.

3048
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,660
So, like, what I have gotten from, like,

3049
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:14,100
these guys, like, Tyler Durden.

3050
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,260
That's, like, that's the guy, Tyler Sensei.

3051
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:19,700
He is, um, I mean, I call him Tyler Sensei,

3052
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:21,700
but, like, it's not like he's known by that.

3053
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:22,660
It's just, like, I met,

3054
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,820
I found out about this guy when I was in Japan.

3055
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:26,420
So I started calling him Tyler Sensei,

3056
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:28,260
even though he just goes by Tyler in America.

3057
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:30,260
But in any case, um,

3058
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:34,020
like, these guys are all about, like,

3059
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:35,540
you become a better man

3060
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:37,300
so that you can attract better women.

3061
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,300
And, like, it's not like you're tricking anyone.

3062
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,660
It's, like, you are a better person.

3063
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:43,860
And the women that are into you,

3064
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:45,700
because of that, are just being given,

3065
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:47,060
like, more of a product.

3066
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:48,660
I think what people are averse to

3067
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,820
is, like, people are really into, like, destiny.

3068
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:52,980
And, like, they feel like I'm born this way.

3069
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,620
Fucking with that order is wrong.

3070
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:57,460
It's not good to improve your station.

3071
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,100
It is.

3072
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:59,300
Yeah, it's, it's disgusting.

3073
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,540
No, we are clay dolls

3074
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:05,700
that we mold through our own power

3075
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:07,460
to a certain degree, you know?

3076
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,740
We have a certain level of influence

3077
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,020
over our own bodies,

3078
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,220
if free will exists,

3079
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:12,660
which I don't actually believe,

3080
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:13,860
but we'll put that aside for now.

3081
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,940
But the point is, like, this is when I,

3082
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,940
like, I, all, what this boils down to is,

3083
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,540
like, I now decided, you know what,

3084
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,140
I should actually do something

3085
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:24,820
because I want women in my life,

3086
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:27,060
and I should actually, like, work on that.

3087
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:28,820
Like, so nobody, I think,

3088
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:30,580
in the right mind would ever find a problem with that.

3089
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:32,100
So that's what we did.

3090
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,300
We went down to Roppongi,

3091
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:35,140
and our choice was to get super drunk.

3092
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:36,180
That's with our solution.

3093
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:38,340
And we would go into clubs.

3094
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:40,500
We would, we would, we would grind up on,

3095
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,780
on hot Japanese women

3096
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,700
who were looking for sexy American men.

3097
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:47,140
And we just, we kind of grew up, you know?

3098
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:49,540
We became grown up guys a little bit more.

3099
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:52,420
Neither, I did not get laid

3100
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:53,780
through during my time in Japan,

3101
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:55,300
which was a big bummer for me.

3102
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:56,420
But Garoff did, though.

3103
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,780
Garoff, and as I was saying,

3104
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,540
like, he, he's really into Japanese chicks.

3105
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:03,540
Devastatingly, he banged a Vietnamese chick.

3106
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:06,580
And, yeah, he's, he regrets it intensely to this day

3107
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:07,700
that he, he, when he was in Japan.

3108
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:08,980
Still, still yellow.

3109
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,660
Still yellow, you know, on the spectrum,

3110
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,340
getting, getting closer to what he wants.

3111
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:13,220
I'm sure by now.

3112
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,260
The color spectrum is what I'm talking about.

3113
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:20,180
I'm sure by now he's banged

3114
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:22,900
quite a few Japanese ladies.

3115
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,100
If his yellow fever persists,

3116
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:24,740
because who knows.

3117
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,780
He was actually Indian,

3118
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:27,940
so I don't know if that is relevant,

3119
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:29,460
but like, he had yellow fever

3120
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,660
despite being Indian.

3121
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:31,140
But whatever.

3122
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:33,380
So, but the funny thing was,

3123
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:35,860
so after I came back from this wonderful time,

3124
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:38,020
oh, by the way, I met Moot when I was in Japan.

3125
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:38,660
Oh, yeah.

3126
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,660
When I was on, I was on 4chan,

3127
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:42,340
just one day, and I saw it,

3128
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:43,460
like, and a bunch of the guys who were there,

3129
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,380
you know, a lot of the white guys who were there,

3130
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,540
were a bunch of, like, big weebs like me.

3131
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,260
And, like, I saw a post one day

3132
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:51,860
that was just, it was the banner on 4chan.

3133
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,220
It's like, hey, I'm Moot.

3134
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:55,220
It was, like, a sticky on every board.

3135
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,700
I'm gonna be in Akihabara at this time.

3136
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,700
Be there if you want to hang out.

3137
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:02,180
And I was like, I'm gonna be there.

3138
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:03,300
So me and a couple of the guys,

3139
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,180
we went down there,

3140
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:06,740
and we hung out with Moot for a while.

3141
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:07,860
And we went to eat.

3142
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:08,900
We met his crew.

3143
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,820
What did he seem like?

3144
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:14,660
He was, like, a skinny, I don't know.

3145
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:18,500
I mean, I imagine he's just a, like, nerdy programmer guy.

3146
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,780
That's really the impression,

3147
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:20,820
for the most part, that I got.

3148
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,860
He didn't have any kind of, like,

3149
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:23,140
bombastic personality or anything.

3150
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,860
He was pretty chill.

3151
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:24,340
Yeah.

3152
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:25,620
And we talked.

3153
01:55:25,620 --> 01:55:27,860
And if you look around online,

3154
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,220
there's some, I don't know if you got,

3155
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:30,100
if you search around,

3156
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:31,140
there are some famous pictures.

3157
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:33,300
If you search, like, Moot in Akihabara,

3158
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,740
there are pictures of me with him.

3159
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:36,660
And there's one of, like, all his crew,

3160
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,340
like, want us to take a big, like, group photo.

3161
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:39,860
So we all lined up in a row.

3162
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:42,500
And he took a big picture of all of us.

3163
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,540
And what was funny to me is that,

3164
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:45,380
even years later, I see that photo

3165
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:47,620
reposted on, like, 4chan now and then.

3166
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:48,820
And I'm right there wearing, like,

3167
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:50,980
a Soga King from One Piece shirt

3168
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:53,620
that I bought at Uniqlo when I was there.

3169
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:55,540
And it's, people label, like,

3170
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:56,740
every person in that group as, like,

3171
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:58,100
a different board.

3172
01:55:58,100 --> 01:55:59,860
Like, Moot was B, you know, like,

3173
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:01,620
there was a girl, like, a pregnant girl,

3174
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,700
like, with a baby who was, like, CGL.

3175
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,420
Just, like, a bunch of other, I am.

3176
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:07,460
Which one's CGL?

3177
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:08,500
CGL is the cosplay.

3178
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:09,940
Like, the slut one.

3179
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:10,740
The slut girl one.

3180
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:11,220
Right.

3181
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:11,620
Of course.

3182
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:12,420
So it fits.

3183
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:14,900
And I was consistently labeled as co,

3184
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:15,940
as the comics board.

3185
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:17,860
Even though you're wearing a One Piece shirt.

3186
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:18,740
Even though I was wearing, yeah,

3187
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:20,500
inexplicably, I think it's because I had

3188
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,900
a shit-eating grin and looked confident.

3189
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:24,900
And I was already getting fit at this point.

3190
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,740
So my muscle definition was improving.

3191
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:28,820
Which isn't an A thing.

3192
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:29,860
Why would that be a co thing?

3193
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:31,220
Because it's not an A thing.

3194
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:33,140
I think A is more fit than co.

3195
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:33,860
That's bullshit.

3196
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:34,740
And you know it, dude.

3197
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:35,860
Comics and cartoons.

3198
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:36,980
Co has some normies.

3199
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:39,060
Co has a decent normie population.

3200
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,300
So those people even out the fitness curve.

3201
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,140
The A's are a bunch of fucking fat weirdos.

3202
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,020
Why weren't you just fit?

3203
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:45,860
Was somebody else fit?

3204
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:47,860
I don't know if there was a fit on this whole thing.

3205
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:49,300
There might just not have been a fit.

3206
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,180
Okay, but the point I'm trying to get to,

3207
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:54,020
I just thought that's a cool thing that happened to me

3208
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:54,580
while I was there.

3209
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:55,940
When I got back,

3210
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:58,740
like a month after I got back to school,

3211
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,180
I immediately got laid.

3212
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,260
And it was just like, I did the grind,

3213
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:04,340
I put in the work, did my training,

3214
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:06,020
and all of it paid off when like,

3215
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,620
I completely changed as a person when I got back.

3216
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:12,180
I was way more like outgoing,

3217
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:13,700
willing to just do crazy shit,

3218
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:15,460
you know, kind of,

3219
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:17,540
like the guy I am now on the PCP

3220
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:19,540
is like post-Japan Nate.

3221
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:20,820
The guy from before Japan

3222
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:22,500
was a completely different guy.

3223
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,580
Big pussy, sucked a lot of dick,

3224
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:28,260
mostly his own, not a fun guy.

3225
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:30,100
I imagine, I mean, I think,

3226
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:32,100
I think pretty much all of us on the PCP

3227
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,860
have some kind of turning point like that.

3228
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:34,340
Yeah.

3229
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:35,540
Like, I don't know.

3230
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:37,300
Like for you it was when you realized you were gay.

3231
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,260
That was a big day for you.

3232
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:38,500
Yeah.

3233
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:39,060
Yeah, right.

3234
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:41,540
I think all of us, well, I don't know.

3235
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:43,540
I don't know if I can speak for the younger guys,

3236
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:45,940
if they've quite had like a definitive,

3237
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,780
like I don't know how different Hippo is

3238
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:49,460
from how he used to be, you know.

3239
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,580
Yeah, yeah.

3240
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:52,500
I'd have to ask him, but like for me,

3241
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:57,060
it would be pre and post BronyCon 2013.

3242
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:58,100
Was that the first one you went to?

3243
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:58,500
Yeah.

3244
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,780
Yeah, so with Tom, yeah.

3245
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:01,860
Because like, if I, I mean,

3246
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,660
like, there's lots of moments in my life

3247
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,740
that like things change, like me going to the Philippines

3248
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:08,740
would almost be comparable to you going to Japan,

3249
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:10,020
except that it didn't change much

3250
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:11,700
about my life back in America.

3251
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:12,340
Right.

3252
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:16,180
It was really going to BronyCon and like becoming,

3253
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:19,140
having a moment of like thinking of myself as famous,

3254
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:22,260
or something like, or like being a personality in public

3255
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:24,260
and like having to respond to all these people,

3256
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:27,860
like completely changed the way I think about interacting

3257
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:29,540
with random strangers.

3258
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,420
Sure, sure.

3259
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:33,220
Like it's just, you have this moment

3260
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:35,540
where all these people know who you are,

3261
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:38,020
who you don't know, and like all you,

3262
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:40,580
like all they expect of you is to be cool.

3263
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,100
And so like, I'm there and I'm like,

3264
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,100
I have to be cool for these people, you know,

3265
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:48,420
like I can't be some boring nerd for all these people

3266
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:49,220
who are coming up to me.

3267
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:51,380
I have to be like this larger than life figure

3268
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:52,420
who they're expecting.

3269
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:56,100
And so that's like what I became in my real life.

3270
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:59,860
It's like, I just kind of transformed into like a,

3271
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:03,540
you know, a guy who thinks of himself as someone with fans.

3272
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:05,540
You know, I remember you talking about,

3273
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,380
there was a phase in your life that I remember,

3274
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:09,380
I think I was just a fan of yours at the time.

3275
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:10,980
And it was when you were doing like a big purge

3276
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,260
of all your contacts and you're like,

3277
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,020
I know too many people right now.

3278
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:14,420
Yeah.

3279
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:15,540
That seems relevant.

3280
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:18,020
That was not too long after that BronyCon.

3281
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:22,100
Just, I had, that's just because I literally accepted

3282
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:24,500
everybody who sent me a fucking Skype request.

3283
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:27,220
And that's a huge mistake and nobody should ever do that.

3284
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:27,700
Yeah.

3285
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:29,620
I still get messages on Discord just from people,

3286
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,580
usually from the fan chat,

3287
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,100
because like I'm in there and it's easy too.

3288
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:33,860
I got no problem with that,

3289
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:35,460
but I just ignore them for the most part.

3290
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:35,780
Right.

3291
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:38,020
And let me see, was there anything else?

3292
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:41,460
I had like 400 Skype contacts at the time.

3293
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:43,060
That's why I had to get rid of phone.

3294
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:46,580
I'm merely going to talk about this because it is important

3295
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:47,700
context into who I am.

3296
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:51,140
And this is like the podcast about the kind of person I am.

3297
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:56,420
So like this getting laid thing was like it, I don't know.

3298
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:58,340
I feel like there's a tendency to like diminish.

3299
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:00,740
It totally matters.

3300
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,140
It's a really important thing.

3301
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:04,260
It totally does matter because it's just that you can't,

3302
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:07,940
like even if it's not good, even if like you,

3303
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:09,940
even if what you take away from it is,

3304
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:13,060
oh, I don't even care about sex, you have to know.

3305
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:14,900
You have become like you have changed

3306
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:17,140
and you will now have something socially

3307
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:19,700
that gives you like an aura of confidence.

3308
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:21,380
Like you're now part of the club, you know,

3309
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,220
you're no longer an excluded, you know, loser.

3310
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,260
And I mean, even if you only,

3311
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:26,420
not that anyone who hasn't had sex as a loser, you know, it's fine.

3312
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:26,500
Right.

3313
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:29,140
I mean, like, I mean, I had said, I had, you know,

3314
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:31,780
my ex-girlfriend and I had sex with her plenty of times.

3315
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:34,580
I understand what it is and it was pretty good.

3316
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:37,780
I think I'm good at it and it's fun.

3317
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:40,260
But like after that, I spent the last three years

3318
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,980
not getting laid until like last week.

3319
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:46,340
And like it didn't get any easier to make it happen again.

3320
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:51,700
But it's just like knowing that I could, that I have and can, you know.

3321
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:52,820
It's a world of difference.

3322
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:57,700
Post-Virginity lost to, pre-Virginia lost to post, it is different.

3323
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:01,860
It's a difference between thinking, will I ever have sex?

3324
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:02,500
Exactly.

3325
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,540
I know I can.

3326
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,660
I've done it before.

3327
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:05,940
I just have to put in more effort.

3328
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:08,580
Like the last three years, I felt like I could,

3329
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:10,260
I could have sex anytime I want.

3330
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:12,420
I just got to put in effort and I'm not willing.

3331
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:15,540
Many of my friends are still virgins to this day.

3332
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:18,420
And they're 26, 27, just like me.

3333
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:20,900
And I don't know, man.

3334
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:21,540
It could have been me.

3335
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:24,020
Could have easily, if I didn't go to Japan, it would be me.

3336
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:24,740
It would be me.

3337
02:01:24,740 --> 02:01:24,980
Yeah.

3338
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:25,540
It was, um.

3339
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:27,460
And I don't think I would have.

3340
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:28,420
These guys are my brothers.

3341
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:29,860
I love them to death, you know.

3342
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,260
I don't know.

3343
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:31,540
I guess I just wish they would.

3344
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:34,900
Incidentally, because you're saying one month after,

3345
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,060
after that's when you got laid.

3346
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:37,300
Yeah.

3347
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:40,260
It's exact same for me with BronyCon 2013.

3348
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:40,660
Oh really?

3349
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:43,140
Because that girl, the girl who was my first girlfriend.

3350
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:43,300
Yeah.

3351
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:47,620
Like literally like BronyCon had been like one week before

3352
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:51,060
and I'd just gotten back and it was like my birthday area.

3353
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:51,460
Like the day after my birthday.

3354
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:53,220
Right, you were complaining about it on the cast.

3355
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:53,700
Yeah.

3356
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:56,020
And I was just talking about it on the on the pub crawl

3357
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:58,660
and this girl starts messaging me in the in the chat

3358
02:01:58,660 --> 02:02:01,140
and that's how we hooked up and like a month later.

3359
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:01,780
Yeah.

3360
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:05,220
It's, there's definitely something to this effect of like

3361
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:09,060
just doing something that's so like something that it's not

3362
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:10,420
that it's out of character.

3363
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:12,260
It's out of character for who you are,

3364
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:14,500
but it's in character for who you think you should be.

3365
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,420
Well, you know, you know, like back in the day,

3366
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:19,380
I also heard describe it's like the whole thing about like

3367
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:21,780
the self-improvement stuff that I got from a lot of the,

3368
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:23,700
like the, they're like more like life coaches,

3369
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:24,980
these kind of this pick up stuff.

3370
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:28,180
But it was like, it's you at 100.

3371
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:29,860
Like, like you're not, it's not like,

3372
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:31,700
you can't even be someone else if you try.

3373
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:32,740
You're always going to be yourself.

3374
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:34,340
You know, you can act fake or whatever.

3375
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:36,340
But like, if you're just going out there and you're just,

3376
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:41,220
I really resent this notion that people like trying to change

3377
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:42,820
themselves are being fake.

3378
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:45,060
I reject that whole heartedly.

3379
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:45,860
I do as well.

3380
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:48,660
That just, that stagnates people so hard.

3381
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:49,460
And I hate it.

3382
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:51,620
And it happens to a lot of like nerdy guys,

3383
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:53,140
like they fall for that trap hard.

3384
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:54,580
I did, I certainly did.

3385
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:57,220
But don't be a fucking idiot.

3386
02:02:57,220 --> 02:02:58,660
Make yourself better.

3387
02:02:58,660 --> 02:02:59,220
Exactly.

3388
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:01,860
Not just to get laid, but like for every reason.

3389
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:04,660
Consider your entire life an engineering problem.

3390
02:03:04,660 --> 02:03:07,300
And if there are deficits that you need to improve, work on it.

3391
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:09,860
If there's literally anything you're not happy with,

3392
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:12,500
then what the fuck are you doing?

3393
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,020
You know, like, fix that.

3394
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:14,340
That's right.

3395
02:03:14,340 --> 02:03:14,820
Like, yeah.

3396
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,620
That's how it should be.

3397
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:17,300
If something's broke, you fix it.

3398
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:20,580
That's like, you know, are you going to be the guy who,

3399
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:22,580
I don't know.

3400
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,860
You watching any Casey Neistat at all?

3401
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:26,900
Yeah, I've seen a lot.

3402
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:27,140
Yeah.

3403
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:29,540
Like what's great about Casey is he's got this,

3404
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:32,900
this sort of workshop that he works in.

3405
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:33,700
Workshop is great.

3406
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:37,220
If anything is not exactly what he wants, he fixes it.

3407
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:39,860
He'll get a tool and just make it.

3408
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,500
He always says like, there's two kinds of people in this world,

3409
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:44,740
people who can build something and people who can't,

3410
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:46,260
you know, or people who can use their hands or whatever.

3411
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,820
Like, you know, if something,

3412
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:50,100
if he needs something to be a certain way,

3413
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:54,260
he immediately, immediately makes it that way.

3414
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:57,300
And that's how everyone needs to get into that fucking mindset.

3415
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:59,540
If something's broken, look around you right now,

3416
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:01,460
look around your room, the audience.

3417
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:04,020
If something is broken and you've been meaning to fix it,

3418
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:06,020
fix the fucking thing.

3419
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:06,740
You know what's funny about that?

3420
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:07,620
Fix it now.

3421
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:08,500
That's entirely true.

3422
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:09,940
That is the best way to live.

3423
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:10,100
Yeah.

3424
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:13,700
The funny thing is I cannot necessarily adhere to that

3425
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,660
as often as I'd like to.

3426
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,980
Like this thing about like getting a new bed,

3427
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,980
that's been like an issue for like a year.

3428
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:19,860
I've wanted a new bed.

3429
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:21,780
It's only because there was something that happened

3430
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:23,140
that was like a motivating factor.

3431
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:25,780
Like, you know, I could use a second bed for like a guest.

3432
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:26,100
Right.

3433
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,620
That's what really got me to do it.

3434
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:29,700
But like then there's other things like nobody,

3435
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:32,020
nobody asked me to make me a mafia.

3436
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:35,380
Nobody was like, hey, why don't you, you know, whatever.

3437
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:39,620
You recognize a systematic problem with your content.

3438
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:41,540
I decided that it needed a solution.

3439
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:42,580
That's exactly right.

3440
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:43,220
That's exactly right.

3441
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:46,500
And I mean, it's not always easy to identify what's broken.

3442
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:46,820
Right.

3443
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:50,500
But there is kind of like, for me, a lot of the time,

3444
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:54,820
if I'm not sure why I'm not happy, I'll just go and make a bunch

3445
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:57,700
of different shit until I figure out what am I missing.

3446
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:59,620
You know, like, I mean, this trip I'm

3447
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:01,620
on right now, that's kind of what inspired like,

3448
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:03,140
I didn't know what the results of this would be.

3449
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:05,940
I'm just like, hey, I'm going to leave the house

3450
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:10,100
because I've tried everything here and none of that's working.

3451
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:12,260
So the solution must be out there.

3452
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:15,380
So let's just go out there and drive around aimlessly

3453
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:16,740
until something changes.

3454
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:19,940
And something did change almost immediately

3455
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:21,140
upon leaving my house.

3456
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:23,460
Like it's obvious that this is what should have happened.

3457
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,540
It's like, yeah, you should have left like months ago.

3458
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:29,460
And that's why I so value and think it's a great idea

3459
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:31,620
to shake up your life in a big way.

3460
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:32,340
Absolutely.

3461
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:35,140
At the very least, like things like traveling,

3462
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:37,700
long distances, people, it's so easy to be like, I don't know,

3463
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:39,620
like if you dreamt of like going to Paris or whatever,

3464
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:41,780
it's like, yeah, I mean, what am I really going to,

3465
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:44,420
oh, the fucking Eiffel Tower, I've fucking seen that

3466
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:45,540
in a million pictures.

3467
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:48,900
Actually putting in the shit to go to Paris is just,

3468
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:52,020
it's going to be worth it, probably.

3469
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:52,500
Probably.

3470
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,660
I mean, it's just worth the experience of figuring out

3471
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:55,940
how the fuck to get to Paris.

3472
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:59,140
And I mean, to me, like a lot of people hate travel.

3473
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:02,340
I love travel just because like, even when it sucks,

3474
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:04,820
it's interesting because it's just something new.

3475
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:05,540
Absolutely.

3476
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:06,420
Like I'm the type of guy.

3477
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:08,900
You're collecting stories and life experience at a minimum

3478
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,500
that you won't get if you're sitting in your ass in the room.

3479
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:12,180
I'm the type of guy who will sit around

3480
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:14,020
like and just walk around the airport.

3481
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,180
Like let's say I have a two hour layover.

3482
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:16,420
Yeah.

3483
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:20,260
You can compare different airports.

3484
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:21,700
It's interesting shit.

3485
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:24,820
I live in Norfolk, tiny airport, nothing there.

3486
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:25,220
Right.

3487
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:28,820
Then you go to New York and you're in this giant fucking LaGuardia.

3488
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:31,780
These huge food courts and all this crazy shit.

3489
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:35,300
Hey, everything costs twice as much in New York

3490
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,300
because the taxes are so much higher.

3491
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:40,820
And like just learning shit, you know, like you can't,

3492
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:43,940
you literally can't go somewhere and not learn anything.

3493
02:06:43,940 --> 02:06:46,820
Like you will learn something because that place

3494
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,660
is not the place you were already in.

3495
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,820
And you will inherently pick up on something,

3496
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,660
even if you don't immediately recognize it.

3497
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:54,500
Even if it's just like a talking point,

3498
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:57,380
you can walk up to some girl at the bar and be like,

3499
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,620
hey, yeah, what's going on?

3500
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:00,900
I went to Boston yesterday.

3501
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:01,220
Oh, yeah.

3502
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:01,700
What was that?

3503
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:03,860
Like, oh, cigarettes are like $12 there.

3504
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:04,820
It's fucked up, you know.

3505
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:07,060
Icebreaker, you have something.

3506
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:08,420
You have something to talk about.

3507
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:10,340
Something's different about you, you know.

3508
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:13,060
You know, there is that's entirely true,

3509
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:15,700
but there is nothing harder on this earth

3510
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:18,740
than doing a cold approach to a girl.

3511
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:20,660
And I've done it many times.

3512
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:22,900
And every single time I felt like I was dying.

3513
02:07:23,540 --> 02:07:26,020
Yeah, see, I have, I went through the fire.

3514
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:29,300
I faced my fear and I haven't conquered it.

3515
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:30,340
It's still there.

3516
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:31,940
I still feel social anxiety.

3517
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:35,540
All the, like, if I want to talk to a girl, it's hard, man.

3518
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:36,500
It's hard shit.

3519
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,700
Every guy knows it is.

3520
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,580
It's a skill that you have to work at,

3521
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:42,900
if that's the kind of guy you want to be, you know.

3522
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,420
I mean, you could take the route of becoming a YouTuber

3523
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:49,380
and getting 100,000 subscribers and waiting for a girl

3524
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:50,980
to say like, hey, you're cute.

3525
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,860
Let's go have sex.

3526
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:55,540
Literally the route that each of us is taking all the time.

3527
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:57,060
It is very inefficient.

3528
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,660
If you can avoid it, there are faster ways.

3529
02:07:58,660 --> 02:07:59,940
It is hyper inefficient.

3530
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:00,340
Yeah.

3531
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:01,940
If you can build a career out of it too, hey, great.

3532
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:02,900
Two birds with one stone.

3533
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:04,580
Wouldn't recommend it though.

3534
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:08,580
Go, guys, go improve yourselves and go harass women in the street.

3535
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:09,380
That's what I'm trying to say.

3536
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:15,220
I don't even know how, like, pick up culture.

3537
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:16,340
It's not called that anymore.

3538
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:19,780
Honestly, like, with the whole picking up girls

3539
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:24,980
through YouTube thing, I think it would only even work

3540
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:27,940
for people like us who were destined to be YouTubers anyways.

3541
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:33,540
The reason it works for us is that, like...

3542
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,980
We're so personality driven.

3543
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:38,180
Yeah, like the kind of stuff that we would use to pick up a girl.

3544
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:40,740
It's the same stuff we'd talk about in a YouTube video.

3545
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:41,140
That's true.

3546
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:47,700
I have literally seduced women by talking about One Piece endlessly.

3547
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:51,220
They get entranced by the passion I show

3548
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,020
when I talk about how much I fucking love One Piece.

3549
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:55,060
It literally happened.

3550
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,740
I have literally gotten laid off of that shit.

3551
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:58,660
The kinds of women who would be into us

3552
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:01,780
are the kinds of women who are into just guys being passionate about something.

3553
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,420
That's right.

3554
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:07,300
I mean, passion is just an endless wellspring of something I have.

3555
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:07,860
Right.

3556
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:10,020
Well, because it creates an association

3557
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:12,340
that if he can get that passionate,

3558
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:14,420
maybe he can get that passionate about me.

3559
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:15,860
Maybe he can get my nut.

3560
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:16,100
Yeah.

3561
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:20,980
Oh, god, you reminded me.

3562
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:22,100
I have to try that now.

3563
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:22,900
Oh, shit.

3564
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:25,300
I totally forgot.

3565
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:26,100
You.

3566
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:26,900
I'm glad I reminded you.

3567
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:27,940
Oh, boy.

3568
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:28,420
Thank god.

3569
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:31,860
Um, I got a hot date in like two weeks.

3570
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:32,980
Great.

3571
02:09:32,980 --> 02:09:33,860
I'm gonna get in there.

3572
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:34,900
Get that.

3573
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:35,460
Pew!

3574
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:38,420
Tragically after National Sex Day.

3575
02:09:38,420 --> 02:09:40,420
Next June 9th, everybody.

3576
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:42,020
Get out there and get yourself a date.

3577
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:42,580
Oh, god.

3578
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:44,420
It's also National Marriage Day.

3579
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:48,260
If you see any tweets about me being like heartbroken,

3580
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:50,180
talking about how my girlfriend broke up with me,

3581
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:57,940
just know it was because I can't avoid it.

3582
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:58,900
Yes, it's gotta be done.

3583
02:09:58,900 --> 02:09:58,980
I have a date with destiny.

3584
02:09:58,980 --> 02:09:59,860
It's gotta be done.

3585
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:01,540
I'm so glad you reminded me.

3586
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:04,100
So I was, I was gonna say,

3587
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:06,340
so after I got laid the first time,

3588
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:08,020
which was a big deal for me,

3589
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:10,740
I then spent the rest of senior year

3590
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:15,060
pursuing like casual sexual relationship.

3591
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:18,660
Like my, I didn't really dwell on this that much,

3592
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:22,740
but my heart was absolutely broken and has not recovered.

3593
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,340
I do not trust relate,

3594
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:25,460
I don't trust anyone.

3595
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:28,500
I do not trust anyone to do anything for me.

3596
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,860
I only trust myself.

3597
02:10:29,860 --> 02:10:32,180
I will never have any confidence in anyone ever again.

3598
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:36,420
I expect them to betray me at a moment's notice.

3599
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:38,980
So I organize my life where when they betray me,

3600
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:41,460
not if, I will be able to survive

3601
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:42,900
and it won't be a big deal.

3602
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:44,260
So that's, that's me.

3603
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:47,700
But I was able to have a,

3604
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:51,060
have good times with a bunch of nice ladies senior year.

3605
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:52,980
You know, I had a bunch of casual things going at once,

3606
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:56,020
was living the dream for a while with a couple ladies

3607
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:59,780
and then senior year ended.

3608
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:02,340
And that was, you know, that was sad and all.

3609
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:03,620
Nothing, none of it was like too tragic.

3610
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:05,300
It was just, it sucked to be away from my boys.

3611
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:10,980
But eventually I went back to Massachusetts

3612
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:12,900
and from there I just spent my time

3613
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:15,620
doing like one class at a time

3614
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:17,380
working terrible, shitty jobs

3615
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:20,500
because for years the College of New Jersey

3616
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:23,860
was useless at finding me a fucking internship

3617
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:25,700
where I could like work and make decent money

3618
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:28,020
with those, with the skills I had developed.

3619
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:31,140
It took me four years and of an account,

3620
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:34,420
like my dad's best friend since he was like,

3621
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:35,860
in like elementary school,

3622
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:37,460
having to work for a software company

3623
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:39,140
and was like, hey, like we could,

3624
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:40,260
we take interns all the time

3625
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:41,780
from like the University of Cincinnati.

3626
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,620
So I'm living like an hour south of Boston

3627
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:44,740
where, you know, where I grew up.

3628
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:46,660
And he's like, hey, want to move out to Cincinnati?

3629
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:48,180
You know, you have to interview and shit

3630
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:49,620
but you've got decent qualifications.

3631
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:51,140
You can finish your degree out here

3632
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:52,900
at like the University of Cincinnati

3633
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:55,460
and, you know, at work and have a fucking job

3634
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,820
and not be a poor piece of shit.

3635
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:59,460
Like you have been for the last three, four years or whatever.

3636
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:02,100
I was like, yes, please, save me from this hell.

3637
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,740
And so I went and started,

3638
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:06,500
I lived out here in Cincinnati

3639
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:07,620
and that's what I've been doing ever since.

3640
02:12:07,620 --> 02:12:09,540
Finished my degree a couple months ago,

3641
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:12,580
checked that box and now my pay went up a bunch

3642
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:14,340
and now I make a comfortable living,

3643
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:16,500
live well below my means

3644
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,620
and I'm spending all my money

3645
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:19,140
to pay off my student loans,

3646
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:20,260
so I'll be free.

3647
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:22,340
But, and so that's where I'm at right now,

3648
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,140
like financially.

3649
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:25,780
But, during that three years,

3650
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:26,980
and this is where I wonder

3651
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:29,620
if maybe this was all a blessing in disguise,

3652
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:33,380
I heard of a little website called uporn.com

3653
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:35,860
and I knew that's where my future lie.

3654
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:38,580
No, it was YouTube.

3655
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:40,340
So actually, it was funny, Ben during this time,

3656
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:42,340
you know, my older brother, Ben, remember that guy?

3657
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:45,380
He had been doing a lot of crazy shit during that time.

3658
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:47,380
He went to Europe, he taught Polish,

3659
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:49,220
no, he taught English in Poland.

3660
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:51,060
Oh, no, no, no, sorry, he taught physics in Poland

3661
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:52,420
because that's what he got his degree in

3662
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:53,700
and he did a bunch of crazy stuff

3663
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:56,180
and he lived in California,

3664
02:12:56,180 --> 02:12:57,140
you know, I've been around for a while.

3665
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:58,740
Go listen to the Ben interview

3666
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:02,980
if you want the full story of Ben's crazy ass post college.

3667
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:05,860
Ben's done some really interesting stuff with his life,

3668
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:07,220
despite being a useless bum.

3669
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:10,740
It's generally because Ben does not care

3670
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:12,100
about having a safety net.

3671
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:12,660
No, not at all.

3672
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:15,060
You and him are kind of diametrically opposed

3673
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:16,180
in this regard.

3674
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:18,260
I wouldn't say, like, I'm very much like my dad

3675
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:18,820
in that respect.

3676
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:20,660
He is like, and I've only become that way

3677
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:21,860
over the last couple years,

3678
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:22,900
like since I moved out here

3679
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:24,580
and I've like been forced to become an adult.

3680
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:28,020
Yeah, like now I really have my shit together

3681
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:30,260
in a big way and Ben does not.

3682
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:31,780
And I, I wonder if that's-

3683
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,220
But it doesn't even matter,

3684
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:34,180
because he doesn't care.

3685
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:35,380
It doesn't, he does not care.

3686
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:36,500
It does not faze him

3687
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,380
that he doesn't have a shit together.

3688
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:38,260
I guess he's more like my mom a little bit.

3689
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:39,380
I don't know, it's a mix.

3690
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:40,100
This whole thing about like,

3691
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:40,980
oh, you're just like your mom,

3692
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:41,540
you're just like your dad,

3693
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:42,340
that's a meme anyway.

3694
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:45,540
But in any case, so during that time,

3695
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:47,620
Ben was got into,

3696
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:48,820
Ben had been watching a ton of shows.

3697
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:50,820
Like he's always been a big consumer of media.

3698
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:53,220
And one show he watched was My Little Pony,

3699
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:55,940
that he was like, hey Nate, check out this show.

3700
02:13:55,940 --> 02:13:59,940
And I remember when he was in, I believe Poland,

3701
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,060
he sent me like something,

3702
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:02,100
it might have been California or whatever,

3703
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:02,740
when he was far away,

3704
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:04,420
he sent me links to like the show.

3705
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:06,500
And I was like, I do not believe

3706
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:08,100
that My Little Pony is good.

3707
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:09,860
I believe that you are lying to me,

3708
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:11,220
that this is a fucking joke,

3709
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:11,860
that you're an idiot.

3710
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:13,300
And I just ignored him for a while.

3711
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,740
But eventually like on 4chan,

3712
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:15,860
people were talking about it,

3713
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:16,980
and I was just like, okay,

3714
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:19,620
maybe there is something to this thing after all.

3715
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:20,740
So I took Ben up on it.

3716
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:22,260
And the first episode I watched

3717
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,940
was Putting Your Hoof Down.

3718
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:26,260
And it was like the best episode of all time.

3719
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:27,140
I'll describe it to you.

3720
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,620
Season two, that's the Iron Will one, right?

3721
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:31,860
As made famous by Keg Standard Reviews,

3722
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:33,300
Putting Your Hoof Down, that's right.

3723
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:36,340
And it's the greatest episode of anything ever.

3724
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:38,420
It's literally about like this,

3725
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,660
like the kind of motivational speaker

3726
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:42,260
sort of pickup artist guy

3727
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:43,780
that was like my hero.

3728
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,540
And it didn't even make him a villain.

3729
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:47,860
It just made him like an antagonist for the episode

3730
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:49,860
with like, hey, you owe me money.

3731
02:14:49,860 --> 02:14:52,580
But then Fluttershy is like,

3732
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:54,580
fuck you, I didn't appreciate your service.

3733
02:14:54,580 --> 02:14:57,540
All Fluttershy does is like learn from this guy,

3734
02:14:57,540 --> 02:14:59,780
become like an alpha herself.

3735
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:02,740
And then he's like, yeah, you know, okay, all right.

3736
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:03,620
I'm with you.

3737
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:05,300
So like, he respects the co.

3738
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:06,260
He's not even a villain.

3739
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:06,900
He's a good guy.

3740
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:07,620
He is a good guy.

3741
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:09,140
Okay, I'm getting too deep into this thing.

3742
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:09,780
I fucking love that episode.

3743
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:10,980
Go watch Keg Reviews.

3744
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:12,660
Go watch Keg Standard Reviews.

3745
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:13,940
Putting Your Hoof Down on T-Bap.

3746
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,180
It's actually a great video that I love.

3747
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:18,820
I did a song for it and two or three songs.

3748
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:19,540
I did three songs.

3749
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:21,540
That video's kind of the precursor

3750
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:23,620
to what would be best guy ever.

3751
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:26,580
Like, it's the first example of you going

3752
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:27,860
way the fuck overboard

3753
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:29,460
for the production of a video.

3754
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:31,460
Which would be continued in Phantom Reviews.

3755
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:33,060
Way overboard.

3756
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:34,660
We've banned Ben's fucking animations

3757
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:35,540
and like the song.

3758
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:37,380
Oh man, that was a fucking crazy ride.

3759
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:39,780
Took us like six months to finish that video, I think.

3760
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:40,420
Yeah.

3761
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:41,860
Which would establish a pattern for me,

3762
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:42,980
which would be very destructive,

3763
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:44,020
but make some decent stuff.

3764
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:45,300
But in any case,

3765
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:47,620
so Ben convinced me to watch My Little Pony.

3766
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:50,180
I did and I got into it.

3767
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:51,540
And I would watch it like at work

3768
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:52,580
when I was supposed to be working

3769
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:54,020
at this other shitty job.

3770
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:55,780
And I would just watch My Little Pony instead.

3771
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:56,980
And it was great.

3772
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:57,780
I remember I was watching it

3773
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:00,820
when the Boston Marathon bombing happened.

3774
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,500
I was watching Some My Little Pony

3775
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,340
and was like, I don't give a fuck about them.

3776
02:16:04,340 --> 02:16:06,180
I'm taking it with rarity and the girls.

3777
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:07,300
This is way more important.

3778
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:11,940
And long story short,

3779
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:13,460
like so we were goofing around

3780
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:15,060
and then eventually Ben came home

3781
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:16,580
and Ben suggested one day,

3782
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:18,660
he's like, yo, I've been watching this big faggot

3783
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:20,580
like Digi Bro and like other guys

3784
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:23,300
or Digi Broney and Broney Curious

3785
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:24,420
and these other guys.

3786
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:26,740
And in fact, he showed me the video

3787
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:29,220
that really made me even interested

3788
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:30,660
in YouTube in general,

3789
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:33,860
was like horseshoe reviews.

3790
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:35,860
God, what was it?

3791
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:36,820
It was like, it was the one.

3792
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:39,060
He knew Jesse even before he showed any of this to you.

3793
02:16:39,060 --> 02:16:39,220
Yeah.

3794
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:41,620
Like the first video that I saw of like YouTube,

3795
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:43,620
this was like my introduction to YouTube

3796
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:45,700
was seeing Jesse's video.

3797
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:47,060
God, what the fuck was it?

3798
02:16:47,060 --> 02:16:47,940
It's like magic.

3799
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:50,660
It's that it's the season three opener,

3800
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:51,540
the Crystal Kingdom,

3801
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:52,900
like the Magic Crystal Kingdom one.

3802
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:53,780
Oh, the Colt Corona.

3803
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:55,540
The Colt Corona video, that's the one.

3804
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:57,140
Where he crawls out of that fucking

3805
02:16:57,140 --> 02:16:58,980
like the carousel boutique thing.

3806
02:16:59,060 --> 02:17:00,820
This is before horseshoe reviews.

3807
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:01,860
Yeah, you're right.

3808
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:03,060
It wasn't even horseshoe reviews.

3809
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:05,540
It was when Jesse was doing his crazy shit before that.

3810
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:08,340
This was, that video was fucking magical.

3811
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:09,860
That video is incredible.

3812
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:10,900
Jesse, I love you brother.

3813
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,780
You're a hero.

3814
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:16,260
But so I realized that YouTube was a thing.

3815
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:17,460
We were both into My Little Pony.

3816
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:18,420
Ben was back home.

3817
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:20,180
He suggested, hey, let's do a,

3818
02:17:20,180 --> 02:17:21,460
because every time an episode would come out,

3819
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:22,740
we've been doing this our whole life.

3820
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:24,580
We would be like up late watching anime together

3821
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:26,020
and we'd talk about it for hours.

3822
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:27,460
He's like, yo, we're doing this again

3823
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:28,500
with My Little Pony.

3824
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,420
Let's make a motherfucking podcast.

3825
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:31,060
So we did.

3826
02:17:31,060 --> 02:17:33,940
So we made T-Bat episode one and just like,

3827
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:37,300
that's two best brothers bitch about ponies.

3828
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:39,300
Yeah, don't tell mom though, because that's a swear.

3829
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:43,380
So, right.

3830
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:44,740
So we did it and I believe,

3831
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:48,420
our first episode was just a still image

3832
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,940
and shitty audio.

3833
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:51,140
And shitty art.

3834
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:51,780
And shitty art.

3835
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,820
The original designs are pretty shit.

3836
02:17:54,820 --> 02:17:56,500
I remember Ben, the keg had this

3837
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:58,260
amazing like number one finger

3838
02:17:58,260 --> 02:17:59,380
that never got reused.

3839
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:01,460
What a tragic loss for that character.

3840
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:02,500
Could have had so much development

3841
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:03,860
with that number one finger thing.

3842
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:06,180
But yeah, I had the Kanye Shades

3843
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:07,620
and Ben Phantom Horn.

3844
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:08,820
Oh, it was good times.

3845
02:18:08,820 --> 02:18:10,660
But what's interesting about T-Bat,

3846
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,860
looking back at it now,

3847
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:14,100
is that that was literally the first video

3848
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:17,620
I ever made outside of like this one

3849
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:19,780
like video editing AMV I made,

3850
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:21,620
like on a VHS tape back in high school

3851
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:22,740
that is totally irrelevant.

3852
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:25,700
I started learning YouTube at that moment,

3853
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,060
like editing and shit.

3854
02:18:27,060 --> 02:18:31,220
And now here I sit like three and a half years later

3855
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:34,660
and I consider myself a pretty damn great edit boy.

3856
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:38,180
And yeah, learned a lot of shit real fast.

3857
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:40,820
But like the way that T-Bat evolved quickly,

3858
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,780
even at that time,

3859
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:44,820
it was as fast as I could learn how to do new shit.

3860
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:46,100
And you know, to give Ben credit to,

3861
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,220
he made new art.

3862
02:18:47,220 --> 02:18:48,580
We were grinding that shit.

3863
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:50,260
We were grinding that T-Bat wheel,

3864
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:51,060
like as hard as we could.

3865
02:18:51,060 --> 02:18:53,620
I'm sure I probably said this in Ben's interview too,

3866
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:57,700
but like both, like the early T-Bat episodes

3867
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:58,740
were all submitted to me

3868
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:03,060
because I was running Equestria Daily's analysis thing

3869
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:03,620
at the time.

3870
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:04,020
Right.

3871
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:05,860
I'd been well established by this point.

3872
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:08,340
I'd been around for probably seven, eight months

3873
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:09,380
and I was pretty famous.

3874
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:11,860
Known for propagating heroes like Dr. Wolf

3875
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,380
on another legendary internet figure.

3876
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:13,940
Exactly.

3877
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:14,500
Right, okay.

3878
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,420
So I'm working for Equestria Daily,

3879
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:17,780
season four has started

3880
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:20,020
and people submit their videos to me.

3881
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:21,940
And the first T-Bat was submitted to me

3882
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:23,700
and I thought this is fucking dog shit.

3883
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:24,020
Sure.

3884
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:27,300
Because the audio is so bad that I can't listen to it.

3885
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:28,580
And I'm just like, who are these guys?

3886
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:30,020
What is this shit?

3887
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:31,620
Who are these plucky young heroes?

3888
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:32,660
Who do they think they are?

3889
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:35,860
But then like literally two weeks later,

3890
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:38,580
I get submitted another one

3891
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:41,940
that's got like vastly superior art and audio.

3892
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:44,660
It's got like a whole intro segment that's hilarious.

3893
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:48,260
It's got these legendary pony designs.

3894
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:51,940
You guys had easily the best OCs in the fucking entirety.

3895
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:52,340
Agreed.

3896
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:56,020
Our OC game was on point.

3897
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:57,780
If you include the whole,

3898
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:00,180
like all the characters you guys made up

3899
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:00,820
for that one video.

3900
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:01,860
Sticky situation.

3901
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:03,140
Like those are...

3902
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:04,020
Horsefister.

3903
02:20:05,620 --> 02:20:07,700
Look, most of our audience doesn't know MLP.

3904
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:10,740
They don't appreciate how meaningful this statement is

3905
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:13,540
because there are hundreds of thousands

3906
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:14,820
of My Little Pony OCs.

3907
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:15,140
That's true.

3908
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:17,620
And there are some very creative people who made them.

3909
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:18,820
There are a lot of great ones.

3910
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:21,620
There are ones who have had whole fandoms.

3911
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:25,140
You know, like fan made OCs with fandoms exist.

3912
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:26,980
Like like a snow drop or something, you know?

3913
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:27,780
Right, yeah, yeah.

3914
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:33,140
You guys made the best OCs in the entire fucking fandom.

3915
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:33,540
It's true.

3916
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:33,940
I think...

3917
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:36,260
And never got the credit you deserve.

3918
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,220
You know, it was funny.

3919
02:20:37,220 --> 02:20:40,580
We never appeared in like those big group shots of everybody.

3920
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:43,380
And it's entirely because we were like a little bit,

3921
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:45,220
we were a little too original, you know,

3922
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:48,180
where there are like Ben, we made a big mistake

3923
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:51,620
by not playing it like exactly like everybody else was doing.

3924
02:20:51,620 --> 02:20:54,740
So like including us, somebody like eventually made like vectors.

3925
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:56,420
But even then they never showed up in anything.

3926
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:00,500
Yeah, like Ben's designs were like cartoony

3927
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:02,740
and like had their own style going on and they were...

3928
02:21:02,740 --> 02:21:04,580
I think that was just because like,

3929
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:07,860
this is a big part of how the horseshoe crew,

3930
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:09,860
which they became the PCP came together,

3931
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:12,420
is that we all respected one another's work.

3932
02:21:12,420 --> 02:21:16,740
And I think a lot of what we were like pissed off about at the time

3933
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:18,980
was that like, you know, I was famous,

3934
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:21,860
but I had like a kind of squeaky clean character,

3935
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:26,500
which when I eventually changed it, people were mad about.

3936
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:27,220
Yes, they were.

3937
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:28,820
But like you guys never did.

3938
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:30,500
The T-Bap and Jesse...

3939
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:32,180
We had a swear in our name, dude.

3940
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:34,020
Yeah, and you guys, you know,

3941
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:36,420
you'd make constant misogyny jokes and shit.

3942
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,540
Yeah, especially me.

3943
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:41,460
And like that kind of shit just didn't fly in that community

3944
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:43,220
because there's a bunch of fucking autistic children

3945
02:21:43,220 --> 02:21:45,540
who didn't want that, who just like couldn't parse

3946
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:46,820
what was a joke and what wasn't.

3947
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:50,100
I always thought like we had a certain atmosphere

3948
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:51,220
that didn't get as much shit.

3949
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:53,940
Like I think the number one thing I ever got shit for

3950
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:56,020
was one time when I got really mad at...

3951
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:59,460
There was an episode where Pinkie Pie kept making Fluttershy Cry

3952
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:00,580
and I was like...

3953
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:02,740
I mean, yeah, I think it's fairly in character,

3954
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:04,340
but like I was being like,

3955
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:08,900
oh, that Pinkie Pie is such a like fucking autistic piece of shit, faggot.

3956
02:22:08,900 --> 02:22:12,100
And like it was the way that I like vindictively called her autistic.

3957
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:13,460
The audience got really mad,

3958
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:15,620
and I wonder why you said that word.

3959
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:18,660
Well, like, and that's the thing, like even for me,

3960
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:22,180
like I liked you guys' stuff, like you guys and Jesse,

3961
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:27,220
but even I would like hesitate to post it on Equestria Daily

3962
02:22:27,220 --> 02:22:28,580
because I knew I'd get shit for it.

3963
02:22:28,580 --> 02:22:30,900
You know, like I'd gotten shit for my own videos

3964
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:31,700
for saying that kind of stuff.

3965
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:33,780
Dude, the whole point of the Phantom Horde character

3966
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:36,900
is specifically to mock transsexual people.

3967
02:22:37,060 --> 02:22:38,020
Like that's what the characters of...

3968
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:39,140
Well, transgender people.

3969
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:40,580
Right, transgender, yeah, yeah.

3970
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:46,580
Yeah, like, I mean, yeah, and like MLP Phantom was highly steeped in like...

3971
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:48,260
By the way, we have no hatred for them.

3972
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,380
We just think it's funny.

3973
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:50,740
It's this whole, it's just hilarious.

3974
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:54,420
Well, that's the thing, like MLP Phantom was highly steeped in like neo-liberalism

3975
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,020
and a lot of social justice stuff,

3976
02:22:56,020 --> 02:23:01,220
and like we're not even really like idealistically opposed to that kind of stuff.

3977
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:04,180
We just are willing to make fun of shit,

3978
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:05,940
and those, like a lot of them aren't.

3979
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:07,700
That's the big problem with that whole movement.

3980
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:10,980
Yeah, and that's why like promoting T-Bab

3981
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:13,700
and promoting Endless Jazz or Drowning in Horse Shoes

3982
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:15,860
was always really difficult for me,

3983
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:18,020
because like I couldn't bring people to that,

3984
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:19,780
and it would affect the way people looked at me too,

3985
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:21,620
people were like, oh, why are you associating with them?

3986
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:24,260
You know, I'm like, well, because I think it's funny, but like...

3987
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:25,940
And because I'm working for Equestria Daily,

3988
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:28,180
who now I have to represent their interests and stuff,

3989
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:30,180
and like when we would do...

3990
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:32,180
Yeah, when people would draw those crowd shots,

3991
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:35,380
like they'd leave out you guys, I think for that reason.

3992
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:37,780
You know, like I think some of them knew about you guys,

3993
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:40,580
and just didn't like you because you were transgressive.

3994
02:23:40,580 --> 02:23:42,420
Well, okay, you know what? Entirely possible.

3995
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:46,580
I'm sticking with my theory that it's because our art designs were too different,

3996
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:48,100
because these people did not have standards.

3997
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:50,740
There was a lot of those like big crowd shots.

3998
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:53,140
Dude, they put like fucking 50 subscriber nobodies in those.

3999
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:55,620
Yeah, exactly. There'd be literal nobodies in these,

4000
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:59,620
and yet Drowning in Horse Shoes and T-Bab wouldn't be there.

4001
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:02,100
And sometimes Gibbon was, you know, sometimes...

4002
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:03,860
If he was in there way more than the rest of us, yeah.

4003
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:05,700
And that's... He was never aggressive.

4004
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:08,420
He was never like, you know, offensive or anything.

4005
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:11,220
I think it was mostly that you guys were offensive to the bronies,

4006
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:14,980
and they're like, literally a bunch of fucking pussies about it, you know?

4007
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:16,100
Like, because they really were.

4008
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:19,140
Like, I knew people who were extremely squeaky clean,

4009
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:23,620
who didn't even had a darker sense of humor, but wouldn't show it, you know?

4010
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:25,540
And like, I mean, you saw what happened to me.

4011
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:26,340
For example?

4012
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:27,140
Well, well, she's...

4013
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:29,060
I don't know anything about her.

4014
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:29,300
No.

4015
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:31,860
She, yeah.

4016
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:33,460
I like that one song she made at whatever.

4017
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,020
Yeah.

4018
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:37,860
Um, anyway, I got a lot of trouble with her.

4019
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:40,900
She blocked... She literally told me to stop listening to her music.

4020
02:24:40,900 --> 02:24:41,860
I remember that.

4021
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:42,340
Interesting.

4022
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:45,220
Yo, white people, don't listen to my music.

4023
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:46,740
Hashtag cats millionaire.

4024
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:46,980
Yeah.

4025
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:49,860
She wasn't black, but...

4026
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:51,060
I'm just... I'm making a joke.

4027
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:54,180
Like that rapper who told white people not to listen to his music.

4028
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:55,300
Kanye West?

4029
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:56,100
No, Kanye West.

4030
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:58,100
Was that... Like, you made a thing about this.

4031
02:24:58,100 --> 02:24:58,660
Like, there was some rap...

4032
02:24:58,660 --> 02:24:59,300
Oh, Milo.

4033
02:24:59,300 --> 02:24:59,620
Milo.

4034
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:01,140
Well, he didn't say white people don't listen to it.

4035
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,820
He just gets mad at white people who say n***a,

4036
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:05,220
even if it's like singing along to his songs.

4037
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,100
Right, n***a.

4038
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:06,740
Fuck off.

4039
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:06,900
Yeah.

4040
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:08,260
So...

4041
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:11,860
But yeah, like, I really think...

4042
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:15,060
Like, you saw what happened when I made my pony start smoking.

4043
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:15,780
Like, people blip shit on me.

4044
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:17,220
Yeah, just smoking.

4045
02:25:17,220 --> 02:25:18,740
Is that weed?

4046
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:21,700
Is... Oh my God, cigarettes are evil!

4047
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:22,180
Fuck!

4048
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:24,020
But this is a children's show,

4049
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:27,140
and what if children watch your videos and get influenced to smoke?

4050
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:30,340
Like, I'm not even portraying it as a good thing that my character smokes.

4051
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:32,980
I'm portraying him as, like, a half-dead, tired,

4052
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:35,300
don't-be-like-me kids abomination.

4053
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:37,460
People don't want to look into, like, the whole...

4054
02:25:37,460 --> 02:25:40,900
When it comes to anything, like, questionable or even slightly edgy,

4055
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:42,580
they're not interested in context.

4056
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:42,740
No.

4057
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:44,900
They're just... I mean, it's like the Anita Sarkeesian thing.

4058
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:47,620
Like, if you're showing X, you're supporting X.

4059
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:50,580
Whether you say so or not, like, context is irrelevant.

4060
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:53,060
If you show, like, a sexy woman, that's you, you know,

4061
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:54,820
just, like, whatever, you're objectifying or whatever.

4062
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:55,620
It's that same argument.

4063
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:56,420
It doesn't make any sense.

4064
02:25:56,420 --> 02:25:57,140
It's ridiculous.

4065
02:25:57,780 --> 02:25:59,380
Though, it's only ridiculous.

4066
02:25:59,380 --> 02:26:00,180
Okay, you know what?

4067
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:01,940
Maybe Anita's right.

4068
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:04,900
If everyone is really stupid, and if nobody's thinking about it,

4069
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:05,700
maybe that's the problem.

4070
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:06,580
Which is not the case.

4071
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:07,940
Which I don't think is actually the case.

4072
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:09,060
If people think attention.

4073
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:11,540
I think most people who take offense to things

4074
02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:14,100
are taking offense on behalf of other people...

4075
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:14,500
Right, yeah.

4076
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:17,460
...who aren't actually being affected, you know.

4077
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:18,820
How far in are we on this?

4078
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,780
Two and a half hours.

4079
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:20,500
Two and a half?

4080
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:20,740
Yeah.

4081
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:23,060
All right, so you've...

4082
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:24,340
You started up T-Bab.

4083
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:25,300
Yep.

4084
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:26,580
How did that go?

4085
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:27,620
Because you guys got...

4086
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:29,620
That channel was not unsuccessful.

4087
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:30,420
No, we all...

4088
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:33,220
You know, it took a long time for you to pass T-Bab

4089
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:34,740
as best guy ever.

4090
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:36,020
I just did it recently.

4091
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:36,580
Yeah.

4092
02:26:36,580 --> 02:26:40,180
Right before the Galco video, I finally reached my goal

4093
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:43,620
of 17,000 subscribers, which was a big deal for me

4094
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:47,620
because I never got there with the T-Bab.

4095
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:49,060
And I was always like, oh, we're so close.

4096
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:51,140
I mean, it was a meme number because it was just like,

4097
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:52,820
oh, yeah, now we'll get the next thousand.

4098
02:26:52,820 --> 02:26:53,860
Now we'll get the next thousand.

4099
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:57,220
And it happened to be that T-Bab never quite got to 17,000.

4100
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:58,500
And it was always like, ah, shit.

4101
02:26:58,820 --> 02:27:00,340
Fuck, I want to do that someday.

4102
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:01,460
So I finally did it.

4103
02:27:01,460 --> 02:27:03,380
And then Galco happened immediately

4104
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:05,700
and the channel doubled in size within a week.

4105
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:06,020
Yeah.

4106
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:06,420
And...

4107
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:07,620
That's how it tends to happen.

4108
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:09,060
And then Mia Maffova happened.

4109
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:10,740
And I mean, it didn't like have an explosion,

4110
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,980
but I've gained like 4,000 subscribers or so

4111
02:27:12,980 --> 02:27:14,660
over the course of Mia Maffova or something.

4112
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:15,060
Yeah.

4113
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:17,140
And I mean, I know I've got a long way to go,

4114
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:19,300
but this is like huge progress for me.

4115
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:22,500
And my Patreon is like exploding a little bit right now.

4116
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:24,420
So it's everything great.

4117
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,100
All good things are happening right now to me.

4118
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:31,140
But, you know, for T-Bab itself, you know, it was...

4119
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:32,580
T-Bab was great.

4120
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:35,780
It was another like confidence boosting thing.

4121
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:38,420
Because, you know, again, I was a different man

4122
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:40,420
than I had been like a couple years ago.

4123
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:42,900
I was more confident and willing to do things

4124
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:47,060
that were, you know, would have scared me off,

4125
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:48,340
you know, in my childhood.

4126
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:52,020
But it was doing it, getting some success,

4127
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:55,700
getting some positive feedback was really good for me.

4128
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:57,780
And especially at that time in my life

4129
02:27:57,780 --> 02:27:59,380
where I was working these shitty jobs

4130
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:01,860
and, you know, didn't have my degree,

4131
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:03,380
was like student loan debt,

4132
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:05,220
having to pay that shit off all the time,

4133
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:07,300
like no money, living with my parents,

4134
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:10,580
you know, no girls, you know, at all at this time.

4135
02:28:10,580 --> 02:28:13,860
And, yeah, it was just really shitty.

4136
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:17,460
But T-Bab gave me something to feel good about in my life.

4137
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:21,140
I was really achieving something that was making an impact.

4138
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,180
It was making people happy.

4139
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:25,380
It was earning me even a little bit of money on the internet.

4140
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:26,260
It was amazing to me.

4141
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:27,060
It blew my mind.

4142
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:29,780
And I was able to work with Ben,

4143
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:32,500
which was usually very good

4144
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:34,020
because Ben is a very competent guy,

4145
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:37,780
but needs the first put to him on occasion.

4146
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:42,580
So, you know, it just was a very positive change

4147
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:45,380
to get, I don't know, to really understand it.

4148
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:47,380
Like, yeah, if I set my mind to something,

4149
02:28:47,380 --> 02:28:48,500
I can fucking do it.

4150
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:49,780
I can achieve this shit,

4151
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:51,220
which I'd already kind of understood,

4152
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:54,820
like with the whole, you know, girl thing in college.

4153
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:58,580
It was just, like, this was like a professional validation.

4154
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:00,580
And it was at this point that I was starting to wonder,

4155
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:02,420
like, I really had those thoughts of, like,

4156
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:05,460
like, what is the point of, like, all this school shit I've done?

4157
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:09,060
Like, why have I spent all this time slaving away

4158
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:11,780
at something that I don't even want to do?

4159
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:16,180
Like, I so easily just fell into this, like, you know, career,

4160
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,620
quote unquote, career at this point,

4161
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:21,220
that, like, I'm passionate for and I love doing

4162
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:22,420
and is earning me money

4163
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:24,980
and could theoretically be a way to live.

4164
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:27,780
And, like, I talk about how, like,

4165
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:29,540
the most productive time in my life,

4166
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:30,820
now it's me and Mathafa.

4167
02:29:30,820 --> 02:29:33,780
But, like, forget, before me and Mathafa happened,

4168
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:34,900
like, and I'm actually,

4169
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:36,900
I'm a ridiculously hard worker on my videos.

4170
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:38,740
It's just they really do take that long to come out

4171
02:29:38,740 --> 02:29:39,940
because I have to work all the time.

4172
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:42,180
And I have to, like, go to the gym and shit

4173
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:42,900
that takes up time.

4174
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:47,220
But, like, every Saturday was New Pony Day.

4175
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:50,020
And it's, nothing else matters.

4176
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:53,540
All that matters is that we get the fucking Pony episode done.

4177
02:29:53,540 --> 02:29:55,780
And people probably don't remember this,

4178
02:29:55,780 --> 02:30:00,740
but we consistently were the first review out on the Saturdays,

4179
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:03,380
despite being also the best review.

4180
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:04,740
We did it every week.

4181
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:06,820
I mean, our only competition was guys like,

4182
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:08,500
I mean, like, Dr. Wolf will get his out real quick.

4183
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:11,140
Granted, you had the advantage of it was unscripted.

4184
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:11,860
True.

4185
02:30:11,860 --> 02:30:13,860
But, like, like, yeah.

4186
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:15,620
We would have our intro skits and shit, though,

4187
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:18,100
and animations and all that stuff going on.

4188
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:19,060
But you did those in the week.

4189
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:19,140
Animations.

4190
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:20,260
Animations.

4191
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:22,500
Well, the animations we had to do during the thing.

4192
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:23,940
Well, I mean, what's your point?

4193
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:25,140
Like, yeah, we planned, dude.

4194
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:25,700
We planned.

4195
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:26,740
We were playing the game.

4196
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:28,740
I'm just saying that, like, it was impressive,

4197
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:31,140
but, like, you know, there was, like,

4198
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:34,100
a certain team of people who was the day ones.

4199
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:36,500
And it was, like, me, you guys and Tom

4200
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:39,860
were always, like, the first starting line,

4201
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:41,300
like, these guys are going to be out.

4202
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:44,420
You'd always beat me just by virtue of being unscripted.

4203
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:45,060
Like, if I hadn't written my video.

4204
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:45,380
Oh, I see.

4205
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:47,140
This is a personal ego thing for you.

4206
02:30:47,140 --> 02:30:47,620
I see.

4207
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:47,860
Okay.

4208
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:50,660
Well, I'm not saying, I wasn't even really trying for,

4209
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:51,940
like, being first.

4210
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:53,620
I was always just trying to have that day.

4211
02:30:53,620 --> 02:30:54,340
That was our goal.

4212
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:57,460
So, like, oftentimes, I would, like, you know,

4213
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:59,220
dick around for a few hours or something.

4214
02:30:59,220 --> 02:31:03,060
But, like, I think in terms of, like,

4215
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:05,940
like, we were probably working at the same speed.

4216
02:31:05,940 --> 02:31:08,580
I just was writing out all the videos, you know.

4217
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:09,380
Sure, sure.

4218
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:11,060
We had some advantages.

4219
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:12,420
You know, we had two people doing the work,

4220
02:31:14,340 --> 02:31:14,740
etc.

4221
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:18,820
And yeah, we, like, but is that the fact that we worked on

4222
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:21,060
our intros and outros ahead of time,

4223
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:23,940
I think is a good thing about us.

4224
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:24,340
Yeah.

4225
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:25,780
Like, we worked really hard on them.

4226
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:28,100
And it's not, like, it's not easy to get all those

4227
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:29,460
fucking poses.

4228
02:31:29,460 --> 02:31:30,020
No, it's not.

4229
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:32,260
Plus, like, the original art Ben would generate.

4230
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:34,580
Like, to this day, I still love some of those.

4231
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:38,100
Like, do you remember the one of, like, Love Lesson Zero?

4232
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:39,860
For one of our fucking intros,

4233
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:45,300
we Ben made an, like, a full, like, fake foe love.

4234
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:46,020
What's the word I'm looking for?

4235
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:46,980
Like, like, harem.

4236
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:49,220
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4237
02:31:49,220 --> 02:31:50,420
Visual novel is the word I'm looking for.

4238
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:52,660
He made, like, a love visual novel intro thing with, like,

4239
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:55,860
it was keg as, like, a character who was playing, like,

4240
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:57,780
some guy who was hoping to date this girl.

4241
02:31:57,780 --> 02:31:59,540
And then, like, Spike was, like, a baddest in Twilight.

4242
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:01,060
Honestly, like, it was nuts.

4243
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:04,180
To our audience, if any of you have never seen any of T-Bat

4244
02:32:04,180 --> 02:32:05,460
because you don't care about MLP,

4245
02:32:06,260 --> 02:32:08,740
I feel like we've done a real disservice,

4246
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:11,780
all of us in the procrastinators, to ourselves,

4247
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:15,140
by, like, insisting that our MLP days are, like, a meme

4248
02:32:15,140 --> 02:32:17,140
that are in the past and we're, like, ashamed.

4249
02:32:17,140 --> 02:32:17,860
I suppose.

4250
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:20,900
We all did a lot of great work back then

4251
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:22,500
that people should go back and see.

4252
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:24,340
Phantom reviews, that is great.

4253
02:32:24,340 --> 02:32:24,980
Peg reviews is great.

4254
02:32:24,980 --> 02:32:29,300
Don't even, don't even, like, go to the, go to T-Bat

4255
02:32:29,300 --> 02:32:32,260
and just watch the intros to all the videos

4256
02:32:32,260 --> 02:32:34,260
because the intros were fucking awesome.

4257
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,220
And so the actors are great.

4258
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:38,580
There's one where it was, like, it was live action,

4259
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:40,420
Phantom Horn trying to draw something

4260
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:42,100
and he had, like, actual hooves.

4261
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:43,220
We worked so hard on that.

4262
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:44,900
How did you do the hooves?

4263
02:32:44,900 --> 02:32:47,780
Okay, what we did was, like, I think that was my idea.

4264
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:50,980
We, like, I had seen some video of, like, someone with hooves

4265
02:32:50,980 --> 02:32:52,820
and I was, like, I've got an idea.

4266
02:32:52,820 --> 02:32:54,020
Let's do, like, a live action drawing thing.

4267
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:56,260
So we bought some hooves.

4268
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:58,260
Like, you can just buy online, like, these, like,

4269
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:00,500
rubbery horse hooves, like, glove type things

4270
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:02,260
that go all the way up to, like, your elbow.

4271
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:04,420
And we spray-painted them blue.

4272
02:33:04,420 --> 02:33:06,820
We just spray-painted them blue so they'd look like phantoms.

4273
02:33:06,820 --> 02:33:09,380
And then we just, this was, we used, like,

4274
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:11,940
our setup for filming that thing was so fucking jank.

4275
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:15,700
We taped, like, one of our, like, Samsung Galaxy 2s,

4276
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:19,060
like, the top of a thing and, like, filmed downward.

4277
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,700
And, like, we had to do so many takes of all that shit,

4278
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:23,140
like, trying to get it just right.

4279
02:33:23,860 --> 02:33:25,940
Essentially, the joke is that he tries to draw,

4280
02:33:25,940 --> 02:33:27,860
but he has hooves so he spills ink all over.

4281
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:29,860
The joke is that phantom constantly,

4282
02:33:29,860 --> 02:33:31,300
phantom is doing, like, a how-to-draw.

4283
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:33,220
He's fucking up everything horribly.

4284
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:35,060
And then somehow, at the end, he ends up with this, like,

4285
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:36,100
beautiful drawing.

4286
02:33:36,100 --> 02:33:37,300
It's like, and that's how you do it.

4287
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:38,340
That's how you fucking do it.

4288
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:40,820
Great skit. Love it.

4289
02:33:40,820 --> 02:33:43,220
Yeah, these guys would put out, like,

4290
02:33:43,220 --> 02:33:46,340
that the opening skits of T-Bap were literally better

4291
02:33:46,340 --> 02:33:48,660
than anything else happening in the pony community

4292
02:33:48,660 --> 02:33:51,060
unless it was from, like, me or Jesse,

4293
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:53,220
or Hippo, or Gibbon.

4294
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:54,900
And I'm not saying it was worse than any of those,

4295
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:57,300
just that those were also not terrible.

4296
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:58,020
It's true.

4297
02:33:59,140 --> 02:34:02,580
And Jesse's stuff, like, I actually have had people tell me

4298
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:05,380
that they've finally gone and watched the horseshoes reviews

4299
02:34:05,380 --> 02:34:06,340
and been like, holy shit.

4300
02:34:06,340 --> 02:34:07,300
They are that good.

4301
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:09,300
They are legitimately incredible.

4302
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:11,780
Don't even watch my little pony, it doesn't matter.

4303
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:13,860
Just go watch the horseshoe reviews,

4304
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:15,380
watch the intros to T-Bap,

4305
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:20,180
watch at least, like, Gibbon finale or something,

4306
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:23,380
or his last one where Gibbon takes sales off and dies.

4307
02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:24,180
Except now he's back.

4308
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:25,140
He's a pirate boy again.

4309
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:28,420
Yeah, and I'm sure I had something worthwhile.

4310
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:29,700
Who knows.

4311
02:34:29,700 --> 02:34:30,660
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

4312
02:34:31,220 --> 02:34:32,740
Something that's worth revisiting.

4313
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:36,420
Yeah, it was good times.

4314
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:38,340
And, you know, we picked out the other people

4315
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:40,900
that we recognized as not incompetent,

4316
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:42,900
actually with interesting things to say,

4317
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:44,420
and we eventually got together.

4318
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:46,740
And, you know, and I've been just to tell the story again,

4319
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:48,180
because it's fun and I like it.

4320
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:52,420
I think, like, the first time we interacted was when,

4321
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:54,580
like, Ben and I were big fans of All You Guys.

4322
02:34:55,860 --> 02:35:00,180
And specifically, Jesse and Gib were our favorites,

4323
02:35:00,180 --> 02:35:02,100
and we respected you as an authority figure.

4324
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:03,380
And, you know, enjoyed your content,

4325
02:35:03,380 --> 02:35:06,020
but we just liked the personality they showed of,

4326
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:08,900
like, the goofy shit as opposed to, like, the information stuff.

4327
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:10,180
I was never funny.

4328
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:13,860
My videos were, like, really fucking straight forward.

4329
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:15,460
We came to your videos when you were like,

4330
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:17,860
okay, let's get serious about what the fuck this episode's about.

4331
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:21,700
Jesse was the one who was making, like,

4332
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:24,100
like, Jesse's content, it didn't matter

4333
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,460
that it was about My Little Pony.

4334
02:35:25,460 --> 02:35:28,340
It was just, like, these masterful, like, films

4335
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:30,180
that he was putting together, you know?

4336
02:35:30,180 --> 02:35:32,340
So, one day, like, Ben and I,

4337
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,860
the first thing we did was we decided, like,

4338
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:37,860
I came up with this goof, like, let's say, for, like,

4339
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:39,220
President's Day is coming up,

4340
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:43,220
let's pretend it's Valentine's Day in this intro,

4341
02:35:43,220 --> 02:35:45,380
and we'll say we're doing a special love episode

4342
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:46,660
with Digi Broney.

4343
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:49,140
And so, we did this whole gag where you don't show up,

4344
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:51,140
and then at the very end, it's this whole, like,

4345
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:54,020
crazy, like, zooming out weird, high concept thing,

4346
02:35:54,020 --> 02:35:55,940
where, like, the whole episode takes place

4347
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:58,020
constantly zooming out from within the universe,

4348
02:35:58,020 --> 02:36:00,420
deep within Digi Broney's eye,

4349
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:01,540
and then, like, at the end, like,

4350
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:03,140
we've zoomed out all the way and you appear,

4351
02:36:03,140 --> 02:36:04,660
and you go, it stinks,

4352
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:07,620
and then, My Little Pony, the end of the episode.

4353
02:36:07,620 --> 02:36:10,420
God, it was a fucking great bit, it was so good.

4354
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,380
I'm so proud of that one.

4355
02:36:11,380 --> 02:36:13,780
The editing was tight and perfect at that moment.

4356
02:36:15,460 --> 02:36:17,060
So, and, yeah, I don't know, whatever,

4357
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:18,500
like, we, you recognize that point,

4358
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:20,100
and then Give, actually, this was before that,

4359
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:22,740
Give made, like, a thing where he showed us

4360
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:24,740
in, like, his big analysis roundup videos.

4361
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:26,500
He animated us a little, we loved that.

4362
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:28,500
But then, eventually, I don't even know how we,

4363
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:31,060
oh, of course, we did the Q&A, and the Q&A,

4364
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:33,460
and we all, he found out that we loved you guys,

4365
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:35,060
and at some point, there was a conversation

4366
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:36,660
where we all decided to do a horse cast,

4367
02:36:36,740 --> 02:36:38,260
blah, blah, blah, we all got together

4368
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:40,180
and started doing stuff, and became friends,

4369
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:42,580
and just kept doing that shit.

4370
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:44,020
We were rushing through this part

4371
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:47,060
because we've told the story so many fucking times.

4372
02:36:47,060 --> 02:36:47,860
Exactly.

4373
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:50,900
Like, hopefully, this isn't your first

4374
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:54,500
PCP interview or episode, because, like,

4375
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:58,500
we've literally told this fucking story

4376
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:00,580
of how we all met dozens of times.

4377
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:02,020
Certainly dozens of times, yeah.

4378
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:02,820
Yeah.

4379
02:37:02,820 --> 02:37:06,500
And that's showbiz.

4380
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:07,940
How far in are we?

4381
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:11,140
We are two hours, 38 minutes.

4382
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:12,020
38 minutes?

4383
02:37:12,020 --> 02:37:13,220
38.

4384
02:37:13,220 --> 02:37:15,460
Feels like, feels like we've reached the hours.

4385
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:18,020
I'll just keep asking you about shit, I guess.

4386
02:37:20,020 --> 02:37:23,540
Yeah, well, so, so, Teabab, you guys kept doing it for,

4387
02:37:24,660 --> 02:37:25,700
we stuck with it for a while.

4388
02:37:25,700 --> 02:37:27,860
I want to emphasize this as well,

4389
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:33,220
that when season four ended, me and Hippo were done.

4390
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:35,220
Like, or Gibbon at the time.

4391
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:35,940
Mostly, yeah.

4392
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:38,020
I think we did like a couple more here and there.

4393
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:40,020
Gibbon's, like, his final video came out

4394
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:41,780
like a couple months later, I think.

4395
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:41,940
Yeah.

4396
02:37:41,940 --> 02:37:44,980
But after that, yeah, he did like the one about

4397
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:47,380
Klopp or whatever, and one about Diamond Tiarra,

4398
02:37:47,380 --> 02:37:47,540
and that was about it.

4399
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:49,060
He doesn't like, I love that video.

4400
02:37:49,060 --> 02:37:49,700
I think it's great.

4401
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:51,700
I think he just doesn't like the way

4402
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:53,780
like people react to it or something like that.

4403
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,420
Yeah, that's right.

4404
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:55,620
Of course, in a while or something.

4405
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:57,940
But he, he went on for a little while,

4406
02:37:57,940 --> 02:37:59,220
but didn't really go farther.

4407
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:01,380
I quit in, like, after season four,

4408
02:38:01,380 --> 02:38:03,540
I hardlined, stopped covering My Little Pony,

4409
02:38:03,540 --> 02:38:04,740
stopped watching it, never told about it again.

4410
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:06,100
I left the fandom that piece of shit.

4411
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:06,820
I did.

4412
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:07,860
I actually.

4413
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:09,460
How dare you.

4414
02:38:09,460 --> 02:38:11,860
So for those who don't know, this is a huge meme

4415
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:13,700
in the My Little Pony, not even a meme,

4416
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:14,660
something they take seriously.

4417
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,700
Like, it's an offense.

4418
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:17,060
You can commit it a crime.

4419
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:20,020
It's, it's, it's like, you either are in or out.

4420
02:38:20,020 --> 02:38:20,420
There is no like.

4421
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:22,100
You're either an ally or an enemy.

4422
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:25,140
There's no like, waning interest or like,

4423
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:27,220
hey guys, I just want to work on other stuff.

4424
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:29,860
It's like, if you're not still producing

4425
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:32,980
My Little Pony content, then you have left the fandom.

4426
02:38:32,980 --> 02:38:34,340
And that's the phrase they use.

4427
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:36,900
And like, yeah, it's like a huge offense,

4428
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:38,180
like to leave the fandom.

4429
02:38:38,180 --> 02:38:38,740
It's very silly.

4430
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:39,060
It's very silly.

4431
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:43,540
So I left the fandom and Gibbon wasn't really doing much,

4432
02:38:43,540 --> 02:38:47,620
but like, Jesse took a whole fucking year

4433
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:48,980
of putting together Horseshoe Finale.

4434
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:51,060
Like he wasn't done until 2015.

4435
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:53,700
And then you guys came back for season five

4436
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:56,100
and did the whole fucking season in podcast form

4437
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:57,220
just without the animations.

4438
02:38:57,220 --> 02:38:58,980
I was already on the fence.

4439
02:38:58,980 --> 02:39:01,220
Like there was much discussion as to whether or not

4440
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:03,300
to even do it because we had like other ideas.

4441
02:39:03,300 --> 02:39:05,140
And the only reason you did was because the Patreon.

4442
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:06,100
Because we had Patreon.

4443
02:39:06,100 --> 02:39:08,820
It's like, I mean, and Ben was a big driving force

4444
02:39:08,820 --> 02:39:12,900
for that stuff, wanting to do it for the money.

4445
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:14,260
And you know, nothing against him.

4446
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:15,460
I understand, but.

4447
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:18,180
But like season, season four ended.

4448
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:21,060
There was a huge gap between season four and five.

4449
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:23,220
And that's when you guys got out the,

4450
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:25,460
the like big gun videos.

4451
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:26,260
Is that when we did?

4452
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:28,420
Phantom reviews had to open at that time.

4453
02:39:28,420 --> 02:39:28,820
Yeah.

4454
02:39:28,820 --> 02:39:29,380
Yeah, that's right.

4455
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:29,780
That's right.

4456
02:39:30,740 --> 02:39:33,780
Because you know, you guys were working on like huge projects

4457
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:35,860
that were like kind of operating in the background

4458
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:38,900
of the weekly reviews, which again,

4459
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:40,020
come together in like an hour.

4460
02:39:40,020 --> 02:39:42,660
You know, like we, we all were like,

4461
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:46,180
it's funny to think that like we're currently

4462
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:47,380
in this period of like,

4463
02:39:47,380 --> 02:39:50,500
let's get back to making smaller, easier videos

4464
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:52,500
when we all launched our careers by doing videos

4465
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:55,060
that we made in literally a couple hours.

4466
02:39:55,060 --> 02:39:56,500
That's the fascinating thing about it

4467
02:39:56,500 --> 02:39:57,700
that I think about a lot.

4468
02:39:57,700 --> 02:40:01,540
It's, and I'm always, I'm sort of lamenting to myself

4469
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:04,900
the fact that the pony days were perfect for me

4470
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:07,140
in terms of like the time crunch

4471
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:10,740
because having that deadline of get it out

4472
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:12,500
as soon as fucking possible,

4473
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:15,060
you've got to meet this goddamn deadline, be the first.

4474
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:16,660
Having that goal in my framework

4475
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:18,340
of like how we were making videos

4476
02:40:18,340 --> 02:40:20,420
was so helpful for a guy like me

4477
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:22,900
who does have a tendency to get lost in the details

4478
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:24,180
and obsess over little things

4479
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,980
that ultimately just to have diminishing returns.

4480
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:30,100
Having that crunch time was so good

4481
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:30,900
and that's why I describe it

4482
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:33,220
as like the most productive time in my life,

4483
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:34,340
like working on those.

4484
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:36,660
Except for Mia Mafia, that was the best.

4485
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:39,780
Yeah, Mia Mafia unquestionably is like vastly.

4486
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:41,620
I cut down on like,

4487
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:42,740
this is the first time in my life

4488
02:40:42,740 --> 02:40:45,220
I really have cut into my sleep

4489
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:47,300
and my like ability to live,

4490
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:49,700
to make content in a big way.

4491
02:40:49,700 --> 02:40:52,260
And like, we're talking like two hours of sleep a night

4492
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:53,380
and it was hard.

4493
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:56,100
And I fueled myself with coffee and caffeine

4494
02:40:56,100 --> 02:40:58,180
and like, God, I don't know

4495
02:40:58,180 --> 02:40:59,780
what my work guys were thinking of me.

4496
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:03,460
I mean, I did the work, but I don't know.

4497
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:05,780
I don't know, maybe it was okay.

4498
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:06,740
I really don't remember.

4499
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:09,700
Hopefully it was okay and it was a big deal.

4500
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:12,340
I just, I often think about like,

4501
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:14,020
what would my coworkers think

4502
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:16,340
if they, you know, knew all this shit?

4503
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:18,660
And like, I have, I regret it,

4504
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:20,820
but I have told them that like I do this shit

4505
02:41:20,820 --> 02:41:22,740
and I have shared like the channel name

4506
02:41:22,740 --> 02:41:23,700
just because like, what are you gonna do

4507
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:24,740
if they's like, hey, what's your channel?

4508
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:25,460
What are you gonna say?

4509
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:26,740
I don't wanna talk about it.

4510
02:41:26,740 --> 02:41:28,420
You gotta, I know you just gotta pony it up.

4511
02:41:29,060 --> 02:41:30,500
Hey, I love my little pony.

4512
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:34,580
Um, so I wonder if any of them are watching.

4513
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:35,860
What if any of them, like,

4514
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:37,300
I'm walking around in my work, right?

4515
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:39,620
All these guys are working on software development and shit.

4516
02:41:39,620 --> 02:41:43,460
They're thinking about like enterprise level systems

4517
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:45,460
deploying to like various companies,

4518
02:41:45,460 --> 02:41:47,860
like fucking Boeing and Honeywell,

4519
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:50,340
like big defense contractors and shit.

4520
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:52,740
I'm thinking about like, I gotta go home

4521
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:55,300
and work on this like anime review

4522
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:58,660
and like tell, you know, like 17,000 people

4523
02:41:58,660 --> 02:42:01,540
and now like getting close to 40,000 people.

4524
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:03,940
How good fucking Angel's Egg is

4525
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:07,540
and like how fucking God has written like shit.

4526
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:10,340
How great this one obscure boss

4527
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:13,060
in this new Kingdom Hearts spinoff.

4528
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:14,900
That's an important video.

4529
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:16,340
Fucking game is.

4530
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:17,060
I liked that video.

4531
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:17,780
That was good.

4532
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:18,900
That was, that's a message

4533
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:20,820
that I'm really glad I got to get out.

4534
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:23,380
God, thank God for me and Mavva enabling me

4535
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:25,860
to get out all these things that I had bottled up.

4536
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:26,100
Yeah.

4537
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:28,660
Well, that's what I'm so excited about

4538
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:32,100
is that me and Mavva, to me,

4539
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:33,860
the funny thing about it is that to you,

4540
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:36,900
it was put in as little effort as possible.

4541
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:39,940
But what it really represents to me is a middle ground.

4542
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:42,740
That is my, that is my low effort, you know,

4543
02:42:42,740 --> 02:42:43,380
the middle ground.

4544
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:46,340
That's that's as low effort as I can go.

4545
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:47,780
It's yeah, it's a middle ground

4546
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:50,660
because for me, my content has gotten to a point

4547
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:54,100
where it's all either a good enough script

4548
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:58,020
that DeVu can do it or I'm going to do it

4549
02:42:58,020 --> 02:43:00,100
and therefore it's going to be nothing.

4550
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:03,780
You know, like I am not going to do anything with this

4551
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:05,700
except for what is required for it.

4552
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:08,580
It's not that my content is like all exactly the same.

4553
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:11,940
Sometimes something different or interesting happens,

4554
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:14,660
but like me and Mavva kicked it up a little.

4555
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:16,580
Like I look at it and I think,

4556
02:43:16,580 --> 02:43:18,420
okay, this is like what I'm doing,

4557
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:21,220
but if I actually thought about each video

4558
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:23,300
and like what I could basically,

4559
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:25,300
if I thought of it as a video you can make in a day,

4560
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:26,820
instead of a video you can make in an hour,

4561
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:29,620
I was explaining this to you that like to me,

4562
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:32,980
there's the two kinds of videos I make are a written video

4563
02:43:32,980 --> 02:43:36,020
which takes a day or two and then it's out of my hands

4564
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:39,700
or a vlog, which is it has to be done in one sitting,

4565
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:42,260
you know, like one concentrated burst

4566
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:44,100
and I can do four of them in a day.

4567
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:45,620
And me and Mavva to me was like,

4568
02:43:45,700 --> 02:43:47,780
oh, this is what the middle of that would look like,

4569
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:51,380
of like I could spend a few hours on a video.

4570
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:53,460
And I mean, I've done stuff like this before.

4571
02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:55,940
I don't know if you ever saw my handfuls of Zen videos.

4572
02:43:55,940 --> 02:43:57,380
Sure, I've seen those, at least most of them.

4573
02:43:57,380 --> 02:43:59,860
That's like very similar mindset to me and Mavva,

4574
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:01,460
which is like it's unscripted.

4575
02:44:01,460 --> 02:44:02,820
The people want more of those, you know.

4576
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:04,420
I want to make more of those.

4577
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:07,700
And like it's that combination of like unscripted,

4578
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:08,900
but there's lots of notes

4579
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:10,660
and there's a level of editing to it

4580
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:12,420
and there's like prep work to be done.

4581
02:44:12,420 --> 02:44:15,140
It can be done in a day, but it's, you know,

4582
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:18,100
it's not something that's just fucking,

4583
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:20,980
I turned on a camera and then uploaded it, you know.

4584
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:22,740
And like what was so exciting

4585
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:24,340
to me watching me and Mavva was like,

4586
02:44:25,220 --> 02:44:29,380
if, like all I could think was if you put out just,

4587
02:44:30,740 --> 02:44:33,060
I mean, even four of these a month,

4588
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:37,140
like if you put the level of effort that it took

4589
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:40,660
to make three me and Mavvas into one video

4590
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:42,100
and released it once a week,

4591
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:44,660
this is the greatest channel of all time, you know.

4592
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:47,460
Like one video a week at the level

4593
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:49,060
of three me and Mavvas of effort.

4594
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:53,300
And you can do seven me and Mavvas of effort in a week

4595
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:55,540
if you had to, but you're not going to time crunch yourself

4596
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:56,900
like that for the rest of your life.

4597
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:59,140
But if you left your job,

4598
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:02,260
you could put seven me and Mavvas of effort in a day.

4599
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:04,340
That's why it's really not a joke.

4600
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:07,940
Like what a big difference me leaving my job will really make.

4601
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:10,980
This is not a meme to trick people to get money out of you.

4602
02:45:10,980 --> 02:45:13,780
It really will be a world changing thing for my channel.

4603
02:45:13,860 --> 02:45:16,260
And if you care about getting more content faster,

4604
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:17,700
that's the thing to do.

4605
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:21,060
Like I hope people like really sit back.

4606
02:45:21,060 --> 02:45:22,740
I know it's harder for the audience

4607
02:45:22,740 --> 02:45:23,860
because they don't make videos.

4608
02:45:23,860 --> 02:45:26,100
So like fully process the difference here.

4609
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:31,780
But like Nate spent those two months that you worked on

4610
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:33,620
like the loose from the biscuit hammer video.

4611
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:35,860
Like I won't say you were working

4612
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:37,780
as much as you did during me and Mavva,

4613
02:45:37,780 --> 02:45:40,260
but like that was consistent work.

4614
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:42,260
Every night I worked every day.

4615
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:45,300
Like my evenings were editing for two months.

4616
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:46,180
That's what they were.

4617
02:45:46,180 --> 02:45:46,900
Yeah.

4618
02:45:46,900 --> 02:45:50,100
And that video was overdone.

4619
02:45:50,100 --> 02:45:51,860
You shouldn't have spit that log on it.

4620
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:52,420
Agreed.

4621
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:53,860
But like imagine-

4622
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:55,300
You can see the work that's in it though.

4623
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:56,260
You can see it.

4624
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:59,380
Imagine though if you could have done that

4625
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:00,980
with if you didn't have a day job,

4626
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:02,340
you could have done it in two weeks.

4627
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:06,580
And with me and Mavva, those 30 videos,

4628
02:46:07,620 --> 02:46:11,220
you could have done, if you didn't have a day job

4629
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:13,940
and you had done me and Mavva exactly the same way,

4630
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:17,540
you literally could have done two months.

4631
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:21,060
Like you could have just cut out the time you spent at work

4632
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:23,620
and done another me and Mavva in that time.

4633
02:46:23,620 --> 02:46:25,140
It could have been two videos a day

4634
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:28,020
and that could have been two months worth of content.

4635
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:31,060
If you guys want to see best guy ever stockpile,

4636
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:34,660
like you know, I mean what you,

4637
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:37,780
let's say you didn't have to work for two months

4638
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:42,180
and you decided to do me and Mavva level videos all day every day,

4639
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:44,580
you're going to end up with like a year,

4640
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:47,380
and let's say you stagger the releases for once a week.

4641
02:46:47,380 --> 02:46:49,460
You've got a year of videos in two months.

4642
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:50,820
You know, I hear you on that,

4643
02:46:50,820 --> 02:46:53,700
but you know one thing that people don't really talk about as much

4644
02:46:53,700 --> 02:46:56,740
that I think a lot about when it comes to me and Mavva

4645
02:46:56,740 --> 02:47:00,740
is how I really went out of my way to make it an event,

4646
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:02,420
to make it a spectacle.

4647
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:04,260
That's my Huey's Law in action right there.

4648
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:05,140
Which is great.

4649
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:06,980
Yeah, like it's got its own theme song,

4650
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:09,380
it's got its own logo, it's got merchandise.

4651
02:47:09,380 --> 02:47:11,700
And only you could deliver on that

4652
02:47:11,700 --> 02:47:16,980
because I fall into this trap that I've talked about continuously.

4653
02:47:16,980 --> 02:47:19,060
And it's a real psychological principle that

4654
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:21,380
if you talk about something you're planning to do,

4655
02:47:21,380 --> 02:47:22,340
you're less likely to do it

4656
02:47:22,340 --> 02:47:24,180
because it gives you the vindication of like,

4657
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:26,580
you know, just describing it makes it,

4658
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:27,860
you feel like you did it.

4659
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:30,660
And you don't fall into that.

4660
02:47:31,220 --> 02:47:33,380
You talk about stuff years in advance.

4661
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:34,580
Yeah, that's true.

4662
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:38,660
Like, I mean, I've known about your Ghost in the Shell video

4663
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:39,540
for two fucking years.

4664
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:41,780
I announced it two years ago, but yeah, yeah.

4665
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:42,500
Like, I mean-

4666
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:44,580
I did not give up on it at all at that point.

4667
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:49,780
Yeah, like, there's just this, somehow you are just

4668
02:47:49,780 --> 02:47:51,380
disciplined in a way that you could,

4669
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:54,020
if I had announced me a Mavva, I wouldn't have done it.

4670
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:54,340
Yeah.

4671
02:47:54,340 --> 02:47:56,740
You know, and I, as you may know,

4672
02:47:56,740 --> 02:48:00,980
I did a whole month of a video every day, October 2014,

4673
02:48:00,980 --> 02:48:03,380
and I never mentioned what I was doing

4674
02:48:03,380 --> 02:48:05,380
until like the last video.

4675
02:48:05,940 --> 02:48:06,260
Really?

4676
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:08,340
Like, or towards the end,

4677
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:10,660
I did a video on the first three episodes of Shirobako,

4678
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:13,940
and I said like, oh, somebody who's been doing this deliberate

4679
02:48:13,940 --> 02:48:16,820
one video a day, all month, and here's the fucked up part.

4680
02:48:16,820 --> 02:48:18,660
No one noticed I was doing it.

4681
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:23,860
Not one commenter ever mentioned that I done a video every day,

4682
02:48:23,860 --> 02:48:24,260
all month.

4683
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:26,980
Between yours and mine, that difference right there.

4684
02:48:26,980 --> 02:48:28,980
Just because mine were of such like,

4685
02:48:28,980 --> 02:48:32,340
my audience was like weird and in this transitional phase

4686
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:33,380
into anime.

4687
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:36,100
So like, some of the videos would be like,

4688
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:37,620
the biggest video I've ever made,

4689
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:38,820
and then another one would have like,

4690
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:41,540
1,000 views, you know?

4691
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:43,620
So like, people just weren't seeing all of them.

4692
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:47,060
Was this because you were afraid that you might not be,

4693
02:48:47,060 --> 02:48:48,340
you know, miss a deadline or something?

4694
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:51,300
It was 100% that I was afraid if I talked about it,

4695
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:52,020
I wouldn't finish it.

4696
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:52,580
That's okay.

4697
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:54,020
Because that had proven true every time

4698
02:48:54,020 --> 02:48:55,140
I've ever talked about a project.

4699
02:48:55,140 --> 02:48:57,140
I mean, because I'm with you on that,

4700
02:48:57,860 --> 02:49:02,100
but to focus on me, because my problems matter more than yours,

4701
02:49:02,180 --> 02:49:03,220
this is your interview.

4702
02:49:03,220 --> 02:49:03,700
That's right.

4703
02:49:05,220 --> 02:49:07,140
Like my, the fear I had,

4704
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:08,660
which was definitely a fear,

4705
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:10,180
and of course it's inevitable with this,

4706
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:11,460
is that I would fail.

4707
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:12,260
Is that I would mess up.

4708
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:14,740
I actually had some other ideas in mind beforehand

4709
02:49:14,740 --> 02:49:17,060
that I floated around with a couple of people,

4710
02:49:17,060 --> 02:49:18,100
just seeing what time.

4711
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:20,180
I think this is why you can do it and I can't,

4712
02:49:20,180 --> 02:49:23,140
is because you're way more afraid of failure than I am.

4713
02:49:23,140 --> 02:49:23,380
That's true.

4714
02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:25,780
Because what actually would have been the consequence

4715
02:49:25,780 --> 02:49:27,220
of me and Matt have a failing?

4716
02:49:27,220 --> 02:49:28,420
Me being embarrassed.

4717
02:49:28,420 --> 02:49:29,060
Exactly, that's it.

4718
02:49:29,060 --> 02:49:29,700
That's it.

4719
02:49:29,700 --> 02:49:31,300
Like, your audience would have been like,

4720
02:49:31,780 --> 02:49:33,140
well, he couldn't do it.

4721
02:49:33,140 --> 02:49:34,420
What a, what an asshole.

4722
02:49:34,420 --> 02:49:36,660
You know, like you would have felt like dumb

4723
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:38,900
for a couple of days, maybe a couple of weeks.

4724
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:41,220
I don't care about that.

4725
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:44,260
Like I fuck up so frequently that it doesn't matter.

4726
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:47,300
Like I've got a character as somebody who like,

4727
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:49,860
you know, like my audience literally doesn't expect

4728
02:49:49,860 --> 02:49:51,700
me to finish anything that I start,

4729
02:49:51,700 --> 02:49:54,180
because I've started so many shows that just die.

4730
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:58,740
But like for you, like just the sheer level of like,

4731
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,580
I can't fail at this.

4732
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:01,620
Yeah, that's true.

4733
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:02,900
Carried it all the way through.

4734
02:50:03,460 --> 02:50:04,100
Yep.

4735
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:04,900
And that's a good thing.

4736
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:06,660
I think it's a healthy mindset to have.

4737
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:09,460
If you're proud of the product and you know.

4738
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:10,340
And I always am.

4739
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:13,780
Yeah.

4740
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:15,460
You look very tired.

4741
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:17,940
Um, I am somewhat tired.

4742
02:50:18,580 --> 02:50:19,940
We're almost at three hours.

4743
02:50:19,940 --> 02:50:20,180
Yeah.

4744
02:50:20,180 --> 02:50:21,540
We can crank out a little more.

4745
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:24,900
Some of them are like a few minutes short of three hours.

4746
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:26,420
It doesn't have to be exact.

4747
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:28,580
I want three hours, god damn it.

4748
02:50:28,580 --> 02:50:31,140
Let's talk about, um.

4749
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:35,220
I'm wondering if, if somebody finally interviews me

4750
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:36,500
in this series, like,

4751
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:38,980
or is it going to be three hours?

4752
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:41,620
Or am I going to, because there's like a thing.

4753
02:50:41,620 --> 02:50:43,700
Yours will be like everyone's to combine.

4754
02:50:43,700 --> 02:50:46,260
We're talking like a 25 hour interview here.

4755
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:49,460
That'd be fucking epic.

4756
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:50,500
It would be epic.

4757
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:52,260
Well, it really depends on who's interviewing me

4758
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:53,540
and how long are they willing to go.

4759
02:50:54,100 --> 02:50:55,940
Maybe we could, you know, I was wondering about that.

4760
02:50:55,940 --> 02:50:56,820
Maybe we could split it up.

4761
02:50:56,820 --> 02:50:58,260
Everyone does a piece, you know.

4762
02:50:58,260 --> 02:50:59,620
Oh, that'd be interesting, right?

4763
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:01,940
Could all come with our questions.

4764
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:04,660
I feel like nobody's curious enough about me

4765
02:51:04,660 --> 02:51:05,860
to want to do an interview.

4766
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:06,820
We know everything.

4767
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:07,220
Yeah.

4768
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:08,660
There's nothing left.

4769
02:51:08,660 --> 02:51:10,100
We'll have to come up with something.

4770
02:51:10,100 --> 02:51:10,580
Yeah.

4771
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:15,700
Um, what, um, what's your favorite anime?

4772
02:51:15,700 --> 02:51:16,740
Why are you asking me?

4773
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:17,860
What's your favorite anime?

4774
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:19,060
I'm filling time, Digi.

4775
02:51:20,660 --> 02:51:21,860
You wanted to go through.

4776
02:51:21,860 --> 02:51:23,220
I, we're almost there.

4777
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:23,780
We can do it.

4778
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:26,420
I know your favorite anime has grown the gun.

4779
02:51:26,420 --> 02:51:27,700
Your favorite bomb is one piece.

4780
02:51:27,700 --> 02:51:28,340
Yeah.

4781
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:31,540
Um, your favorite movie is American Beauty.

4782
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:32,260
That's true.

4783
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:32,900
That's true.

4784
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:33,940
You want to say anything?

4785
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:34,580
I'd be happy to.

4786
02:51:34,580 --> 02:51:36,740
And, uh, I think if anybody's seen American Beauty,

4787
02:51:36,740 --> 02:51:38,740
you, you understand very much why.

4788
02:51:38,740 --> 02:51:44,420
Um, it is a movie about casting off the shackles

4789
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:48,900
of societal expectations and like embracing your dreams

4790
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:49,860
is really what it's about.

4791
02:51:49,860 --> 02:51:53,220
And every character in the movie does that to an extent,

4792
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:54,980
or like in their own way.

4793
02:51:54,980 --> 02:51:57,300
For example, I'm going to spoil this movie, by the way.

4794
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,140
So if you give a shit, uh,

4795
02:51:59,140 --> 02:52:00,340
I'd highly recommend watching it.

4796
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:01,780
So, you know, do whatever you want.

4797
02:52:01,780 --> 02:52:03,540
But so the main character, Kevin Spacey,

4798
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:10,020
he wants to fuck his teenage daughter's hot ass, uh,

4799
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:11,940
like girlfriend, like her, her buddy.

4800
02:52:11,940 --> 02:52:13,860
And she's like a captain of the cheerleading squad.

4801
02:52:13,860 --> 02:52:16,340
She's like a model, uh, Mena Savari,

4802
02:52:16,340 --> 02:52:17,460
whatever, some famous actress.

4803
02:52:17,460 --> 02:52:18,820
Like he wants to fuck this girl.

4804
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:22,420
And she's 17, 18, something along those lines.

4805
02:52:22,420 --> 02:52:24,100
So she's pretty darn young.

4806
02:52:24,660 --> 02:52:27,540
And like he sets up his whole life, uh,

4807
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:28,580
where he, he did like,

4808
02:52:28,580 --> 02:52:30,740
so he worked this like shitty corporate job

4809
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:32,420
and, uh, he fucking hated it.

4810
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:34,740
It's actually very similar to Fight Club in a lot of ways.

4811
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:37,620
Like he just says, fuck it one day, I'm done.

4812
02:52:37,620 --> 02:52:39,460
And I, you know, it's slipping my mind right now

4813
02:52:39,460 --> 02:52:40,980
because it's been a little while since I've seen the show.

4814
02:52:41,780 --> 02:52:43,380
Why exactly he does it?

4815
02:52:43,380 --> 02:52:44,340
I have to think about that.

4816
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:46,100
Oh, I remember it's because he meets a new neighbor,

4817
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:47,380
a new neighbor, neighbor moves to town,

4818
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:49,140
like the weird kid who gives him some weed

4819
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:50,900
and he gets high and he just has some revelations.

4820
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:52,740
You know what, fuck this shit, I'm done.

4821
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:56,660
He quits his goddamn job, um, in a, in a brilliant way.

4822
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:59,140
Like he literally says, like to his boss,

4823
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:01,060
like as they're doing like corporate restructuring,

4824
02:53:01,060 --> 02:53:04,180
look, if you, I'm going to, uh, quit now.

4825
02:53:04,980 --> 02:53:09,780
Um, and if I'm going to say that you asked me,

4826
02:53:09,780 --> 02:53:13,860
if you could blow me and sexually harass me, uh,

4827
02:53:13,860 --> 02:53:17,060
if you don't give me like a huge severance package.

4828
02:53:17,060 --> 02:53:18,180
And, uh, oh, by the way,

4829
02:53:18,180 --> 02:53:20,500
the movie starts with him just saying like as an announcer,

4830
02:53:20,500 --> 02:53:22,020
I'm going to be dead in one year.

4831
02:53:22,020 --> 02:53:23,300
So know that going in.

4832
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:24,180
That's just how it starts.

4833
02:53:24,980 --> 02:53:25,540
So he does this.

4834
02:53:25,540 --> 02:53:26,820
Oh, and he also has like some information

4835
02:53:26,820 --> 02:53:29,060
about like shady business dealings the company's been doing.

4836
02:53:29,060 --> 02:53:30,740
Anyway, he, he finally like mans up

4837
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:32,980
and uses his leverage to fuck over this company.

4838
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:34,660
That's been screwing him and not treating him

4839
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:36,820
like the way that he deserves to be treated.

4840
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:39,860
And, um, he just, he pieces and he leaves.

4841
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:41,700
And like now he's got like this money

4842
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:43,140
where he can just live on for like a while.

4843
02:53:43,140 --> 02:53:44,660
He's got like a year's salary,

4844
02:53:44,660 --> 02:53:46,100
which lines up perfectly with like the time

4845
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:47,220
he's going to die at the end.

4846
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:49,780
And he immediately goes and gets a shitty job

4847
02:53:49,860 --> 02:53:51,940
at a burger joint just to get another job.

4848
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:53,940
So he's like, I want to do something in my life.

4849
02:53:53,940 --> 02:53:55,780
And so he starts working there

4850
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:58,900
because he wants a job with zero responsibility anymore.

4851
02:53:58,900 --> 02:54:01,060
Like this guy is just unburdening himself.

4852
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:02,980
That's what he's, he's unburdening himself

4853
02:54:02,980 --> 02:54:05,380
with the shackles of like, of, of his job.

4854
02:54:05,380 --> 02:54:07,140
And like then his family is another huge thing.

4855
02:54:07,140 --> 02:54:08,740
So he's got his wife, Carolyn,

4856
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:11,220
and his daughter, June, Judy, whatever.

4857
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:18,260
And his wife is a frigid bitch, uh, who is like just not,

4858
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:20,260
I don't know, they don't vibe, you know,

4859
02:54:20,260 --> 02:54:21,860
they've grown apart over the years.

4860
02:54:21,860 --> 02:54:23,780
They used to be really into each other.

4861
02:54:23,780 --> 02:54:26,660
But like, so, so he starts like exercising, right?

4862
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:27,540
He starts working out.

4863
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:30,980
And over the course of the year, he gets fucking fit.

4864
02:54:30,980 --> 02:54:33,780
He gets swole to an extent as much as you can get in a year.

4865
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:36,820
And it's just, it's just about the self-improvement shit, right?

4866
02:54:36,820 --> 02:54:38,500
Like he, like something happens to this guy,

4867
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:40,340
he has an awakening and he's like, you know what,

4868
02:54:40,340 --> 02:54:41,780
fuck this, I'm going to take charge of my life

4869
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:43,540
and actually go for the things I want.

4870
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:45,460
So I think you can tell why something like that

4871
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:46,260
would appeal to me.

4872
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:48,340
But it's not just about that guy,

4873
02:54:48,340 --> 02:54:50,420
because all the other characters do it too.

4874
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:54,020
Like, uh, Carolyn, his wife, she starts cheating on him.

4875
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:55,620
She starts having an affair.

4876
02:54:55,620 --> 02:54:59,220
But she is like so happy and empowered by it,

4877
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:01,060
that like it's, it's not good to cheat on people.

4878
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:02,500
But what she's realizing is like,

4879
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:05,060
I have been unhappy in this situation I'm in.

4880
02:55:05,620 --> 02:55:06,580
I need to do something.

4881
02:55:06,580 --> 02:55:07,460
I need to like change.

4882
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:08,180
This has got to end.

4883
02:55:08,180 --> 02:55:09,220
This is no good.

4884
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:11,300
And so she has her own little development arc,

4885
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:12,180
related around that.

4886
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:14,900
And the daughter, Judy, I believe it's Judy,

4887
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:16,500
like, you know, she's best friends with this girl

4888
02:55:16,500 --> 02:55:18,580
that like her father lusts after.

4889
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:20,900
And she feels like so self-conscious

4890
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:22,900
and like thinks she's ugly and all this shit.

4891
02:55:22,900 --> 02:55:25,780
And this new neighbor kid moves to town and um,

4892
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:29,220
he uh, uh, uh, like he introduces her.

4893
02:55:29,220 --> 02:55:31,380
He like makes her believe that she's beautiful

4894
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:34,020
and like makes her feel happy for the first time in her life.

4895
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:36,740
And they fall in love and they, you know, do the do.

4896
02:55:37,380 --> 02:55:38,580
And it's totally hot.

4897
02:55:39,220 --> 02:55:40,580
She totally shows her tits.

4898
02:55:41,380 --> 02:55:43,460
Nate just mimed to be like finger-druful.

4899
02:55:43,540 --> 02:55:45,380
I did the finger, I did the hole in your finger

4900
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:47,140
and put your other finger through the hole.

4901
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:48,260
Yeah, they did the sex.

4902
02:55:48,260 --> 02:55:48,820
It was sick.

4903
02:55:50,820 --> 02:55:53,620
And uh, it's, it's about, you know,

4904
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:54,580
it's about all that shit.

4905
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:57,220
It's about like just saying fuck it

4906
02:55:57,220 --> 02:55:59,140
and doing what you really want to do with your life

4907
02:55:59,140 --> 02:56:01,540
and not giving a fuck what anybody thinks anymore.

4908
02:56:01,540 --> 02:56:02,580
That's what it's really about.

4909
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:05,060
I can't remember if I talked about this

4910
02:56:05,060 --> 02:56:06,740
in Ben's interview or where I did,

4911
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:10,020
but like that I'm endlessly fascinated by the fact

4912
02:56:10,020 --> 02:56:12,100
that your favorite movie is American Beauty

4913
02:56:12,100 --> 02:56:13,700
and his is American Psycho.

4914
02:56:14,260 --> 02:56:15,540
That's one of my favorites,

4915
02:56:15,540 --> 02:56:16,980
but that is interesting, isn't it?

4916
02:56:16,980 --> 02:56:18,020
That they're both like,

4917
02:56:18,020 --> 02:56:19,620
not just that the titles are the same,

4918
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:21,460
but like just the idea,

4919
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:25,220
like one is all about like this vision of self-betterment

4920
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:26,740
and like becoming the perfect you.

4921
02:56:26,740 --> 02:56:29,380
And the other one is about like this underlying

4922
02:56:29,380 --> 02:56:32,180
insane neurosis behind everybody.

4923
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:33,860
And I just feel like it matches up

4924
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:35,140
with both of you perfectly.

4925
02:56:35,140 --> 02:56:36,020
Isn't that interesting?

4926
02:56:36,020 --> 02:56:39,380
You guys are, you and Ben to me have always been like,

4927
02:56:39,380 --> 02:56:41,700
like mirror reflections of the same person.

4928
02:56:42,180 --> 02:56:43,300
Like a nega version.

4929
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:46,660
One of you is the nega version of the other.

4930
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:47,460
I don't know which.

4931
02:56:47,460 --> 02:56:50,180
Because Ben and I talk and I've come to understand

4932
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:52,260
through a lot of the PCP conversations,

4933
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:55,220
I have this extremely optimistic view about people.

4934
02:56:55,780 --> 02:56:58,260
I really think that humanity can like evolve

4935
02:56:58,260 --> 02:56:59,380
and develop and change.

4936
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:02,740
There is a future for us if we work hard at it

4937
02:57:02,740 --> 02:57:04,100
and strive to achieve it.

4938
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:06,020
Ben is extremely not like that.

4939
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:07,780
He's like, no, people are fucked.

4940
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:08,740
Why are we wasting our time?

4941
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:12,180
And it's weird because that seems like

4942
02:57:12,180 --> 02:57:13,940
such a fundamental difference.

4943
02:57:13,940 --> 02:57:19,780
But like aside from like the basic mindset you two have,

4944
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:23,940
like the actual like person is extremely similar.

4945
02:57:23,940 --> 02:57:24,260
Yeah.

4946
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:27,700
Like the ways you talk and think and act are very similar.

4947
02:57:27,700 --> 02:57:30,980
But then like the mentality is totally different

4948
02:57:30,980 --> 02:57:32,420
and like almost opposed.

4949
02:57:32,420 --> 02:57:34,020
Maybe it goes to show that like,

4950
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:35,620
because Ben and I, you know, we grew up together,

4951
02:57:35,620 --> 02:57:37,860
exposed to all the same shit for the most part,

4952
02:57:37,860 --> 02:57:39,860
that like that kind of that part of your brain,

4953
02:57:39,860 --> 02:57:42,980
like your your fundamental like psychological

4954
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:44,980
and not psychological philosophical approach

4955
02:57:44,980 --> 02:57:46,260
to like the way you live.

4956
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:49,540
Maybe it's less impactful on your personality

4957
02:57:49,540 --> 02:57:50,900
than we would assume.

4958
02:57:50,900 --> 02:57:53,380
You know, maybe we are a little more divided

4959
02:57:53,380 --> 02:57:54,900
in our brains than we think.

4960
02:57:54,900 --> 02:57:58,340
Yeah, maybe it's maybe maybe you have the same left brain

4961
02:57:58,340 --> 02:58:00,420
but totally different right brains or whatever the fuck.

4962
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:04,660
Yeah, maybe that's nobody fucking science me on that.

4963
02:58:05,620 --> 02:58:08,180
Just spitballing philosophical questions.

4964
02:58:08,180 --> 02:58:10,820
And by the way, I just wanted to say that at the end

4965
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:15,460
of American Beauty, what is the best thing about that movie

4966
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:20,740
is that the way it ends is wonderful.

4967
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:23,620
It ends with, so you know, at the beginning of the movie,

4968
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:25,620
Kevin Spacey says like, I'm going to be dead in a year.

4969
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:27,460
Here's like the story of that year.

4970
02:58:27,460 --> 02:58:28,740
So all these crazy things happen,

4971
02:58:28,740 --> 02:58:30,420
like everybody changes their life,

4972
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:32,580
all this crazy improvements are happening.

4973
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:35,460
And Kevin Spacey at the end,

4974
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:38,820
through some shenanigans that are just too complex to go into,

4975
02:58:38,820 --> 02:58:41,460
he ends up getting murdered by his next door neighbor.

4976
02:58:41,460 --> 02:58:43,700
Okay, well, his next door neighbor is like the father

4977
02:58:43,700 --> 02:58:46,260
of the new kid who's like, who's changing everybody's life.

4978
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:49,380
That guy is like a military dad, but he's actually gay.

4979
02:58:49,380 --> 02:58:51,300
And he's been repressing it like his entire life.

4980
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:53,380
And over the course of the movie, you find out that like,

4981
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:54,740
oh, wow, this guy's actually gay.

4982
02:58:54,740 --> 02:58:57,380
And like on this last night, he just,

4983
02:58:57,380 --> 02:58:58,580
he's like feeling really vulnerable

4984
02:58:58,580 --> 02:59:00,100
because his son is going to run away with the daughter

4985
02:59:00,100 --> 02:59:01,460
like they've had this gigantic fight.

4986
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:06,020
So he just walks over to his neighbor.

4987
02:59:06,020 --> 02:59:07,700
Like he ends up at Kevin Spacey's garage

4988
02:59:07,700 --> 02:59:09,220
and he's just like, it's raining.

4989
02:59:09,220 --> 02:59:10,900
And he's like, what the fuck's happening?

4990
02:59:10,900 --> 02:59:12,340
And Kevin Spacey is just like, hey, come in.

4991
02:59:12,340 --> 02:59:13,220
No, it's okay, man.

4992
02:59:13,220 --> 02:59:14,580
What's, I'll take care of you.

4993
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:15,620
What's going on with your life?

4994
02:59:15,620 --> 02:59:17,300
And they, like he ends up kissing him.

4995
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:19,220
And so like it's that, it's at that moment

4996
02:59:19,220 --> 02:59:22,020
that the colonel or whatever realizes like,

4997
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:24,900
someone knows, someone knows my fucking secret now.

4998
02:59:24,900 --> 02:59:26,900
And long story short, like, so he comes over,

4999
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:28,900
he kills Kevin Spacey,

5000
02:59:28,900 --> 02:59:30,740
just shoots him in the back of the head from behind.

5001
02:59:30,820 --> 02:59:32,820
But, and what's cool about it is like,

5002
02:59:32,820 --> 02:59:34,020
all of these characters are set up

5003
02:59:34,020 --> 02:59:36,340
like they could be the one who killed Kevin Spacey.

5004
02:59:36,340 --> 02:59:38,180
Like his daughter kind of has a reason to do it

5005
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:39,220
because like she's going to run away

5006
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:40,980
and like he might try to stop her.

5007
02:59:40,980 --> 02:59:43,780
And the wife actually has a gun and is headed home

5008
02:59:43,780 --> 02:59:45,300
because like she's fed up with like,

5009
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:46,340
the stuff that he's been doing

5010
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:47,860
to like get back at her for cheating on him

5011
02:59:47,860 --> 02:59:48,980
with that other guy.

5012
02:59:48,980 --> 02:59:51,780
So he gets killed by the next or neighbor guy.

5013
02:59:51,780 --> 02:59:54,020
And, but like it's the way that he dies.

5014
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:56,580
And the film, you know, really focuses on this.

5015
02:59:56,580 --> 02:59:58,740
Like he's looking at like a picture of his family,

5016
02:59:58,740 --> 03:00:00,260
specifically I think of his little daughter

5017
03:00:00,260 --> 03:00:01,780
when she was a little girl.

5018
03:00:01,780 --> 03:00:04,420
And he's just like so overjoyed

5019
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:06,100
that he was able to experience

5020
03:00:06,100 --> 03:00:09,140
like the life of his daughter

5021
03:00:09,140 --> 03:00:11,300
and like his wife when they were in love.

5022
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:13,700
And like he gets shot and he's dying.

5023
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:15,780
And like the characters like they come in,

5024
03:00:15,780 --> 03:00:18,340
they see him dead, but they look at him and he's smiling.

5025
03:00:18,340 --> 03:00:20,020
He's smiling and there's this speech at the end

5026
03:00:20,020 --> 03:00:21,380
of how like when you're dying,

5027
03:00:22,020 --> 03:00:24,180
it's not like the lights got instantly.

5028
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:26,020
It's that all the experiences of your life

5029
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:28,100
like stretch out like a vast ocean

5030
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:29,300
and you just witness them

5031
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:30,340
as they're passing you by.

5032
03:00:30,340 --> 03:00:32,340
And it goes on to an infinite degree.

5033
03:00:32,340 --> 03:00:34,580
So it's almost like you never actually die.

5034
03:00:34,580 --> 03:00:36,740
It's just like your existence continues forever.

5035
03:00:36,740 --> 03:00:39,140
And like the takeaway from that is just like,

5036
03:00:40,260 --> 03:00:42,900
that's the value that life has.

5037
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:44,900
And don't waste it on bullshit

5038
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:46,500
that you don't give a fuck about.

5039
03:00:46,500 --> 03:00:48,500
You know, do things that are meaningful to you

5040
03:00:48,500 --> 03:00:50,580
and you find value in and bring you joy

5041
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:53,540
and legitimate satisfaction.

5042
03:00:53,540 --> 03:00:56,420
And you know, as a guy who lived

5043
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:59,060
like a little faggot bitch for a long time in his life

5044
03:00:59,060 --> 03:01:00,660
and then something changed

5045
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:02,420
and I decided to do things differently.

5046
03:01:02,980 --> 03:01:04,900
You know, things like that.

5047
03:01:04,900 --> 03:01:06,660
Guys like Kamina who just do whatever

5048
03:01:06,660 --> 03:01:07,540
the fuck they want to do

5049
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:10,340
and don't give a shit about the consequences.

5050
03:01:10,340 --> 03:01:14,580
Even though I'm not that guy, I really want to be

5051
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:16,340
and I work to be more like that.

5052
03:01:17,540 --> 03:01:18,500
There you go. That's me.

5053
03:01:19,220 --> 03:01:19,700
Sick.

5054
03:01:19,700 --> 03:01:20,580
It's the best guy ever.

5055
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:21,860
Gains, bruh.

5056
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:22,900
Are we at three hours yet?

5057
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:23,860
We're past three hours.

5058
03:01:23,860 --> 03:01:25,220
We're at 302.

5059
03:01:25,220 --> 03:01:25,940
We did it.

5060
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:26,500
We did it.

5061
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:28,580
Yay!

5062
03:01:28,580 --> 03:01:30,660
A full analysis of American beauty

5063
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:31,860
took us over to the other part.

5064
03:01:31,860 --> 03:01:32,580
Yes, it did.

5065
03:01:33,540 --> 03:01:36,340
Literally, you could probably repackage that

5066
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:37,460
as a behemoth of a problem.

5067
03:01:37,460 --> 03:01:38,100
Maybe I will.

5068
03:01:38,100 --> 03:01:38,660
Maybe I will.

5069
03:01:40,580 --> 03:01:41,780
A geomath of a...

5070
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:42,660
G or something, yeah.

5071
03:01:43,220 --> 03:01:43,700
All right, well.

5072
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:45,140
A geomath of a...

5073
03:01:45,140 --> 03:01:47,700
God may wilt fucking end.

5074
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:52,500
I was thinking with a J, but that worked out.

5075
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:54,100
Someone had pointed out in the comments

5076
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:58,580
on the Aromanga video that we did last night,

5077
03:01:58,580 --> 03:02:01,220
that it's literally the night after BMF,

5078
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:02,820
so it basically isn't even over.

5079
03:02:02,820 --> 03:02:04,660
I know that, like I said in the last video,

5080
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:07,540
like, yo, I probably won't even take a day off,

5081
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:08,420
and so I didn't.

5082
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:12,020
Or maybe that was actually a day later, but whatever.

5083
03:02:12,020 --> 03:02:12,580
Nor have you.

5084
03:02:12,580 --> 03:02:13,380
This is also...

5085
03:02:13,380 --> 03:02:14,180
Yeah, here we are again.

5086
03:02:14,180 --> 03:02:15,460
See, I'm not quitting people.

5087
03:02:15,460 --> 03:02:16,500
I'm a real deal.

5088
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:17,140
I'm committed.

5089
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:17,540
Neither.

5090
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:18,580
We're not capable.

5091
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:20,660
This is why you should be supporting

5092
03:02:20,660 --> 03:02:21,860
both of us on Patreon.

5093
03:02:21,860 --> 03:02:22,340
Right.

5094
03:02:22,340 --> 03:02:24,500
We are human content machines.

5095
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:26,660
We don't have other purposes in this world.

5096
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:27,060
That's exactly correct.

5097
03:02:27,060 --> 03:02:28,740
This is the only thing we know how to do.

5098
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:31,780
I have eliminated all other distractions in my life,

5099
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:34,180
deliberately, so that I can focus on doing the thing

5100
03:02:34,180 --> 03:02:37,540
that I have found brings me my satisfaction and my joy,

5101
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:40,660
just like Mr. Kevin Spacey would want from American Beauty.

5102
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:43,460
Yeah, and if you like listening to me and Nate

5103
03:02:43,460 --> 03:02:45,860
talk on these bullshit podcasts,

5104
03:02:45,860 --> 03:02:47,540
get Nate's Patreon up to a point

5105
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:49,540
where he feels comfortable moving out,

5106
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:54,100
maybe he and I will more successfully than I did

5107
03:02:54,100 --> 03:02:55,140
with Ben and Davoo.

5108
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:58,260
Not that I had ever really planned those two

5109
03:02:58,260 --> 03:03:00,980
to be like my guys that I was going to do stuff with,

5110
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:02,740
but me and you have a lot of ideas

5111
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:04,580
of what we could do if we lived close together.

5112
03:03:04,580 --> 03:03:04,900
We sure do.

5113
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:09,060
So move Nate and I nearer.

5114
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:11,060
Yes, nearer, nearer.

5115
03:03:11,060 --> 03:03:12,020
Not in the same house.

5116
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:13,860
And you know what, I'm done with that life.

5117
03:03:13,860 --> 03:03:17,540
Yeah, Ben is a lazy piece of shit,

5118
03:03:18,500 --> 03:03:23,220
but you know, I might be willing to indulge him

5119
03:03:23,220 --> 03:03:26,260
and just move to wherever he is to get him involved.

5120
03:03:26,260 --> 03:03:29,460
Atlanta's not a bad place if he wants us all to go there.

5121
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:30,260
And I wouldn't mind.

5122
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:33,540
Like I resent him for forcing me my whole life

5123
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:35,060
to just go along with his pace

5124
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:36,900
because he is the lazy piece of shit.

5125
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:38,260
And if I want him involved,

5126
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:40,260
I have to slave around what he wants.

5127
03:03:40,260 --> 03:03:41,940
But you know, in this case,

5128
03:03:41,940 --> 03:03:43,460
it might actually work out pretty nice.

5129
03:03:43,460 --> 03:03:44,980
So hey, maybe that'll happen.

5130
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:46,180
Yeah, or somewhere else, whatever.

5131
03:03:46,260 --> 03:03:48,100
Hashtag get us all somewhere.

5132
03:03:48,100 --> 03:03:50,500
Yeah, hashtag buy me out, nigga.

5133
03:03:50,500 --> 03:03:51,460
Yeah, yeah.

5134
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:52,820
All right, everybody, thanks for listening.

5135
03:03:53,380 --> 03:03:54,020
Thanks, guys.

5136
03:03:54,020 --> 03:03:54,740
Hope you enjoyed.

5137
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:58,820
Look forward to Tom Mage and maybe me in the future.

5138
03:03:58,820 --> 03:04:00,020
We'll see what happens.

5139
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:00,580
Bye, guys.
