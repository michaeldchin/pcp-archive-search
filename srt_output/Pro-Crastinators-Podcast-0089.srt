00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Christmas evolved from the Roman holiday Saturnalia, a winter festival where men gave gifts to each other.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They also would get drunk, have sex with each other, and beat their wives.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
People would act so crazy on Christmas, the holiday was outlawed by the Protestant church until the 1800s.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A podcast of a bunch of people on the internet talking about things they like and dislike.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm the best guy ever, and today we're joined by such characters as Hippocrit.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tom Oliver is here.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm dreaming of a white Kwanzaa.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now that's the dream, that's the real dream. The Davoo is here.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think even the word holiday is offensive because it implies holy, thus divine. Let's just use festive. Come on guys, be PC.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Did you bros here?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is the dawning of the rest of our life on holiday.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who is that? Is that Blink?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's Green Day.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's right. That's right. That's right.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's from America.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right guys, we're talking about holidays. Merry Christmas everyone.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Merry Kwanzaa.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Happy Hanukkah.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Whatever the fuck made up holidays you guys celebrate. I hope that you're having a good one.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This will be out after Christmas, before New Year's, so right in that sweet spot.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Before the important one.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Which is New Year's.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
New Year's is the only holiday I care about.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think that makes like the exact same holiday because they sort of meld into one another.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The holidays are an amorphous blob.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't think of them that way. It's a whole week between them, and New Year's is more special to me.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because Christmas is just about like giving each other shit. New Year's is about getting fucked up.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And that's why it's the best holiday, but we'll get into that later.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, right. I mean, we're busting this nut wide open and revealing all the secrets within on all holidays here.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is going to be, I assume we'll spend most of our time on Halloween.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's like the most important one. It's the most relevant one.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You know, Hippo knows.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's probably the only one significantly rising in popularity still, where all the other ones are sort of on a public opinion decline, I would say.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a slutty ween and whatnot, has really brought it to the mainstream.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But hey, let's break this thing down with a visit to our good friend UrbanDictionary.com and find out what the fuck a holiday even is.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, so a holiday. Here we go.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
An opportunity for relatives to come around and say stupid shit like, why haven't you found a wife yet?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My favorite part about holidays is how being single is considered a disease.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There you go. All right.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Was that all in the UrbanDictionary definition? Or was that just you responding to it?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, no. That's in the definition. That's in the definition.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Also, a British term for vacation. I always thought that was weird.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't have vacation as a word, I guess. We go on holiday to summer places.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And Harry Potter, when they had summer holiday and they're going on holiday and whatnot, it was very triggering.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are we going to make sure to keep this to nationally recognized holidays?

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think just the big ones. Christmas, Halloween.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Halloween's not even technically a holiday. Nobody gets off and work on Halloween.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My favorite holiday is the Eclipse, the solar eclipse.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But see, it's not the Earth solar eclipse. It's the Mars solar eclipse that I calculate using.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I triangulate the position of the sun and the moon in the sky.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait, Mars doesn't even have a moon. Never mind. I thought that was going to be hilarious.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Mars could eclipse the sun if it tried hard enough.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Does Mars have a moon? Is that accurate?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mars has two moons.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, so it's twice as likely then to do Eclipse and shit.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But no, the Earth is like the only...

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, so anyway, talking about holidays here, what the fuck are we... God.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do we want to go through them in order or something?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go from most woke to least woke holidays in order.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Everyone's currently on Google searching a list of holidays.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What are these things again? I remember Halloween.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If you can't recall them off the top of your head, they don't matter.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But big holidays are relative, because in America, Thanksgiving's a big one,

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but I'm sure to you, Thanksgiving is not even real.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
America is the only place that matters, so who fucking cares?

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The only thing about Thanksgiving is that there's Black Friday,

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
which has permeated the collective consciousness of fucking everybody.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I generally hate it, because I don't get it.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You just don't like it as Black in the title.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you know why they call it Black Friday?

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, hippo, do you know why they call it Black Friday?

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know if this is something that everyone knows or not a whole lot of people know.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why it's called Black Friday?

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Tell us.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, first of all, like all facts I've ever heard in my fucking life,

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sure like next week I'm going to hear that it was actually,

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I heard this from a false source and this isn't the reason,

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
like every knowledge in the world.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will know whether or not it's true, because I know why it's called that.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, because you heard it from the real service.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's because stores are in the red basically all year

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because retail is a shitty industry to get into,

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and so they named it after their own relieved desire

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to finally have Black on the bottom line of their revenue.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And that's what it's called Black Friday.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The idea is we get so many people like literally killing each other

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to get their shit that we actually make a profit for the first time.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So that's basically the whole retail industry is completely circled

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
around the whole holiday season.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's like literally their business model,

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
which is part of a whole holiday creep that I want to get into

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
toward the end of this.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh yeah, that's the most important thing I wanted to talk about on here.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Me too, yeah.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In fact, I kind of want to skip straight to that, because like,

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Can we?

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The holidays we're going to talk about here,

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the ones that we all care about, like fuck Memorial Day,

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
no one gives a fuck.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No one knows what it's about other than the pools close.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Like that's all that I know about Memorial Day.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The pools close, yeah.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh yeah, I went into that shit too, yeah, definitely.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh wait, do the pools open or close on Memorial Day?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Which one is earlier?

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's like only open on Memorial Day.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The fact that you don't even know just proves your point that it doesn't matter.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, it's close.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They close on Memorial Day and open on like Veterans Day or something like that.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Like those are like the bookends of summer, you know.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
In America, pools open and close based on the holidays.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No, not the fucking pool thing, the fucking Veterans Day.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I mean, I guess we have like military days as well.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, we've got Veterans Day where you celebrate Veterans Memorial Day,

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
which is where you cry because people died.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have no fucking idea.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Martin Luther King Day, no one cares.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But the holidays we have that matter are like New Year's, Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Those are the ones that have slowly expanded and run way beyond their day

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and consumed whole years of time.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Walking through the fucking hallways of aisles at Walmart,

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
they had Christmas shit up on October 29th.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And it's like, guys, guys, hold the fuck up.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Stop, stop, stop.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No one wants this.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No one here wants this.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, if there was able to sort of spread out the joy of the holiday season in a way,

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, perhaps that'd be nice, but really all it seems to do is cheapen it.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Absolutely.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's because it's not done to increase the appeal and the good feelings of the holidays.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's to maximize you spending money.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's why it feels so cold.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
As much as people can debate whether or not the mythological cultural figure of Santa Claus really exists,

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
there is one highly doubted mythological figure that does exist.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's called the slippery slope.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
People like to call that argument a fallacy,

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but if you look at literally any human activity ever,

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
there is not a single fucking slope humanity has never slid down.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And in this case, its retailers became dependent on the holiday season to make money,

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
so they just take more and more and more and more and they just cannot help themselves.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They are as fat as your fat uncle at Thanksgiving on the holiday cheer.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It is obscene.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you know that Santa Claus used to be green?

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What made you red?

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Did you know he's not got Father Christmas any time anywhere other than your country?

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What?

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean, they call him a lot of things in a lot of different countries,

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
because he's a weird amalgam of a million things.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When I was a kid, we called him Father Christmas,

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because it's like Father like a religious thing.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I just thought it was like Dad Christmas or something.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Lol.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then Santa Claus was like, oh, that's the American one.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Everyone knows, on Christmas, we celebrate the fact that Santa is your dad for the day.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Everyone enjoys it.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And once she stays up all night getting ready to steal as soon as he comes down.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, getting ready to beat his father for one day.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, I actually think that retailers got so focused on Christmas that they killed Easter.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, absolutely.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
When I was growing up, there was this holiday called Easter,

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that I don't know if anyone still celebrates.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But there was like a bunny, and you had these eggs.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You would like paint eggs, like regular eggs.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But then you would also have like fake eggs with candy inside of them that were hidden everywhere.

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And you had to find those.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is this really like dead?

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We do this all the time.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like this is still a thing.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you still do Easter?

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I just don't think it's something that adults do much.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm trying to explain this so that like modern children can understand.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know if they have Easter.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think this is still a thing that happens.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think explaining Easter is like explaining a Nintendo, like an NES game.

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't think it's that far gone, dude.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, perhaps.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean, me and my family, like up until before I moved away, moved out to Ohio,

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
me and my family would do our Easter egg hunt every year.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And mostly it was just because my dad liked doing it,

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and it was an excuse to get together.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you think it's a holiday that only exists in families with kids?

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
As soon as they grow up, it's not fun.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Unless you're very religious, in which case that's like a very sacred day.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The problem with Easter is that there's not enough of like a party aspect attached to it

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
for like adults to celebrate Easter.

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I think the problem with it is that hiding eggs around the garden is time-consuming,

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and I don't care.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, well, I love doing it.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Am I going to be eating mud?

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't want to be doing that.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't love fucking trolling people.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is that it's becoming a light Christmas?

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
At least that's my experience with it.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's more about like you have to, because you used to just get like the Easter basket

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
that had like candy and whatever, but like slowly it's been like,

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
well, we need to corporatize this to make money.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So like you need to buy presents on Easter, not just a dumb little gift basket.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wait, Tom, do you still get presents on Easter in your family?

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't anymore, but like back when I was growing up, it did get more and more...

208
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, like I remember that.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I remember that by the time I was like 10 or 11.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I grew up Christian.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I grew up Christian, so like Easter was a big deal in this house,

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
because you know Jesus was fucking back, kicking ass.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, to this every year growing up.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
As we all know, when Jesus died on the cross, like a thousand bunnies showed up

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and cried and cried, and a bunch of eggs were laid by the bunnies,

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and that's why Jesus died.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wait, no, I think this is detailed in the Professor Brothers lectures on Jesus.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But like, fucking, to this, like every time I got like a gift on Easter,

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
like for my entire childhood growing up, I was consistently baffled

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
on why I was being given like a gift.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like don't get me wrong, like in our Christmas basket one day,

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there was one magical morning when I woke up,

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and we got Easter baskets with some candy,

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and in Ben's basket I believe was Mega Man X,

225
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and in mine was Donkey Kong Country 3.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Holy fuck!

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And it was like the most legendary Easter of all time.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But I still don't understand why I was given those.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I've never heard of Easter.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've never heard of Easter presents, that's never been like a failure.

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
My parents didn't man, I don't know.

232
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can count the contents of the eggs as presents.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Now quite unlike Hippo, I loved hiding the eggs,

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
like I would be the sole proprietor of egg hiding duties.

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I mean the reason I wouldn't, I mean, the reason I said that was like,

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the reason adults don't continue it is because it's a fucking hassle.

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's kind of a demand on your time for an adult.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's more of a thing that can only be enjoyed by kids.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can still enjoy giving and getting presents at Christmas as an adult.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When my family got a business and had a rural neighborhood that we lived in with a big yard,

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
that's when I became an ultra bastard at my hiding techniques.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'd put eggs on appliances where they completely blend in,

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
whether you can't see them, I'd put eggs inside a broken part of a tree that you have to open.

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You and I are in a unique position because we're older brothers.

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Easter is the most fun for an eldest brother for about two years.

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's when you're like 12 and 13,

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
when you're like right at the age where you're too old to have to look for the eggs

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
because you'll find them immediately, but your little brothers are still kind of retarded.

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, the eggs I had, not even I would have found.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Your parents would never hide them that well.

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Your parents are just going to put eggs around,

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and then your kid brother, you're going to find them all immediately,

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
your kid brother's not going to find any.

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So it's way more fun if you hide the eggs because not only will you do a better job,

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
but now it's all on them.

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's probably some they won't even find, and it's just going to be way more fun.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But then as soon as they're old enough that they could hide the eggs themselves,

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
there's nowhere to go from there.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No one in my family extended or even acquaintances is as much of an evil person as me.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I put an egg just straight up in the ground with barely a centimeter sticking out of it, right?

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Like barely like a millimeter sticking out of it, right?

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
See, it's a win-win, the thing with eggs, because if they never find them,

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you get to forever enjoy the fact that they didn't find it and it's there,

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
even though it's plastic rotting away for all eternity.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Now they do find it, then you get to take a victory lap in your cleverness,

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
because you've been exposed and now they get to see your logic.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But the point is, underneath that egg was another egg.

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But like one inch further down.

269
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And underneath that...

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, I am the Dark Souls of Easter, that's what I'm saying.

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Incredible.

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I was just like, the gutters were always the best.

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You got your rain gutter.

274
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But yeah, when I was a kid, there was a period where it suddenly became a toy holiday,

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and I think that's what killed Easter, because Easter was like the hiding eggs,

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
candy, like simple, he spent like $15, $20 on Easter.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then as soon as parents started having to spend money to buy you a video game

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
or some shit on Easter, they were like, didn't we just do this on Christmas,

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and your birthday?

280
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We can't have every fucking holiday coming along bleeding us dry.

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think my parents were trying to get out of the Easter game as fast as possible,

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
because I was probably like 13 when we stopped doing that shit.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Our approach to these things with my family was more like,

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
we were always happy to have an excuse to celebrate something or buy things for each other,

285
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
because I don't know, we're all cut through capitalists who are out to get each other

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and get the competition.

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I mean, not really, but there was kind of that sentiment.

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And I personally think the real problem with Easter as a holiday is that it is too kiddy of a holiday,

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
just in general in the ways I was saying before.

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's no reason why a parent, like okay, because obviously children are worthless and do nothing.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Only parents make everything happen.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It needs more eggnog, they need something to make parents like invest in Easter as a thing.

293
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And I don't know what that would be, but it needs something.

294
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You ask adults why they like Christmas, they're like, ah, eggnog.

295
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
A million reasons.

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I want rum in my wintry drink.

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's all about excuses to drink.

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, think about this way, Halloween was probably primarily,

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
capital-y a child holiday for a long time.

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It just took the infantilization of society,

301
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
had to catch up to it to the point that now an adult can be like,

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
oh yeah, I'm dressed enough for fucking crit for Halloween.

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And now you're weird if you don't.

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Go to a party.

305
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Now it's like everyone goes to hell.

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's like everyone doing it kind of thing.

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So at the rate we're at the second biggest holiday.

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you know some 20-somethings, there's going to be a Halloween party that you're invited to.

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So maybe eventually the infantilization of society,

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
give it another generation or so,

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
they'll be like, oh yeah, Easter, fucking scavenger party, sweet, let's do it.

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And then you'll be weird if you don't do that.

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
We could talk more about individual ones if you guys want to,

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I have a larger point about holidays in general,

315
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and I do want to ask, who is, let's just a quick poll,

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
who is pro-holiday and who is anti-holiday?

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm pretty anti-holiday.

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As a person who doesn't have days on or days off,

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't really know what to think about it.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think it's good for kids, it's great for kids, it's lovely for kids.

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Keep them for that.

322
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And other than that, I think some people need time off,

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
but I don't know about holidays generally.

324
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The festivities, you have to do the specific type of festivity.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You have to make a Christmas roast.

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What if you don't like roast? What if nobody likes roast?

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If you don't like your family?

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I would like time off of work,

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but I don't know whether I would like to dress up a tree every year.

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I know what you mean.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
To that effect, I want to pitch a holiday here real quick,

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
which people have done a lot before,

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
so I'm sort of reiterating their arguments,

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but I think it makes a lot of sense.

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
New holiday, everyone gets the day off.

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's a national holiday, at least in America and probably everywhere.

337
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It is voting day.

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It is voting day.

339
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When everyone gets the day off and you can go vote, it's easy,

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
nothing to worry about, you've got one thing to do.

341
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I think voting should take a whole week though.

342
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't think it should only be on one day.

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But there is a day set aside where if you can't,

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
for whatever reason, you've got a day where you can do it.

345
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm surprised it isn't already a thing.

346
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It seems very dumb.

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It could be a reason.

348
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sure some people oppose it because there is a measured...

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sure some people have done studies on what it would be like

350
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
if they did that, and they found like,

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
uh-oh, that means 50% more blacks will vote.

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I was going to say, it's very easy to quell the working class

353
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
if they're too busy working a 12-hour shift.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Cat-a-fucking-gorkly,

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
politicians who make the laws and decide rules like that

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
are all very comfortable with the exact mechanisms

357
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
that got them elected, so there you go.

358
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Exactly, which is why these people cannot...

359
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's ridiculous that we have the people making the decisions

360
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
on how to do this stuff are also the ones, like, you know,

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
themselves, those who should be in charge.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It should be a separate body that decides this stuff.

363
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I got a separate body for you.

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So, to answer your question of who's pro and anti-holiday,

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I am pro-holiday as an idea,

366
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
but I think I'm anti a lot of the holidays that exist,

367
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and mostly because they're just so, like, homogenized,

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and, like, it's all the... Yeah, it makes everything the same.

369
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like, you go out, fucking Christmas is the worst,

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and, um, in my family over the last decade or so,

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we've done a lot of, like, experimental Christmas alternatives.

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
For instance, in 2008, we celebrated Festivus,

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the made-up holiday from Seinfeld,

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and then for the next two years, I made up my own holidays.

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
One was where we celebrated Hearth Swarming Eve, the...

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh!

377
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There was a whole video about it.

378
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
One of the oldest videos on my channel was a 20-minute explanation,

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and, like... I remember that.

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Like, cataloging of what happens on Hearth Swarming Eve,

381
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and I basically just took the stuff that happens in the show

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and, like, reimagined it for what real people would do, you know?

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Right, yeah, like...

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hearth Swarming Eve, ponies all come together,

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
unicorns, pegasi, earth ponies, whatever,

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
being friends with each other, regardless of race,

387
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
someone needs to remind these upstarts of their place!

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey! Hey!

389
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Fancy reviews.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Like, fucking, the thing with holidays is they're just dated,

391
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and the reason why they continue to persist with such, uh,

392
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
hack-need tradition is because no one wants to look like the fucking curmudgeon

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
who doesn't want to participate, right?

394
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's the hardest part, is, like, convincing people, like,

395
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
no, I like hanging out with my family,

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I like buying you all things.

397
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What I don't like is that for two months out of every fucking year,

398
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
everywhere I go is playing Christmas music,

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and it's the same Christmas music.

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Fifteen songs.

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, the same 15 songs reimagined infinitely,

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and the worst part is that none of the reimaginings are any good.

403
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's all, like, the shittiest quality music playing.

404
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We go out, Dibu, hold on a second, let me do my rant.

405
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We go out, and fucking, like, they'll be playing, like,

406
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
this, like, shit-mitty version of, like, some obscure Christmas song

407
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
that no one cares about, and, like, there was one,

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
there's this one that's on the radio right now

409
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
that I heard in the department store, and it made me, like,

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
feel like I was on drugs?

411
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like, more so than usual?

412
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Dude, did you guys know Did You Broke Those Drugs?

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It was, like, this weird, like, I don't know,

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
it was, like, a feeling, like, the music was just bad

415
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
in, like, a way that's, like, hypnotic,

416
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and it, like, made me feel like my brain was rotting out of my head,

417
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
like, they were trying to, like, push Christmas, like,

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
subliminals into me or some shit.

419
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Dude, what song was this?

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't remember what, it was one of the generic Christmas songs,

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
like, one of the instrumental ones.

422
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was, like, a really bad instrumental.

423
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Like, it just sounded like shit.

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
My thing with Christmas music that I only really thought about this year

425
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is, regardless of the, like, comp, like, regardless of the recording quality,

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
is that, you know how, like, in a song, by the third time you get to the chorus,

427
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the singer is, like, doing it a little bit differently,

428
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
because that's how a lot of it works.

429
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The way with Christmas music is because I think this is, like,

430
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
a subliminal, subconscious thing that everyone has done,

431
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
is that because everyone's heard these songs thousands of times,

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
they're sort of singing it as though it's the 2,000th version of the chorus,

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
so I'm not gonna try and sing it, but I'll do the rhythm of, like,

434
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll be home for Christmas,

435
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
if only in my dreams.

436
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They sing it as, like, wrongly as possible,

437
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
because, like, that's how you do it differently.

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What's supposed to be, like, the jazz swing version,

439
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
now it's, like, jingle bells, jingle bells,

440
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
it's, like, you can't make jingle bells sound cool.

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's always gonna be fucking jingle bells, you know?

442
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Right, exactly.

443
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like, and the worst part is that it's playing literally everywhere,

444
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
so, like, I go out to have, like, Chinese food,

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and they're playing it at the Chinese food place,

446
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and I'm, like, I was kind of trying to escape the American Christmas culture

447
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
by coming to some foreign land,

448
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but no, there is no escaping it.

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
They're singing jingle bells in Chinese,

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
because that would have been cool.

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No, they were doing the fr-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Dude, like, I remember, okay, did you, you know,

454
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
you watched Todd in the Shadows.

455
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I remember one year, I think it was 2012, he was like,

456
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
guys, we seriously need some more Christmas songs,

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
so he reviewed a bunch of new Christmas songs,

458
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
hated them all, next Christmas, he said,

459
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
yeah, there's nothing else to sing about Christmas,

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
we're done, it's an expense idea, it's done with.

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So, here's the thing about all the holidays,

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
but mostly Christmas, they're dated,

463
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but the way that they are celebrated now

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
made sense for the baby boomers,

465
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
it made sense back in the 50s and 60s.

466
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Back in the 50s and 60s, we had three channels on TV,

467
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
now we have a thousand, we had one flavor of pasta sauce,

468
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
now we have 20, we need more options,

469
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it's just too similar, so here's my proposal.

470
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We need a bright neon 80s style future to move,

471
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
we need 80s, you know, neon holidays.

472
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We are now a culture of options and customization,

473
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
so here's my proposal.

474
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Halloween and Christmas become merged,

475
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
because people want that anyway,

476
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
so many people do Halloween stuff for Christmas,

477
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
or like, you know.

478
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's a terrible idea, we never heard of that.

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We have to separate these.

480
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's a fantastic idea.

481
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Are you saying that basically, it's like a pick,

482
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
like, okay, the last three months of the year

483
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
is holiday time, but you get to pick which holiday,

484
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
is that what you're saying?

485
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah, you can do any combination that you want.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You can choose your own adventure holiday.

487
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Fucking imagine, you're sitting down to Christmas dinner,

488
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and a trick or treater comes up to the door,

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
he's full of gravy in that bag.

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah, and also, you know what,

491
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I didn't even think about this until this podcast

492
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
fucking throw Easter in there too.

493
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Easter is already too samey, so that way,

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
like, you get a customization going to fuck on, right?

495
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Makes sense to me.

496
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And just make new years just like the...

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think the problem with the holidays has become,

498
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
because I like the idea of holidays in concept,

499
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
kind of like similar to what you were saying, Digi,

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
is that like, I like the idea of just like, you know,

501
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
good times, like good food, hang out with family, whatever.

502
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But the problem is because it becomes so corporatized,

503
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
it just feels so fake, like there's this,

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
this omnipresent fake goodness

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
that's really just an excuse to make you want to spend more money.

506
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Speaking of the corporatization of it,

507
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
alright, this is a whole other bag,

508
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
a trick to get into here.

509
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah, I saw your podcast, I know where this is going.

510
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What podcast? I've no idea what you're talking about.

511
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The one you did with Rucker Rucker.

512
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This is a slightly different point though.

514
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This is about how every day is like now is a holiday.

515
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like they've gone through the calendar,

516
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
they found it every single day.

517
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's true.

518
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I have pulled up a list, everybody.

519
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm looking at it right now.

520
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What holiday is it right now?

521
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm happy to tell you.

522
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Today is the 23rd of December that we're recording on it.

523
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is in fact Festivus Day,

524
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
but it is also Roots Day.

525
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't know what that means,

526
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
but it is Roots Day.

527
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Tomorrow, in addition to being Christmas Eve,

528
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is National Chocolate Day

529
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and also National Eggnog Day.

530
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Remember to go out and make chocolate eggnog, kids.

531
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
When you say national, is that an American?

532
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's America.

533
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, that's the same.

534
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm clean.

535
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh, and just for the viewers,

536
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
just for the viewers' enjoyment,

537
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
this episode will come out on the 31st,

538
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and just so you know, listener,

539
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
it is New Year's Eve and Unlucky Day

540
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and Make Up Your Mind Day,

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
according to HolidayInsights.com.

542
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The thing is that all holidays now are just memes.

543
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
All of these made up holidays

544
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
that are for every day of the year,

545
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
they come from Facebook.

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Someone makes a Facebook image meme

547
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that's like, oh, this is now National Cookie Day,

548
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and then everyone shares that,

549
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
because my mom shares all these.

550
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If it's something she likes,

551
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
my mom will be like, oh, it's Cookie Day,

552
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and she'll come home with cookies,

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and I'm like, this is a fucking meme, you know?

554
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Right, it's one half meme, one half marketing.

555
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm like, hey, we're a brownie company.

556
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Let's make sure what brownie day gets celebrated

557
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and the laws that we can get off tick and ourselves.

558
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Brownie day is National Brownie Day,

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
where is it, the 8th of December,

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
National Brownie Day.

561
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Fuck, damn it, I missed it.

562
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I missed it.

563
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
By the way, this really reminds me,

564
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I didn't realize that was the case.

565
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Gabe, you know how in One Piece,

566
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
in the question and answer thing,

567
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
whatever it's called, the SBS,

568
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oda will just get, someone will send a message

569
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and be like, hey, can this person's birthday be this day?

570
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And he's just like, sure, fine, it doesn't matter, okay.

571
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's exactly that arbitrary.

572
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah.

573
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What a world.

574
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh, I want to talk about my one other made up,

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
my own version of Christmas,

576
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
because the corporateization is why my family

577
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
kind of stopped celebrating mainstream Christmas,

578
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
which they do again now, because my parents,

579
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
my dad grew up with it,

580
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
my dad kind of likes having the tree

581
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and the decorations put in the presents under the tree.

582
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
That's the main part of it he still cares about.

583
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's like, let's just make sure

584
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
there's a decorated tree with shit under it.

585
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I like that, you know?

586
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Because in some of our weird made up holidays,

587
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
it was usually just like they just,

588
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
we just had like a big bag with gifts in it

589
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and we just kind of hand them out

590
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and it just doesn't have much drama

591
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to the actual gift giving, you know?

592
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You just were Santa, you just had the bag yourself,

593
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
just like, fuck that guy, we got this.

594
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
One of the holidays I had made up was called Agarwood Day,

595
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and it was based around the band Agalodge,

596
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
who is a black metal band,

597
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
but basically their music sounds like winter

598
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and I associate winter with the aesthetic of black metal.

599
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
As opposed to Christmas music, just like the exact opposite.

600
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Me too. Yeah, me too.

601
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You know, I'm looking at the window right now,

602
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
there's a fucking blizzard going on, I'm in New York,

603
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
so it's like, it's snowing constantly,

604
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and I'm like, this does not make me think

605
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
like, fast Christmas, I gave,

606
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
this makes me think like, Mother North, you know?

607
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So, like...

608
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's the coziness though, when you're inside

609
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and it's snowing outside, it's the coziness of it.

610
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
When you're by the fire and it's all warm,

611
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
that's the fire I associate with it.

612
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You don't stay inside cosily when there's snow,

613
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you put on a giant fur coat,

614
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and with a pipe you go out.

615
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Just to summarize it, the idea of Agarwood Day

616
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
was I would take an Agalodge song

617
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and interpret the lyrics as things that we could do

618
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
on the holiday,

619
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
because our family's always been big about

620
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the activities of a holiday.

621
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's not so much about the religion,

622
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
the sitting around with your family or whatever,

623
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
we don't really do the Christmas dinner so much

624
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
as what are fun things you can do on a holiday.

625
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So, like, one we have for Christmas that we still do,

626
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and I don't know about this year because I won't be there,

627
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
but like, we usually make a giant bonfire on Christmas

628
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because we have like a fire pit in my backyard.

629
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And we'll do this thing where we write down

630
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
on a piece of paper like something we don't want to take

631
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
with us into the new year and throw it into the fire.

632
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Dude, holy shit.

633
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, so like...

634
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It's like the opposite of like the New Year's resolutions.

635
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, exactly.

636
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's like you throw away this stuff

637
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and then on New Year's you pick up what you're going to take

638
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
with you into the next year.

639
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Which, incidentally, on New Year's,

640
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
which I'll get into a lot,

641
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
we have a lot of New Year's traditions,

642
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
but my favorite one is that we take our champagne glass

643
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and like, you're not supposed to drink the champagne

644
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
until the ball drops, right?

645
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Like 10, 9, 8, you hit one, you drink.

646
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But before that, you write down like your New Year's resolution

647
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
on like a tiny slip of paper and you burn it into your drink.

648
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, like, you then drink it with the champagne.

649
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Right.

650
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, I did that with you.

651
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I've been having real good luck with...

652
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, we all did that,

653
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
along with our other traditions,

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
which are donuts for some reason.

655
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
We always eat donuts, drink a shitload of champagne,

656
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and we make party hats.

657
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Like, we each make our own party hat

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
that like is supposed to encapsulate

659
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
like everything you sort of did and were in 2016.

660
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh, you guys did that when I...

661
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I remember we were around for,

662
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
when Radcon at the beginning of this year happened,

663
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
those were still hanging around.

664
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, me and Ben had been doing that.

665
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But yeah, so that's why I love New Year's.

666
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I love that aspect.

667
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I love the creative aspect of holidays,

668
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
being like, with Easter, again, the egg hunt,

669
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
like that's a great idea of like,

670
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
oh, we're going to hide eggs and shit like that.

671
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But the problem is that it ends up being just shit

672
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
that everybody does,

673
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and it's not necessarily what your family wants to do.

674
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Right.

675
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I think a lot of like what killed

676
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
like Thanksgiving and Christmas for me

677
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
is that like my extended family are all kind of,

678
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
like we don't really get along with a lot of them,

679
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and like they all kind of live far apart.

680
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So we don't have, like when I was a kid,

681
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it was like, oh, the whole family's here for Christmas,

682
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and I get that.

683
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I totally get why people would enjoy that.

684
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But when it's like just you,

685
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and like it's just your parents and kids,

686
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and it's like, well,

687
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
we all bought each other stuff, I guess,

688
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
even though we're all in our 20s now,

689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and like, you know, like...

690
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah, money.

691
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
When you were a kid,

692
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
you only cared about Christmas

693
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
because that's when you got a game console.

694
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know, you couldn't get a game console

695
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
under the time of the year.

696
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I think that, yeah, if it when I have kids,

697
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I think I'm gonna try and like,

698
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
make loopholes to make them not care so much

699
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
about the getting shit of Christmas.

700
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm just gonna buy them a console when it comes out.

701
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Or when a good game comes out.

702
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You know?

703
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Or rather, they're gonna be like,

704
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
what the fuck's a console?

705
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, who knows.

706
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, well, fair point.

707
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Console gaming might have been about 10 years.

708
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I've been thinking about the commercialization of Christmas,

709
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and I think, I mean, I don't, you know,

710
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
jump into it like, I don't embrace it myself,

711
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
but I do like that it exists

712
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
because it allows me to judge myself and my family

713
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
above all the stupid people who buy into the commercial,

714
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the buying the stuff, the cheap Chinese plastic

715
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and the millions of lights and just, yeah, fuck you.

716
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I had a nice, I had a nice meal.

717
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I gave a gift that I knew my people,

718
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
my family would want to them,

719
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and I saw them open it and it was great.

720
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I had one party and that's all I need,

721
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and everyone who goes beyond that

722
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is just somebody who I can laugh at.

723
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So it's like even funnier.

724
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So I like the commercialization.

725
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's pretty good.

726
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Hippo, I'm glad you reminded me of this.

727
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
A few weeks ago, I was standing outside having a cigarette

728
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
on my front porch, and I looked down the road

729
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and a few houses down.

730
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I see a guy get out of his truck

731
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and he put something on the ground

732
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and then slowly what inflates from the ground

733
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
is an eight-foot-tall minion.

734
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh!

735
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Dressed as Santa Claus, like wearing like a Santa helper hat.

736
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well, you know, eight-foot-tall minion.

737
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Eight-foot-tall one of those sorts of things.

738
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I overheard the guy talking to his neighbor

739
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and he goes, the neighbor's like, oh, my God, right?

740
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And he's like, yeah, she told me,

741
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I told her I wanted to get an inflatable.

742
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
She said, I can only do it if it was a minion.

743
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I said, fair game.

744
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Dude, on the line, around me.

745
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There's a bunch of inflatable minions.

746
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There's one house that has like three minions

747
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
in front of it. What is with the fucking minions?

748
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll tell you what the fuck is with the minions.

749
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Mom's, everyone's mom.

750
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Despicable Me is a mom franchise.

751
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
There's just no two ways about it.

752
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I think my mom kind of thinks they're cute, too.

753
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
This is scientifically proven by me through my life.

754
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I go up to everyone and be like, what's up with all the minions?

755
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What's up with Despicable Me? Why is this so popular?

756
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't know. Hey, mom, I love Despicable Me.

757
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I love the minions. They're great. It's just a mom movie.

758
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And mom's, yeah, minions are mother's things.

759
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
That makes sense to me.

760
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This reminds me of something about the holidays.

761
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It makes a weird kind of sense.

762
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
No, no, no, no, no. Because the main character of Despicable Me

763
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
like raises three adopted girls.

764
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He is like a mom kind of character.

765
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah, he's a mom character.

766
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, but they only talk about and show and pick the little weird yellow guys.

767
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Nobody has merchandise of the characters of that movie.

768
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, because the minions are the distillation of the feelings that you feel when you watch,

769
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
that a mother feels when they watch the big movie.

770
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm going to get a fucking inflatable fidget spinner.

771
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That'd be pretty sick.

772
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Especially if it does spin.

773
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Dude, only if you could actually like, imagine having a giant inflatable spin.

774
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
If it's fun.

775
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah, actually, spin. That'd be pretty fun.

776
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Or especially like maybe Santa Claus is like flipping it around with like the,

777
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
some meme glasses and shit.

778
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I just want that Ajit Pai meme as an inflatable.

779
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
On my lawn.

780
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
He's very festive.

781
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Right.

782
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Do it.

783
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But Tom, what were you saying, dude?

784
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I was just going to say lawn ornaments.

785
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That reminds me of like something that I always just found really just dumb about the holidays.

786
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Like the try-hards who like deck their entire house out and like all these lights and all these decorate.

787
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There's someone who's down the street from us like every year.

788
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's just his entire house, all of his yard, all of the fence.

789
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Just, just, just like, I can't imagine this dude's power bill.

790
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It must be insane.

791
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Dude, he's peacocking so hard.

792
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's pulling so much pus.

793
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, that dude.

794
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He's slagging so much pus with that.

795
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I gotta tell you.

796
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's ridiculous.

797
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Tom, I gotta tell you about this guy in my old neighborhood.

798
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
There's this, walking down the main road that goes into my neighborhood.

799
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
There's these two houses directly across from each other that are always like pulling out all the stops on their Christmas shit.

800
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No one else in the neighborhood's like this.

801
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's just these two guys.

802
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They're obviously competing with each other.

803
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But one of them has gotten to the point where during the holiday season, they put like a full monitor in their window and just play like live footage of Christmas carols.

804
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Like, like on stage.

805
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Like they play like live Christmas carol performances like all day and night on a fucking huge monitor in the window that you can hear when you're walking past the house.

806
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's fucking insane.

807
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Dude, the weirdest, the weirdest one that I ever found is my, it was like two years ago and my mom, my mom is totally into all this shit.

808
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
She loves it.

809
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
She'll never do any of it herself because she's too lazy, but like likes being the observer.

810
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So she demanded that all of us get in the car and drive somewhere.

811
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah.

812
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So we drove.

813
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We used to do that when we were kids.

814
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Our whole family would pilot a car and drive around.

815
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This was a bizarre experience.

816
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So we go out of our way like 20 minutes to this house.

817
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And we had to like turn on, I think we had to like turn on the radio or something.

818
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It was like a radio, like a smartphone thing and you hit a button and a whole thing would play on this person's house.

819
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You could start it whenever you wanted.

820
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Just this guy's house.

821
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Just this guy's house.

822
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Incredible.

823
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
He decked out everything and it was like responding to like an app or something and you would make it like auto play.

824
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's cool.

825
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And I'm just, and I'm just like, I appreciate the technical prowess that would need to be like done to do this.

826
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But at the same time, what the fuck, man?

827
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I can explain this because down at the beach by my house, like on the main beach, there's this stretch of road that they turn into a light show during Christmas time.

828
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And basically it's like you come in and it's like that.

829
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's like, I think they give you a CD or it was a radio station or something like that.

830
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But like this was when I was a kid.

831
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So it wasn't no app or anything like that.

832
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You would drive down this stretch of road and like you're supposed to listen to this particular CD while you're driving and like the music matches up with the lights.

833
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And like, like, you know, if you're driving at the correct speed, you know, right?

834
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So Tom, I think that's what he might have been inspired by something like that.

835
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Tom, did you ever go to Los Alets by any chance?

836
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Like where I lived in Massachusetts, like right at the street once we used to go to the Fatima trying a lot.

837
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
They had a lot of displays.

838
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Dude, guys, you know what was like the craziest lawn ornaments I've ever seen?

839
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It was these refreshing breath mints seen after the TV show Lawn Order. Lawn Order mints.

840
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That's what I had. I had them. I ate them. They refreshed my breath.

841
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Who, who, who? Excellent.

842
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
By the way, everybody, May 6th is National Beverage Day.

843
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Don't forget to drink a beverage on May 6th, National Beverage Day.

844
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Wait, wait, like just completely no specific.

845
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's just beverage. It's just beverage.

846
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just drink water that day.

847
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Don't forget. Do not forget.

848
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I guess I've been celebrating that all my life.

849
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I celebrate it every day.

850
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's really been watered down, if you will.

851
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Oh, yes!

852
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Guys, I want to say something about New Year's.

853
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now, I'm going to tell a story and I don't know if I'm either going to seem like a weirdo to everyone

854
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
or will actually seem like I'm really on the level with a lot of people around the globe.

855
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So, it was last New Year's, so I was with Digi and Ben, and they were all like,

856
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
oh man, DeVoo, you want to go and watch the ball drop?

857
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I was like, yeah, yeah. I always heard of the ball being dropped.

858
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I vaguely understood what it was, and they were like, wait, you've never seen the ball get dropped?

859
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I was like, yeah, man, I'm living in a different time zone my whole life.

860
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There's never been a reason to watch the ball drop, to which these two East Coast for Life boys were like,

861
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you're right! Holy shit!

862
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Never even fucking considered that.

863
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So yeah, I've never even knew what the ball drop was, because to everyone who watches the ball drop,

864
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
it's so ubiquitous and culturally understood, they never bothered to explain it.

865
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I just hear something about someone's balls dropping, and I'm like, well, I guess it's worth watching.

866
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's just weirdly, yeah, when you told me about that, I was like, of course it's an East Coast thing.

867
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That makes perfect sense, but everyone lives on the East Coast!

868
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because it's from New York. It's based in New York, and all the channels cover it and stuff.

869
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But yeah, I never even considered the fact that it literally only makes sense

870
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
if you live on the East Coast of the United States, or a certain part of Canada.

871
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I remember, I think, maybe two years ago, I had done my New Year's celebration.

872
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I watched the fireworks over Big Ben, and that's the London thing.

873
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
They don't drop any balls, they just have a big fireworks display in the middle of London,

874
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and it's on TV, and we watch that.

875
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And then five or six hours later, I'm still awake, got a lot of alcohol, just happy and stuff.

876
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And then I see you in the chat, you guys are like, oh, yeah, happy New Year, and I'm like, yeah, fuck you, I win.

877
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm indeed.

878
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Incidentally, everybody start gearing up for August 4th, National Clown Day,

879
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
which as everyone knows is the Saturday during International Clown Week!

880
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Wow.

881
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Alright, I'm sorry, go on.

882
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Dude, how do you feel that your birthday is 808 today?

883
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Like, that's pretty cool, right?

884
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, yeah, 808, 808, 808, 808, 808.

885
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Dude, also, I have another holiday to close.

886
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I've said this before.

887
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
On August 8th of this year, it's sneak some zucchini onto your neighbor's porch day.

888
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
What the fuck?

889
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, okay, go on.

890
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Is that for real, or are you dropping new ones?

891
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It is on the screen, I'm looking at.

892
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Sneak a zucchini onto your neighbor's porch day.

893
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Indeed, that's correct.

894
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What if I don't have a neighbor or a porch or a zucchini?

895
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Or the ability to sneak.

896
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm like stuck on that one.

897
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm like, I need some fucking explanation for that one.

898
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Well, that's just, I mean, they're all memes, but some of them are more real than others.

899
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That one, I was making my own videos.

900
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That one clearly just some guy thought of it would be fucking random.

901
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's probably a fucking meme from an adult film show or something.

902
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's like a tagline for this day, which is, now that's nasty.

903
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That's like, that's like the best phrase.

904
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Was that a fucking family guy?

905
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, I just feel like.

906
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I have no idea.

907
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Anyway, back when I was making my own videos and was all into reviewing and stuff,

908
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I felt that October 10th should have been National Reviewers Day,

909
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
because the date you write down is 10, 10.

910
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
10 out of 10, the best score you can give.

911
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, I like that.

912
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So like maybe on 10, 10, you review either something that you consider to be a 10 out of 10,

913
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
or you review Ben 10.

914
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Sneak a zucchini.

915
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Sneak a zucchini under your neighbor's porch day is 8, 8.

916
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It is my birthday.

917
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah.

918
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What in the fuck?

919
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Well, everybody.

920
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That's your birthday too.

921
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Well, everybody, if you want to sneak some zucchinis on my birthday, let's make that a thing.

922
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I just get caught.

923
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You die.

924
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Celebrate Digi Bro's birthday by fucking leaving zucchinis on people's zucchinis.

925
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
What the fuck?

926
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I think my last holiday-based proposal, and this one is entirely self-interested,

927
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
is to, there's going to be a caveat here.

928
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There'll be a way to make up for this.

929
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Eliminate all three-day weekends.

930
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Hold on.

931
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Hold on.

932
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Hold on.

933
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And then just make everyone take all of Shark Week off.

934
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Because I hate three-day weekends.

935
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Usually it's because I was counting on doing something when the store's open again on Monday,

936
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
but oh shit, one of the like five dozen three-day weekends hit me up the ass.

937
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Now I got to wait another day to get it.

938
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I can never be prepared for it, you know?

939
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Like, a dude fucking found an entire pair of continents, and we have to celebrate by not working,

940
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
be more like Columbus himself, and actually get off your ass and do something.

941
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Don't take the day off, bullshit.

942
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Take just the week of Shark Week off, and just absorb yourself into the sharks,

943
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and don't work for a week, and then that will be so much more simple and easy to keep track of for me.

944
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
There's some logic to that.

945
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Okay, condensing all the time up to a week.

946
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Okay, I'm still stuck on this Zucchini thing, but this website that I was reading about it on

947
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
is a website called National Day Calendar.

948
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And each day, it tells you what the next day's holidays are going to be,

949
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
like what all the national whatever days are going to be for the next day.

950
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So posted on August 7th this year was the August 8th list of holidays.

951
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So there was National Sneaks from Zucchini into your neighbor's porch day,

952
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
National Happiness Happens Day,

953
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
National Dollar Day, and National Frozen Custard Day.

954
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Now I'm going to read you there right up on one of these for National Dollar Day, because it's short.

955
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So okay, National Dollar Day.

956
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
August 8th commemorates today, Congress established the U.S. monetary system in 1786.

957
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's National Dollar Day.

958
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The first U.S. dollar bill wasn't printed until 1862, and it didn't bear the image of George Washington either.

959
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Sam and P. Chase, President Lincoln's Secretary of Treasury, was featured on the first greenback.

960
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
How to observe, so they have sections in this.

961
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
First they tell you what it is, then they tell you how to observe, then they tell you the history.

962
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
How to observe, spend or save a dollar, depending on your preference.

963
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Use hashtag National Dollar Day to post on social media.

964
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Here's the important part, history.

965
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Within our research, we were unable to identify the creator of National Dollar Day.

966
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
However, the origins are clearly related to the establishment of the U.S. monetary system.

967
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I imagine it was spawned from the womb of the invisible hand of the market.

968
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
A few scrolls down at the bottom of National Frozen Custard Day, history.

969
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Within our research, we are unable to find the creator of National Frozen Custard Day.

970
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
They probably made these up themselves.

971
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
A couple of them.

972
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The zucchini one's history is that Tom Roy at WellCat.com created this zucchini holiday while doing years of news and talk radio.

973
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Can we all just read off the holidays that correspond to our birthdays?

974
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I got eight, but I'll just blow through them real fast.

975
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We got St. James the Great Day, Children's Day, Spring and Labor Day holiday,

976
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
while Pergis Night...

977
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Well, Pergis from Fates Day Night, not Fates Day Night, but Bible Black.

978
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
No!

979
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Madoka Magica had Well Pergis Night as the big final boss that kills everybody.

980
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Really?

981
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I don't like this first and better because there was lots of chicks with dicks.

982
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Then we got State Holiday.

983
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Also, Children's Day is a major Japanese holiday.

984
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't know if that's the same one.

985
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because of all them lollicons, if you know what I'm saying.

986
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Dude, then we have the Taiwanese God of Medicine's birthday, Education Day in the Congo Democratic Republic,

987
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Carnival Day, Showa Days for Japan, International Jazz Day and Liberation Slash Reunification Day in Vietnam.

988
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Holy shit, you're right.

989
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Incidentally, when Hitler was killed, April 30th, Fall of Saigon, April 30th, my birthday,

990
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and when Osama bin Laden was killed, I think it was April 30th somewhere.

991
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Basically, a lot of fucking conflicts end when I show up, which is kind of inaccurate.

992
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Well, hey, I pulled up mine. Let's see, July 1st is my birthday.

993
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It is Build a Scarecrow Day.

994
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It is Canada Day slash Dominion Day.

995
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Dominion Day?

996
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Dominion Day.

997
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That's like...

998
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's DA Space Minion Day.

999
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It is Creative Ice Cream Flavors Day.

1000
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
International Chicken Wing Day and most appropriate...

1001
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's not bad. Most appropriate to my birth, International Joke Day.

1002
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You got really good ones. I got really shitty, boring ones.

1003
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You got Hitler's birthday or something. That's not bad.

1004
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
No, his birthday is April 20th, actually, but his death day is 30th.

1005
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Okay, okay. Well, there you go. That's mine. Anybody else want to read theirs?

1006
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'll go. Oh, no, Hitler, you go first.

1007
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
No, I was just going to say I don't know whether I could even find it,

1008
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
because if I type in National Holidays, it comes up with like...

1009
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Just type your birthday and holiday stuff.

1010
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Here, I'll link you in the chat. This is what I'm using. It's just like a list of...

1011
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean, it's going to be all American things, though.

1012
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh, that is true.

1013
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I was trying to find whether there's like a list of English ones.

1014
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Is this like a Wikipedia thing for it, I think? Like, days of the stuff that...

1015
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I mean, Tom could do it if he wants, though.

1016
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, I got mine pulled up. All right, so my birthday is November 8th.

1017
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So the holidays are iPod day.

1018
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
What the fuck?

1019
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
What the shit, dude? That's terrible.

1020
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Okay, all right.

1021
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Pythagorean Theorem Appreciation Day.

1022
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh, yeah.

1023
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

1024
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I like all the better ones than me.

1025
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Wall carpet day.

1026
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Wall carpet? The fuck.

1027
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yeah, that's what it says.

1028
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Okay.

1029
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Silence support the value of life day.

1030
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You mean...

1031
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Wait, like a pro life?

1032
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Is that science supports the value of life?

1033
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I don't know.

1034
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
If that's a pro life, damn.

1035
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But here's the best one, and the one that I feel I've been horribly negligent in celebrating.

1036
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Spontaneous elevator sex day.

1037
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Not bad.

1038
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Not bad.

1039
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I know what I'm doing next year, for sure.

1040
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh, my God.

1041
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Holy shit.

1042
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Damn.

1043
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Wait, like, can they...

1044
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Are they allowed to encourage that?

1045
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Look, I don't know, but I'm just gonna...

1046
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It's like, it's my birthday.

1047
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You know what else it is today.

1048
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
That's not a good pickup line.

1049
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Okay.

1050
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Did you know it's spontaneous sex, elevator sex day?

1051
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That's amazing.

1052
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh, my God.

1053
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And they're trapped in the elevator.

1054
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They can't leave.

1055
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They're definitely finding a way to celebrate that holiday.

1056
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That's the great...

1057
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Okay.

1058
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I know I could make that happen.

1059
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I got stuck on the wall carpet one.

1060
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Wall carpet day?

1061
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I don't know what the fuck a wall carpet is.

1062
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And when I go on the floor, you fools.

1063
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
What the fuck?

1064
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Is it if you want to do a epic prank and even somebody that they're a Spider-Man?

1065
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I typed wall carpet into Google, and all I've gotten is wall-to-wall carpets.

1066
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Like, not anything about a carpet on the wall.

1067
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And then I searched wall carpet day, and instead I got National Lumpy Rug Day.

1068
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Lumpy Rug Day.

1069
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean, you can hang a rug on the wall, theoretically.

1070
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Is that what this is?

1071
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I don't know.

1072
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm lost.

1073
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Okay.

1074
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Okay.

1075
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Hold on.

1076
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Okay.

1077
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
This is on a...

1078
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Okay.

1079
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
First of all, this is an entire website dedicated to noise cancellation.

1080
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's called acousticsfirst.com, materials to control sound and eliminate noise.

1081
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Man.

1082
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I can see why you're such a product reviewer, Tom.

1083
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You're based on iPods and sound insulation.

1084
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah.

1085
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It says acoustic myths and realities, carpet on the wall.

1086
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
In the disco days of the late 1970s, floor carpet was often used in studios as acoustic wall treatment.

1087
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But I guess it's not actually good.

1088
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And so they're talking about...

1089
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The gist of this article is that wall carpet's not a good idea, as a sound canceling.

1090
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Okay.

1091
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Sorry, I got really sucked into wall carpet day.

1092
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Digi, did you want to read...

1093
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Were there more of yours?

1094
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Did we already go through all the answers?

1095
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
You went through the important ones.

1096
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I mean, I got mine, but it's not that interesting.

1097
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's Meteor Watch Day.

1098
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Meteor Watch Day, okay.

1099
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, that's where everyone sits.

1100
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You go to the park, and you look for the big girls, the meteor girls, and you're like,

1101
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah.

1102
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Okay.

1103
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Isn't it true that we can predict when meteors will actually be visible?

1104
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So shouldn't Meteor Watch Day just be whatever day has meteors?

1105
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Like, every time there's a meteor that people are talking about, I'm going to hear about it on Twitter.

1106
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
That is Meteor Watch Day.

1107
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's the day when Twitter's like, hey, a meteor's coming close to Earth today.

1108
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You should look out for it, you know?

1109
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
With a little luck, you can see a meteor just about any night of the year, apparently.

1110
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Okay.

1111
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That's what it says, but I don't get it.

1112
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
A little luck?

1113
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You'd better live in a fucking Alaska.

1114
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Wait, what day is your birthday again?

1115
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
30th of June.

1116
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
That's right.

1117
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That's right.

1118
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So...

1119
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Thanks for doxing me, Nate.

1120
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Oh, no.

1121
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah, the only thing on here is Meteor Day for that on the website I'm looking at.

1122
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Right.

1123
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Who else needs to...

1124
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Wait, is that everyone?

1125
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, I think that's everyone.

1126
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's everyone.

1127
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm trying to think of real holidays again.

1128
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
How very interesting.

1129
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We haven't talked about Halloween yet.

1130
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That's true.

1131
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I'm going to come out and be the guy who doesn't like Halloween at all.

1132
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Not terribly into it, no.

1133
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Okay, the dressing up aspect, I kind of get, but if somebody goes to conventions, I don't

1134
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
feel like I have to wait for a holiday to do that.

1135
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And all the outfits are the same shit.

1136
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Everybody just goes and does the same fucking Halloween outfits.

1137
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
The thing...

1138
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I've never been to a Halloween party personally, but...

1139
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I lost my virginity at a Halloween party, so I will always be grateful to Halloween.

1140
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Go listen to the How I Lost My Virginity episode of the PCP if you want to hear that story.

1141
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But guys, you're not fucking cool unless you lose your virginity on Spontaneous Elevator

1142
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Sex Day.

1143
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You're right.

1144
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You're right.

1145
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's Spontaneous Reversal.

1146
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Do not ask permission.

1147
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's got to be spontaneous.

1148
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
During...

1149
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
When you celebrate that holiday, how many fucking references to a shaft do you think are made?

1150
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Holy shit.

1151
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh my god, this isn't the only shaft you're writing.

1152
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Halloween is...

1153
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It is very...

1154
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Like I said earlier, it's good for kids.

1155
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Kids, it's great for making funny little costumes and, you know, trick or treating.

1156
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
But everything else, like the going out to a party...

1157
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
First of all, October's cold and parties happen at night.

1158
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So, and getting in a costume may or may not cover you up well enough.

1159
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That's part of the point, is that the girls go out in the slutty outfits and they're cold

1160
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and so they need men to keep them warm.

1161
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That's why men go to the parties is to fuck all the slutty...

1162
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Dressed as the fucking wolf, man.

1163
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I mean, yeah, that's definitely the idea.

1164
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah.

1165
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They're definitely hook-up parties.

1166
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I've never been to a Halloween party like that.

1167
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I don't know, maybe I'd like it, but in general, I don't care.

1168
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I don't like the kids coming to the door.

1169
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I used to pretend to...

1170
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I used to be tasked with standing near the door or being the guy who goes to the door

1171
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and hands the bowl to the kids and say, here's your fucking stuff.

1172
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Let me take a step back on this Halloween thing,

1173
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
because I think there's really two different Halloween holidays.

1174
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
There's the normy, widely accepted Halloween, which is the combination...

1175
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
If you're adult, it means you go to a party.

1176
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I don't care for that.

1177
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And if you're a kid, it means you go trick-or-treating, which was fun when I was a kid.

1178
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I'm too old for it, so I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1179
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'm okay with that Halloween.

1180
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
The Halloween that bores me and that I'm not interested in is the nerd Halloween,

1181
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
which is where every single year, everybody who likes horror at all,

1182
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
transforms their internet presence into nothing but horror themed shit for an entire month.

1183
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And as somebody who's not into horror or its aesthetic at all,

1184
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
every October, I'm just like, oh, here we go.

1185
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm gonna hear about all the horror classics again.

1186
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I agree with that a lot, especially...

1187
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's really a very mild annoyance, but it is still annoying,

1188
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
just to see absolutely everyone from October 1st change their Twitter avatar and name,

1189
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
so they don't know who anyone is.

1190
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Let's talk about this real quick, because give you right now,

1191
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
it is Christmas time and you have a Halloween avatar

1192
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
that inspired the greatest webcomic ever created,

1193
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Pumpk and the Gang, or whatever it was called.

1194
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Bail Jape.

1195
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I drew that Pumpkin Girl during October,

1196
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and I just thought, that's a cool face.

1197
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'll put it in my profile picture, but Halloween had ended,

1198
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and I thought, wouldn't it be funny to just do the wrong thing all the time?

1199
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So I'm gonna try and keep this tradition going.

1200
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'm going to be Halloween during Christmas,

1201
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and I'm gonna be Christmas during something else.

1202
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
April Fool's or something, I don't know.

1203
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

1204
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I'm gonna change my name when people have changed it back.

1205
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh man, we definitely gotta talk about Valentine's Day as well.

1206
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I think the frustration that Digi expressed towards the Super Halloween nerds

1207
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
is something that if you are a person who likes to watch lots of reviews and analyses,

1208
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
you can relate to people like James Rolfe.

1209
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Halloween is legitimately his religion.

1210
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
He's as fanatical for Halloween as anybody's parents are for God.

1211
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's fucking nuts.

1212
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Remember that fucking guy?

1213
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Most of you have listened to the biggest problem in the universe.

1214
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Remember that fucking guy they had on Two Years in a Row,

1215
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
who was like the Halloween guy,

1216
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
who was very seriously, legitimately trying to argue

1217
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
that Halloween needs to be recognized as a national holiday.

1218
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But his reasoning is because it's cool.

1219
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
He had no real reason, but he was very passionate

1220
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
that this needed to be a real national holiday.

1221
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm just like, what is wrong with you, dude?

1222
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I think what should be is it should be that Halloween,

1223
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
the day after you should have the day off,

1224
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
because everybody does shit all night, especially kids.

1225
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
They gotta go to school the next day and they've been up all night out doing bullshit.

1226
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
That's lame.

1227
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Eating syringe filled candy and whatnot.

1228
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
They're tuckered out.

1229
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Halloween should either, the next day,

1230
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
November 1st should be a day off,

1231
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
or Halloween should be rescheduled to be the last Friday of October,

1232
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
so nobody gets fucked over.

1233
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I think Halloween kind of keeps its punk edge, though,

1234
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
by the fact that choosing to celebrate it

1235
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
is sort of choosing against your other responsibilities.

1236
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
There's something to that.

1237
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's unrecognizedness from the government keeps it punk.

1238
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
When I was a little kid, I definitely liked Halloween more,

1239
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
because my mom was a big Halloween decorator.

1240
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
We had tons of Halloween shit,

1241
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
so she would cover the house in scary spooky crap.

1242
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
There was this pop-out calendar thing,

1243
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
where it was basically like a big spooky mansion,

1244
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and it had a bunch of doors with numbers on them.

1245
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Every day, you would open one of the doors,

1246
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
and there'd be a monster inside.

1247
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It's sort of a game where every day you have to open another door on this thing.

1248
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I think the moment I realized I was too old for Halloween

1249
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
was when I was not excited to open the doors.

1250
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
On the Halloween calendar, it already works.

1251
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'd seen all the monsters so many times,

1252
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
and I don't fucking care.

1253
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
No more trick-or-treating for me.

1254
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Just eating my brother's candy from now on.

1255
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
How do you feel about these...

1256
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You see, high schoolers are even older.

1257
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Guys like ironically trick-or-treating.

1258
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I've seen that. I did this a little bit in high school.

1259
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I think I probably did it a little bit when I was 14,

1260
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
because I was going out with my little brothers anyway.

1261
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I was like 17.

1262
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I was living large and in charge, man.

1263
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But I'm done with that life.

1264
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We used to get...

1265
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
One of the first trick-or-treaters you'd get every night

1266
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
would be a 17-year-old kid

1267
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
with just a little bit of football face paint on,

1268
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and they'd just be wearing their football jersey,

1269
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and they'd be like,

1270
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm like a ghost football player.

1271
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Fuck off.

1272
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
My mom would chew those kids out.

1273
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I legitimately did the whole homeless guy thing at least once,

1274
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
because I was just really lazy.

1275
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I think if you're going to give out candy,

1276
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
you should always have a second bowl of bullshit

1277
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
for people who suck.

1278
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Hey, not bad. Not bad.

1279
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
You should be able to differentiate

1280
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
between good and bad trick-or-treaters,

1281
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
because there is a difference.

1282
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You just give licorice to all the shit ones,

1283
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
and then like...

1284
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
True.

1285
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Re-seize to all the good kids.

1286
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
This year we did not...

1287
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So I live in my own place now.

1288
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
The reason we stopped celebrating Halloween

1289
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
not only was because we moved into a house

1290
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
that was too big for all the decorations.

1291
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
My mom tried to Halloween that front yard.

1292
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You guys know what my front yard looked like.

1293
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's fucking huge.

1294
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
She tried to decorate it,

1295
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
but there just wasn't enough stuff

1296
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
to make it look cohesive or scary.

1297
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So she just kind of gave up.

1298
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We also never once got a trick-or-treater

1299
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
in the nine years we lived there.

1300
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Because you're on a fucking highway.

1301
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah, exactly.

1302
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
No one's going to bring their kids along.

1303
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So when we moved in my new place,

1304
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I was like,

1305
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
oh, we might get trick-or-treaters,

1306
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
but they gave us these little signs

1307
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
that they're like,

1308
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
you have to put this sign on the door

1309
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
to indicate that kids can come to your house

1310
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
or else they won't.

1311
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And we just didn't end up putting it on

1312
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
during those out.

1313
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We bought a bag of just re-seasoned kit-cats,

1314
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
because I was like,

1315
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm going to be the best house on the block.

1316
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm only going to give re-seasoned kit-cats

1317
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
the only two candies that actually matter at all.

1318
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
If I go out on Christmas or Halloween,

1319
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I will throw out all the rest of the candy

1320
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
for my brothers.

1321
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I just want the re-seasoned kit-cats.

1322
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The only really good candy.

1323
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And those flavored Tootsie rolls,

1324
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
the lime ones or whatever.

1325
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I remember so vividly one day trick-or-treating.

1326
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
This is like my greatest memory.

1327
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Starburst is great too,

1328
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
but I got a full-size three musketeers bar.

1329
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
A full-size!

1330
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Hell yeah.

1331
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It was unbelievable.

1332
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It was the greatest day of my life.

1333
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
That's the greatest thing ever.

1334
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
When you get the full-size,

1335
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
you're just like, holy shit.

1336
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It was so decorative.

1337
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I remember this really cool memory

1338
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
of childhood Halloween time

1339
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
where we went trick-or-treating and stuff

1340
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and we got all the candy,

1341
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
but then we brought it into the living room

1342
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and Dad had a cassette of the Monster Mash playing.

1343
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And we were like the three of us,

1344
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
me and my two brothers.

1345
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Something about your dad being there

1346
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
listening to the Monster Mash sounds inherently hilarious.

1347
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's very easy to imagine.

1348
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It goes down listening to Monster Mash.

1349
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Just kind of gyrating a little bit.

1350
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You just reminded me that we had a horror CD

1351
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
that my mom would put on and blast out of the house.

1352
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It was like all these horror-themed songs,

1353
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
but we'd have the window open and be blasting this

1354
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
so when kids came by, they'd hear the spooky music.

1355
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But it was all songs like Monster Mash.

1356
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
These retarded-ass 50 songs that aren't even scary.

1357
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And that was just this memory of that being on in the background.

1358
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And we had this big pile of candy and sweets and stuff.

1359
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We put it all in the middle.

1360
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And then me and my brothers diverted up

1361
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
based on how good our costumes were.

1362
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We argued with it, but it was basically like

1363
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
the bulk of the evening was us deciding who would get what.

1364
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And if there was four of something,

1365
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
we had to decide who would get the extra one.

1366
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And it was a nice memory.

1367
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I do remember loving Trick or Treating.

1368
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I loved making costumes.

1369
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I didn't make a lot, but I remember my favorite one

1370
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
was kind of like at the end of when I was starting to get too old for it,

1371
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
where I made a paper mache Ichigo...

1372
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Kurosaki? Oh my god.

1373
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah, Ichigo Kurosaki Bankai Hollow Mask.

1374
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And I painted it with the things.

1375
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Hell yeah. The Vizard Mask.

1376
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, the Vizard Mask.

1377
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I got like a little plastic katana,

1378
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and I painted it black with poster paint.

1379
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And I walked around and I was so cool.

1380
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I was the coolest kid, except I wasn't.

1381
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
But it was so fun.

1382
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Shit, there's a term in Bleach for like...

1383
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It's called like a flash step, only in Japanese,

1384
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
where you can like...

1385
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's like their teleport equivalent.

1386
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I bet you were just flash stepping everywhere from house to house

1387
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
at light fucking speed using that Bankai.

1388
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh, I was.

1389
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Incredible.

1390
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Yo, are you gonna like turn the subject to like April Fools or some such?

1391
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I was gonna go to Valentine's Day next.

1392
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I wanted to talk about Valentine's Day.

1393
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Oh, so many I forgot about.

1394
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Valentine's Day is a fascinating holiday to me.

1395
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
You know, I kind of like Valentine's Day.

1396
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And I like, like conceptually, I think it's a good idea.

1397
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I like that there's some holidays that are not for everybody.

1398
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah, it's interesting.

1399
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And everybody who like...

1400
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
There's always like the singles awareness day

1401
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
and all that shit on holiday on Valentine's Day,

1402
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
which I don't...

1403
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I feel like that is people trying to co-op someone.

1404
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Like, look, Valentine's Day is just not for single people.

1405
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Like, you don't have to like make it about yourself.

1406
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You don't have to like make a big show.

1407
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Oh, everybody else is in a relationship and I'm depressed about it.

1408
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Like, just don't celebrate it.

1409
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Just ignore it.

1410
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It's one thing for it to be a holiday for not for them.

1411
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Like, we don't celebrate, I don't know, Scottish holidays.

1412
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But the same thing is that there's not like tons of Scottish merchandise

1413
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
in the stores all over the place.

1414
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's true for ages.

1415
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah, it does kind of shine in your face.

1416
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I don't think Valentine's Day isn't like that.

1417
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Like, it's not nearly as bad as Christmas.

1418
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
There's not like music for it.

1419
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I mean, online.

1420
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's hard to like forget that it happened.

1421
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Yeah, if you're just like going to Amazon to buy something,

1422
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
you're gonna know it's Valentine's Day.

1423
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I mean, I know that the...

1424
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Like, I like the Valentine's Day, like, even as a single person.

1425
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Like, I like it as this just general celebration of like love.

1426
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Like, I love when everyone does the waifu like cake,

1427
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
where like anime fans will always like take a picture of them

1428
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
like with a real cake in front of their monitor and their waifu on it.

1429
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And I fucking love that.

1430
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And I did...

1431
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So one year on my anime blog, it was Valentine's Day.

1432
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Everybody was making their Valentine's post,

1433
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
bunch of people with cake and their waifu.

1434
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Everyone's just making waifu jokes.

1435
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So I wanted to do that.

1436
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Jokes, he says.

1437
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And I had my waifu pillow of...

1438
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
What's her name from Senkoku Basura, Uesubi Kenshin.

1439
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Oh yes, my waifu.

1440
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
What's her name?

1441
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
She literally wasn't my waifu.

1442
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I just had this random pillow, because it was like cheap,

1443
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and it came with a magazine.

1444
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And I just wanted to own one.

1445
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So I had this dakimakura,

1446
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and I took a picture of like me like,

1447
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
like hugging the dakimakura,

1448
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
making this like wild and crazy face.

1449
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But like, I also wanted there to be the food element.

1450
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Like, I'm sharing a meal with her, but I didn't have any cake.

1451
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So I just made myself this enormous egg salad sandwich.

1452
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's just this photo.

1453
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I'm gonna find it for you guys.

1454
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
There's a photo of me like, making this like crazy face,

1455
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
hugging a hug pillow, and holding a gigantic egg salad sandwich.

1456
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And it's like, happy Valentine's Day from me and my waifu.

1457
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's fucking great.

1458
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
There really should be a holiday that involves eating egg salad, by the way.

1459
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And this, by the way, is me when I'm like 17.

1460
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So like, I look terrible in this picture as well.

1461
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I gotta find it though.

1462
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You know, what would make Valentine's Day like,

1463
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
not depressing for so many people?

1464
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
If part of the holiday was, you're expected and encouraged to

1465
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
like confess love to whoever it is, and it's not weird.

1466
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's like, it is not weird.

1467
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
That's part of the holiday.

1468
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It is not weird, no matter what.

1469
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That is technically a big part of Valentine's Day,

1470
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
especially in Japan.

1471
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It's like the confession, like giving people chocolate

1472
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and like confessing that you have feelings for them.

1473
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
But it not being weird.

1474
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I don't know how you can beat that demon.

1475
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's impossible, but it would make it like not a problem

1476
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
if it was just a normal for people to say that

1477
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
and to get it out of their system.

1478
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Because a lot of the time it just reminds them of it

1479
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and they feel like they can't say and it's just bad.

1480
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Like I never used to like it.

1481
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I don't think about it too much now.

1482
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And in fact, the large amount of people who constantly like

1483
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
poo poo it every year makes me like it more

1484
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
because I don't like being with the crowd on that.

1485
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
That's stupid.

1486
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I don't want to wallow.

1487
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And what do you think about this thing?

1488
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It's kind of what Digi was saying before

1489
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
about co-opting it for people who don't really deserve it.

1490
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Like when you're a kid and they make you give like

1491
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
cards to like literally everyone

1492
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
instead of just like one person or something.

1493
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1494
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, that's kind of bullshit.

1495
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I hate like fucking thank you cards for birthday shit.

1496
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It's like I don't...

1497
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Chew chew chew.

1498
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
We should not do people the disservice

1499
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
of making people think that they are cared about

1500
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
if they are in fact undeserving

1501
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
of people liking them or caring about them

1502
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
because then they won't improve themselves

1503
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
and you know, fuck that.

1504
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
They should know that they're worthless

1505
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
if they are worthless so that they can one day not be worthless.

1506
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It says be mine and it has a picture of a bee on it.

1507
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Yeah, I don't like cards

1508
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
because I don't feel like they're really expressing anything.

1509
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You just picked it.

1510
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
You didn't make it.

1511
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Ever since I was a kid I've always been like...

1512
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
These don't make cards a lot.

1513
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Yeah, I wanted to make cards but then I just...

1514
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I just feel like holidays in general

1515
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
they're meant to relax after work

1516
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and I've never in my life felt like

1517
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I've gotten enough work done to deserve it

1518
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
so that's why I'm having a problem with holidays right now.

1519
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
You know what?

1520
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Actually, this is a thing about holidays in general.

1521
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
My favorite thing to do on holidays

1522
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
and I kind of feel this on like...

1523
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
For example, my favorite day to exercise is on Friday

1524
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
because everybody takes Friday off

1525
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and there's a lazy piece of shit

1526
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and so when I'm in there I get to feel so superior

1527
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
to everyone who's not in the gym on Friday.

1528
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And similarly, my favorite day to like go for a run

1529
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
or workout is like on Christmas Day

1530
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
or something like that.

1531
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I feel so superior to all those waste space out there

1532
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
who are not grinding away this day.

1533
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, it's the best. It's the best.

1534
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's my favorite.

1535
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It's my favorite day to do work on Christmas

1536
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
and holidays when everyone else is lazing around.

1537
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Okay, unfortunately I couldn't find the picture

1538
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
with the egg salad sandwich.

1539
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I did find a very similar picture of me

1540
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
with my waifu pillow that is missing the sandwich

1541
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
but let me read you the...

1542
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Maybe she ate it.

1543
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I do have, because unfortunately the post I made

1544
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
was on an old website where all the images are broken

1545
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
but I still have the text from it.

1546
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It says in line with the otaku tradition

1547
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
of sharing a nice Valentine's Day confection with your waifu,

1548
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
here you can see myself and waifu Uesugi Kenshin

1549
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
munching down on my special God's Left Nut Sandwich.

1550
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It's got turkey, ham, and roast beef

1551
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
between an egg salad spread

1552
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
made from mayonnaise, mustard, Texas peat, hot sauce,

1553
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
one boiled egg, salt, pepper, and garlic.

1554
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
All on two gigantic whole wheat sandwich bread slices.

1555
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Damn good eating.

1556
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So a happy Valentine's Day to everyone,

1557
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
whether you're celebrating it with your waifu or all alone.

1558
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Watching people get senselessly murdered out of spite.

1559
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Because I'd also written a post that day about...

1560
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Because Valentine's Day is named after a massacre.

1561
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Like, it's from the Saint Valentine's Day.

1562
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I thought he drew the snakes out of Ireland or something.

1563
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Isn't that...

1564
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Well, here, let me read you this Patrick.

1565
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Let me read you the intro.

1566
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
That's right.

1567
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I made a post called Saint Valentine's Day

1568
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
and Five Senseless Anime Murders.

1569
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It says, you've heard it before, no one's really sure

1570
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
about the origins of Saint Valentine's Day.

1571
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Historians have only found traces of various stories

1572
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
wherein someone named Saint Valentine

1573
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
always gets horribly murdered by the end.

1574
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And your candy hearts are stained red with this blood.

1575
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So then I made a video about, like,

1576
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
my top five anime massacre scenes,

1577
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
and that was my Valentine's Day post.

1578
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Word.

1579
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
The Otaku audience would appreciate that, I think.

1580
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1581
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Go check it out.

1582
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
If you want to read posts I wrote almost a decade ago.

1583
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
But yeah, Valentine's Day is an okay.

1584
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It's an okay boy.

1585
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I mean, I'm the kind of cuck who will buy,

1586
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
like, lots of shit for a woman anyways, so...

1587
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Yeah, I like all these things.

1588
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
You know, that's the thing.

1589
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I actually hate the violence that is imposed upon me

1590
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
by society of forcing me to buy gifts.

1591
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You should have seen me buying gifts this Christmas.

1592
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Oh my god, it was fucking agony.

1593
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I hate spending money on these fucking assholes.

1594
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Like, the people in my life who know that I care about them,

1595
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
they know that I care about them.

1596
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I don't want to be fucking tricked into buying people gifts.

1597
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Hey, I just love how you described, like,

1598
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
the cultural obligation to give gifts as violence.

1599
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Who are you, Stefan Malanu?

1600
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I know, right?

1601
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm exaggerating, but still.

1602
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Interesting point you bring up there, Nate,

1603
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
because, like, I think one of the things I like about holidays

1604
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
is that, and I think this is what a lot of people like about it,

1605
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
is it gives you an excuse to give people presents,

1606
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
because most people are not thoughtful.

1607
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Like, most people will not buy their friends and family shit.

1608
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And, like, in many ways,

1609
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I do think the holiday is part of the problem,

1610
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
because it gives you an excuse to not be thoughtful.

1611
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It's like, well, I'll buy something for him on Christmas,

1612
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
but, like, every other day of the year,

1613
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
you never think about that person.

1614
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But, like, sometimes you meet those people,

1615
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
those legitimately great people who just, like,

1616
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
buy you things because they saw it

1617
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and thought you would like it.

1618
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
What are the best gifts for spontaneous

1619
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
and at some point randomly in the year?

1620
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Spontaneity and thoughtfulness

1621
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
are the cornerstones of any good gift, obviously.

1622
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Oh, man.

1623
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Gifts like elevator sex are best when they're spontaneous.

1624
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Exactly. Oh!

1625
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think the funny thing about holidays is, like,

1626
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
because I love giving people, yeah, those kind of spontaneous gifts,

1627
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
if it's, like, the right one, which is very rare.

1628
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But on holidays, because it is so mechanical

1629
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
that, like, you get somebody a gift,

1630
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I usually just, like, literally give people

1631
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
exactly what, like, like,

1632
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
like, I'll go shop for it with them.

1633
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You know, like, I don't care if it's a surprise.

1634
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Like, I'm gonna spend a hundred plus dollars on you

1635
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
for Christmas.

1636
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It might as well be something you really want, you know?

1637
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So, like, let's make sure it's something good.

1638
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The ideogation does make it much more difficult

1639
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
and less personal and just less special.

1640
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah, exactly.

1641
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Like, I bought, this was the worst thing

1642
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I've ever done in my life.

1643
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I had to buy my sister's boyfriend a gift,

1644
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
and I bought him some fucking mustache wax.

1645
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I've never met the man. I know nothing of this man.

1646
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And I had to buy him a Christmas...

1647
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I had to buy him a fucking Christmas gift.

1648
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
That feels, like, dirty.

1649
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I feel gross that I had to do that.

1650
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Like, something has gone wrong

1651
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
along this system that forces me to buy someone

1652
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
who I have no fucking connection to

1653
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
whatsoever a goddamn Christmas gift.

1654
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Something is wrong.

1655
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You got it, you got it.

1656
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I was bullied.

1657
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I developed an amazing technique for gift giving,

1658
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and I think a bunch of you

1659
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
have been given this gift from me as well,

1660
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
and you will continue to be done so.

1661
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
In fact, you'll probably get this on the 26th,

1662
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
because a couple of you I'm going to be meeting

1663
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
right after Christmas.

1664
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Is it dinner?

1665
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
My gift is always I will buy you food,

1666
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
because, like, I love eating out with people,

1667
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I love buying people food,

1668
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I will just cover everyone's checks on Christmas,

1669
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
and that's my gift, you know?

1670
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
That is an amazing, yeah, you gave me that for my birthday

1671
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
at Walker House fucking A.

1672
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah, great, you know?

1673
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I love just buying people food

1674
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
and being like, there you go.

1675
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That's not a very thoughtful gift, though.

1676
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's not thoughtful,

1677
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
but everyone will be happy with it.

1678
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And it's very me.

1679
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's something that comes from my personality.

1680
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It's my problem with most holidays

1681
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
is that they're so cookie cutter,

1682
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I just don't feel like I'm being creative,

1683
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
and it just feels stupid.

1684
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
The best thing that ever happened

1685
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
to Christmas for me as an adult,

1686
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
because as a kid, we got game consoles

1687
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
every year, you know, whatever,

1688
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
and it was like video games and anime DVDs,

1689
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
whatever, we're old now, right?

1690
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The best thing that ever happened is that

1691
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
my dad, because he used to be my dad

1692
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
would always ask us, like, what do you want for Christmas,

1693
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
all that shit, and then when we went back

1694
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
to doing traditional Christmas, he was like,

1695
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm not asking anybody what they want anymore,

1696
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I'm just gonna buy you guys shit.

1697
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Like, I am just gonna show up with a bunch of shit

1698
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
that none of you know what it is,

1699
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
and weirdly enough,

1700
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
my dad is amazing at giving gifts.

1701
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
My dad is the one responsible for my robe.

1702
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
My dad's the one responsible for my

1703
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
giant coat that's in the

1704
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
fat and dangerous video.

1705
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
The iconic coat, the iconic robe.

1706
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
He's responsible for buying me

1707
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
silk pajamas

1708
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
and slippers

1709
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
to wear around the house,

1710
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
which I didn't use to do, but after he bought

1711
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
them for me, I realized I loved them.

1712
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
So a lot of my image has been crafted

1713
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
by Christmas gifts my dad has given me,

1714
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
because he knows how

1715
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
to find stuff that he knows I will wear.

1716
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And I look at it and I go, oh,

1717
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
fuck, you're a genius.

1718
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Granted, that's only half of the stuff.

1719
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The other half is like, he tried to buy me

1720
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
like a home brewing kit, that was

1721
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
a total waste of money.

1722
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
He bought me a rice maker, I ended up giving to shade,

1723
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
so it doesn't always work, but you know.

1724
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Sure, but it's a net positive,

1725
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
clearly. That is

1726
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
absolutely the downside

1727
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
of a cutthroat capitalist family

1728
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
like mine is, where like,

1729
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
my dad specifically,

1730
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
sorry dad, but I blame you for this,

1731
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
he will just ask me, just tell

1732
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
me what you want, I'll buy it.

1733
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And so what he doesn't realize he's doing there

1734
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
is he's putting literally all the work

1735
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
on me to like, figure out exactly

1736
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
what to buy.

1737
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I consider a good gift is to

1738
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
do the work for, show you care,

1739
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
go out and get me something, like put in the

1740
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
it's your job to do this.

1741
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
What we used to do is my dad would give us

1742
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
my dad would always tell us like

1743
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
you have $500 for Christmas.

1744
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So like, you know, figure out what you want

1745
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but go up to $500.

1746
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And so I would sit there for like an entire day

1747
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
granted I love doing this, but I would sit there

1748
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
on like Amazon all day like crunching

1749
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
numbers, like trying to figure out

1750
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
what combination of things that I

1751
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
most want will equate to $500.

1752
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I feel a little hypocritical on it

1753
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
because in some ways like you're saying

1754
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
it is good, like I can get exactly

1755
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
the things I want doing it, but like there is

1756
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
a bit of magic that's lost in the

1757
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
little there. It's just better when it's

1758
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
fucking spontaneous. Now stop me if I've

1759
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
set this story on the BZB before

1760
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
but it's the best thing that was ever

1761
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
given to me and it was how

1762
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I got my computer, the one

1763
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
for editing. Basically I was beginning

1764
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
my video, YouTubeing career

1765
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and the first step was to buy a microphone

1766
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
so I got all the shit, got the interface

1767
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
and I plugged it into my computer at the time

1768
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
and it didn't work. There was like a driver

1769
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
issue. Now I could have like, you know, gone

1770
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
downstairs to record it in the computer in

1771
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
but like, I'm way too much of a teenager

1772
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
for that shit. I don't want to record

1773
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
when everyone's around. I would die. So I spent

1774
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
a straight week trying to figure out how to fix

1775
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
the drivers and there was finally the nuclear

1776
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
option one night. I'm like, alright, I'm going to push

1777
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
this nuclear option and see if it fries my computer

1778
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
or fixes the problem. Woke up the next

1779
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
day, fried my computer. So I'm like

1780
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
ah, so I walk downstairs

1781
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
all like just defeated, just sort of

1782
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
like in a serenity, like a Jesse

1783
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
level of defeat at this point, right?

1784
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I walk downstairs

1785
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and my dad's in the kitchen

1786
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
and I'm in the kitchen and

1787
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I tell my dad what's been going on, you know

1788
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
how like my entire week has just been

1789
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
like go to work, you know, do the business

1790
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
the window cleaning business with my dad, come

1791
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
home, try to fix the microphone problem

1792
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
no progress, right? And

1793
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
my dad who had just 30

1794
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
minutes prior looked over

1795
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
the finances for our business

1796
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
for the previous month and it was

1797
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
like the biggest windfall

1798
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
profit month our business had ever had,

1799
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
right? Super in the black

1800
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
so he's like on fire right

1801
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
now with excitement about the money

1802
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
and I come down and talk about this and he goes

1803
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
let's buy you a new computer

1804
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
and I was just like, oh, it was

1805
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
super cool. So like literally

1806
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
we packed up and like

1807
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
my dad is not very

1808
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
spontaneous, like he's very like

1809
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
oh, we're going to go somewhere today, like there's going to be a

1810
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
fucking project to get ready to go, right?

1811
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Everything has got to be planned. So he never

1812
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
does anything this all at once

1813
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and we got a new computer and just like within

1814
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
three hours I had a new computer

1815
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
and it was just

1816
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
and then literally that evening he was like looking at more

1817
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
finances and turns out it actually wasn't all that good

1818
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
after all. So I was just in the perfect

1819
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
fucking window, the perfect

1820
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
fucking window to get a new computer. I know I've

1821
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
told this before but that just reminds me of

1822
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
of like me and my brother like saved

1823
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
up all our pennies and allowance for like a year

1824
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
so that we could buy a PlayStation 1

1825
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
and we buy like that in a couple games

1826
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
and then just on the way home my dad's

1827
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
like you guys need a TV. Let's get you a TV

1828
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
too. He just bought us a TV

1829
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
and I was just such a

1830
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
wonderful thing to do. Yeah, that was great.

1831
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It touches me to this fucking day. I love that TV.

1832
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I literally

1833
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
love that TV.

1834
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
What are the holidays have we not talked about yet?

1835
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
April Fool's Day, the piece of

1836
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
shit, terrible holiday. Didn't we have

1837
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
a discussion about April Fool's at some point?

1838
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I think we did. I know

1839
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Hippo was on a podcast.

1840
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The same way as Hippo was with Valentine's, I'm very

1841
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
fucking against people being against April Fool's.

1842
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
People were being such hipsters like it's not funny

1843
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
but shut up. It's a great holiday. It's a great

1844
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
fucking holiday. It's overused. It's

1845
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
abused. It's not a great holiday

1846
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
but I don't like complaining about it. Yeah, exactly.

1847
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I don't like April Fool's

1848
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
That's stupid.

1849
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I've also heard the origin of April Fool's

1850
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Day. It might be fake

1851
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
but I've heard it. Who knows the origin

1852
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
of April Fool's Day?

1853
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
No one? Okay, so

1854
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Mr. April is a fool

1855
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and they called him that. So originally

1856
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
at some point, hundreds of years ago or what

1857
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
not, the beginning of the year

1858
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
was April the first. Like that was New Year's

1859
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
was April and so

1860
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
at some point they changed it. I don't know why

1861
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
and so there would be a lot of people

1862
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
on April 1st who forgot about that

1863
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
being like, hey, happy new year

1864
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
to which they'd be like

1865
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
you April Fool

1866
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
you have no idea

1867
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
you don't remember and they're like, oh shit

1868
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I'm an April Fool

1869
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
and so I guess it just became

1870
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I really want this to be a true story

1871
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm an April Fool

1872
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I realize

1873
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
that that makes a lot of sense because that's the beginning

1874
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
of spring kind of and then

1875
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
that means the year is in line with the seasons

1876
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and I like that's how Japanese school

1877
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
works, right? Like their year starts

1878
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah, I think so

1879
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I thought the origin was

1880
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
like the Ninja Turtles were hanging out

1881
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
in their sex dungeon and April

1882
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
falls in and she's like

1883
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
ooh took my turtle

1884
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
you know

1885
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
something like that

1886
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I like April Fool's a whole lot because

1887
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I think that

1888
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
it used to be anyway

1889
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
that was the day the internet got creative

1890
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
because everyone would

1891
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
it wasn't just that people did something interesting

1892
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
but it was always something way different from what you're used to

1893
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
the best was the web comic XKCD

1894
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
which is a stick figure comic

1895
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
that was really popular in the late 2000s

1896
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
and

1897
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
April Fool's

1898
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
because he was a programmer and he would

1899
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
completely re-design the site into

1900
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
some kind of elaborate game

1901
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
like some kind of weird like

1902
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
it either be like a text adventure or

1903
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
just some kind of crazy ruse

1904
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
if it's done well it's great

1905
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
yeah a lot of the internet would turn into that

1906
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and there were annoying parts like for instance

1907
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
don't try to download any torrents that day

1908
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
because it's all going to be weird shit

1909
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
but sometimes it would be hilarious

1910
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
like people would put out troll subs for every new anime

1911
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
cause April first is like

1912
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
the first day of the new season for anime

1913
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
so there's always going to be some shows that come out

1914
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
like the first episodes that day

1915
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and people would always make troll subs for them

1916
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
probably still do and it's fucking hilarious

1917
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
but um

1918
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
the first time I watched Queens Blade

1919
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
episode 1 was April Fool's troll sub

1920
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
but like

1921
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
websites would just get crazy

1922
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and there's so much stuff that

1923
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
none of that can be done anymore

1924
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
because too many people make their money online

1925
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
and you can't change it that severely

1926
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
cause like youtube

1927
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
the year when rick rolling

1928
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
really caught on youtube made it so

1929
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
every link on the front page

1930
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
took you to rick roll

1931
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
like 2009 or so every link

1932
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
and like that was fucking epic

1933
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
as like a gag but like youtube could

1934
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
never do that now cause it would ruin

1935
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
people's like careers

1936
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
like people would have like

1937
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
fucking thousands of dollars just like

1938
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
sapped away because they didn't get the click

1939
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
through that day you know

1940
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
and like it's just

1941
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
it's sad to think

1942
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
that this is just one more victim

1943
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
of like the internet's

1944
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
imagination you know

1945
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I've never liked

1946
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
the way the

1947
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
meta of April Fool's has shifted

1948
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
like it did it used to be very creative

1949
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
and it's not so much

1950
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I mean it is also that

1951
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
people and websites

1952
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
can't do that now because of money

1953
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
but like creators and stuff

1954
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
they used to have like creative

1955
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
things that they did and

1956
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
you didn't always expect everybody

1957
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
to do it because it was like

1958
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
you know not everybody it wasn't that huge

1959
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
but now it's like

1960
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
if you don't make an April Fool's video

1961
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
that's the big twist

1962
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
like if you make something that isn't lazy

1963
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
and isn't stupid and isn't

1964
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
then you're actually

1965
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I was remembering back when I was on Newgrounds

1966
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
a lot because like every year there was like

1967
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
they had like the McDonald's parody

1968
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
for April Fool's they had Numa grounds

1969
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Poo grounds, China grounds

1970
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Kevin Bacon Day but I remember

1971
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
2011 was when Tom Fulp announced on the site

1972
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
guys we always go too far

1973
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
with our April Fool's they're too obvious

1974
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
this one is very

1975
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
very subtle and I remember

1976
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
thinking like wait what was the parody

1977
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
because I remember like people swarming the

1978
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
boards trying to figure it out

1979
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
so it looked it up just now there was no joke

1980
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
there was the joke that nothing

1981
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
changed

1982
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
yeah I love doing April Fool's videos

1983
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
because I try to think

1984
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
like I don't just want it to be a fake

1985
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
video I want there to be some point

1986
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
behind it like the year

1987
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
where I did the Attack on Titan review

1988
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
and it was just like all the most generic

1989
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
ideas of reviews imaginable

1990
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
and don't forget them when people do stuff

1991
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
like that because I just I want to be kept on

1992
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
my toes you know like I want

1993
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
to every once in a while something shakes

1994
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
it up and like because it's April Fool's

1995
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Day like it just gives

1996
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
everybody a little bit of an in

1997
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
like when Rick and Morty came out

1998
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and like they the new season of Rick and Morty

1999
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
they just like ran the debut episode all

2000
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
night long on April Fool's and like

2001
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
it's such a weird shocking

2002
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
thing to do but because it was April Fool's

2003
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
people are like accepting it

2004
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
because right no that's what they

2005
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
don't forget the legendary serial

2006
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
punctuation review of Duke Duke and forever

2007
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
back when we thought that game would never exist like

2008
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
the joke of that video

2009
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
wouldn't have worked nearly

2010
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
as well if there hadn't been a holiday for it

2011
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it's the same way as you know National Brownie Day

2012
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
is just an excuse for everyone to have a brownie

2013
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
it's an in right it's always an excuse

2014
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and comedy

2015
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
relies on set ups so April Fool's

2016
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Day provides a very unique

2017
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
once a year setup

2018
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
that certain jokes need to survive

2019
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
but but there's also

2020
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
what about the fact that like every April Fool's

2021
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Day everyone's like okay

2022
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
what's it gonna be this time so like there's an inherent

2023
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
like anticipation there's always

2024
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
there's always the joke

2025
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
there's always a challenge right you always have to

2026
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
the way I see it the way I see it

2027
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
you gotta look at April Fool's like this

2028
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
if you are gonna post something

2029
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
on April Fool's Day make it a joke

2030
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
if you have something you need to post that day

2031
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
just save it for April

2032
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
second like like like that

2033
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
that day should just be like

2034
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
weird joke content

2035
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and I think that because there's a lot of

2036
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
people who get mad like all

2037
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
it's all mistracks I just want my normal content

2038
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and I'm like dude

2039
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
like people who are putting out normal content

2040
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
on that day I think are like muddying it

2041
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
like it should just be weird

2042
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
shit all day and then like

2043
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I don't know I think that we're allowing it to

2044
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
fucking take over the area for the day

2045
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I wanted to take over I want there to be

2046
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
a time where everyone is just forced

2047
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
to experience

2048
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
weird shit all day exactly

2049
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
yeah I want to stop making things

2050
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
it's not really necessarily

2051
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
it's not really necessarily there to

2052
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
trick people although it's a sweet bonus

2053
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
it's really just an excuse to be a fucky

2054
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
for a day

2055
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I mean it's not

2056
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
multiple things I was gonna say one

2057
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
a lot of the time it's not that weird

2058
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
it's just sort of bad

2059
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
a lot of it's shit sure

2060
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
and it just makes me feel upset

2061
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
that they even spent

2062
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
any seconds making this

2063
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
terrible thing

2064
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
what happens with all the holidays though

2065
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
there's always gonna be the channels who are like

2066
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
last minute oh I gotta have something

2067
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
for this holiday let me throw some bullshit up

2068
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and they'll make like a 40 second

2069
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
you know

2070
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
April Fool and you're like I knew it was an April Fool's

2071
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
video because it was 40 seconds long and it came out on

2072
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
April 1st like what is the

2073
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
joke here you know but like if you're gonna

2074
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
go all out with it then it's worthwhile

2075
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
what I would say is that

2076
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I think it could be

2077
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
if you're going to post on April Fool's you should

2078
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
try to make it funny even if it's short and whatever

2079
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
but I don't think

2080
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
you shouldn't post a real thing

2081
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
but if you're going

2082
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
to post a real video it should be

2083
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
the most bombastically

2084
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
incredible video you've ever made

2085
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
and like two hours long

2086
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
like a feature length film on YouTube

2087
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
just so that people can be like

2088
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
what? or

2089
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
or you should announce

2090
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
something bombastically unrealistic

2091
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
on April 1st

2092
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
people think that it's a joke for months

2093
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
and then actually do it

2094
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
that's a clever funny thing to do

2095
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
yeah that's what I'm saying

2096
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
it should be a day of funny clever videos

2097
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and like personally I put

2098
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
more effort into my April Fool's videos

2099
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
than probably any other holiday videos I've done

2100
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
because every time I do try to jump on holiday bandwagon

2101
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
it's always last minute because I'm not passionate

2102
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
about the holidays I don't give a fuck

2103
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
about Halloween

2104
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
like I've made like maybe

2105
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
one or two Halloween videos and it's always

2106
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
like super last minute

2107
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
and it just sounds like

2108
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
alright let's drag out the five horror anime

2109
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
that exist and talk about those again

2110
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
oh somebody's going to write about Junji Ito

2111
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
big fucking surprise because there's nothing else

2112
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
to like tie Halloween to anime

2113
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
because there's like no horror anime

2114
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
out there you know and like we're all going to

2115
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
be tired and wrote if we keep doing the same thing

2116
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
every Halloween or every Christmas

2117
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
every Christmas is going to be

2118
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
we're past that well yeah we are

2119
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
but like if people keep doing it

2120
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
like you are officially contributing

2121
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
to rote bullshit

2122
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
but April Fool's Day

2123
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
the floodgates are open for you to do literally

2124
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
anything and like you can really

2125
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
mix it up and like show people

2126
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
how you can be creative outside of your format

2127
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
you know and I think that's what makes it cool

2128
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
well you should

2129
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
like celebrate St. Patrick's Day on April Fool's

2130
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
that's what you should do

2131
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
that's a good idea let's

2132
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I think we've touched quite a few holidays here

2133
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I just want to say one last thing

2134
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I just realized

2135
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
that is quite accurate for

2136
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
like people like

2137
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
like if you have

2138
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
instead of making something that's just

2139
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
bad or like shitty

2140
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
as a joke you could just show them

2141
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
some other aspect of

2142
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
the stuff you do like you could

2143
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
you could post a rap on the main channel

2144
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Digi or something like

2145
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
as an excuse

2146
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
like it's always an excuse

2147
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
an excuse to show your main

2148
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
people something that else

2149
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
that you do very well

2150
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
oh my god that is a good idea

2151
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
that might be what I do on April Fool's

2152
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
next year it's like just post one of my rap

2153
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
like some really fucking weird

2154
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
rap music video

2155
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
with me like although

2156
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I don't know if that's what happened

2157
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
when Bro Science made

2158
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
his rap video I don't know if that was on April Fool's

2159
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
or not but that did not get received

2160
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
well but that's unrelated

2161
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
well it's more of an excuse

2162
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
than just any other day I guess

2163
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
but then people are going to think that like oh yeah

2164
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
this is a joke like oh it's shit

2165
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
agree well if they like it

2166
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
but it changes the way they're going to pursue it

2167
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
okay but whatever have to have the comments

2168
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
on all my raps are always like

2169
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
oh my god he can actually rap

2170
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
like they always expect it to be a joke

2171
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
you know yeah yeah

2172
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
okay guys good talk

2173
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
let's go to questions

2174
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
oh yeah I got a great

2175
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
extremely related question

2176
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
from the PCP fan

2177
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
discord which you have access to

2178
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
if you're a patron

2179
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
procrastinator's patron lounge

2180
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
patreon.com

2181
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
we usually answer questions from there

2182
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
vulture asks

2183
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
what's your guys' new year's resolutions

2184
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
didn't we answer that

2185
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
literally every time for the last

2186
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
like six months or so

2187
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
4k

2188
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I don't I think so

2189
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
4k I can never remember

2190
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
4k 120 hertz

2191
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
well I haven't been on if we have

2192
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I'm undecided

2193
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
if my new year's resolution should be like

2194
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
something I realistically know I'm going to do

2195
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
or something I like hope to do

2196
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I think that's the more responsible one

2197
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
it's like to set your goal high

2198
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
so that you have to like really

2199
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
work to reach it

2200
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I've already made my new year's resolution

2201
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
and it's not a new year's resolution

2202
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
because I made it earlier

2203
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
so I don't have one

2204
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
that's the smartest thing to do

2205
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
my new year's resolution is to make

2206
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
six figures this year

2207
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
oh that's a good one

2208
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I've had a lot of money based

2209
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
ones in the last few years

2210
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I guess my just yeah

2211
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
my year resolution is to

2212
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
go full time with the shit so we'll see

2213
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
we'll see how that works out

2214
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Tom do you have any new year's resolutions you want to talk about

2215
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I haven't

2216
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
really put too much thought into it

2217
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I was thinking probably I'm just going to make

2218
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
my new year that I actually get in shape

2219
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I know it's super fucking basic

2220
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
but I'm going to be 30

2221
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I feel like I can't go into my 30's

2222
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
being fat

2223
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
so fuck that shit

2224
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
it's amazing how much you can transform yourself

2225
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
physically over the span of just one year

2226
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
if you're dedicated to this stuff

2227
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Tom are you going to be the first 30 year old

2228
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
in the PCP is that coming

2229
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Ben right a little bit

2230
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Ben will be in April

2231
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Ben will be 30 I believe

2232
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Ben will be first

2233
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
we can never go back guys

2234
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
yeah we're getting old

2235
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
we'll be in there

2236
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I have to do something impressive

2237
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
to hit 30 because

2238
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I'm going to have a crisis

2239
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I'm going to have a mental crisis

2240
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
and I might just kill myself it's very possible

2241
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
it's good that you're anticipating though

2242
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
it'll give you some runway to try to steer

2243
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
steer it correctly

2244
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I need something really good to happen before November 8th

2245
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
and I turn 30 otherwise I'm just going to be like

2246
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
my whole life has just been a complete

2247
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
joke

2248
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
just don't kill yourself on your birthday

2249
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
or the next day as those are also

2250
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
my dad and girlfriend's birthdays

2251
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
so

2252
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
it would be a real downer

2253
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
if you kill yourself

2254
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I'll give you convenience if you kill yourself

2255
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
give me like a two day lead

2256
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
to celebrate my family's birthdays

2257
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I'm glad that your

2258
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
girlfriend's

2259
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
comfort for their birthdays is more important to you

2260
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
than your actual death

2261
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I'm just saying die on like the 10th

2262
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
so I can grieve you not on someone's birthday

2263
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
you know

2264
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
like if I'm going to be in mourning

2265
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I'd rather not ruin someone else's

2266
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
birthday you know

2267
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
so just let me know

2268
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I'm going to make sure you don't die

2269
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
alright from

2270
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I can't decide

2271
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
my new year's resolution is to not be

2272
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
tipped over when people do questions

2273
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I have a role to play

2274
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
what's gonna happen

2275
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
my resolution is really just

2276
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
not eat really delicious unhealthy food

2277
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
all the time just because it's offered to me

2278
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
because it's only because it's offered to me

2279
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
if I'm just like alone with my own devices

2280
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
as I was

2281
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
in Digi's house where you had to eat your own food

2282
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I just like you know as long as I could walk

2283
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
to the store I would just eat healthy food

2284
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and I feel better in the body

2285
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
but you know if someone's offering me chimichangas

2286
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I can't pass them up

2287
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
so yeah pretty boring resolution

2288
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
alright instead of a resolution

2289
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I have a new year's resolve

2290
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
because it sounds cool

2291
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
my new year's resolve is to have

2292
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
a video on hypocrite

2293
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
every single week until the end of the year

2294
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
and I want them to be recorded

2295
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
and done by

2296
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
June

2297
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I want to do the entire year

2298
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
of content in half a year

2299
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
that's my goal

2300
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
like so many of us have tried to do

2301
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I have succeeded in this by the way

2302
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I have made this

2303
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
not the whole year like that

2304
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
but I have successfully worked months ahead of myself

2305
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and I know it's doable

2306
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
especially at one video a week

2307
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I think you can do it

2308
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
because this man put out a video almost every day for a month

2309
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
no you did do a whole month

2310
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
and then a second month almost every day

2311
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
with the Kirby month

2312
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
well I wouldn't call it almost every day

2313
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
but anyways

2314
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
the next question

2315
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
this one I just want to read because it's funny

2316
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
it asks

2317
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
if you have siblings

2318
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
who is your parents' favorite son

2319
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
also for Nate

2320
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
where did your parents go wrong with Ben

2321
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
where did they fuck up

2322
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
it was right at the start

2323
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
he just went down

2324
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
when he came out

2325
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
he's like

2326
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
for my one piece of reading

2327
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
comrades you'll know that I am the

2328
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Rosinante and Ben is the evil Doe Flamingo

2329
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
only reverse the Chad

2330
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
roles between the two

2331
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and you just got all the worst stuff was Ben

2332
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
all the great stuff was me

2333
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
that's all I've got to say about it

2334
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
it was pure genetics

2335
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
alright here's one from the gobs

2336
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
what's your opinion on snow

2337
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I'm curious about this

2338
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
mine has changed a lot

2339
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I like Jon Snow

2340
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I'm with Jesse from Pokemon

2341
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
in saying snow, snow, I love it so

2342
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
that's uh yeah

2343
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
remember that one

2344
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Jesse had to eat snow

2345
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
remember when Jesse was poor in that Pokemon episode

2346
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and she fantasized about when she was a kid

2347
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
they would eat like snow sandwiches

2348
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
and like snow desert

2349
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I remember snow sandwiches

2350
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Jesse should do a remake

2351
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
of that song

2352
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
no you gotta have the Kendrick Lamar

2353
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'll never mind

2354
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
anyway

2355
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
so it's snowing balls outside

2356
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
right now

2357
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I'm living in a park

2358
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
like the exact like city

2359
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
in America that gets the most snow

2360
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
like that is this area

2361
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
is like the shit storm

2362
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
part of the world

2363
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
and I gotta say

2364
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
it's interesting

2365
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
back where I'm from

2366
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
a couple inches of snow

2367
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
in Virginia Beach would shut the whole city down

2368
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
and it was fun, it was great

2369
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
we'd all go out and play in the snow

2370
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
cause it's so rare

2371
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
when you only see it once or twice a year

2372
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
and you're excited about it

2373
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
and you're like oh we can make snow balls

2374
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
and snowmen and like Radcon 2

2375
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
happened with a huge snowfall

2376
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
and we made the fucking

2377
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
handboy winter war

2378
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I wasn't involved with that

2379
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
but you guys made a great fucking well

2380
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
we had some fun

2381
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
vlogs in the snow

2382
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
it's a great time

2383
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
and the fact that it shuts down the whole city

2384
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
makes you kind of just

2385
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
everybody just kind of is at home

2386
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
up here in the north

2387
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
nothing shuts down

2388
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
and it snows constantly

2389
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
like the amount of snow that we would have gotten

2390
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
once or twice a year of Virginia Beach

2391
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
we get almost every day

2392
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
there has only been like three days in December

2393
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
where I saw grass

2394
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
it has been snowing consistently

2395
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
and it stays for a long time

2396
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
cause it's so cold that it wouldn't melt

2397
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
so it took

2398
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
almost a whole week

2399
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
for our last major snowfall to melt

2400
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
again so like

2401
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
there's just always snow

2402
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
and it really like

2403
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
changes your lifestyle in some ways

2404
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
when it's that constant

2405
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
where like every time you want to use the car

2406
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
you gotta clean off the car

2407
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
and like if you want to leave the house

2408
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
you need to be wearing snow boots

2409
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
cause like your shoes will just get immediately soaked

2410
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
so it's like

2411
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
and you're gonna have to leave the house

2412
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
cause it snows every fucking day

2413
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
like you can't just be like

2414
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
for like three months unless you're like

2415
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
gonna clean off your car every time

2416
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
and put on snow boots and

2417
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
you know today I

2418
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
almost wrecked my car

2419
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
people have been

2420
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
did you skid? did you do a swerve?

2421
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
oh I did a big swerve

2422
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
everyone, all of my fans

2423
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
have been constantly nagging me to get winter tires

2424
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
they're like dude you're gonna die

2425
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
get winter tires or you'll die

2426
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
and I'm like ehhh

2427
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I'm only gonna live here for one winter

2428
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I don't want to spend that like 100

2429
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
however much money it costs for winter tires

2430
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
for one winter

2431
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
but then today was one of those insidious days

2432
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
where it was like at first it was raining

2433
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
but it was like an icy rain

2434
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
so we go out and it's fine

2435
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
but by the time we're coming back home

2436
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
now the ground is all icy and it's starting to turn

2437
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
into snow and everything's kind of shit

2438
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
and I of course try to be slick

2439
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
like I have to make a left turn into my neighborhood

2440
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
and there's like

2441
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
the last thing you should try to do is be slick

2442
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I made a huge mistake

2443
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
because

2444
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
there's a car coming from the other direction

2445
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
and I have to make a left turn into my neighborhood

2446
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
and I'm like

2447
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
alright if I go fast I can beat that guy

2448
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
you know

2449
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
the rational thought would have been

2450
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
come to a complete stop and let him pass and then go

2451
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
but I'm like no if I'm fast I can beat that guy

2452
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
so I try to go because this is what I normally do

2453
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
so I try to go fast

2454
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
and I immediately swerve all the way off into

2455
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
the bushes

2456
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
like right next to the sign from my neighborhood

2457
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
almost hit a

2458
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
could have hit a brick wall

2459
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
could have gotten hit by that guy's car very easily

2460
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
we were extremely lucky

2461
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
that all I knocked over was like this wooden post

2462
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
that was in the ground that nobody cares about

2463
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
and so like you know I've got a little scratches

2464
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
on my car I got out of there just fine

2465
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
but I was like man this was lucky

2466
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
and this is

2467
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
clearly a warning to go get

2468
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
winter tires you know

2469
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
the winter has only just begun

2470
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
you're gonna go all the way through March

2471
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
like this

2472
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I'm just hoping like

2473
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
cause I'm trying to drive to fucking Boston

2474
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
on Christmas day

2475
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
and like I don't know what the snow is gonna be like

2476
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
that day so there's

2477
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
there is some chance

2478
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
there is not a terrible idea

2479
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
cause you can take the train all the way to

2480
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
self-station

2481
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I don't even know where a train is or how long that would be

2482
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
but I could look into it cause

2483
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
cause there's a chance I won't be able to go to Boston

2484
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
and I'm like well I'm not

2485
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
driving in that you know

2486
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
sure

2487
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
could be an option

2488
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
hey so I'm sure Tom

2489
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
had a similar experience as you grew up in the same part of the country

2490
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
yep had dealt with a lot of snow growing up

2491
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
it was kind of a hassle

2492
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
but so while I hate

2493
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
the cold

2494
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I hate cold temperatures more than anything

2495
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
in the world they are paralyzing

2496
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
they are counter

2497
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
to life

2498
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
the antithesis of everything that I wish for

2499
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
in this world

2500
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I do love hanging out in snow

2501
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
and then coming inside and being cozy

2502
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
having escaped the winter

2503
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
you know what I like doing I like skipping that whole first part

2504
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
and just being cozy

2505
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
no cause you gotta suffer so you can feel

2506
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
the joy of being inside again

2507
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
you're just a masochist

2508
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
this is the same person who grinded the ultimate weapon

2509
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
in Kingdom Hearts 2 you just like pain

2510
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I do

2511
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
like I agree with Nate on this

2512
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
like

2513
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
it snowed once a few days ago

2514
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
and

2515
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
the rain brushed it away immediately afterwards

2516
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
so it was like I gotta get out there

2517
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I gotta make something I gotta make a little snowman

2518
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
and it's cold and you know and all that

2519
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
and I roll up a ball

2520
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
and I roll it

2521
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
so that all the snow in the garden

2522
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
is in the snow

2523
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
and it's very big and very heavy

2524
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
and I fall over it and I drop it

2525
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
and I build it back up and I fall over it

2526
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
and it's like I was so

2527
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
like my coat was like kind of

2528
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
warm like the fact that I was moving

2529
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
so much and lifting big

2530
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
lumps of snow all heavy it was like

2531
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
getting sweaty and it was

2532
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
great and then I fell

2533
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
on the snow and I just

2534
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I was just warm and cold at the same time

2535
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
and it feels so good to exert yourself

2536
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
to a ridiculous extent

2537
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
and then come in and just be like

2538
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
as you pull off your winter clothes and you're free

2539
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
and it's warm and it's glorious

2540
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
cool down and warm up at the same time

2541
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
your hands need to warm up

2542
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
but your body needs to cool down

2543
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
it's like weird and you don't get that very often

2544
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
that is my aesthetic

2545
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I love being inside

2546
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
in a warm, biofire is preferable

2547
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
with a snowy outside and specifically

2548
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
snowing is

2549
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
peak decadence

2550
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
the best temperature improvement

2551
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
in my life because like as a kid

2552
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I go out into the snow and within

2553
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
two seconds my ears are dying

2554
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
of cold I don't know why my ears

2555
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
are just really sensitive to cold and like

2556
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
if I put on ear muffs or a hat

2557
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
or whatnot it would just get way too sweaty

2558
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
and then get cold but

2559
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
when I grew my hair out when I was

2560
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
13 as it remains

2561
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
just the tiniest little increment

2562
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
of hair draped over

2563
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
the ears completely warms them and I've

2564
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
never had that issue since and it's

2565
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
really cool it's like yeah everyone should

2566
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
grow their hair out that's why I grow

2567
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
my hair and beard out during the summertime

2568
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
my hair's not curly enough to do that

2569
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I'm just wearing ear muffs

2570
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Question from Jolly Bones

2571
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
what is the worst type of Christmas gift

2572
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
one

2573
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
that I had to work really hard to get

2574
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
so my parents like arranged

2575
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
and my parents would just like pay for

2576
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
or anyone would like pay like when I had to work really hard

2577
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
someone else could like buy for me

2578
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
especially if it's not that expensive

2579
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
like if I had to work hard then I'm getting like

2580
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
nothing out of this

2581
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
what do you mean by describe what would be a hard work for a Christmas gift

2582
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I had to arrange

2583
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
the delivery location

2584
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I had to find

2585
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
all the logistics about how to buy this

2586
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
like it was like a portable

2587
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
heater or something like when I lived in my last

2588
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
apartment that my parents willingly bought for me

2589
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
but like I had to do all the work

2590
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
to arrange everything

2591
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
and it took me like days of work to like

2592
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
get everything just it was just like a weird situation

2593
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
happening but like I had to put in a lot of

2594
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
work and all they did was like

2595
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
just send a check afterward and it's like

2596
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
there's a gift and yet I worked so hard

2597
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
to make it happen

2598
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I hate doing that I really hate that

2599
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
yeah gifts that are burdens in disguise

2600
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
exactly exactly

2601
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I would rather just not have to deal with it

2602
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I think you should

2603
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
never buy someone a gift under the

2604
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
assumption that they are going to like

2605
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
use it

2606
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
like because when my dad

2607
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
as I was discussing before he got me like all those

2608
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
like the robe the slippers the pajamas

2609
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
and also a

2610
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
brewing kit and of those

2611
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
the robe and slippers ended up being

2612
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
something I used and so he was lucky and he was

2613
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
correct there but like the silk pajamas

2614
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
eh like they're not really

2615
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
comfortable they're kind of weird to wear

2616
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
around and then

2617
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
the brewing kit was like

2618
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
just so okay

2619
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
better answer gifts that the person giving it

2620
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
to you doesn't understand themselves

2621
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
because he bought me this

2622
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
home brewing kit thinking this would just be

2623
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
like yeah you're going to make your own beer

2624
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
but like the

2625
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
shit is super complicated like you need to

2626
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
have like a fucking chilled room

2627
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
to store this shit in you know

2628
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
like you gotta have tons of stuff

2629
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
like I mean that doesn't come with

2630
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
barley and like hops it's just like a big

2631
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
jug and a bunch of tubes you know

2632
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
by buying that he's he's he's his gift

2633
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
to you is fucking homework

2634
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
right and it's like wow thanks for like this

2635
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
extra I mean it could have been cool it probably

2636
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
would be really cool if you like did it I

2637
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I hate being given a burden yeah I

2638
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I get why he would think I'd be into that

2639
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
because I love alcohol and I like you know

2640
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
like homemade kind of stuff

2641
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
but like I'm also lazy as shit

2642
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
and like this stuff was really complicated

2643
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
that would be a good gift if you expressed

2644
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
interest exactly exactly I

2645
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
had ever said like I want to make my own alcohol

2646
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
great but like he just bought that for me and the

2647
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
thing is that one of the parts

2648
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
was like kind of broken and

2649
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
we didn't figure that out until

2650
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
like a couple days later I

2651
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
thrashed the box that night

2652
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
because some

2653
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
dramatic stuff happened that Christmas

2654
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
where one of our friends got kicked out of

2655
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
our group of friends and I was

2656
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
shit-faced drunk and not handling it

2657
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
so I just tore up this box because it's

2658
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
just a big box I can let out my rage

2659
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
on so there's no way to send

2660
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
it back so it's like a hundred and fifty

2661
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
dollar brewing kit that never got used

2662
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
and I was just

2663
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
like I feel bad

2664
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
but at the same time why

2665
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
the fuck did you buy me this like

2666
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
you know I'm sorry I tore

2667
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
up the box so we can't send it back but

2668
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
you should have had the foresight to know

2669
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
that rather than buying me a home brewing

2670
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
kit you should have just bought me a hundred fifty dollars with a beer

2671
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
you know yeah

2672
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I would have loved that

2673
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
in this case for sure

2674
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I have any answers I can top that so yeah

2675
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I hate gift cards

2676
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
it's categorically worse than cash

2677
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
just give me cash

2678
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
it's better

2679
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
it's more useful

2680
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
like I get the fact that

2681
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
people want gift cards because

2682
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
they thought of you like oh I know

2683
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
you like this so it feels more personal

2684
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
than cash but it's just it's less

2685
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
useful there's always going to be a situation where I could use

2686
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
ten bucks and I have ten bucks in fake

2687
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
money and it sucks

2688
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I'm curious about something what do you think will happen

2689
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
when we get off of this bullshit paper

2690
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
fiat currency that we're all wasting our time

2691
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
with and we all go full crypto currency

2692
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
what will gift exchanges

2693
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
be like with that I mean will it still be like

2694
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
here to have this

2695
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
do you think we're ever going to be all using crypto currencies

2696
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
eventually yeah

2697
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
like in cowboy bebop for example everyone uses like

2698
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
is that a cryptocurrency

2699
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I think it's just like a digital currency

2700
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
but it's like it's very similar

2701
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
we're already on digital currency for the most part

2702
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
paper currency is pretty

2703
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
pretty pretty pretty bold

2704
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
but like once like as long as

2705
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
this brings bebop to mind

2706
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I want us to name our global currency

2707
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
double dollars like in tri-gun

2708
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I don't know why they were called that but it's

2709
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
double dollars I think I know why

2710
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
inflation got so bad

2711
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
this actually we just got to double up

2712
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I remember I think what the idea behind

2713
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
that was like so like the people in tri-gun

2714
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
crashed on this planet and like rebuilt civilization

2715
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
and some things they just fucked up and like

2716
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
they read like it's like they were just people

2717
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
who were like had no idea what was going on so they like

2718
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
read a lot of literature and there was like a typo

2719
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
somewhere of like instead of a dollar sign

2720
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
there were like two dollar signs and they're like

2721
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
okay I guess like where did you hear this

2722
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I've never heard this lore before

2723
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I you know I'm reaching back like more than

2724
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
ten years to like fanfiction.net

2725
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
yeah I don't know maybe it's coming from

2726
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
my head I remember reading that somewhere

2727
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
and really being certain of that but

2728
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
it'd be a cool thing if it was true

2729
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I will say about gift cards that like

2730
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
there is an interesting like manipulation

2731
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
element that you can like force people

2732
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
to spend money on things you think they need

2733
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
for instance recently

2734
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
recently um

2735
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
and I don't think this was the intentions of this gift

2736
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
but uh but um

2737
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
May's mom gave her a

2738
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
a $50 gift card to the grocery store

2739
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
and I thought that was really

2740
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
interesting like as an idea like if you had

2741
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
let's say that you have a kid

2742
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
who is bad with money

2743
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
this is not the case with May

2744
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I don't know why her mom got her that gift card

2745
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
but it made me think about this

2746
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
that if you had a kid who is bad with money

2747
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
and you gave them

2748
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
like like a

2749
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
a gift card for a place that you know they

2750
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
need groceries

2751
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
and like you don't want them to spend it on

2752
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
heroin let's say

2753
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
that would be a reason not to give

2754
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
somebody cash like hey I'm not going to give

2755
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
you money you could spend on just whatever you want

2756
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
you have to spend this on groceries

2757
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
holy shit the odds of me giving to a homeless person

2758
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
just went into like from a zero to the single

2759
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
digits

2760
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
if you give them a gift card

2761
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
do you mean? yeah

2762
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
pass the gift cards to homeless people

2763
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
well I mean

2764
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
there's something I suppose

2765
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
hey I've got a question here

2766
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I'll give them a World of Warcraft subscription

2767
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I've got a funny question here

2768
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
from our pity question section

2769
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
on the

2770
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
twitter

2771
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
using hashtag askpcp

2772
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
at senjo42 asks

2773
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
could you self administer

2774
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
a needle

2775
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
which is interesting to me

2776
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
could anyone do it?

2777
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I can't even have somebody else

2778
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
administer me

2779
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I have like a straight up panic attack

2780
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
from that shit

2781
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
it's not even the pain

2782
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
it's just the concept

2783
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
it's a utterly disgusting thing to me

2784
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I think with like a good old sit down

2785
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
of training I probably could do it

2786
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
you know I would hug

2787
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
a hedgehog that was

2788
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
disguised as a hedgehog

2789
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I would do that

2790
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
and there would be an accident and I would be like oh wait

2791
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
damn it now I'm cured of AIDS

2792
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I don't think that's how that works dude

2793
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
it took so much work to get those AIDS

2794
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
putting aside the whole

2795
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
whether I could like find a vein

2796
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
or like you know the smarts of it

2797
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
I think the question is really about the like

2798
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
it's really about like the pain aspect here

2799
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
needles don't hurt at all

2800
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
like there's

2801
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
but it's the anticipation right

2802
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
it's the fear

2803
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I find it so utterly disgusting

2804
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
just the fact that they're like

2805
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
these like vessels pumping

2806
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
through you

2807
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
utterly disgusting

2808
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
let's get off the needles

2809
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I was going to say I like this

2810
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
and also I want to tell an embarrassing story about Ben

2811
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
where we both got our blood drawn at one time

2812
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
and like I was sitting we were both doing it

2813
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I got it you know they injected me or something

2814
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
and I was like okay that sucks but not that bad

2815
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
but Ben

2816
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
like when they came to the needle with him

2817
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
like you guys can probably relate to this but he was like flinching

2818
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
and like the biggest most like

2819
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
caricature movements like

2820
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
like they wouldn't even bring the needle that close

2821
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
flinching is just the beginning for me

2822
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
it just goes down from there

2823
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I usually cry and scream

2824
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
the closer you get the more my hands turn

2825
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
into fists and

2826
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
the stronger I become

2827
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I find the

2828
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
the active needle so disgusting

2829
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I would rather they just took a knife cut me open

2830
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
and bled me out

2831
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I would be much more comfortable

2832
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
with just like hacking like a big

2833
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
gash in my arm

2834
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
like the aesthetic of the needle

2835
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
you find like disgusting

2836
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
just the fact that it's like going into a vein

2837
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
it's disgusting

2838
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
enough needle talk let's get one last question

2839
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
before we're done

2840
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
from grey nine

2841
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
what do you want for Christmas

2842
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I want a switch

2843
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I want a Nintendo switch

2844
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I want to play Splatoon 2

2845
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
and I got to play Bayonetta

2846
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
and Metroid Prime 4

2847
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
and that's what I want

2848
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
give me a switch

2849
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Gib left because he didn't want to hear gross talk

2850
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
but that's over

2851
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
we're talking about what we want for Christmas

2852
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
what do you want for Christmas Gib

2853
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
a needle

2854
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
I want

2855
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
what do I want

2856
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
something

2857
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I asked for a little Meta Knight plushie

2858
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
because I have a little Kirby plushie

2859
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
and I want a little Meta Knight plushie

2860
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
because Meta Knight is a fucking cutest little guy

2861
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I like plush things

2862
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
and he's like

2863
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
he's so fucking stern

2864
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
yeah it's great

2865
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I asked Santa Claus

2866
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
for Xenoblade Chronicles 2

2867
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
for the switch

2868
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
because I have very little experience

2869
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
well I watched a friend play most of it

2870
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
it looks like a big meme game

2871
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
but it's like the first big RPG for the switch

2872
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
and I love my switch more than anything

2873
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
and I just want another game

2874
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
so I'm gonna play that shit

2875
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I saw a bunch of like anime

2876
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
just anime cutscene I've ever seen

2877
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
in a video game

2878
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
from that so I'm really excited to see

2879
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
just how deep the rabbit hole goes

2880
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
in terms of just literally being an anime

2881
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
that's what I'm talking about

2882
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Davoo what do you want for Christmas

2883
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I want a stopwatch

2884
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
you can use your phone for that

2885
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
well here's the thing

2886
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I'm gonna explain

2887
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
so I use stopwatch as the key track

2888
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
of how long things take

2889
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
that way I can figure out what things I'm wasting my time on

2890
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
so stopwatches are vital to time efficiency

2891
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
the problem is

2892
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
pulling out your phone

2893
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
is antithetical to time efficiency

2894
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
you see the issue there

2895
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
a stopwatch doesn't have

2896
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
any fucking apps on it

2897
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
stopwatch doesn't have twitter on it

2898
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
so there you go that's why I want multiple stopwatches

2899
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
you can theoretically put your phone in airplane mode

2900
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
but in any case whatever works best

2901
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
the holding like

2902
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
like PE class

2903
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
you got the stopwatch you go click

2904
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I want multiple stopwatches

2905
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I want a stopwatch for

2906
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
last time since Eaton

2907
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
last time since Bates

2908
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
stopwatch for how long I've been in this conversation

2909
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
to know when I need to wrap it up

2910
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
not this podcast but like

2911
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
you gotta be on the lookout

2912
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
when you're in a conversation with someone

2913
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
who you agree with politics on

2914
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
because then it just becomes self affirmation

2915
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
the game for 5 hours

2916
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
eventually the amount of time it'll take you to

2917
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
manage all these stopwatches

2918
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
don't worry I have

2919
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
a fucking alarm clock for that

2920
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I've just imagined

2921
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
like DaVoo's having a

2922
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
kind of annoying conversation with his dad

2923
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
and he brings out that because the stopwatch is a universal thing

2924
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
he knows what that is

2925
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
if you bring out your phone it's like oh it's just looking on his phone

2926
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
but if you bring out the stopwatch it's like oh he's timing you

2927
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
DaVoo is timing you

2928
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
this shit and you click it

2929
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
writing this fucking face

2930
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
yeah I know I've actually

2931
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
you wish for the 17 seconds of my life

2932
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
yeah hey well what I want for Christmas is

2933
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
world peace

2934
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
and I want it by way

2935
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
of legal weed everywhere

2936
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
yup there you go

2937
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
did you know guys know that didgy bros so

2938
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
smokes the weed what the fuck

2939
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I don't even care

2940
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
if that becomes the meme because I

2941
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
literally smoke every fucking day now

2942
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
so like yeah it is actually true

2943
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
like you can meme it all you want

2944
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I'm just gonna embrace it as an identity at this point

2945
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
yeah it was really interesting like didgy

2946
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
you mentioned like halfway through this podcast

2947
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
you're like yeah I went out on the back

2948
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
patio and started smoking and I was like

2949
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
wait wait cigarette

2950
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
yeah cause I was like he's smoking weed

2951
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I'm having a problem with this how dare you mention

2952
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
you actually smoking a cigarette something that's

2953
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
actually a lot worse for your health

2954
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
well I guess I'm actually okay with that one

2955
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
no I smoke weed indoors it's not

2956
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
it's decriminalized here but you know

2957
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
still keep it

2958
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
still federally not good

2959
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I think

2960
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I think

2961
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
smoking weed

2962
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
world peace won't come from

2963
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
just having legal weed

2964
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
we need it to be free

2965
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I just was going to originally say weed

2966
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
the weed thing and I thought world peace

2967
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
would be funnier but then I decided to say both

2968
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000

iTunes

2996
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
and what else where are we

2997
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
it's on google play

2998
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
iTunes and google play for the two guys that

2999
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
listen on there but hey

3000
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
you guys give me twenty dollars a month

3001
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
so keep listening

3002
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
do we have a way to track the numbers on those

3003
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
google play's numbers are

3004
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
pathetically bad

3005
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
but iTunes does not keep track of

3006
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
numbers so I have to go into Bluehost and figure

3007
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
out how to track numbers that way

3008
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
so yeah we still need to figure it out but we will

3009
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I'm lazy alright well it's too much back room

3010
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
