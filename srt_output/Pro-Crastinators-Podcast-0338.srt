1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to bless that guy. That son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello everyone, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Ben Saint, it's Gibbontake.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we've got a robot guest today.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Excuse me, I fucked it up.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I fucked it up and then I also swore in the first five seconds of the video, so the channel's going down.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is Twitch from Reploid Revo, the Mega Man YouTube channel. Welcome to the show.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thanks, I'm super happy to be here. Thank you so much.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thanks for reaching out on Twitter to say you'd like to maybe talk about Mega Man or something sometime.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And yeah, I did. You know, this week, famously, this week I put out...

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Twitch, you've got to understand, for the past six weeks or more on this show, I have every episode I've been saying,

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think the video's going to be out this week. This is definitely the week that it's done and I'm putting it out.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So it's finally happened, that's the context.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You know what, I'm guilty of that sort of thing too.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A highly anticipated video on my channel is Time Skimmer Episode 6, where I finally begin talking about stuff that happens after Mega Man X4.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And famously, I was like, yeah, it's going to be coming really soon.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then it never came. And the reason why is because I wanted to get a set of animatics made for it, depicting the battle between X and Zero.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I even got it voice acted. I got Lucas Gilbertson, the voice actor for Zero, to come and record lines.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It was a whole big to do. But then it became an entire animation.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And the person working on the animation, granted, it takes a very, very long time.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So it just kept getting pushed back and pushed back and pushed back.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And now the animation has been abandoned. And so I waited several years for this and now there's no animation.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I'm going to go ahead and go forward with just releasing the episode.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You got to scale it back, yeah.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, unfortunately. But you know what? It does mean that that blockage is not there anymore and I can finally continue with the rest of the timeline.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can only do so many. Who exactly is in what exactly is in a row?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mega Man.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, Mega Man.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Gib, how many Mega Man's did you play? You said you played the first one.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I played a bit of the first one on the Wii virtual store and it was hard. I couldn't get past anything.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think I beat Cut Man once.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a par for the course for Mega Man 1.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You just got to get the magnet beam.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What could that possibly be?

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You just got to, is it not selfish? It's a magnet. That's also a beam.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's one tool in Mega Man 1 and it's the magnet beam and it just lets you place platforms wherever you want basically.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it's a big help but it's a little, I think it's in Crash Man's level.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, it's in Magnet Man. I don't remember where it is.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Crash Man is 2 and Magnet Man is 3 so those are definitely not correct.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wait, it was Guts Man that's Cut Man.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What the hell am I talking about? Yeah, you're right.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's in Electman stage? I could be wrong.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know where it is but the bottom line is it does make platforms but it's also very janky.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's pretty janky.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The way that it works is that it creates a platform for as long as across the screen as you're holding the button down.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So the longer you hold the button down, the longer the platform is.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But as soon as you let go of that button, a timer is ticking down that you can't see.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It only lasts for like, I don't know, like 2 maybe 4 seconds tops and then it just vanishes.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And if you're standing on it when it vanishes, you unceremoniously plummet like a cinder block to the bottom of the screen and die.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, if you put it, you can shoot one out and then jump on it and then you shoot another one out quickly and then you jump on that

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and you shoot another one out quickly and then you jump on it and if you do it quickly, you can cross pretty much any gap.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
See, I vaguely remember, maybe I did find that and I used all of the energy points or whatever they're called, the PP for that thing.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I ran out.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You gotta consider the energy points.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Is that what they're called?

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think they're called weapon energy is to generally agreed upon term.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's like the secondary meter for the things that are not your health.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If you're reading one of the manuals, it's called a belt buckle for some reason.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What the magnet beam is?

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No, just the weapon energy.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What?

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because they look like little buckles?

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, they don't.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, the drops.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The drops kind of do.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Drops?

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, they look like little lemons or like a big lemon sometimes.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know if I have the picture anymore, but there's, I don't know if it's in the English manual or if this was on like a blockbuster pamphlet for renting the game.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But they absolutely were trying to describe the game and a lot of it doesn't make sense.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It says something like press down to crouch and I'm like, you absolutely cannot crouch in any Mega Man game until like the year 2000 or next five.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So that's a lie.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I read some of the translated guides, like the Japanese guides.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And some of them are very different, some of them are very funnily different.

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The English ones are just, the English ones are just bad.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They don't explain the game properly.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They call the city Monsteropolis for some reason.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Calls the, calls the robot masters.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like robotic humanoids or something or no, robot like humanoids.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It calls them.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I know there's a handful of really weird English.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, you know, it's funny because in Japan, Dr. Light's robots, the robot masters are not actually called robot masters.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think they are just called like humanoid robots or something to that effect.

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, in the first one, I know they don't call them humanoid robots, which would be correct.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They call them robot like humanoids, which doesn't make any sense.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then in a lot of the English manuals, they were just like, oh, they have human faces.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Therefore they are cyborgs and they just converted everything to cyborgs because I guess it was the 80s and cyborgs were in vogue or something.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sounds cool.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I saw one.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I really wish I could find it.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But I have like scans of this manual and it's like, you are Mega Man.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Last creation of Dr. Kine after he was murdered by his evil lab assistant, Dr. Wiley, spelled with like an E.

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I know they spelled it Dr. Willie.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They spell it Dr. Willie a couple times.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Dr. Wright and Dr. Willie.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean that I can, I guess forgive.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But Dr. Kine, I've seen Dr. Kine and I'm like, what are you?

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
K-I-N-E.

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
K-Y-N-E.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Very, very strange.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was telling Gif that she should play two because one is hard and it's kind of bad.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You should play two and just get the metal blades and then the game's easy.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That is accurate.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because two is the best selling Mega Man game of all time up until like a month ago.

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Up until a month ago when Eleven just knocked it off.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Shocking.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The manual by the way.

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Because two is when they actually figured out like how to make, two is when they hit the formula and they made like the first good Mega Man.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I mean one is fine.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not trying to shit on one too hard.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's janky.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's competent.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's smooth.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's not like polished.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But you can see what was coming.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And then three is kind of just easier in general.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They give you so many health drops in three.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, right up until the Doc Robot stages.

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, yeah.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Three is they give you, they lull you into a false sense of security.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're like, wow, I might actually be getting good at Mega Man.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And then Doc Robot comes in and he just ruins your day.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The robot, yeah, the robot master levels, the eight normal levels are easy.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And it get, you know, most, most of them get really hard at the end.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But yeah.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I see the belt buckles.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In bulk.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In bulk.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, let me see.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let me see.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Belt buckles.

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Pick up the belt buckles to make your weapon.

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The helmet adds an extra man.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Wait, propeller.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, yes.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I forget what it's called.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's an item in, it's a special item.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's in Mega Man.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I think there's only one of them.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It just gives you like a bajillion points.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's the, it's like, it's a Japanese thing.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's got a Japanese name.

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And it's, and it's a thing.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's like a Capcom puts this thing in like a lot of their games is like a mystery.

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It was a power up or something in, I think in 1941 or 1942, like a Capcom shoot them

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
up.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And so they've just been putting it as like an Easter egg and other things.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I know in other games, it's there and it like is like a full life and weapon

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
restore.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But in this one, it just gives you points, which are totally useless.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, I'm so glad they dropped the points thing in Mega Man 2.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's so funny that there's points in the first one.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And what, you know what, I think also makes Mega Man 1 harder because of the points.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That is now a useless pickup that is on the drop table for when you kill enemies.

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In most games, when you kill an enemy, it's either health or weapon energy or nothing.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
In this, now it's you have two chances for nothing and two chances for weapon energy

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
or health.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know what I mean?

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How did I forget that they call him Dr. Kine?

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Like what the what the?

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, I don't know if you had seen this particular thing because I think this isn't the

180
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, what is this?

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't remember the origin of this off the top of my head.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I know I have it in a video somewhere, but I think this is this might be a blockbuster

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
insert, like a little pamphlet that came with the game when you rented it.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So I think it's not official.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Right.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Like it was one of those things that because blockbuster in place of giving everyone like

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
a complete inbox copy of a game.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They would often give you a pamphlet because back in the day, certain NES games.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, honestly, we're just you couldn't play them unless you knew what you were doing.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So the manuals would often give you critical information on how to play.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And so to kind of circumvent giving everyone a complete inbox copy of a game, they just

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
whipped up these like quick little like pamphlets which like skimmed through the manuals.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think wasn't wasn't there.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think I've seen I swear I've seen a of a gaming historian video.

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You ever watched the gaming historian on YouTube?

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Occasionally.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, there's he has one that's about the lawsuit between Nintendo and blockbuster where

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
basically Nintendo tried to sue block really they wanted them to stop renting their games

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
because that that was like, you know, hurting their business model.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But the way but there was no legal way they could do that.

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So instead they attack them on the grounds that the game manuals are like copyrighted material

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and they're not allowed to to give those out.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And so yeah, I think it would think it might have been because of that lawsuit that blockbuster

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
issued a lot of like that they wrote up their own like yeah.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh yeah, that's that's totally a possibility.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Like that sounds like that lines up perfectly with this.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So mm-hmm.

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have watched like every gaming story and video that's ever been made.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, wasn't wasn't there a Dr. Cain in Mega Man X?

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Wasn't that the X guy?

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's Dr. Cain.

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Dr. Cain is he's sort of like the Dr. Light replacement in X, but then he kind of just disappears

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
after X3 and is never heard again.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Well, I actually have a strong idea of actually where he ended up and this is the agreed upon

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
theory by most people who like care to know.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay.

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So Dr. Cain forms the Maverick Hunters in response to the first handful of Mavericks

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that appear in the X series, right?

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, he like he talks to the council though, which we never see them all mysterious council

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and they're like, maybe we should just stop making reploids and like, you know, is that

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
is that what they call it the council in?

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, it's in the journal of Dr. Cain.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's called the council and the interesting is the the journal is only English canon.

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's it was just made up for the English manual and no such thing exists in Japan.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
However, I know that much.

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Japan later adapted it and changed some of the details.

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So it retroactively did come into Canada USA USA USA.

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A rare instance of when English canon has actually added something useful because it didn't hurt

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
anything by adding it there.

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So he he's like the council has, you know, met with me today and something something

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
considered stopping production of all reploids.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But I think that's a step too far.

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So then he builds the Maverick Hunters.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So Dr. Cain is actually the leader of the Maverick Hunters.

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He's running the organization up until X3, as you said.

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And even though we don't see him in X4 in the English manual, which again, this hasn't

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
officially been adopted, but it says he created repliforce.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I know in the X4 manual in the English manual, it says that he is he was one of the he's

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
founded repliforce.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So he's not actually in the game.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, he's not actually in the game.

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He's just kind of like mentioned, you can even in the yeah, yeah, yeah.

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So so peep this, the official origin for sickness.

245
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Remember, I remember you're talking about him.

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He's like the leader of the hunters and he's like, well, he doesn't really do anything.

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, yeah, it's cause all of his story happens like out of the game.

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Apparently, he became leader of the hunters.

250
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And this is exactly rough on paraphrasing, but this is as deep of info as we get.

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He became leader of the Maverick Hunters after the previous leader of the Maverick Hunters

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
resigned out of shame for how the repliforce incident was handled.

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So basically, I think it's Dr. Cain.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Where does it where does it say that?

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay, because because I know that like he's the in five, he's the new leader, which

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
implies that there was an old leader.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Right.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And he's no longer there, but I don't.

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, if you're going to kill me because I don't have this information on hand, but

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I swear, I'm telling you, there's no entire channel of people who will back me up on

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
it.

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I would.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I would love to see it.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think it came in one of the.

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So there's like these guides called like, like the Rockman X Psycho Dysacon guides.

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And they've had they've been making them from X one all the way to like X five.

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Are they like books?

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, they're like, they're like, excuse me.

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, they're like strategy guides.

270
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They also include like bits of lore.

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's where we got the information for Iris and Colonel, how they used to be like one

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Reploid and then they got like split into two because they have like conflicting personality

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
differences.

275
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's where we get information about like just like different, like random things.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Like sometimes there's motivations for the for the Maverick Hunters and also for the Mavericks

278
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that you fight.

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Like that's where I get the information about like Gravity Beetle and stuff.

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Like I was brothers with Boomer Coanger.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know I've seen some of these before.

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What are they called?

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Dyso.

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm probably going to butcher the spelling, but it's Psycho Dysacon.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, I saw some of these.

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Are these all translated?

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know if all of them are translated.

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I believe most of them have been.

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
However, the person who did the original translations said that they did a pretty poor job and they're

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
like, don't trust these translations.

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like I'd like to do them again someday.

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So, but, but it does seem to be information that has been like corroborated with like other

293
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
sources.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And so it's like not everything is like a hundred percent accurate, but I mean, like

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it's the best we've got.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So, yeah.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But, um, yeah.

298
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So the implication is that well, Dr. Cain is running the Maverick Hunters.

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He's the only person we see running them up to X3.

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It makes perfect.

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It makes perfect sense that after, after the Red Play Force Rebellion.

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The leader, whoever that is would resign and it makes sense that it would be Dr. Cain,

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
whether it's Dr. Cain or not, that makes sense.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But if it, who else would it be besides, besides Dr. Cain?

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So, yeah, and since he's the only guy that we've seen leading them up to that point.

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So he's just like, you know what?

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I really handle, I really dropped the ball with Repple Force pretty badly.

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That would mean that he was simultaneously leader of the Maverick Hunters and Repple

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Force.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And he says no one man should have all that power.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So he resigned because he was a big gay fan.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He was a big gay fan.

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He was right.

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can't, that's why, that's why it's all happened.

315
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I just pictured now Dr. Cain listening to like a bunch of old Kanye West albums and he's like,

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
he's like, yeah, he was a genius.

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He was ahead of his time.

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But it's light years ahead of anything we have now.

319
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He says, he shakes his head and he says, ah, too bad in 2022.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He went crazy and ran for president and came into submitting.

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They call it the fall.

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The fall started in 2022 and then, and then the Irish Rebellion of 2024.

323
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Dark times ahead for humanity.

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Boy, I would have hated to be alive back in 2022.

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh goodness.

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sick.

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I forget what we were talking about before.

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have a tendency to do that.

331
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I just, I'm like a banana in a fruit smoothie when it comes to Megaman.

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little.

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Take over everything.

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm a little abashed because, you know, I made this big video where I explained Megaman.

335
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But like, I think I know in my heart that you probably know more about the subject than

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I do.

337
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So, well, I mean, I want to keep you off the subject to avoid embarrassing me.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Listen, I'm going to tell you one thing.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You did a fantastic job and I'm listening, like actively listening.

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And I'm like, you haven't said anything like wrong.

342
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Like the only things that like, that I wouldn't agree with or that I wouldn't even call them

343
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
wrong, just things where I'm like, I kind of differ are points of, of like, it's kind

344
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
of like fuzzy where it's like, well, you could think of it any which way that you want.

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Like there's no like solid answer for this thing or not.

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know what I mean?

347
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So, I mean, at that point, it just comes down to like personal preference.

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I used to be like way more like, like iron fisted about that sort of thing.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But I've since loosened up because I find that Megaman kind of does as far as established

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
as its canon and story is.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,600
There are certain areas where it's like, nope, this is just a little fuzzy and you just kind

352
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
of have to deal with it.

353
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,000
Like, so a good point that someone brought up shout outs to Zan on my, on my Discord server

354
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
in the Lord discussion.

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He, he mentioned, he brought up a good point.

356
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
He goes, what is the cannon way to play Megaman X five?

357
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, X or zero.

358
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, not even that.

359
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do you collect all of the, do you succeed in collecting all of the enigma cannon parts?

360
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Or do you just fire it and you destroy the, the space station in one shot?

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Like, what is the story?

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, yeah.

363
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Like in the history books, you know, do they, do they say, you know, matter of fact or X

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and zero go and get all the parts and then they fire the cannon and it didn't work.

365
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So then they launched zero at it in a shuttle and then that did work.

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Or do they say they just launched both without, you know, without getting anything and it just worked.

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Or did it fail?

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because well, it, well it can't have failed because that's true.

370
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

371
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, I know the cannon ending is that zero doesn't go Maverick, but there's two different

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
ways that that can happen.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I understand.

374
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

375
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It raises an interesting point because for once the story actually is determined.

376
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Like in every other game, it's like, yeah, you beat all eight Mavericks and that's it.

377
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But in this game, the Mavericks are literally optional.

378
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So do you beat one Maverick and call it quits?

379
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you beat, you know, like all of them?

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Do you beat like two or three and then just, you know, launch?

381
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I mean, even in X4, there's differences between the X playthrough and the zero playthrough

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
that, like, did, like, did X fight general?

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, like in X's playthrough, yes, but in zero's playthrough, not necessarily.

384
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You have to fight general as a zero.

385
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You actually do need to fight him.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, you do?

387
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, it's guaranteed.

388
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Damn it.

389
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay.

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The only thing that happens is in X's playthrough, you fight Colonel twice in place of a cutscene.

391
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So zero gets the prepare yourself cutscene, but X just fights Colonel like for real.

392
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Stop the coop now.

393
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah.

394
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's not too late.

395
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Never.

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm not gonna lie.

397
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I didn't have nothing against that voice acting.

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I thought they did a pretty decent job for the time, comparatively to, like, if you look

399
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
at, like, what they were up against, like, with Resident Evil and, like, some other horrible

400
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
games, it's not the worst.

401
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No, you're not wrong.

402
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're not wrong.

403
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think, you know, coop is a little silly because it's like, okay, you literally said

404
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the wrong word.

405
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But I didn't have a problem with the voices they chose.

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
As a matter of fact, I think Shake Man explores the best.

407
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think if I was a kid, I probably would have just been like, yeah, cool.

408
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Like, yeah.

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Like, I didn't know any better.

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's just what they said.

411
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay, I will say, I think General's voice is pretty bad.

412
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think.

413
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes.

414
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They picked a very, they picked, like, a reedy voice for a guy, like a 40 foot tall man made

415
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
of gold.

416
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
They think it should be a little deeper.

417
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think you should have a slightly more booming voice.

418
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah.

419
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In my opinion.

420
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He absolutely needs to shout, sound like some sort of, like, big shogun or something.

421
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like, instead of this, he's just, get out of my sight, you know.

422
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We are the repliforce.

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We must do this.

424
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Remember, we will not defy the humans.

425
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah, like, I don't know.

426
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He sounded a bit like Steve Urkel.

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Gib.

428
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know, I don't know what their deal was.

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey, you know, you know, yeah, well, that's just my problem.

430
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
In the game, General's voice sounds more like Lenny, even though Homer is the one who's

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
giant, who's the biggest man in the world and covered in gold.

432
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Hey, Homer.

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Hey, Homer.

434
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We're going to fire a space laser.

435
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey, guys.

436
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Notice anything different about me?

437
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hey, Colonel.

438
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey, Colonel.

439
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Notice anything different about me?

440
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, you're the biggest man in the world now and you're covered in gold.

441
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Not a half bad Colonel, gotta say.

442
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thanks.

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I like Sigma the most.

444
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I think the guy, and you know what's funny?

445
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I think the guy that did Sigma is the only one of those people who went on to do, like,

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
a really serious voice acting career afterwards.

447
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Hmm.

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He, how does he sound?

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Sigma was chewing up the scenery.

450
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He loved it.

451
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He kind of just sounds like, um, he's sort of like, ugh.

452
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Ugh.

453
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh, my Maverick Hunters, what will you do?

454
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You will, yes.

455
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Why do you, why do you do this?

456
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Why don't you kill him?

457
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I forget, I forget any of his lines.

458
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Um, yeah.

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He sounded fine.

461
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He's, he's, he's getting into it.

462
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I think later on they made his voice a little too, like, not that there's anything wrong

463
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
with his voice being deeper in other portrayals, but I almost feel like it, um, it's a little

464
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
too breathy for my liking, I think.

465
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I liked him better when, when he was speaking from the back of his throat and like a little

466
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
bit more Palpatine, you know what I'm saying?

467
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Hmm.

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I like that.

469
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I like that.

470
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's just, that's just me though.

471
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Um, Gib.

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hmm.

473
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hi.

474
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What's up?

475
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Uh, nothing.

476
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm just, I'm just, I'm, I'm, I have no way to, like, interact with this conversation.

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't want to, don't want to exclude you.

478
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Don't want to, don't want to apologize.

479
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I mean, we can talk about the lecture because I have been watching that.

480
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm like up to the Mega Man and base part.

481
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Is that, I guess, I don't know if you have, you know, sorry, you know, as I've been saying,

482
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I've been, I've been hyping this video up for, for weeks and weeks on here.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So, um, it's time, it's time to pay that all off.

484
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But, um, I don't know if there's anything, if there was anything that stuck out about

485
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
it to you and you wanted to bring up, then that would be something we all would be familiar

486
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
with.

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Or maybe if there was anything, uh, uh, maybe you could, as to anything you wanted to clarify,

488
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
me and, me and Twitch are here with our expertise.

489
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Well, I mean, I feel like I, I feel like I haven't gotten to the really weird fucked up

490
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
stuff yet.

491
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Cause I'm not.

492
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, did you not, did you not finish it?

493
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I haven't finished it yet.

494
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh.

495
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I haven't had enough time, uh, spare.

496
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Uh, but.

497
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

498
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm, I'm just finished with like legends, uh, to.

499
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I gotta be, I gotta be honest.

500
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I love legends so much.

501
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I, I love it now.

502
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Uh, Gib, you should play legends.

503
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You'd really like it.

504
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I, I've seen legends.

505
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It looks fun.

506
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Also, just because I've been following this artist for a while.

507
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Um, Arthur Vader has been making like an indie game that is like a Mega Man Legends-esque.

508
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh, is that the, um, the Delta Gal thing?

509
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yes.

510
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes.

511
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They took out Delta Gal.

512
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Arthur Vader.

513
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Big shout out moment.

514
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Big, big appropriate shout out moment for that game.

515
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

516
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That game looks fantastic.

517
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Um, it does.

518
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I, that guy follows me on Twitter.

519
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I love the, um, the, the low poly PS one anime aesthetic.

520
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Maybe we should, maybe we should, maybe we should ask him, maybe we should ask him if he wants

521
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to be a guest.

522
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

523
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You should.

524
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
He'd probably, he'd probably, he'd probably.

525
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Okay.

526
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Okay.

527
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
All right.

528
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Anyway, what were you saying?

529
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But yeah, Mega Man Legends looks fun.

530
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And it's of all the Mega Man games.

531
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I, I like 3D environments.

532
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm a big 3D person.

533
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The graph, the graphical style is exactly what you always say you like the best.

534
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Plus it's just a, it's just chill.

535
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's a chill time.

536
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I think you nailed it when you said in the, in the video you said that, um, Legends 1 is

537
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
more charming.

538
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And what did you say about Legends 2?

539
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I said 2 is more, more epic.

540
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yes.

541
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's exactly it.

542
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Um, I always, I got that exact same, that exact same feeling.

543
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
When I, when I heard you say that, I was like.

544
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Bigger world in a darker tone.

545
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes.

546
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
When I heard you say that in my head, I'm like, this guy gets it.

547
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Like, that's exactly, that is exactly right.

548
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Cause I always tell people, they're always like, which one is better?

549
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Legends 1 or Legends 2?

550
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I'm like, guys, you can't make me choose like that.

551
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's a little bit.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, I didn't, I think, I hear people say like one better, but I think there's things,

553
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
there's things to like about 2 as well.

554
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, yeah.

555
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Like, so in Legends 1, like, and this is going to, I'm going to sound like a big, big old

556
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
sap here.

557
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I played Legends 1 very recently, and my girlfriend was watching me go through the whole thing

558
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and I cried during the ending.

559
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I got like all emotional and I was like, oh my God, like these are people that not only

560
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
did I like figuratively grow up with in the game, but like I literally grew up with these

561
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
people in this game as a kid playing this in, what was it, 97, 98 when it came out?

562
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That sounds about right.

563
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah.

564
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And you know, so like you grow attached to them and I was explaining to her, I said,

565
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
if you play this game, you're stuck on one island, but you explore every single nook

566
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and cranny of this island and you get to know the people on the island and every single

567
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
person has new dialogue when anything happens.

568
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Like, I'm talking like, literally there's events that take like, I don't know, like

569
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
20 seconds tops to complete, and they will literally change their dialogue as soon as

570
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
that new thing has happened.

571
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And so you're, it's more cozy.

572
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You get to learn about these people's lives, you know, and like you kind of like become

573
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
part of the island.

574
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You become part of their little community.

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And when he leaves, it is like genuinely like all that when they're all, yeah, let's

576
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
talk, let's talk, let's talk spoilers.

577
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But I don't give any spoilers.

578
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah.

579
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
When at the end, it's just like, oh, like I get it.

580
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like even though it's just like it's kind of like typical like sappy cartoony stuff.

581
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Like it's the one time in like any sort of media where I was like, oh, like I feel what

582
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
they were going for.

583
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's not like, it's not like in other cartoons where they're like, you know, we'll see you

584
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
again sometime.

585
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You know, and I'm like, they're never going to see those people again.

586
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Like, yeah.

587
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But like this is the one time where they had a scene like that and I'm like, ow, like

588
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
that's hitting me like square in my heart.

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This actually like hurts.

590
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Like it's like a happy sadness.

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I don't know how else to describe it.

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But then I play legends too.

593
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I'm like, this game, like you said, this game was more epic.

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's not bad.

595
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's not worse than legends one.

596
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In fact, the gameplay is much more improved.

597
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But the presentation is like, it doesn't have it does not.

598
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It definitely doesn't give you like a cozy like, I know these people sort of.

599
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

600
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because you don't get enough time on each island to get to know them.

601
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
There's only one island where you get to actually like sort of get to know people.

602
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And that's Kalbania Island with snowy one.

603
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, the snowy one too, because you go there quite often.

604
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So there in Kalbania, because on Kalbania Island, it's like that little one that's

605
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
like just got like the girl and her two brothers, like the two wild kids.

606
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, yeah.

607
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And you kind of like get to know them a bit because you can talk to them often and

608
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
they send you letters back at Yashunka town with the snowy one.

609
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And you go to the post office.

610
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And so like you kind of that's a little bit of that.

611
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But yeah, you're basically it's like a globe trotting adventure.

612
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So you don't really have enough time to like sit there and get to know the people of the island.

613
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do you?

614
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You know.

615
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah.

616
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Did you ever play a game called Phenotopia?

617
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No, I've never heard of that one.

618
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Okay.

619
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Well, it was a it was a Newgrounds game, but it was like a side scrolling action RPG,

620
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
a bit in the vein of Cave Story, but like without like gunplay.

621
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But I played that a long time ago.

622
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And then when I played Legends, I was like, wow, some even though even though this is

623
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
like a 3D free roaming adventure and that was like a 2D side scrolling action adventure,

624
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
there's something very similar about like the pixelated graphic style and there's something

625
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
because because in Phenotopia, you go around, you meet talk to villagers, you like do favors

626
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
for them, you find them stuff and trade stuff with them to like upgrade your equipment and

627
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
all that.

628
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Mm hmm.

629
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You explore ruins.

630
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
There is a sort of like secret science fiction backstory that with dark implications that

631
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
you uncover.

632
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's like this is this is just this is Phenotopia.

633
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I was playing Legends.

634
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I like this is just Phenotopia.

635
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Right.

636
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
They Phenotopia just ripped this game off completely and Phenotopia is awesome.

637
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They remade it.

638
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
They remade it on the on the switch.

639
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's on the switch now.

640
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Really?

641
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's awesome.

642
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think it's called Phenotopia Awakenings.

643
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I haven't yet.

644
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I haven't played the remake, but like they did like a full like read.

645
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I don't have to look into this.

646
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's a good child of Newgrounds.

647
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So yeah, it was, um, it was like, uh, like Newgrounds.

648
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It wasn't even just like some random guy posted it to Newgrounds.

649
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I think Newgrounds like funded this guy.

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Like they did like a big full page spread on the on the on the main page when it came

651
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
out.

652
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Right.

653
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
They sort of did like a lot to do a little bit.

654
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, a little bit.

655
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That's awesome.

656
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's a good game.

657
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's a good ass game.

658
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah.

659
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It sounds like a good ass game.

660
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think anything that lets you, any game that lets you like emotionally connect to a

661
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
10 PCs, um, I think it's doing a great job because you do feel more connected and you

662
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
feel more like satisfaction and more like, um, I'm not sure what the word is, but like

663
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
it's just a bigger deal to you.

664
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Like it has more meaning when you like actually finish quests because not only are you getting

665
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
like, oh cool, I got the item to go give to the next person to go do whatever.

666
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You're also getting an emotional payoff.

667
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So like it feels good.

668
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's, it's Fino.

669
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's spelled like Phoenix, by the way.

670
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So it's like P H O E N O T O P.

671
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Got it.

672
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Right.

673
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Phonetopia.

674
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Phonetopia.

675
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Uh, gave you said you made it to the Mega Man Legends part.

676
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I think I got, I think I finished that and then you were talking about Mega Man and base.

677
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I was a little confused because you didn't draw a line was based made by Dr. Wiley.

678
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes.

679
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah.

680
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's sort of a reveal like part way through Mega Man seven, I think.

681
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah.

682
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's part way through Mega Man seven.

683
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think I eventually draw that.

684
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I eventually draw that line.

685
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah.

686
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Base was made accidentally by Dr. Wiley.

687
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, he, he's, um, oh, I didn't mention this, but like, okay, all the, all the robots have

688
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the serial numbers and base is, base actually has a serial number, but he's not a, a light,

689
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
a Dr. Wiley number.

690
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He's like a super Dr. Wiley number.

691
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He's called like special Wiley number.

692
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah.

693
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
He's like, he's SW, he's SW.

694
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm messing it up.

695
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
SWN.

696
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yes.

697
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
SWN zero, zero one or just one or something.

698
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Whereas zero is, is, is DWN infinity.

699
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
He's not a special Dr. Wiley number.

700
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He's just a regular Dr. Wiley number, but he's number infinity.

701
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah.

702
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
He's supposed to be like the end.

703
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like there is nothing, you know, there's nothing more than him.

704
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know what I'm saying?

705
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Like that's.

706
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah.

707
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I think that's kind of cool.

708
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Whereas X, he's not a light number.

709
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He doesn't have a serial number because he's not part of a series.

710
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He's, he's his own person and his name.

711
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
A person.

712
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah.

713
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And his name X is like a variable X because he has infinite potential because he can be

714
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
whatever he wants to be.

715
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh, it's beautiful.

716
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It is.

717
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Like I've always had people ask me, they're like, what's X is a serial number?

718
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm like, well, if it had to be anything, it would probably just be X.

719
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But I don't think.

720
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.

721
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I think that would defeat the purpose of what light is trying to, trying to illustrate.

722
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So I think he would just not give him a number at all.

723
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
He would just be like X, you, you aren't.

724
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I said this in one of my videos.

725
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
X is not a robot with the ability to think like a person.

726
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He is a person who happens to be a robot or something.

727
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Totally.

728
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What's this?

729
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Sort of like X, if he wanted to, could choose his own name.

730
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah.

731
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And that would be his serial number.

732
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm just putting this here because you can see in teeny, teeny, tiny little letters.

733
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It says DWN infinity.

734
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You see where it says like Omega because you're dealing.

735
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh, I see.

736
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, I see.

737
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Bottom right.

738
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's a doctor dot W dot.

739
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And number, number infinity.

740
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah.

741
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, yeah.

742
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Because this is an emission where I believe you're going to confront Omega or something.

743
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And so the implication is that Omega is DWN infinity because he's inhabiting zero's original

744
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
body.

745
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Is this where that comes from that he's DWN number infinity?

746
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No.

747
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Okay.

748
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This is the, this is the first like in game confirmation of that.

749
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But I believe it was another thing that was like confirmed in a, you know, on the back

750
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
of a soda can or something like that in Japan.

751
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah.

752
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah.

753
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But it's a thing that's always been known.

754
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Everyone's because I've heard that even since I was a kid, they were like, no, he's DWN

755
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
infinity.

756
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I think, I think that was first confirmed around Mega Man X five where like the Wiley zero

757
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
connection was like, like right in your face.

758
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There's no escaping it anymore.

759
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean, arguably X four, but they don't really delve into it too much.

760
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But that's when they were like really like, look, he's made by Wiley.

761
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This is the connection.

762
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This is what's going on.

763
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So it was confirmed in a book somewhere and it's spread throughout like the, the old

764
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
early 2000s Mega Man websites that I used to frequent.

765
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Shout outs to Mega Man Network and Mega Man homepage.

766
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This is like into creates like they into creates loves their references.

767
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So like they were absolutely going to be like, we're going to cram as much references in

768
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
here as possible.

769
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That's a good one.

770
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So that that's a good one right there.

771
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And I don't have it handy.

772
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm desperately trying to find it.

773
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
This is actually cut content.

774
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think you can find it on the cutting room floor in zeros like opening area where you

775
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
like the in-game cut scene where CL walks on screen and he's in his like little capsule

776
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
thingy when he's like hanging there with no arms.

777
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah.

778
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So there's like the artwork of him hanging, but there's also like the in-game scene,

779
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
like where he's like where he's there.

780
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
There's actually a wall that they removed, I guess, so that you can see him better.

781
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And the wall has the words like, like warning virus and a symbol.

782
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And you can't really read that it says virus because it's like broken.

783
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's like kind of like, like, like messed up.

784
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

785
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But the symbol is there.

786
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And it's a symbol that's actually shown in the cut scene where zero is in the warehouse

787
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
fighting against Sigma.

788
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
There is like these canisters that have this symbol on it.

789
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And then that this thing that says warning virus has the exact same symbol.

790
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So I guess into creates looked at that cut scene.

791
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It was like, that's the symbol to indicate like computer virus or something to that

792
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
effect.

793
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Wait, which game was the cut scene in?

794
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
X4.

795
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
When?

796
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, when the, the anime one, when they're.

797
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah.

798
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
When they're fighting.

799
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah.

800
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
There's a, there's a spot somewhere either during one of zero's flashbacks or when he's

801
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
fighting Sigma, whatever that is.

802
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But there's a group of canisters and they have this little symbol on them.

803
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And like it's just there.

804
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Like there's a background thing.

805
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Like you didn't mean anything.

806
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But then I guess not retroactively.

807
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah.

808
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I guess retroactively.

809
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah.

810
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah.

811
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
They, they, they picked that out and they said, Hey, what if this is the symbol for the

812
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
virus that was in?

813
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah.

814
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Exactly.

815
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So it's funny because it's cut content.

816
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So you never actually see it, but it does.

817
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It is there.

818
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And so I'm saying like, well, it's cut content, but what was their intention?

819
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You know, so.

820
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah.

821
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah.

822
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Totally.

823
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, that's great.

824
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
There's just like little details, you know, there's like way too many of those.

825
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You could get there.

826
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They're like, they're all over, especially in the zero games.

827
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then I mean, yeah.

828
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, man, I've after I finished at some point, I realized that the in ZX, I think it's in

829
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
ZX one or two, like the body of high leg or a buckle is just kind of like buried under

830
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
some grass somewhere.

831
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I have one even better for you in the woods.

832
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yeah.

833
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
For the entire, there's a lot of bosses actually.

834
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't have screenshots of all of them.

835
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
The high leg or a buckle was just one that I in game.

836
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I noticed was like, oh my God, it's high leg.

837
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's everybody's favorite suitoroid high leg or a buckle.

838
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah.

839
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What's the name?

840
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's so easy to pronounce and remember.

841
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I mean, it's memorable.

842
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's a memorable name once you get your head.

843
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh, this one.

844
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's cucumber.

845
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Right.

846
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's a wire sponge.

847
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Wire sponge.

848
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
What the fuck?

849
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So I always thought this was cool that he's like dead, but he's like fused in.

850
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So this is the Tower of Vendir in ZX, which is like or ZX Advent, I should say.

851
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And it's like a giant organic tree thing.

852
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think I don't know if this is growing out of area zero or if it's like near area zero.

853
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But it's interesting because wire sponge was part of a like a weather control thing.

854
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And there's like these weird gross like organic vines that can like grow out of his stage.

855
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Like there's like things that they drop.

856
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So this looks like if one of those like grew out of control and I guess his body was just like merged with it.

857
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know how he got stuck there because I mean like he got blown up and then you fight him again in the Sigma stages for or I guess the X Hunter stages for X2.

858
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So how did he get here?

859
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't understand, but I don't know what the implications of this are, but it's neat to speculate.

860
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
That's just news.

861
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hell.

862
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's just cool.

863
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They love their references, man.

864
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm telling you, it's all over the place for better or for worse.

865
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

866
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm like appreciating.

867
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm like appreciating the screenshots.

868
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh my God.

869
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
This is so cool.

870
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
There's so much implied history here.

871
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah.

872
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Speaking.

873
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh, go ahead.

874
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I just want to say I think I think unfortunately I think I got to say that I think the part where in the lecture where I talk about legends is a little bit slow.

875
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I think like I think it was I think that's kind of maybe like the low point energy wise in the lecture because I think.

876
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yeah, I felt like there was a few moments when you were talking about Legends 2 that I realized I wasn't listening for like four times and I had to go back.

877
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And I'm like, okay, let me actually pay attention.

878
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Like what happened?

879
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Like who?

880
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's because it's because it's because like that those games, even though they canonically take place in the future.

881
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
They're like they're very they feel very disconnected from the rest of it.

882
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So there's not that much in the terms of like like connections to be made.

883
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So there's actually a few that I wanted to mention, which I don't know if you knew these and couldn't fit them in because I know that for for Legends.

884
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I didn't think that it was low energy so much as there wasn't a lot connecting other games, but there's a lot to cover.

885
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So I know you were kind of like going over a lot of it.

886
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Like you're and this is not that it was any less good.

887
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It was just kind of like you have to just kind of speed through it because there's just so much.

888
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think I was kind of trying to speed through it.

889
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Which makes sense because I mean the story is massive, but here's something that I was surprised that you didn't.

890
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Right.

891
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So there's so much more dialogue in the Legends games.

892
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's like it's kind of got to kind of got to summarize all this.

893
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So connecting ZX to Legends, I'm surprised you didn't talk too much about this.

894
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Alright.

895
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
In Legends, the Master runs Elysium, right?

896
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah.

897
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This big tall blonde man who lives for however many years, 3,000 years or something like that.

898
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The Sage Trinity made up of those three smart guys.

899
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
They're also called Masters.

900
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
There's Master Thomas, Master Albert, Master Mikai.

901
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's true.

902
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That's true.

903
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

904
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And on top of that, they are doing, I can't articulate it better than this because it's

905
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
not made very clear in the ending, but he's like something, something replates with human

906
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
bodies.

907
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And what do you think we did with this and that?

908
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And on top of that, Mega Man, or I should say Rock, Volnut, is called Mega Man Trigger,

909
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
right?

910
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
There's another Mega Man on Cadillacs Island called Mega Man Juno.

911
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah.

912
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The people who use bio metals are also called Mega Man.

913
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes.

914
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's like now a title.

915
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Even more than that, it's only like brushed over really quickly.

916
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
You are not just a Mega Man, you are also named based on which bio metal that you're

917
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
using.

918
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So if you're using Bio Metal Model Z, you are Mega Man Zero, you are Mega Man X, you

919
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
are Mega Man Thephnir, you are Mega Man Harpuia, Mega Man Phanta, Mega Man Leviathan.

920
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,640
So Mega Man has now become a title.

921
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,320
So there's not too much connecting them, but I mean, you got people called Masters who

922
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:33,880
are like, they rule over the society of people and kind of control, you know, human-reploid

923
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,440
relations as well as, you know, they have their own like backup of like human bodies

924
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,480
somewhere.

925
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,840
And then there's also the Mega Men who serve the Masters, just like how in Legends, the

926
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,660
Mega Men who work on the islands and things like that also serve the Masters.

927
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,240
So I think there's some sort of connection going on there too.

928
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,760
That's true and you put it like that.

929
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,480
And the kicker, which makes everyone kind of all their, everyone's brains explode, is

930
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,920
the very last thing that Thomas says is this world needs to be reset, which is not unlike

931
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,240
the Carbon Reinitialization Program, which will wipe out everyone on the planet and literally

932
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,560
reset the world.

933
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
It is like that.

934
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,080
So what they mean by this, I don't know, but I feel like I'm not saying they're like,

935
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,440
you can draw a straight line from ZX to Legends, but I'm saying that that seems to be laying

936
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,800
the groundwork for something that's going to come.

937
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:36,000
I think it's, yeah, you can, you could definitely hear that and be like, is, you know, he talks

938
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,720
about like he wants to like reset the world and create the next step in human evolution.

939
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,440
So is it, it's not, it's not that hard to imagine that he's talking about carbons or

940
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:56,320
the Anthro, uh, the Anthro units or pure humans or, uh, yeah, the stuff that becomes, yeah,

941
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
sure.

942
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,200
I found this out in my, uh, I have a series of three videos I did called History of Robotics

943
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
and Mega Man.

944
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
I watched those.

945
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,040
I watched those, of course.

946
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,640
I had a feeling because I heard you say a few things and I'm like, hey, I remember

947
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,880
I had, I watched a bunch of them and I, and I got enough from that I was like, I can't,

948
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
it's plagiarism.

949
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,280
If I just say these things, I have to, I have to shout, I have to shout this channel out

950
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
now.

951
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
I appreciate it.

952
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Thank you.

953
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I was very surprised when I saw that.

954
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
I was like, oh, wow, look at that.

955
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,640
I'm hitting the big leagues now.

956
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,680
I was, I was, you know, I was, I was, um, I was looking for like Mega Man videos on YouTube

957
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,840
to get like alternate perspective, like, you know, just to hear what's like, hear what's

958
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,760
in the zeitgeist, hear what's like word on the street.

959
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,840
So I, and I think I found your channel and I watched a bunch of your stuff.

960
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Thank you.

961
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
I'm very flattered.

962
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
Yeah.

963
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,600
And in the end I was like, well, I got it.

964
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,400
I got some key, I got some keen insights from this, from this guy.

965
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,520
So got to let people know.

966
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,720
Oh, well, I really do appreciate it.

967
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
It means a lot to me.

968
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,000
I've been trying to share your video everywhere that I possibly can because it's great.

969
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Thank you.

970
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,520
Um, I got to, I got to celebrate.

971
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
I got to celebrate.

972
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,760
I did last night, it did hit the milestone.

973
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,000
It did hit a hundred K views in its first week.

974
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
100 K views.

975
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Nice.

976
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's crazy.

977
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,520
I wasn't sure if it was going to do that.

978
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,920
Uh, I'll say, I was going to, I told myself I was going to be happy if it hit a hundred

979
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
K views ever.

980
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,000
Like, I thought it was not going to do as well as my previous ones.

981
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,600
I was, I was going to say in the Mega Man, in the Mega Man circles, your video is getting

982
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
everywhere.

983
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,800
I've had like a thousand people be like, have you seen this video?

984
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
Is it going to be good?

985
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
Check it out.

986
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,200
It's going to be awesome.

987
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
So like everyone knows about it.

988
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,840
In the Mega Man community, like everyone does, like, and I'm super happy that they do because

989
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
it's amazing.

990
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,800
I don't want to be like the only guy that talks about Mega Man.

991
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,960
Um, some people have even complained they're like, he's the only one that talks about

992
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
blah, blah, blah.

993
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,600
I'm like, okay, but that's not my choice.

994
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,000
Like I'm not like, you know, like, like monopolizing it.

995
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Everyone's free to do it.

996
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,720
It's just, I'm the only one who is.

997
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,440
So, um, I'm really happy that there's more people doing it and I'm more than happy to

998
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,160
collab with other YouTubers, you know, who want to talk about stuff.

999
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
So.

1000
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,560
A lot of people keep, you know, every now and then I get a comment that's like, obviously

1001
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,600
a lot of people are like, where's battle network, where's command mission, even though I explained

1002
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
in the video.

1003
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
I saw that.

1004
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
But that, but that's okay.

1005
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
But that's okay.

1006
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
I get it.

1007
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Nobody read.

1008
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
I get it.

1009
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Nobody pays attention.

1010
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,600
It's fine.

1011
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
Nobody reads the description and nobody pays attention to your opening statements.

1012
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:27,080
Cause I do videos like who exactly is Mega Man and I give you like a 30 minute video

1013
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,040
explaining the origins of Mega Man, his specifications, a buttload of trivia.

1014
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,280
And then I still have that one jackass in the comments.

1015
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,240
He's like, oh, you didn't talk about Mega Man EXE and I'm like, it's a different character.

1016
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,240
Like, come on.

1017
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,640
Cut me some slack here.

1018
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,440
Hey, wait a second.

1019
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,440
I'm sorry.

1020
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
This is off topic.

1021
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,440
I'm looking at that screenshot.

1022
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
The wire spun screenshot.

1023
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
Uh huh.

1024
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
Okay.

1025
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
You see that pillar.

1026
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Rewinding a bit.

1027
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,280
You see that pillar in the background under the spike wall.

1028
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
Yeah.

1029
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,280
The angry face.

1030
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,280
I'm sorry.

1031
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
Is that Dr. Doppler?

1032
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,640
I'm sorry.

1033
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,640
It looks exactly like Dr. Doppler.

1034
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
Yeah.

1035
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,640
You know, you know what?

1036
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,040
We found another reference.

1037
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,040
It totally could be.

1038
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,240
Like I'm not saying that it is, but I'm not putting it out.

1039
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,360
I'm not saying it isn't because he's made up of nano machines and he's merged with everything.

1040
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,800
So if anything is Maverick or evil, no, no, no, no, not Dr. Vi, although he does kind of

1041
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,800
look like Dr. Vi.

1042
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,800
I'm saying, oh, you know what?

1043
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
You're right.

1044
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
You're right.

1045
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
I think it looks more like him.

1046
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
You're right.

1047
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I got it mixed up.

1048
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
You're totally right.

1049
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
It has to be.

1050
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
Who else could it be?

1051
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Yeah.

1052
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,080
It's literally the only thing that makes sense.

1053
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,120
It's literally the only rational explanation.

1054
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
Yeah.

1055
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,120
If you deny it.

1056
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,080
I used to think Dr. Vi'll, or I always say Vi'll just to make sure that I don't confuse

1057
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,920
him with Vi'll, the bad guy robot remix.

1058
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Yeah.

1059
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,520
I said, I said wheel.

1060
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,920
I used to say wheel.

1061
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,920
I used to say wheel too.

1062
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,240
And then people were like, no, it's supposed to be Vi'll because that's his name in Japanese.

1063
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,560
I'm like, I know that's his name in Japanese, but I'm saying while because that's how it

1064
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,560
looks like it should be pronounced.

1065
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,880
So now I had some people say, I had some people say while now, I had some people say that

1066
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,520
in German, it might be, it might be either Vi'll or some have said that it might be

1067
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
Ville.

1068
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,520
Yeah.

1069
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,720
And unfortunately it's it's hard.

1070
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,840
You can't even reference the original Japanese pronunciation to be like, well, what is it

1071
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
supposed to be?

1072
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,160
Because it's a totally different name.

1073
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,160
Yeah.

1074
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,560
That's kind of like the whole ballad or belayed.

1075
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,960
I always go with ballad because in Japanese, I think his name is like Barado or something

1076
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
like that.

1077
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,160
Like it's got the, it's, it's a, what's the word I'm looking for?

1078
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
The short a.

1079
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
Yeah.

1080
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
Yeah.

1081
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,320
So that's why I always say ballad makes, I had a lot of keyboard warriors in the comments

1082
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,920
slamming on their keys, like, no, you idiot pronouncing wrong.

1083
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,840
I'm like, all right, sorry, dude, I'm too busy knowing everything else about Mega Man.

1084
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,000
So remember here to pronounce his name, right?

1085
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,080
You just got to pronounce it really wrong because it's going billiards or whatever.

1086
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
Yeah.

1087
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,680
You gotta do Billiards would be a cool name for a robot actually.

1088
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,640
Honestly, what would have gotten the video even more views is if I just deliberately

1089
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,520
pronounced all the names wrong because people can't help like, like, um, you get so much

1090
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
interaction.

1091
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
Welcome to my Megaman lecture.

1092
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,720
Megaman, Pokemon, Pokemon YouTubers and like Nuzlocke, like FlygonHG does it all the time.

1093
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,280
He like pronounces Pokemon's names wrong on purpose all the time.

1094
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Like, uh, uh, uh, like he calls Magnemite, Magnemite, and he calls Ninetales, Nenaytales

1095
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,760
and stuff like that.

1096
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,640
And I think he's doing it as a joke, but I'm sure it has the side effect of like,

1097
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Rattata.

1098
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:46,480
Um, people just can't help but be like, he said, um, he said, uh,

1099
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
Yeah.

1100
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,760
He, why, why did he pronounce it Lucario?

1101
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
Why did he say it like that?

1102
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,760
Yeah.

1103
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,960
I, I have to admit, um, I don't think I've ever done anything that egregious, um, but

1104
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,880
I have absolutely said things that like, for instance, I saw you, you mentioned this.

1105
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,560
There was a theory that saying like the star droids might not actually be aliens.

1106
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,560
And don't get me wrong.

1107
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,920
I did consider like, you know, maybe that is a possibility, but I purposely didn't double

1108
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,960
back to say that, you know, like, no, they probably are aliens.

1109
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,640
I think that's, that's what their intention was only because I knew it was going to get

1110
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,520
people to comment and be like, they absolutely are aliens.

1111
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,520
So it's, it's, it's kind of cheated a little bit, but I got a lot of engagement out of

1112
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,520
it.

1113
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
So I mean, what can I say?

1114
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:36,320
I think, um, I didn't, I didn't set out deliberately to say anything wrong for engagement, but like,

1115
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,840
I think the fact that my video is eight hours long and I say so many things, like I'm surely

1116
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,520
I'll, I'll leave stuff out or probably get things wrong here and there.

1117
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,160
Uh, and I think you did fantastic though.

1118
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,760
Like honestly, all things considered, and I'm telling you as someone who I don't want

1119
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,480
to say it's my job because I don't do YouTube as a job, but okay, um, as someone who spends

1120
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:01,120
every single day basically looking into and examining Mega Man lore and history, um, you

1121
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:07,560
did a fantastic job and I honestly don't think anyone could fault you given the size and

1122
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,040
scope of your video for leaving anything out.

1123
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,360
Like I thought you'd agree.

1124
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:17,120
Anything that you left out, I didn't assume it was left out because of, um, like ignorance

1125
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,760
and I figured you left it out because of time because honestly, like it's huge.

1126
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,960
Well I think it's like you said, even if I did, um, even if I didn't get anything like

1127
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,760
straight up wrong, there's always going to be things that like someone else interpreted

1128
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,840
something differently or someone else or there, or there's vagueness in the interpretation

1129
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,040
and it's like, well, someone's going to think something different.

1130
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,400
But as a result of that, um, the video has gotten, it's got like for its view count,

1131
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,040
um, it's gotten, it's gotten like a thousand comments, which is a lot, which is a lot for

1132
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
a hundred K views.

1133
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,640
Like I have videos that have like, I have a couple of the other lectures have like two

1134
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,840
hundred K views and they don't have two thousand comments.

1135
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,040
They have like eight hundred comments, nine hundred comments.

1136
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,040
Right.

1137
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,880
So I think, I think, uh, this is very, very active comment section on this one, which

1138
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,440
supposedly, uh, which is great.

1139
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Yeah.

1140
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,840
I'm already getting pulled into arguments in your comment section.

1141
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
I left.

1142
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
I'm sorry.

1143
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
No, it's okay.

1144
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
I'm not like actually like.

1145
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,240
I have not been looking at my comments.

1146
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,960
I know I said I would answer comments in the video and I, and I will go through them at

1147
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,640
some point, but there's too many and I haven't like gone through them and like tried to answer

1148
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,600
people's, uh, questions except for like one or two here and there.

1149
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
Right.

1150
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:35,080
It's just like, um, so I referenced, um, in, in one of my comments, I was like something,

1151
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:44,120
Dr. Wilde or, uh, or whatever his name is, uh, love Lava lamp, man, um, he in, in X dive,

1152
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,360
they have character bios that they release every once in a while and the character bios

1153
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,640
as far as I can tell contain cannon information because I've actually been able to cross reference

1154
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,920
it with other sources.

1155
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,920
So it's like, oh cool.

1156
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,160
So X dive itself, we all know is not cannon because it's, it's, it's literally a game

1157
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,920
playing off of your nostalgia.

1158
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,120
Like within the opening.

1159
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,520
I was so relieved to discover that it's definitely not cannon because I'm like, this seems

1160
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,040
like there's like an amount of content and it's, it's clearly just them having fun.

1161
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,880
They're just like, Hey, remember when you used to play video games all night and did

1162
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,880
this?

1163
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
I'm like, okay.

1164
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,240
So they're acknowledging that Mega Man is just a video game series and like it's not

1165
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
right.

1166
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,240
It isn't the story.

1167
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:30,240
The story of X dive is that you, you basically play yourself, but like going into the computer

1168
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,160
to like fix old Mega Man data.

1169
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,880
You're fixing, you're fixing data.

1170
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,600
You're fixing the memories of Mega Man, which is stored in a giant computer called the deep

1171
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,320
log, which is the most unfortunate name for a computer ever log wall.

1172
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,840
So it's basically, so it's basically an excuse.

1173
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,680
It's basically an excuse to play through a bunch of like, what if like alternate Mega

1174
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,960
Man scenarios with the goal of like fixing them.

1175
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Yeah.

1176
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,000
They're just throwing cannon out the window to have fun crossovers and whatever.

1177
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,360
And I'm like, I'm all for it because, you know, it's people are like, it's nostalgia

1178
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
pandering.

1179
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,640
And I'm like, yeah, you're just having fun.

1180
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,960
It's not a serious game.

1181
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,920
You know, it's not meant to be taken seriously.

1182
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Sounds like it might be fun.

1183
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,560
I like, you can, you can argue like, oh, it's predatory because it's gotcha or whatever.

1184
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,160
I'm like, all right, fine, but like just don't spend your money then.

1185
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Yeah.

1186
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,960
Like I stopped playing, but even if I stopped playing, I'm still enjoying just looking at

1187
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,480
the new character designs and models as they come out.

1188
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,120
So like, I mean, I'm loving it, even though I'm not even actively playing in it.

1189
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,680
I love the game, but, you know,

1190
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,840
all this to just to mention that I mentioned that Dr.

1191
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,600
Wild thing and people were slamming me in the responses because they're like, really,

1192
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,760
you're going to accept X dive as canon, that that piece of crap game

1193
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,160
that's all about milking you for money.

1194
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,280
I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, chill, dude.

1195
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,720
Like I'm not saying the story of X dive is canon.

1196
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:55,480
I'm just saying that if all their other character bios are canon because I've been

1197
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,120
able to reference them with other sources, why would Dr.

1198
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,440
Wild's bio not be canon, you know, even though it's giving us new info?

1199
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,320
I feel like that makes sense.

1200
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,760
I. Yeah.

1201
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,600
Because like, why would he be the one exception?

1202
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,440
Like all the other bios are canonically accurate and there's sources for them,

1203
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,880
except for his like, come on, like really?

1204
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,160
I mean, you could maybe you could try to be like, oh, it's a different studio.

1205
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,040
But like, Inti Creates is a different studio than the one.

1206
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,600
But it's not a different studio anymore.

1207
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,800
Or at least I don't think it is.

1208
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,840
I think is it not.

1209
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,480
It used to be Capcom, Taiwan.

1210
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,840
But as I recall, I believe Capcom, Japan resumed development of it.

1211
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,520
But so like, I think Capcom, Taiwan is Inti Creates made zero.

1212
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,720
And I'm saying that it's not.

1213
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,120
Oh, yeah. Inti Creates didn't make X dive.

1214
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,040
So I mean, I guess you could say that, but like, that's dumb.

1215
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,840
So never mind.

1216
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,520
It's it's owned by Capcom.

1217
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,680
So, you know what I mean?

1218
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,480
Like Capcom owns the IP and even though they gave

1219
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,240
Inti Creates the permission to make whatever story they wanted,

1220
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,840
ultimately, Capcom still holds the reins so they can change it

1221
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,240
to be whatever the hell they want it to be.

1222
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,640
So, yeah, you know, so that is just the thing I'm putting out there.

1223
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,440
I there was something else I was going to go off on.

1224
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,760
I can't remember. But anyway, I just wanted to say, please don't attack me

1225
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,080
for using X dive as a source. I'm sorry.

1226
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,080
There's a lot of useful information in that game, even though the game itself is not can.

1227
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,520
And I feel like that makes perfect sense.

1228
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,640
That makes sense to me.

1229
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,720
Like I learned another neat fact about X's armors.

1230
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,960
Yeah.

1231
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,800
So this was something that was only speculated on, but it was recently confirmed.

1232
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,080
So everyone's always like, what happens to X's armors between games?

1233
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,400
Why does he lose his armors between the games?

1234
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,240
So originally, there was a quote from a developer somewhere for X4

1235
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,880
where they're like, this isn't canon, this is just our personal idea.

1236
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,720
But we think that X doesn't like holding onto weapons of war.

1237
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,640
He only uses them when he needs to.

1238
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,000
So that's why your weapons go away.

1239
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,280
He's like, I don't need these anymore.

1240
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,840
I'm going to get rid of them.

1241
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,680
But they're still stored somewhere because in X5, he has some on the back.

1242
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,200
Yeah, when you fight zero, he uses some of the X4 weapons.

1243
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,680
But where did the armors go?

1244
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,880
So there's actually another again, it's on the back of a milk carton somewhere.

1245
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,960
It's in a newspaper, not newspaper, excuse me, magazine.

1246
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,480
I think one of the Dysocon guides where for X2, it says that X found

1247
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,280
another light capsule after he had the full armor and he stepped into the capsule

1248
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,560
and it unequipped it from him where Dr.

1249
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:33,840
Light then studied the armor and then developed the second armor from it,

1250
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,520
which is why the first armor is not actually called the light armor.

1251
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,840
That's like a fan name.

1252
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,800
It's actually just called the first armor.

1253
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,000
Second armor is also not called the Giga armor.

1254
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,360
It's actually called the second armor officially.

1255
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,640
And so everyone's like, OK, well, that explains that one.

1256
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,960
But where's the third armor come from?

1257
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,480
So Xdive, when they were doing a showcase of the third armor as a character

1258
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,680
when it came out, they mentioned just like previously,

1259
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,840
he turned in the second armor to a light capsule.

1260
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,520
And then he studied the battle data from that and then developed

1261
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,680
the third armor from that, which totally tracks because.

1262
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,960
Makes sense.

1263
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,560
In X1, you get the dash.

1264
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,560
In X2, you get the air dash.

1265
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,920
In X3, you get like the vertical dash on top of that.

1266
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,960
In X2, you get like the double charge shot.

1267
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,720
And then in X3, you get like an even bigger double charge shot.

1268
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,800
So like, obviously, it's like an increment of what it's working on.

1269
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,040
And then, of course, in X4, there's like, we don't actually know

1270
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,880
what he did with the third armor because there's nothing no one said anything.

1271
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,040
But it can be presumed that because they're all named first, second,

1272
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,360
third, and then finally fourth, that he turned in the armor for the third one.

1273
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,480
And like it got developed into the fourth one, which also increments.

1274
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,040
I read somewhere that fourth armor was a mistranslation of force armor.

1275
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,480
No, it's actually not a mistranslation.

1276
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,480
In Japanese, it would be pronounced and spelled the exact same way,

1277
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,000
which is why people were saying force.

1278
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:03,000
You could technically translate it as both fourth and force.

1279
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,840
But given that the previous three armors are first, second, and third,

1280
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,000
fourth is the one that makes sense.

1281
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,480
I guess I didn't I didn't realize that

1282
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,480
because they don't actually like say they're they don't actually like call them

1283
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,200
that anywhere, like they don't they're not really named in X one through three.

1284
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,040
They're they don't get them.

1285
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,120
Yeah, they don't mention the names of them in game.

1286
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,760
The names of them come from other sources, of course.

1287
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,840
It's always like a random source.

1288
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,840
Another another weird wrench that they threw into it for some reason

1289
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,880
is that for X3 for a while, even though it's the third armor,

1290
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,200
they kept calling it the Max Armor and it's not the Max Armor.

1291
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,160
Because as it turns out, again, I love my because Mac died.

1292
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,680
Obviously, you killed Mac.

1293
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,160
It's not Mac's armor.

1294
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,680
He's dead. You can't just wait to lose his body.

1295
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,800
It's stupid. It's ridiculous.

1296
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,280
No, but I can't tell if you're joking.

1297
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,120
Mac is X's best friend.

1298
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,720
X's best friend of many years, his long time friend and compatriot.

1299
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,280
Oh, it's great.

1300
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,280
How cool of fate this is for to follow you yet.

1301
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:15,920
I think I think I think you I think in you, your video about

1302
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,840
like, how would you rewrite the story of X to give to give?

1303
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,240
You would give Mac more of a but you would give him more backstory.

1304
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,800
So when he betrays you, it actually means something.

1305
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,080
I think I think I was riffing on that when in the in the in the lecture.

1306
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,840
I make I make I make a joke about.

1307
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,520
Oh, yeah, your close personal friend and confidant Mac.

1308
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,080
Yeah, I mean, even if even if you weren't riffing on that,

1309
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,240
you absolutely hit the nail on the head because that's how everyone feels.

1310
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,200
There's been a long running joke between me and my buddy, Colman,

1311
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,800
where every time someone mentions Mac, we're like, who?

1312
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,600
Like, we just pretend we don't know who he is.

1313
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,120
Never, never heard of him, which I'm going to call it.

1314
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,720
Before I lose the weight, my train of thought, Max Armor.

1315
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,680
Max Armor isn't the name of the armor.

1316
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,920
It refers to having all of the armor parts.

1317
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,760
And the reason why I know this is because

1318
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,560
when they did the Mega Man Bandai Mega Armor series model kits,

1319
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,680
the third armor was called Max Armor.

1320
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,000
And what they really mean is full armor, because it was the only model kit

1321
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,440
of the armor they had at the time.

1322
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,320
So Max Armor was referring to the full set of armor.

1323
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,360
And then there was other toys, which reference a full set of armor

1324
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,280
for the X one and X two armors, and they also call it Max Armor.

1325
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,560
So Max Armor refers to all the armor pieces, not understanding.

1326
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,160
But everyone just kind of adopted it as like the name.

1327
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,600
Do they say it in the game?

1328
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,720
Like, like, does it show on a display somewhere that like when you've got all

1329
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,920
the pieces, it's called, it says, oh, you've Max, you've Max on it.

1330
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,720
OK, it does not.

1331
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,280
It's literally just part of like, merchandise material.

1332
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,480
It's like on a box, like for the model kit somewhere.

1333
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,400
Like, that's it. That's all it is. So that makes sense.

1334
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,160
But that's the reason I'm glad I cleared that up.

1335
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,720
Because for years, I was like, yeah, the third armor is called the Max Armor

1336
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,520
because in X four, it's called the Force Armor.

1337
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,280
And then in X five, they got the Falcon and Chet.

1338
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,000
But no, it's actually first, second, third, fourth.

1339
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,520
And then X five and onwards, they start giving them names.

1340
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,520
Yeah, because because they start being more than one in the game

1341
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,240
and you got to like switch between them. Yeah, exactly.

1342
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,480
So that's that's what was going on with that.

1343
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,560
Yeah, uh, where should I apologize?

1344
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,200
By the way, I feel like I don't mean to ramble as much as I do.

1345
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,440
I have a show for that called Ramblin Reploids.

1346
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,360
This is this is but I apologize.

1347
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,200
I get passionate about about Mega Man and it just flows out of me.

1348
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,400
I'm possessed by the spirit of X, you know.

1349
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,080
Uh, I wait, I feel like I was going to say, oh, I was on the subject of the.

1350
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,280
Oh, you said you Gibbs, you said you made it to the legends.

1351
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,280
And I said the legends is a bit of an energy low point.

1352
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:54,160
I just wanted to say that I think I to me in my opinion, the video picks up

1353
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,880
energy around the time I'm getting to X around the time that I go on

1354
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,800
like a big rant about how much I hate Repliforce.

1355
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,960
I feel like that's I feel like that's kind of when I hit my stride.

1356
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,160
I think you.

1357
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,760
Yeah, because I think not only that, because like you, like you said,

1358
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,560
legends is so disconnected from so many things, unless you know, like, where to look.

1359
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:24,440
But I was really, I was really enjoying how unapologetically against Repliforce you are.

1360
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,600
Yeah, I felt like it's more interesting if I like.

1361
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,520
I feel like it's more interesting if I take a hard line

1362
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,320
and I'm like everyone's very waffly about whether or not Repliforce is.

1363
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,520
I mean, and I like you can tell you can tell in the game they were going for

1364
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:46,840
like a sort of morally gray both sides are both sides are sympathetic conflict.

1365
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,880
Like so they're so they're they're both they're both right and wrong.

1366
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,920
Like so Repliforce is wrong for just being like, hey, man,

1367
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,400
all your all of your robots are at the scene of the crime.

1368
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,920
Can we like talk about this?

1369
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,120
And they're like, how dare you?

1370
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,400
I'm afraid we can't talk about this.

1371
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,440
Yeah, just launch a full on war.

1372
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,160
And then the Maverick Hunters not really X or zero necessarily.

1373
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,080
But I guess I guess society is the problem because they're so quick

1374
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,280
to label anyone who doesn't fall into lockstep as a Maverick.

1375
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:25,120
So you could argue that Repliforce knows that no matter what's going to happen,

1376
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,160
they're just going to be labeled Mavericks anyway.

1377
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,200
So maybe they figured like we got no other choice may as well throw a revolution

1378
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,640
right now, you know, I guess. Yeah.

1379
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,600
Yeah, that's always been my argument is like Repliforce knows.

1380
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,400
I guess it didn't really consider it from that angle.

1381
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,880
But yeah, Maverick Hunters, if yeah.

1382
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,440
They're they're quick to they're quick to call people.

1383
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,800
If I guess it is they are the ones who are like, well, we've got to we've got to declare.

1384
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:00,040
I guess they sort of start the conflict by declaring them Mavericks in the first place.

1385
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,720
Yeah, I mean, I see that.

1386
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,840
Yeah, I mean, X X or zero did their best.

1387
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,600
They're like, listen, if you don't cooperate with us, you are going to be labeled as Mavericks,

1388
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:13,480
which, you know, right is not only is it like, yes, that's the logical thing to do

1389
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,240
because they're at the scene of a gigantic terrorist attack

1390
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,200
and are basically refusing to cooperate with you.

1391
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,120
But also it kind of speaks to the fact that like anyone can be labeled a Maverick,

1392
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,080
you know, like it kind of does, you know what I mean?

1393
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:34,360
Like I've always had the idea that as time goes on leading up to X for an X five ish,

1394
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,600
I guess even all the way into X seven, that the Maverick Hunters are slowly becoming

1395
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:44,240
like the judges from like Judge Dredd, like if someone doesn't obey you

1396
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,960
or doesn't does anything to even slightly look at humanity the wrong way, you're a Maverick.

1397
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:54,960
You know, by the I by the I mean by by X, but by zero,

1398
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,160
like that's zero is like the logical conclusion of that progression.

1399
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,280
Exactly, where the finally the Reploids were never equals.

1400
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,000
They just finally it's like the true colors are shown where it's like, OK,

1401
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,880
we don't trust Reploids, we're going to subjugate the crap out of them.

1402
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,160
And if anyone disagrees with that, you're a Maverick,

1403
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,880
whether you're a human or Reploid alike, it doesn't matter.

1404
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:23,600
So it kind of goes to show how like the term Maverick can, you know,

1405
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,520
it's not it's not really just it really just means whatever you think it means.

1406
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,600
Yeah, it goes from it's not like the word criminal where it's like this person,

1407
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,520
you know, committed a crime and they've been like convicted or something like that.

1408
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,760
It's more specific than that.

1409
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,320
Right. Maverick is just kind of like, hey, buddy, you're acting a little funny

1410
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,240
or like, hey, man, you made some anti human remark before.

1411
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,960
And I'm not sure I trust you anymore.

1412
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,800
And so you can kind of see how it's like a slippery slope.

1413
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,120
Once you kind of like start on it, you know, they're so they're they're basically

1414
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:01,120
getting canceled for tweets, yes, human tweets, except instead of getting canceled,

1415
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,160
you can blast it in the head.

1416
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,600
They send they send the they send the cops.

1417
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,960
Yeah, the robot, the robot police as they were almost called.

1418
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,440
Yeah, they I mean, they pretty much they pretty much are the robot police.

1419
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,360
Yeah, they were almost called that like in early drafts for the game.

1420
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,760
They were called the robot police.

1421
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,560
Maverick countries is cooler.

1422
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,560
It is way cooler.

1423
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,120
But I guess it all it kind of comes to the same thing.

1424
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,160
Everyone I don't like is a Maverick.

1425
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,960
Yeah, that's how it is, though.

1426
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,000
That's what that's all this whole deal that really is.

1427
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:43,280
Like, no, you know, Zero's line in Zero's line in Zero Three,

1428
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,600
when he tells Vile, like you you sound like the Maverick.

1429
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,600
Like, yeah, you're like you're like the king of the humans and like you're

1430
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,280
persecuting everyone and then you call them reploids and then have them retired.

1431
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,480
But like, you're you're the one that sounds like the Maverick,

1432
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,840
like for being such a desperate for being such a such a just a psychopath about it.

1433
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,720
I think who's who's the real Maverick here?

1434
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,960
What a game. Exactly.

1435
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,960
It is. I think I have some problems with indecorates storytelling

1436
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:17,160
because in the games themselves, it's a fantastic quadrilogy of games.

1437
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,040
But there's lots of other like minor details, which makes like a lore nut

1438
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,840
like me, like lose my mind because certain things just don't add up.

1439
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,480
But I won't get into those now because we'll be on.

1440
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,160
No, I can think of one. I can think of one or two.

1441
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,080
Yeah, there's definitely a handful.

1442
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,640
But I do think it is beautiful in that

1443
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,240
you can kind of see how the term Maverick gets applied more and more liberally

1444
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,400
throughout the series until finally it reaches a point where humans are like,

1445
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,160
yeah, we don't trust you, which sucks, because as you mentioned,

1446
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:50,000
there was a point where X was like kind of like ruler of the rest of the world

1447
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,040
for a little bit and everything was like cool and sweet and everyone

1448
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,800
was like singing Kumbaya and it was awesome. Yeah, definitely.

1449
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,360
And then and then Dr.

1450
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,400
Dr. Weil is like, how about no?

1451
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,880
And he he like actually I don't know if you mentioned it,

1452
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,800
but it is part of the story, which, again, is not explicitly stated in the games.

1453
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,960
I don't think he manufactured Mavericks to attack places

1454
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,520
after X's. So they're OK. Let me know.

1455
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,360
I didn't. I don't even remember that.

1456
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,520
OK, so this is again, this is this is why I say I don't like

1457
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:28,120
intercreates is storytelling, because there's lots of key details,

1458
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,360
which contextualize a lot of things, which are just not in the games.

1459
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,720
That's no, that's definitely true.

1460
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,960
Like the fact that I had to go and listen and listen and listen to it.

1461
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,600
But like there's you have to listen to the audio drama

1462
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,920
to know who like where El Piso comes from and why he has the baby elves.

1463
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,160
Yes. So this is actually about the baby elves.

1464
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:53,040
Dr. Weil develops the mother elf with

1465
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,840
Ciel's great grandmother or whoever the hell she is.

1466
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,360
I'm going to I'm just going to call her Alia.

1467
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,680
It's Alia. I'm just going to say it.

1468
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,640
We're just going to go ahead and say it's Alia.

1469
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,560
All right. He's developing the mother elf.

1470
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,960
I mean, just because that's what I choose to believe.

1471
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,080
I think it. I think it. Yeah.

1472
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,640
Why not? Why not? Why not?

1473
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,280
They got the same hair. They got the same color eyes.

1474
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,480
They're both pink, whatever.

1475
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,480
So he develops the mother elf and

1476
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,760
wisely, the human government of the time of the world.

1477
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,160
We'll just say the world governments are like,

1478
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,000
how are you going to use this thing?

1479
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,560
So everyone kind of submits their own ideas for how they're going to use

1480
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,280
this reality bending digital deity that they've created.

1481
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,440
And X says we should use it for its intended purpose

1482
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,760
and just remove the sigma virus from the world.

1483
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,040
And if any other viruses ever come up,

1484
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,960
we'll just use it again to get rid of them.

1485
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,840
And that is the only thing we ever use it for.

1486
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,760
The moderate position.

1487
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,800
Yeah, he's like, that is the only thing we use it for.

1488
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,840
It is only it was designed to stop viruses.

1489
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,040
We only use it to stop viruses.

1490
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,640
And Dr.

1491
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,000
Wila was like, well, actually,

1492
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,520
Reploids are the cause of literally all the conflict in the world.

1493
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,080
And I can't say that he's wrong.

1494
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,960
Like he's kind of right.

1495
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,120
So he's like, instead of using it to get rid of the viruses,

1496
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,280
number one, we get rid of the virus.

1497
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,160
And number two, we then use it to mind control all Reploids

1498
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,080
and revoke their free will so that we control what they do in the world.

1499
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,120
And so there's no way I did read this.

1500
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,000
Yeah, this rings a bell.

1501
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,840
So he he wants to control all Reploids.

1502
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,560
In the end, everyone, you know, is like, I don't know, that sounds kind of evil.

1503
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,600
And so so they go with X's plan and they're like, OK, so X,

1504
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,280
we're going to go with your plan.

1505
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,080
And I forget how they do this exactly because I thought they needed

1506
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,920
zero's original body to control the mother elf.

1507
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,640
But I don't know if Omega is a thing at this point, but either way,

1508
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,680
the point is they do erase the Maverick virus and or Sigma from the world.

1509
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,120
And then everything is happy and great and everyone loves it.

1510
01:13:59,480 --> 01:13:59,960
So Dr.

1511
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,120
Wila's like, well, you know, I don't like that.

1512
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,320
I think my plan is the right plan.

1513
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,520
So he goes and makes two copies of the mother elf, which are the baby elves.

1514
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,920
And then when he has those,

1515
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,080
he uses them to start manufacturing Maverick uprisings,

1516
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,400
basically mind controlling Reploids to go and commit crimes.

1517
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,480
So he's like, see, look, like the giving Reploids their free will.

1518
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,000
It doesn't solve anything.

1519
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,840
They're going to always rebel against humanity.

1520
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,600
It's evil. We got to control them.

1521
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,840
And so the government.

1522
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,160
I feel like there are parallels to be made to the real world here.

1523
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,120
Yeah.

1524
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:41,480
So he's like, see, I've manufactured a crisis, although no one knows that.

1525
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,920
And therefore you should give me control of the mother elf.

1526
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,360
And I'm going to enact my version of the plan.

1527
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,480
And so the human governments are like, and he also it's briefly mentioned,

1528
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,160
but he did have conspirators like on the inside that helped him.

1529
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,400
And so they were like, OK, we're going to go ahead and give you

1530
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,600
Zero's original body to control the mother elf and do whatever it is you want with it.

1531
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,440
And that's where Omega comes into play and gets put into Zero's body.

1532
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,280
And then also how he controls the mother elf and means.

1533
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,760
Yeah, no, no, go on, go on.

1534
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,480
So and so basically once he has the mother elf, he's like, Tee he, I'm just kidding.

1535
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,720
I'm not going to just control all the Reploids.

1536
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,320
I am also going to wage war on the entire planet and just rule it

1537
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,320
because I am a power hungry, crazy person inside of a lava lamp.

1538
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,920
It makes it makes perfect sense.

1539
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,120
If that's where if only it were actually in the game.

1540
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,360
Yeah, exactly.

1541
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,480
And so that's where the elf wars come in.

1542
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,400
And that's why they were so devastating, because they were literally

1543
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,600
waging war, not not just with the mother elf, but the other sides were fighting

1544
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,800
with their own cyber elves that were developed from the mother elf.

1545
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:53,720
And so each side is lobbying these reality bending super weapons at each other.

1546
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,480
You know, and just I mean, that must have been one hell of a battle.

1547
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,600
Like there's literally a cyber elf that can turn people into metools.

1548
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,480
Like, could you imagine like one day you're just a soldier on the field,

1549
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,640
you're shooting at guys, you're dipping and ducking through trenches.

1550
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,520
And then all of a sudden you just become a metal.

1551
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,640
Well, yeah.

1552
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,560
So so that's that's basically what happened.

1553
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,440
And then so X is fighting back and he's like, this is ridiculous.

1554
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,320
Holy crap, how did you guys let this happen?

1555
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,920
And so that's when they wake up zero and put him inside of that copy body.

1556
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,080
And then he he fights back with X.

1557
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,440
They defeat Dr. Wilde and Omega.

1558
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,920
And then that's when everyone's like, OK, X, you were right the first time.

1559
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,640
We're really sorry.

1560
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,840
You just you rule the world at this point, because we know that you're good

1561
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,360
and pure and you're the best little cupcake out there.

1562
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
And so then he does.

1563
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,680
And then everyone is happy and everything's perfect for a little while.

1564
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,160
It does make sense.

1565
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:54,720
I think I was a little I was a little fuzzy on some of the details of how it

1566
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,480
shook out and it is it's there.

1567
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,760
This is this is from like the drama CDs, right?

1568
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,120
Yeah, it's like drama CDs, external sources, like the art books.

1569
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,520
A lot of this is in official complete works.

1570
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,840
A lot of it is also on the now defunct, although I guess still considered canon.

1571
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,480
Mega Min zero collection, official timeline website,

1572
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,120
the official timeline they had on their thing.

1573
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,560
Yeah. So that's basically how that happened.

1574
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,480
So yeah, everyone's like, yeah, we screwed up X. We're sorry.

1575
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,720
And that's why instead of just killing, yeah, instead of just killing

1576
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,520
why, like they should have, they were like, what you have done is so bad

1577
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,440
that we're going to punish you harder than just killing you.

1578
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,520
We're going to try to make you suffer every single day.

1579
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,080
And this will absolutely not bite us in the ass.

1580
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:45,240
I understand the sentiment, but I don't think it was maybe the the optimal play.

1581
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,960
Yeah, it was.

1582
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,560
And that was the thing that apparently was like kept secret

1583
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,400
because like they knew that it was illegal and they shouldn't have been.

1584
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,160
They should like it was supposed to be that highly illegal.

1585
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,000
So and that's why like when you were saying he comes back and copy X mark,

1586
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,360
too, is like, well, it wasn't an illegal exile.

1587
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,680
It wasn't illegal exile.

1588
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,640
They did it wrong.

1589
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,320
They didn't follow the correct procedures.

1590
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,120
It's fine, guys.

1591
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,960
Like I think he basically like says exactly that.

1592
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,640
He's like, yeah, I didn't follow the rules.

1593
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,520
No, they did it.

1594
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,720
They did it sneaky.

1595
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,920
None of that didn't count.

1596
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,960
Didn't didn't count.

1597
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,480
We give him another chance.

1598
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,560
Kiwi Hermans's way.

1599
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,000
Yes.

1600
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,720
Into power.

1601
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,560
Stands up in the town hall.

1602
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,160
Yes.

1603
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,800
My name is Dr.

1604
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,080
Leuve and, you know, like Mr.

1605
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,200
Mr. Burns doing that.

1606
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,040
I'm I'm Mr.

1607
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,800
Snrubb.

1608
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,240
He's just like he's got a fake mustache on his lava

1609
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,080
length, lava, lava, lava.

1610
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,600
Yeah, exactly.

1611
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,040
I think I think it was not according to protocol

1612
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,040
that Dr.

1613
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,320
Vile was exiled.

1614
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,560
So we should we should give him another chance.

1615
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,800
Exactly.

1616
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,520
It was totally and you know what?

1617
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,400
I mentioned this.

1618
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,720
I have like a meme video I did.

1619
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,600
It was like I summarized the entire Mega Man

1620
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,880
timeline in like 18 minutes.

1621
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,600
It's just me screwing around.

1622
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,400
But there's a there's a part where I mentioned

1623
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,120
I'm like the four guardians are a bunch of

1624
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,640
dumbasses for letting this happen.

1625
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,880
And I'm like, yeah, they really are.

1626
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,640
Like like I know I was joking, but they really

1627
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,840
are dumbasses for because they were they were around.

1628
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,600
They were around.

1629
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,560
They were around for watching because when

1630
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,560
Copy X was made, that's when they were made as well.

1631
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,560
So like Copy X and the four guardians were built

1632
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,160
around like the same time.

1633
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,840
I don't know which ones came first, but the point

1634
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,360
is is around the same time.

1635
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,400
So they got to watch Copy X rule like a toddler

1636
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,080
over all of human civilization.

1637
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,360
And he's just like, there's an energy crisis.

1638
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,040
Replies use energy.

1639
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,120
Replies aren't allowed to get any more energy.

1640
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,280
And instead of any of them raising their hand

1641
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,280
and being like brilliant, brilliant, sir,

1642
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,560
I think there might be a problem with that solution.

1643
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,360
They were just like, yes, of course, your highness

1644
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,040
and just let it go.

1645
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,800
And I'm like, you know, I feel like at any time

1646
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,240
they could have stepped in to solve this

1647
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,120
if they just used like their brain a little bit.

1648
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,680
Like why would you make them perfectly loyal to Copy X?

1649
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,160
They said, yes, sir.

1650
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,920
Mr. X, sir, you're saving humanity.

1651
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,800
You know, I'm so glad you bought Twitter.

1652
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:06,640
You know, you're saving the world.

1653
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,760
You know, your self-driving cars are really good.

1654
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,720
Copy X is like we're going to put people on Mars

1655
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,200
or something like that.

1656
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,400
Yeah.

1657
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,640
He's building the orbital elevator.

1658
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,320
Actually, I was going to mention,

1659
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,280
Mega Man Zero does have orbital elevators.

1660
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,760
It's not remarked upon, but they are there.

1661
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
There's lots of orbital elevators

1662
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,560
all throughout the Zero series.

1663
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,000
As a matter of fact, I think in-

1664
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,280
I know in Neo Arcadia, like in one of the endings,

1665
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,280
you climb up a big tower.

1666
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,200
Yeah, that's where you go and get.

1667
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,400
You actually go in one.

1668
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,440
No, three.

1669
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,040
In Zero One as well.

1670
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,560
I think that's area X, where you fight X.

1671
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,320
It's you actually fight him.

1672
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,960
You go through like a big elevator area.

1673
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:53,800
I have a picture of it.

1674
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,640
Hang on.

1675
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,520
I do remember climbing a big tower.

1676
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,600
I wasn't...

1677
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, you kind of do like sort of end up like in space.

1678
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,680
Yeah, you end up in space somewhere.

1679
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,400
Or at least like really, really high up

1680
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,280
and you can see the...

1681
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,040
Yeah, you know, I remember that.

1682
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,240
I remember that and they don't really even remark upon it

1683
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,080
other than that.

1684
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:14,920
They don't talk about it much.

1685
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:15,840
It's just a really high tower.

1686
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,840
But it is there.

1687
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,440
Oh, come on, where the hell is it?

1688
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,360
I got pictures of it or in here somewhere.

1689
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,640
Is it in this one?

1690
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,640
I gotta say, before we go on with any more of that,

1691
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,800
I just wanna say that I had a happy Thanksgiving

1692
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,200
and I hope everybody had a happy Thanksgiving this week.

1693
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,200
I had one, it was pretty good.

1694
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,520
How was your Thanksgiving, Twitch?

1695
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,440
It was good.

1696
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,360
I went to go see my family.

1697
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,360
Like I always do, we always go to my uncle's place.

1698
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,680
We have been going since I was a kid.

1699
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,160
Literally, I don't think there's been a single year

1700
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,920
where we haven't gone.

1701
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,760
So I've been doing that

1702
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,680
since I was like single digits old.

1703
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,280
So, it's cool.

1704
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,320
We did not do like an extended family Thanksgiving.

1705
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,520
Pretty much just hung out with my parents and my sister

1706
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,520
and my dad's like best friend from a childhood came over

1707
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,320
and then you just had dinner and it was good.

1708
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,680
We watched a movie.

1709
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,280
I think it's, we watched a movie called,

1710
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,840
I think it was called Bullet Train and I hated it.

1711
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,880
Oh, I've seen a clip from that

1712
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,680
and I wanted to watch it based on the premise alone

1713
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,440
and how silly it looked.

1714
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:39,120
It looked, I just did not appreciate Brad Pitt's

1715
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,640
twee, cutesy little quips and dialogue.

1716
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,720
They were so irritating that I just decided

1717
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,720
that I hated the movie

1718
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:51,160
and then I couldn't take any of the action seriously.

1719
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,800
I don't think it was meant to be taken seriously.

1720
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,600
It was meant to be like a big cartoon.

1721
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,800
But just annoying, just the twee Joss Whedon-esque dialogue

1722
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,760
was really irritating and I just couldn't stand it.

1723
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,120
The Whedonisms.

1724
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,480
The Whedonism, yeah, yeah.

1725
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,360
Ice quip.

1726
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,920
I'm very sorry.

1727
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,240
Thank you.

1728
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,080
Thank you very much.

1729
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:12,920
Thank you for saying that.

1730
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,880
Sorry that you had that experience

1731
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,320
on Thanksgiving, the most holy of days.

1732
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:23,320
And my dad, my dad is so impossible to watch a movie with

1733
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,720
because he will literally, he'll quip

1734
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:30,120
about whatever's on screen, like nonstop,

1735
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,240
like every like 30 seconds.

1736
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,560
Like he can't stop.

1737
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,400
He can't stop making a little quip.

1738
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,720
Even if it's just like, the bad guy comes on screen.

1739
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,960
My dad would just be like, bad guy.

1740
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,560
He'll just like say that.

1741
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,840
And then like 15 seconds later,

1742
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,520
I don't know, somebody gets shot and he'll go like,

1743
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,600
he'll go like, oh, shot or something.

1744
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,760
It's like, shut up.

1745
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,920
Shut the fuck up.

1746
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,240
Dude, great quips.

1747
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,840
Sometimes he tries to be clever with them,

1748
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,480
but sometimes they're just like completely banal,

1749
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,040
just like saying what he's seeing.

1750
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:06,880
Why?

1751
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,360
Why?

1752
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,800
I totally understand.

1753
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,640
So funny.

1754
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,080
Just why are you like this?

1755
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,280
It reminds me of, I don't remember.

1756
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,720
I think I was watching Hollow Man when that came out.

1757
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,480
It was in the movie theater.

1758
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,600
And I was but a wee babby.

1759
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,920
I don't know, I was like a kid, teenager, whatever.

1760
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,080
And I think my mom was with me

1761
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,440
because she wanted to see it too.

1762
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,040
So we're in the movie and every time anything

1763
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,800
remotely spooky or foreboding what happened,

1764
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,200
there was this one guy who in a very deep voice

1765
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,840
would just go, aw damn.

1766
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,120
Like, but like the whole theater could hear him.

1767
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,640
And it would always be like, aw damn.

1768
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,440
And like, it just kept building and building

1769
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,640
until finally something like actual,

1770
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,880
I think like there were some boobs on screen.

1771
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,840
And he was like, aw damn, like really stupid,

1772
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,920
but I kept laughing.

1773
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,200
Me when I see boobs, aw damn.

1774
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,760
It was really dumb and immature, but I laughed anyway.

1775
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:05,600
Yeah.

1776
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,760
I think it's like a relieve the tension for yourself.

1777
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,200
It's like you relieve the tension of what's going on screen

1778
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,360
by quipping about it or just saying something.

1779
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,200
Yeah, probably.

1780
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,880
I've noticed, I've noticed I used to do that

1781
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,480
when there was something like a romantic scene.

1782
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,960
And I'm like, I don't wanna feel like feelings right now.

1783
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,800
But what if they farted?

1784
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,840
What if I like make gross lip slacking noises

1785
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,520
to like undercut the emotional resonance

1786
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,560
of the scene I'm watching?

1787
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,800
Yeah, I don't do it anymore though.

1788
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,840
I try to allow things to affect me because that's better.

1789
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,640
I had a moment recently like that

1790
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:50,640
where I was watching the Wachowski Speed Racer movie,

1791
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,080
which I love, I love that movie so much.

1792
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,240
I saw that when I was younger.

1793
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,840
I saw it when it was fairly new

1794
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,480
and I remember thinking that it was great

1795
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,320
and then I heard that it was really bad.

1796
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,360
And I was like, what the fuck are people talking about?

1797
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,920
I, I, but, but culture has come around.

1798
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,760
Culture has vindicated me.

1799
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,720
I think we as a society have decided

1800
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,200
that actually it's amazing.

1801
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,600
We're now ready for Speed Racer and what it has to say.

1802
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,440
It was fun.

1803
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,280
It was way fun.

1804
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,120
I loved the movie.

1805
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:20,960
I thought it was great.

1806
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,960
The visuals were incredible.

1807
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,120
Action was well choreographed.

1808
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,440
I loved some of the neat stuff they were doing.

1809
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,000
I love the scene in the snow

1810
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,440
and they're using the snow and the movement of the camera

1811
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,640
to generate anime speed lines.

1812
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,400
I'm like, that's so clever.

1813
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,240
I liked them.

1814
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,640
There's a, I remember there's a shot where like,

1815
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,480
I think it's when Speed Racer and the girl like kiss

1816
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,320
at the end.

1817
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,640
That's what he has.

1818
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,080
You know, and like, you know,

1819
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,880
that's what I was building too.

1820
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,760
Yeah. When you unfocus the lens

1821
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,640
and the lights in the background like expand into circles.

1822
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,400
Well, they do that, but they expand into hearts.

1823
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,760
Instead, it looks like a floaty anime background.

1824
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,840
And it's just fantastic.

1825
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,560
Speaking of that scene, like you said,

1826
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,120
commenting so you can kind of like relieve

1827
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,600
the tension for yourself or you're like,

1828
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,240
oh, I don't want to feel things.

1829
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,520
I was, this is the only part of the movie

1830
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,960
that I was disappointed in.

1831
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,400
I loved Spritle in the movie.

1832
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,360
People are like, he's just like a dumb annoying kid.

1833
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,560
I'm like, yeah, but he's supposed to be

1834
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,440
like a dumb annoying kid.

1835
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,680
And he kind of sticks to himself.

1836
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,760
He doesn't really interfere with the story much.

1837
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,720
But there's one part at the very end,

1838
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:21,920
just like you were saying,

1839
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,680
where Speed wins the big race.

1840
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,080
I know, shocker spoilers.

1841
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,640
And he goes to kiss Trixie.

1842
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,400
And the scene freeze frames and Spritle comes on

1843
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,080
and along with ChimChim, just as doctors.

1844
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,160
And he's like warning, the following scene

1845
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,440
may contain gross feelings and cooties

1846
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,560
and something, something.

1847
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,080
If you have a weak constitution, please look away now.

1848
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,040
And I was like, okay, like it is kind of like a funny joke,

1849
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,000
but not at the climax of the movie.

1850
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,200
But also, yeah.

1851
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,560
Like I was waiting for this.

1852
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,920
They've been building to it.

1853
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,560
And like Spritle like kept interrupting them

1854
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,640
before they can like, you know,

1855
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,320
get romantic with one another.

1856
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,360
But like, I was into it.

1857
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,520
I was like, wow, like I feel emotionally connected

1858
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,600
to these characters and what they're going through.

1859
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,760
And finally, Speed gets like, you know,

1860
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,000
his well-deserved first place win

1861
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,240
and he's going to go kiss Trixie

1862
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,480
like he promised he would do at the beginning of the movie.

1863
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,040
And then Spritle comes in and ruins it.

1864
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,360
And I'm like, like, I,

1865
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,840
I don't, I, yeah.

1866
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,680
If you want to break the-

1867
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,760
Sounds a little annoying.

1868
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,600
Sounds a little annoying.

1869
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,080
If you want to break the tension for yourself,

1870
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,480
like you said, by like saying something

1871
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,880
or making a fart noise or whatever the heck it is,

1872
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,240
you know, fine.

1873
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,840
But it annoys me when the movie does it for you

1874
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,320
because what if I wanted to be invested in that scene?

1875
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,400
Now that I am like,

1876
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,200
because now that I'm looking at it as an adult,

1877
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,320
I'm like, I think Speed Racer is like a work of art.

1878
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,160
I think it's great.

1879
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,000
It has great messages.

1880
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,840
It's got good, like it's just,

1881
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:41,960
it's just produced really well.

1882
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,600
Like everything about it is great.

1883
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,800
So then I get to this end scene

1884
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,120
and then I'm like, I get slapped on the face for,

1885
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,920
you know, almost the perfect movie.

1886
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,760
Yeah. That is the one and only like-

1887
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,680
So close.

1888
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,640
You know, so here's what I'm going to do.

1889
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,000
I believe the music cuts as well,

1890
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,560
but it resumes where it's supposed to.

1891
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,640
I'm just going to go ahead and load up the file

1892
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,240
into like Sony Vegas or something.

1893
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,360
And I'm just going to cut out that part with Sprytal.

1894
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,680
And I'll just have it resume uninterrupted for myself.

1895
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,520
The Revo cut.

1896
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,360
Yeah.

1897
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,360
The Revo cut.

1898
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,040
If I-

1899
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,400
Isn't that the thing they do in like,

1900
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,120
like some or most like Marvel superhero movies

1901
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:27,040
where they sort of, they're embarrassed to be superheroes?

1902
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,240
Like, isn't that like a, like a,

1903
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,920
like what sort of power do you have?

1904
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:31,880
Isn't that like stupid?

1905
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,720
It was funny.

1906
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,000
Like they say that in the text.

1907
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,640
They like sort of embarrassed.

1908
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,120
It was funny like once, like the first couple of the times

1909
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,800
that it happens, like, you know-

1910
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,400
Common isn't it isn't it wacky that we have that we are wearing spandex and

1911
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah, it's like movies. Like what were you expecting yellow spandex? Oh

1912
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,680
I mean

1913
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,200
It was funny when you do it like once and I get it

1914
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,800
Yeah, and so I give the X-Men a pass that was pretty funny

1915
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,840
Like yeah, they would have matching uniforms like they're supposed to because they're like a team

1916
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,840
But then the Marvel movies started doing it and like okay, I get it like you know

1917
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:11,560
It's a funny joke, but then they do it in like every single movie like every single time a new hero gets introduced

1918
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:16,440
They have to draw attention to the fact like huh, isn't it silly that I'm wearing this funny costume

1919
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:21,400
And I have these weird patterns like dude. We're living we are now invested so insecure

1920
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:26,100
Yeah, we're now in a universe where a purple alien man with you know

1921
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:32,840
Tire marks for a chin snapped to the entire universe out of existence. I am ready to believe anything

1922
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:39,560
You don't have to like like deflect like it's cool if you're a weird dude who wears a bug costume like I'm

1923
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,800
I'm ready for it now. It's I've

1924
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:47,800
I'm cool with it. I am I am I have not seen a Marvel movie since

1925
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,680
I don't even know how long I'm I'm free. I'm pure

1926
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,520
of its

1927
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
Malif Lewis influence

1928
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,480
The last one I've watched also I can't I can't call them shit because I haven't seen them

1929
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:07,400
I can't complain. I only kept I catch that from like people saying it and also remembering

1930
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:14,120
Like certain scenes where they're just sort of like, you know comic books were from the the 1950s and those were so strange

1931
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:19,000
Huh? Hey modern audience. Don't you find that cringe? Well, enjoy it anyway, but also

1932
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,160
Don't don't feel too bad about enjoying it. It's kind of like how

1933
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,040
Using speed racer as a great example of this

1934
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,560
um

1935
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,560
speed racer is

1936
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Impinibly campy and silly

1937
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:37,800
But the movie has internal logic to it where they don't acknowledge that things are campy and silly

1938
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:43,800
Yes, that is just their world and the the characters the characters are serious about what's going on

1939
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:50,040
Yeah, and so I'm like, yeah, I'm fully invested in this. I am totally okay with watching

1940
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:56,840
A movie about a guy whose first name is speed and his last name is racer and is

1941
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:02,520
No problem brothers with someone named sprightle, which is not a name. I think I've heard

1942
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:08,920
Ever uh, and they have a pet monkey named chimchim who is also super intelligent like I'm cool

1943
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,720
You I'm already sold. You don't have to like

1944
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:19,560
You don't have to be like, haha, isn't it funny that his name is speed like no like I get it. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is

1945
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,920
That's why I'm watching the movie. Yeah to be entertained by this

1946
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:28,520
Stop drawing attention to it. Let's let's just take that and run with it. All right. We don't need to wallow

1947
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:35,560
We don't need to wallow in the premise, please. It's kind of like when people engage in like, um self-deprecating humor

1948
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:39,240
Um, but it might be funny once or twice, but once you do it

1949
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,680
Too many times it's kind of like bro. Are you okay?

1950
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,560
Like are you sure that you're not like actually insecure about yourself? Like, you know, you know what I mean?

1951
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,120
And that's how some of these movies come across

1952
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,000
So that's why I love speed racer because they just they're unabashedly

1953
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,880
Cheesy and silly and campy, but they also treat it with like seriousness and reverence

1954
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,280
um internally

1955
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,640
And I'm like, yeah, I buy into it. I for

1956
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,360
For just an hour and a half

1957
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:10,920
I believe that miracles can happen on the raceway and I am totally

1958
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:17,720
Hell yeah, and I am totally fine. I believe that love can bloom on the battlefield. Yes. Yes

1959
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:25,160
And I he makes art when he races and I am totally fine suspending my disbelief and just

1960
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,960
Enjoying that you don't have to

1961
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,840
Tell me isn't it silly like I'm not watching a realistic movie. I'm watching a marvel movie

1962
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,520
You don't have to sell me on it

1963
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:40,280
Like you stopped being super realistic after like iron man one like and iron man one was great

1964
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:44,920
But they they quickly realized that we're going to continue down this path. We are going to have to get

1965
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:50,520
Consistently more and more silly and cosmic because that's just the nature of Marvel comics and that's fine

1966
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,240
But don't draw attention to it. Just shut up. Give it to me. I'm willing to believe it

1967
01:33:56,120 --> 01:34:03,000
Just like how Godzilla was Godzilla 2014. Um, they try doing a somewhat realistic one where he fights king kong

1968
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:10,760
Well, I'm getting to that. So the first Godzilla 2014 was the one where he fights the the mutes the

1969
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:15,320
Mutated ultra something whatever organism. I don't know what the hell it stands for

1970
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:22,200
Um, and they did a somewhat serious take on Godzilla where brian cranced in his wife dies and like a mudo escape

1971
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,600
All that other crap. So like I'm fine with that. The first outing was like

1972
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:32,920
Kind of serious much like the first Godzilla movie was meant to be taken somewhat seriously

1973
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:37,800
It had it had a lot to say. Um, but then as they continue down the Godzilla rabbit hole

1974
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,280
quite literally

1975
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:46,360
They realize. Oh, yeah, these movies are going to have to go in a very silly direction because the nature of Godzilla movies

1976
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Get a little silly. Um

1977
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,000
So the tone in Godzilla 2014 versus

1978
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,400
Godzilla versus king kong is stark contrast to one another

1979
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:01,160
They and I and I'm glad because they don't really draw too much attention to it

1980
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:07,240
They just fully embrace the fact that um, there's a hollow earth that's always been there and there's portals

1981
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,480
And there's monsters everywhere and we're just not gonna internally

1982
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,240
We're just gonna accept that this is reality and we're not going to like

1983
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:23,240
Wink wink at the audience and be like, isn't it crazy that all those? No, just shut up. Let me enjoy my monster wrestling match. It's fine

1984
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,000
It's fine. I'm willing to I'm willing to accept it

1985
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:34,520
I gotta use the bathroom. I'll be back in a minute. No, you're not allowed. No, it's okay. Go ahead. Okay. All right

1986
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,400
You're right. No, I'll just if you say I wish

1987
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,360
You must answer me my riddles three

1988
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,160
All right, I'll be back in one minute

1989
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,960
So how are you given I'm glad to be here

1990
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:55,240
Yeah, it's great. I'm glad to have you you don't worry about rambling because that's

1991
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,200
That's what people crave. They crave large

1992
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:03,880
Long conversations about I get nervous because uh, I have a tendency to talk way too much

1993
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:10,200
And I I have a tendency to accidentally talk over people and I don't mean to I'm just I'm very passionate about the things

1994
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,440
We're discussing and so it's not I'm not trying to be rude. I'm just excited

1995
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:18,040
No, it's great. It's it's don't worry about it. Okay. I um

1996
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,800
I I'm good. I I I did zone out a few times where I'm like, okay

1997
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:31,640
So many of these these things being talked about are like I don't even having the faintest idea what it means

1998
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:37,640
But that's okay. I'll I'll watch the lecture. I'll definitely play legends because that looks fun

1999
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,400
Legends is a lot of fun. Um, my recommendation for legends

2000
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,920
This always helped me some people say they don't like this, but

2001
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:51,400
Everyone's like, oh the controls on legends are like tanky and crappy, but uh, if you go to the options, you can actually switch

2002
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:56,280
Um, because there's dedicated buttons for strafing and there's dedicated buttons for rotating

2003
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,680
And so I always set my rotating buttons to just left and right on the d-pad

2004
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:05,000
So that I can navigate with one hand and if I'm going to strafe I use the shoulder buttons for that

2005
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:08,760
Um by default, it's the opposite left and right actually make you

2006
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,520
um

2007
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:14,120
Actually make you strafe and then the l and r is what you use to rotate

2008
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,800
That just doesn't feel natural to me

2009
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:21,480
And I feel like using your d-pad to run and also rotate and point in the direction that you want to go in

2010
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,640
That just feels more

2011
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:28,680
Like normal to me. So that's just the only thing I would recommend. I think that's an easier control scheme

2012
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,400
That's just me. Everyone of course is welcome to do whatever

2013
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:37,080
Yeah, that's the one thing I've heard about that is that it's it's early 3d. So that there's no

2014
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:44,280
Consensus on how you do the traversal in 3d and the controls are a bit odd. It's also so early that there wasn't even

2015
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:51,000
Analog sticks. This was like an early PlayStation game. So the the dual shock controller didn't even like come out yet

2016
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,360
Pre-ape escape. Yes, exactly. So

2017
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
um, and here's the thing

2018
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Legends 2 did come out

2019
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:06,760
Uh after the dual shock. So it does have analog controls, but it they're not actually analog controls when I played

2020
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,600
um

2021
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,440
I noticed hey, wait a second

2022
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,800
I can set the right joystick to aim like a modern

2023
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:17,640
Third person and or first person shooter game. That sounds amazing

2024
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:22,280
All I need now is like a target reticle in the center of the screen. Um, but it's not

2025
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:29,480
Actually analog what it does is it takes the up down left and right inputs of your joystick and just moves the camera

2026
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,000
Like that

2027
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,240
Um, it kind of just automates having to like hold down the look button and then pressing the the d-pad buttons

2028
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,640
So it's not true analog

2029
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,000
But I think that if you took mega man legends and just gave it like a proper

2030
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,720
double joystick

2031
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,480
movement and or

2032
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,080
aiming scheme

2033
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,880
Legends would would play like a dream like it actually

2034
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,760
Once you've gotten used to the controls like I have

2035
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,320
It's it's really fun

2036
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:01,000
Like I know these like little movements to like move him in like a perfect circle

2037
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:06,520
And I know how to get him like like tight circles. Um, so I can like collect all the the refractors really easily

2038
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,640
Running and jumping and like grabbing onto a ledge feels so satisfying and then climbing up

2039
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:19,000
So I think if it just had some modern controls on it, I think legends would stand toe to toe with like modern action games

2040
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
It's just unfortunately

2041
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,720
It was kind of ahead of its time and it came out

2042
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:29,240
Before control schemes. Well, I mean, I don't even want to say it had a good controller

2043
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:33,560
Yeah, I was gonna say it's not even a control scheme. There wasn't even a good controller for it

2044
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,960
Before the dual shock set the standard for all consoles going forward

2045
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,280
I'm trying to imagine

2046
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:44,120
Because like I've played like ratchet and clank with like the strafe lock

2047
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,320
So that's like you you're always strafing

2048
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:51,000
Um, and you move you rotate the camera rather than

2049
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:58,280
Like free free walking around that's pretty much how legends works except l1 and r1 is what rotates the camera

2050
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,600
Yeah

2051
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:05,960
I'm trying to like visualize like walking around because like um if I use a dual shock with legends

2052
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:12,200
Will it recognize the analog stick as the directional buttons for legends one? It doesn't it just has no dual shock

2053
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:16,600
Input at all because it predates the dual shock

2054
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:20,040
So there's not even a way to have it recognize

2055
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,480
Your your analog stick so you have to play it with d-pad

2056
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,920
Um legends two you can enable

2057
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:33,080
The dual shock controls, but they're not analog controls and that's the issue

2058
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:41,000
So like the all it really does is let you use your analog sticks as a replacement for up down left right d-pad buttons

2059
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:46,040
That's that's literally all it does at least as far as I can tell other people have told me that's not the case

2060
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:49,000
But when I play, um, it it doesn't feel that way

2061
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,480
Um, it feels like when you press

2062
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,080
Like anything on the joystick it doesn't move

2063
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:57,880
smoothly, it's just like

2064
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:02,920
It's it's literally just cardinal directions on the on the joystick. Um, so I just play with him

2065
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,680
Welcome back. I'm back by the way, but I didn't want to interrupt. Oh, it's all good

2066
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,680
We're we're discussing how legends was ahead of its time and no one appreciates it

2067
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,920
Yeah, yeah

2068
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:19,800
The um the the tank controls are a little bit they take a little bit of getting used to but once you are used to them

2069
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,120
It's it's fine. Yeah

2070
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,760
If you do play legends one by the way, um another thing I recommend besides

2071
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,560
Um messing with both control schemes

2072
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,040
um, I also recommend

2073
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:38,280
Grinding a lot in the early game because there's a very difficult boss rush that they just throw you at

2074
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,280
Um

2075
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:43,480
Right at the start of the game. Uh, if you hear them talking about pirates

2076
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,000
Um, you've gone too far. Don't proceed back into the city. Please

2077
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:51,160
Get a lot a lot of zenny and and buy power ups

2078
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:54,200
You're talking about against the three dudes

2079
01:41:54,600 --> 01:42:00,440
Yeah, they make you fight, um the serve bots and they're the bloom bears and then you fight tron and then after tron you have to

2080
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:05,080
Fight bonbon. Um, it's like a boss rush. It's very difficult for early games

2081
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:10,040
Especially if you're not prepared for it. So save Austin. I do I do remember that

2082
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,040
I did get

2083
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,560
Yeah, that one did

2084
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:21,080
I lost a bunch of times. Yeah, it definitely, um, it definitely pushed my shit in when I first played it. Um, but I then had the

2085
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:27,320
Uh, the the foresight because I had a memory card, which is new technology to reload my save

2086
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:32,680
Go to the dungeon and just grind for zenny and here's the cool thing about legends. Um

2087
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:37,000
Legends too would change this but legends one once you can buy, um

2088
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:44,280
Your your your health increase like by like one pip same thing for your your energy canteen, which will like refills your health

2089
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,800
Um, you can just increase it forever. There's no cap

2090
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:53,000
It'll just keep letting you increase it. Um, and it doesn't block it off based on what part of the game you're in

2091
01:42:53,480 --> 01:43:00,040
Um, so if you have the money, you can technically get yourself to like 200 health and the game won't stop you

2092
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:06,040
You gotta you. Yeah, I think I forgot to use my energy canteen. I like forgot that I had it

2093
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:11,240
But like, yeah, you got to be using the energy canteen. You you can't be sleeping on it canteen saves you

2094
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:16,840
Yeah, gatorade. It's I'm just I'm the kind of gamer that I'm just get really focused on what I'm doing

2095
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:20,840
And I forget to like use the I use the items in my inventory for what's there

2096
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:25,640
So I have definitely done that a few times where I was like, ah crap. I forgot I could heal

2097
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:29,160
You know what I used to do as a kid when I when I was fighting Tronbon

2098
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:34,840
Uh, because she would kick my ass so hard. I'd run away from her and then go buy a soda out of the machine

2099
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,520
In the middle of a battle in the middle of the battle

2100
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,720
You could do that lol

2101
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:45,400
You can you can literally go buy so you you're mashing through that because she's still shooting at you while the dialogue is happening

2102
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,840
So I've had I've had times where it's like

2103
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,680
It's a vending machine. It costs 100s any to get a soda

2104
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:58,040
Do you want and then like all of a sudden a bomb just blows up the vending machine and like go flying and I'm like dammit

2105
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,680
So I quickly run to where the next one is, you know

2106
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,960
That is awesome. It's it's hilarious

2107
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:09,880
Uh, I also found out you can just uh, you can kick the vending machines and it'll just give you a soda instantly

2108
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,120
So I started doing that during the battle because it was quicker

2109
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:17,800
But I also found that if you kick it too many times the vending machine explodes and then you can't use it anymore

2110
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:24,360
But if you buy a soda from it, I think you can get like three refills out of it and then it runs out

2111
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,520
Yeah, so uh, those are just I didn't know you could blow up the vending machines by kicking them. That's so

2112
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:34,040
Yeah, there's so there's a morality system in legends actually

2113
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:38,680
I I know I know about that because I didn't know about it at all in legends one

2114
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,560
But I had to use it in legends two in order to get

2115
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:46,120
Yeah, yeah, that were the last weapon which I didn't even use by the way

2116
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:52,520
Yeah, it's it's a whatever weapon. It's not even worth it for it's such a cool secret that like oh, you have to be evil mega man to get it

2117
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,040
um

2118
01:44:54,040 --> 01:45:00,520
But it's not even worth I mean it depends on the gameplay you're going through because apparently it gets stronger based on how evil you are

2119
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,400
Uh, oh like frustration

2120
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,920
Yes

2121
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,920
so

2122
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,520
um

2123
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,360
I'm looking at um

2124
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:13,400
Like mega man's mega man legends on pc

2125
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:20,040
Is that is that like a which which is the best way to play so the game?

2126
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:25,880
Uh, I I officially I do not endorse piracy, but in my opinion the best way to play legends

2127
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,920
No, uh, is to emulate it and uh increase the resolution and turn on a widescreen hack

2128
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:38,680
Um, I've played it like that. I play legends and legends too at like two to four times resolution and the game looks beautiful

2129
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:43,080
Um, it's really really nice. I mean I found like an

2130
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:47,800
Abandoned where like like an actual like released pc version of it

2131
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:52,120
Just on this abandonware site. I don't think was it actually released in pc?

2132
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:58,040
I thought it was just uh, it was on playstation and then they released it on the n64 as mega man 64

2133
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:02,920
You might be downloading a rom of it, but it definitely was never released for pc

2134
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,080
But um, can you send me that link because now i'm curious what the heck you stumbled upon

2135
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:11,240
I am yeah, I just I just typed it in hang on. I did I did emulate it

2136
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:14,040
Uh, I didn't this on a widescreen

2137
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:18,520
Resolution adjustments pretty cool united states. What?

2138
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:23,240
Is this real? I've never heard of this. I'm gonna have to look into this

2139
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:29,480
Is it uh, is it meg? Is it rock man dash a great adventure to save the world? Uh by strawberry soft

2140
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:36,920
Because that is a taiwanese game that was on pc, but not regular mega man legends. I think they might just be calling at this

2141
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:42,680
I'm so confused. What it looks like we find mega man legends

2142
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:51,240
I don't i'm not familiar with this website wait the reception i'm looking at the wiki pd. Yeah, it says it was released in taiwan

2143
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:59,080
So it's uh in the reception but the pc and nintendo 64 version had lower averages. So there was a pc version

2144
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:02,120
What?

2145
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,120
I guess I didn't know there was a pc version

2146
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:10,840
Huh pc version received a more negative review game spot gave it a bad three eight point six out of ten damn

2147
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,880
Saying the playstation port is better

2148
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,320
I've never heard of this

2149
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:21,960
Uh wacky I um I did I did emulate it the only

2150
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:27,720
The only time I like used any like emulator uh things to like do anything to it

2151
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:32,200
Is just when I wanted to grind for zenny against the golden bird into

2152
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,160
That

2153
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:41,880
The uh mirak, I believe it's called. Yeah, I I don't know its name, but yeah, um, they're like pokemon

2154
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,560
I know some of them not all of them. That's um, that's uh, you know

2155
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:52,040
Even with even with like I played it at like 10 times speed or whatever and I just developed muscle memory to like

2156
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,960
Go in the door

2157
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,400
Uh go in the door

2158
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,840
Shoot the bullet shoot the bullets

2159
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:00,600
I remember exactly how long to hold the button down and then use the vacuum go out the door

2160
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:06,040
Turn around go back in the door and I just had a perfect like a perfect formula for just the order and the and the rate at

2161
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:10,600
Which is the buttons and it still took it still took like a long time even at like

2162
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:13,960
Sped up. Yeah, it's really really they give you

2163
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:18,840
I'm glad they even include a way of getting like a ton as any that way. That's nice of them

2164
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:24,120
It is nice, but it's good for the early game. It's still inconvenient. Like it's not it's not that

2165
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:27,960
I mean without without without that bird like I just probably just wouldn't

2166
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,840
I don't even remember what I was saving up for

2167
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:37,480
Probably the shining laser because the shining laser costs like several millions any to upgrade completely. Yeah, I think it probably

2168
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,000
I know

2169
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,400
I know it's a crazy expensive item to upgrade to begin with and then the final attack upgrade

2170
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,960
Costs you a millions any flat just because

2171
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,240
I I don't think I upgraded it. I just I just got it

2172
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:55,080
I mean at that point if you're emulating, I mean I did this on on my I mean, I'm playing through legends too right now

2173
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,080
I actually I'm near the end of the game

2174
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:01,720
I'm showing my girlfriend the game. So I'm like she loves it. She's fallen in love with Tron Bonn. She thinks she's great

2175
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,240
Tron Bonn is great. She is fantastic. Tron Bonn is so cool

2176
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:11,720
She's she's amazing too. She's like just a good-ass character. She's got some nuance to her. She kills cops

2177
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:17,960
She blows up kills children children's in fairness. She becomes friends with the cop and misinventions of Tron Bonn

2178
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:22,440
So that kind of makes up for it. That's what I dislike about it. That's the one black mark on her character

2179
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,680
Really? Yeah

2180
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:28,280
She's she's working. She can't she can't stoop to

2181
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,560
No, I like she should be full full anarchy

2182
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:40,280
Well in fairness it's not like she doesn't plunder and destroy the island she goes to it's just she just kind of helps this one cop

2183
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:46,040
Who's like like, oh no, everyone's I'm gonna get fired and she's like well, she's like authority of bone

2184
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,600
I know I know

2185
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:55,320
But for emulating, uh, I just turned on the the infinite zenny cheat and then turned it off because it instantly jumps your zenny to like

2186
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,320
999999

2187
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:01,560
And so I've just been coasting off of that for you know, fair. You know what? I don't want to grind

2188
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,680
I want it. I wanted to do it like

2189
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:10,040
Sword I get I mean I kind of cheated but I sort of did it. I sort of did the grind

2190
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:13,720
I've already put in my time. Okay when I was a kid

2191
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:18,440
If I was doing it again, and I had an option to just like can I please just fast forward through

2192
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:23,560
Spending an hour and a half grinding like yeah, I've done it. It's fine. I've done it already

2193
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:27,960
So like I don't have any qualms about cheating to get through that. That's the only thing I cheated at though

2194
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,000
Everything else. I'm playing legit

2195
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,040
I just don't want to have to sit there and get like billions of zenny for no reason

2196
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:37,080
Although, you know when when you're in the mood for it, there's something to be said for just okay

2197
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:42,120
I gotta grind zenny for an hour, you know, whatever just put on a youtube video. Just just do it

2198
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,920
I believe it was it was designed to help to incentivize you to explore

2199
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:50,600
Because it's like well, you need a bunch of zenny. So what are you gonna do?

2200
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:54,520
So the idea is that you were supposed to go and explore because I did this in legends one

2201
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:58,360
I would explore every single look and cranny that I could possibly get to

2202
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,640
Um, and then by the time I was done, I've explored

2203
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:07,240
Whatever was available to me and then I come back and I'm like, oh, I have like I'm like several thousands any richer

2204
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,560
And I've explored and found more items

2205
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,800
Um, yeah, you know, you know

2206
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:17,000
Without a without a guide like because I did I didn't like refer to a guide extensively

2207
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,960
But when I was missing something I would look I would look up like where to find a certain item or something like that

2208
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:27,480
With without that. Yeah, all I would have been able to do is like go back through every dungeon and explore everywhere

2209
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:33,720
And if I was doing that like back in the day, then like, yeah, I probably just would have accrued it would have taken me

2210
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,520
months to beat the game

2211
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:41,800
But I would have accrued all kinds of zenny just from the exploration and stuff. So yeah

2212
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:48,440
Legends is an interesting balance because you can play it like a traditional mega man game and beat it in like an hour

2213
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:54,280
If you really wanted, um, or yeah, if you if you want to treat it more like an adventure rpg

2214
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:00,120
You can actually spend like days playing this game and getting lost in it. It's all off. Oh, yeah have to do it, you know

2215
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:05,720
I I honestly felt a little bit bad after I looked up some stuff about legends one because

2216
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:11,240
When I went I think I was looking for maybe like the bone or like I had missed the bone or something. Oh, yeah

2217
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:15,480
It's like in a hole somewhere. Yeah, it's just like there's stuff just like in holes in walls

2218
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:19,720
And like when I looked it up and I went and I found it I was like, you know, that wasn't that hard

2219
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,560
If you know, I I could have just if I just made a cursory sweep of like

2220
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:27,480
The dungeons I've been to I were like, I could have find this myself like damn

2221
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,480
Yeah

2222
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:34,520
It does kind of feel I cheated not only my I cheated not only the game but also myself. I learned nothing

2223
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:36,520
Um, well, you know what?

2224
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:40,920
If you just give it a give it a year and then come back to the game and you'll have forgotten all about it, so

2225
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:43,400
Yeah, probably

2226
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:48,120
Legends 2 helps mitigate some of the grinding to you. I've noticed where um, there are certain dungeons

2227
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:51,240
They're optional dungeons. You need to get like the the dickers license for it

2228
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,080
um

2229
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:56,120
Which where the the price at the end is like a giant refractor

2230
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:59,720
Uh, and I looked at it. I'm like, oh cool. Like I remember legends one

2231
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,720
We needed these to repair various machines

2232
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:05,480
But in this one, they literally say you could probably sell it for a bunch of money

2233
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,120
Yeah, so I'm like, oh, that's cool

2234
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:12,760
Uh, which is ironic because in legends one this always bug me in legends one

2235
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:18,280
You start the game with a large blue refractor because of the opening cutscene where he steals it out of the chamber

2236
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,040
um

2237
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:25,240
Right and uh, and you have it for the rest of the game and I'm like, but you don't you don't it's not useful

2238
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:28,200
It's not useful and theoretically you could sell it. Yeah

2239
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:34,120
I remember specifically reading in the manual and even in uh, I think a game pro magazine that reviewed the game

2240
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:39,800
They were like you can go to the bank and you can trade in your refractors for for zenny and I'm like, oh really?

2241
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:45,160
So that's what the blue thing is for uh, but no, it absolutely you cannot it's just there for the rest of the game

2242
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:50,920
Sad sad. So I guess you just have to pretend like in universe. That's what people do. So I'm like, yeah

2243
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:55,160
Aren't zenny aren't zenny just little refractors like isn't that what they are?

2244
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,640
so

2245
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,960
Yes, and no, I don't think

2246
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,680
Legends has reverted back to like

2247
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,000
For lack of a better term the gold standard and everyone's keeping around like little bullion in like a sack somewhere

2248
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:14,600
I think the idea is that um, you can trade in refractors for money

2249
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:18,120
Because everyone is so dependent upon them as a power source

2250
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:22,280
So the idea is like different refractors of different sizes and purities

2251
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:25,640
Can be traded in at a bank who appraise the the

2252
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:29,640
The refractor that you have and then they give you money in exchange

2253
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,840
So I think they still run off of like a paper and coin money system

2254
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,920
So so it's like it's as good as money

2255
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,040
But it's like the the refractors that you find are as good as money

2256
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:41,240
But they're not literally the money the zenny that you're right

2257
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,800
For instance, I believe there's a side mission in legends one where

2258
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,680
The the serve bots steal a bunch of money from a bank and you're supposed to catch them

2259
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,120
And it's a it's a briefcase full of dollar bills not

2260
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,400
Like refractors. It's not like a super heavy

2261
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:03,560
Jangly box of refractors. It's it's money. I do I do remember that I do remember that

2262
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:09,400
There's actually content in legends that I've never seen because I'm such a pansy and I can't bring myself to

2263
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,600
To do it if you let them steal the money like there's three options

2264
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:16,600
There's you can either catch them and return the money catch them and keep the money

2265
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,720
Which instantly turns you full evil mega man

2266
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,240
Or you can let them get away and if they get away

2267
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,400
They buy a plot of land in downtown and build a burger restaurant

2268
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:29,160
I

2269
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:32,760
I've never seen this content for myself because I never let them get away, but

2270
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:37,000
That only happens if they get away because like I think I I didn't let them get away

2271
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,240
But I remember that they have a restaurant

2272
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:45,960
In downtown later. Don't you like you have to well, that's why they were stealing the money to fund the restaurant

2273
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:49,880
Maybe I'm thinking of a different thing. There is I did not let them get away

2274
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:53,880
But there is a restaurant in the town later that where the servebots are behind

2275
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:55,640
the

2276
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,640
Counter, maybe there's like a different

2277
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:01,640
I don't know if there's another way to trigger it. I don't know how to get that to to work

2278
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,360
But I've only ever

2279
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:06,280
I've only ever

2280
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,600
Because like they're stealing the money to fund the restaurant

2281
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,120
So one would assume logically that if the you let them get away with it

2282
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:18,680
Then they um, they build it. I guess you could also just not trigger that cut scene and maybe they like still build it

2283
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:21,880
Anyway, I don't know. I I I definitely did the the thing

2284
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,680
And I I I'm

2285
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:28,520
Swear there's got to be some other way to do it because I went to that restaurant. It's possible

2286
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:32,040
I I don't know what it is though because I have never seen it myself

2287
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:37,240
The only way that I have seen it is I saw someone who had like a like model rips of like the whole thing

2288
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:42,440
And I was able to like see the restaurant like in a 3d viewer. I was like, oh cool. I've never seen this before

2289
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,080
base base base

2290
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,080
cool, um, I love the servebots

2291
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,720
Yeah, I don't know why everyone lets them get away with everything though like, um

2292
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:55,880
They're like they're clearly the pirates that are attacking the city

2293
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:01,880
And yet they just go around and do things and everyone's like a small yellow child came by later came by lately

2294
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:06,520
And he said something funny, but I'm like those are the pirates. Why are you guys okay with it?

2295
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,920
Why isn't the whole town collectively running up to them and kicking them?

2296
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:16,040
Because they're so cute. They're so cute and sweet and nice and friendly and who's you know

2297
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:21,640
That's their defense mechanism. They're just and they're just a little guy. They're just a little guy. He's just a little guy

2298
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:25,480
Who can hate a thing like that?

2299
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:29,640
I don't think I didn't oh give I wanted to ask

2300
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:34,440
Have you played any more inscription or have you put that down for the for the moment?

2301
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
I put it down for the time being

2302
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:42,280
I know everyone's everyone says like oh you're just you're just

2303
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:47,160
You're you're you haven't seen the big reveal

2304
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:53,560
Where something happens and you you'll go. Oh my god. I can't possibly tell this to anyone

2305
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:57,720
I mean, I know that you know that you have not seen the full game, but

2306
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:02,120
Yes, um, okay. Just just curious because we didn't talk about it last week

2307
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:04,760
Uh, twitch. Are you familiar with inscription?

2308
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,760
I am not

2309
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:08,760
it's a uh in short

2310
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:11,160
it's kind of a

2311
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,320
horror themed

2312
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:19,080
card based deck building games. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. I think is this one with like the don't spoil it

2313
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:25,400
Don't no no no spoiling. Okay. This is just like the first thing. Isn't there like a weird like swamp man or something?

2314
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:28,360
Yeah, the guy with the eyes the crazy eyes

2315
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:34,760
Yeah, you're in his like swamp cabin or something or yeah, and like you you look around his cabin

2316
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:40,520
You're looking for clues for like, okay. Yes. Yes. I have seen a playthrough of that. I am familiar with it. It's okay. Okay

2317
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:44,360
Uh, yeah, I I got uh, I made gib play it

2318
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:48,600
That it does seem like a really cool game. I like it a lot. Uh

2319
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:52,120
Yeah, that's pretty good

2320
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,400
But I can't talk about it because

2321
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,320
Gib has

2322
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:01,880
Failed because fails me suck. I suck at the game. No, you don't

2323
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:04,440
No, you don't

2324
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:09,800
There's the only way to fail is not to play and I'm supposed to lose you're supposed to lose a lot of times

2325
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:14,360
It's fine. Yeah, but that just makes me upset. I hate losing lots of times

2326
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,480
Just think every time you lose just think great great

2327
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:24,600
Great just think it's great great people have walked this path great great people have failed at this same game

2328
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:27,720
So many times and I follow in their footsteps now

2329
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:30,280
Now it's my turn steps to my grave

2330
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,640
Now it's my turn exactly. I'm just I'm just joining a line of losers over here

2331
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:37,320
She was in a bunch damn

2332
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:41,240
Damn can't can't believe all these gamers have like lost this game so many times

2333
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:44,600
Like I'm a much better gamer than them because I just quit. I didn't lose

2334
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,200
Yeah, you knew you knew how to leave a losing battle. You're like, you know what? I'm not going to lose again

2335
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,200
I'm going to choose to leave

2336
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:56,680
It's valid. I'm going to go like chop down a hundred million trees and runescape. You know what?

2337
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:02,600
There's a quote. I don't know if it's by bruce lee or if it's just people attributing it to bruce lee because people love

2338
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:08,520
Making up quotes on the internet. Uh, what is it? Do you not fear failure for there is glory even in great attempts?

2339
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,880
I think yeah, it's probably heard that

2340
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:16,120
I don't know if that's from him, but I know that's a good quote and I like that one. I don't care who it's from

2341
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:22,040
That's me. I don't fear failure. I just don't like me my my face my face when

2342
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:27,640
My face when I'm basking in the glory of my great attempts because I beat a video game. I'm

2343
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:31,880
I'm just resplendent. I'll I'll get around to it

2344
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,960
resplendent in my

2345
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:36,280
It's a good word splendor. Yes. Thank you

2346
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,240
Oh shit, I'm trying my my dad used a really good 70 cent word over

2347
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:48,440
Over Thanksgiving. I'm trying to remember. What was it? You know, I've heard so many people say

2348
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:53,880
Like for 50 cent word, I I've heard that phrase used but everyone has a different

2349
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:58,920
Denomination of money every time someone says it. I've heard that's a good that's a good five dollar word

2350
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:04,200
It's a good one dollar for me. For me. It's 50 cents. I would not pay more than 50 cents for a word no matter how good

2351
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:09,960
I just I'm just saying I've always a dollar. Yeah, everyone's got a different night. You know what inflation I guess that can

2352
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:17,160
Probably throw it off. Were we saying gibb? Yeah in in joe biden's america a 50 cent word now costs a dollar

2353
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:22,120
Thanks, obama. Well, we thanks obama. Were you saying gibb?

2354
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:28,840
Um, I had a question. I know this is not actually related to the megaman laur at all

2355
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,960
But what the heck is mighty number nine?

2356
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:38,040
Oh, what happened? Oh, you got the right person on for this. I haven't played it. So I mean, I know

2357
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,360
All I know is that there's a kickstarter

2358
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,560
Yeah, there was a kickstarter to make like a megaman thing from a megaman person

2359
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:53,000
And it sucked so wait. Well, okay. So hold on. You got the right person on for this because I am somewhat of a mighty number nine expert

2360
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:55,560
um, hell, yeah, so

2361
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:59,720
Uh, keiji in a fune was like the guy who he was the megaman guy

2362
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:04,280
Uh for 25 years. He was he was known as the megaman guy

2363
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:08,520
He was known as the megaman guy, but I would dare say he is the megaman guy because

2364
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,080
Yeah, he was a key to mura who made megaman

2365
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:13,960
Like he basically was like the guy who made it with in a fune

2366
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,440
Basically like as his partner like the site like the the next in command so to speak

2367
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:24,600
Uh, and the two of them worked on megaman one, but it megaman was uh, key to mura's baby. Basically, it's he made it

2368
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,600
Um, but he dipped at like megaman three and then in a fune took over

2369
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:33,240
So I would say for the majority of the franchise in a fune was the one

2370
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:38,120
You know, he's not megaman. He's not megaman stepdad. He's the dad who stepped up

2371
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:39,960
um

2372
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,680
You know what I mean quite clearly he was basically

2373
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:47,480
He might not have been like the guy who like came up with the design initially

2374
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:50,760
But he was sort of in charge of the series for like a long time

2375
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:54,280
Yeah, and he helped shape like the direction of along with his team

2376
02:02:54,280 --> 02:03:00,360
He always mentions like everyone always calls him the father of megaman and he himself in every interview where someone's like

2377
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:06,280
You know, mr. Unifune people say that you're the father of megaman and he always the first thing he does is he corrects them and he's like

2378
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:10,840
People call me that. I didn't make megaman. I just kind of took over for it

2379
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:16,040
Megaman is a team effort. It was created by myself or it was created by akira kidamora and myself

2380
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:22,680
But megaman is a team effort. It's made by all the people who work on it because yeah, there's actually a surprising amount of flexibility

2381
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,720
I found in the megaman franchise or who gets how much

2382
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,920
Say and like what happens in like the series

2383
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:32,920
So it's it's really interesting. I like that. It's always kind of been a team effort

2384
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,920
But he is like the figurehead of megaman

2385
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:39,080
Yeah, so I won't go into every single excruciating detail, but

2386
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,800
around this time i'm gonna say

2387
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,360
2010

2388
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,360
I actually met him at

2389
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,240
Wow, uh, new york comic con

2390
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,320
Uh, does he like speak english?

2391
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:58,120
Very basic english. He had a he had a translator there. So okay, but he was really nice

2392
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:03,800
He was basically revealing the megaman legends three dev room project

2393
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:07,640
Which was basically saying we're going to create a forum. You can go here

2394
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:11,960
We're going to have contests and things you can submit ideas and if the ideas win the contest

2395
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:14,440
We'll put them in the game. It was really great

2396
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:17,560
Um, but then he was like i'm going to be doing autograph signings at two o'clock

2397
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,600
So I I like dipped because I was like, okay. I want to stay here for this

2398
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:25,320
But I know that this panel that i'm in right now is being recorded. I can get all this information later

2399
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:29,960
I'm going to run over to the autograph thing and i'm glad I did because I just barely got online

2400
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:35,800
So I met the guy he signed my copy of megaman x1. Um, I got to tell him I was like listen

2401
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:38,360
You inspired me since I was a kid

2402
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:44,200
I want to make video games the same way that you do your creations and your ideas and the megaman franchise means so much to me

2403
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:46,440
And he seemed like really like touched by that

2404
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,920
So I have a picture of myself with him. I actually made a megaman x t-shirt like it's a blue t-shirt

2405
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:56,600
But it has like x's like chest plate on it. Uh, and I made myself a blue

2406
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:01,720
Baseball cap that had like x's like helmet stuff on it. Oh, yeah

2407
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:07,160
He he thought it was cool. I thought it was cool. If I still had it. I'd wear it. Um, that's another story

2408
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:11,560
But anyway, he was a very nice guy. Um, he I think he really does

2409
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,520
Despite his reputation now

2410
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:19,400
I think he really does care about his fans and I think he really does care about making video games

2411
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:23,320
I just think that he's become very misguided in recent years. But anyway

2412
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:25,560
He announced

2413
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:31,480
Megaman legends 3 he announced megaman universe, which was basically mario maker but for megaman in so many terms

2414
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:37,720
And I got to play a demo of it. It was not half bad. It played like a megaman powered up in in the way that it felt

2415
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,400
um

2416
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,800
It wasn't half bad, uh, and then

2417
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:47,400
Around this time capcom was like, hey, I know everyone's really excited for this whole legends 3 thing

2418
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:52,040
Um, but we never said that we were gonna make this game and he's like, huh

2419
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:56,680
Uh, and so it turns out they never actually officially greenlit the game

2420
02:05:57,240 --> 02:06:01,320
So everyone was like, what the hell you made this dev room? There's all these materials made for it

2421
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:05,960
There's like clearly like a demo being developed. Um, and the demo for the game

2422
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:12,120
Uh, was going to be its own little contained story and just kind of like kind of like what they did with two because in

2423
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:15,160
They had the japanese only um, like demo game

2424
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:20,360
It never got ported to america for some reason. We never got to play roles critical moment

2425
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:26,040
I yeah where she gets tied up and she's in a crate and you can choose to join tronbon in that mission

2426
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:30,760
It's really funny. It sounds it sounds awesome. Yeah, but yeah, so it was going to be its own story

2427
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:33,480
But like literally its own prologue story

2428
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:38,200
Um, we're like if you play legends 3 and you didn't play the demo you're going to be like, huh?

2429
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:41,080
Like it's just legends 3 was just going to pick up as its own thing

2430
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:43,640
And the prologue was going to cover

2431
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:47,560
Um the build up to them launching the rocket and getting him off the moon

2432
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:51,640
So that was just confirmed. Um, there's other story details, which um

2433
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:56,280
I cannot talk about on the podcast because I've been sworn to secrecy about it

2434
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,680
And I might actually get someone in trouble if I do wait really

2435
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:01,400
Yes, I wow

2436
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:05,560
I know some things of it. Well now you well now you got to tell well now you got to tell. I'm sorry

2437
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:08,280
You got to tell us that you got to tell us. You got to tell us. You got to spill the beans

2438
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,200
You got to spill the beans

2439
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:16,360
All listen, I don't want to have to deal with the bean spillage, but uh, that's gonna be I will tell you one thing. All right. Um,

2440
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:19,320
There was a fan theory based on

2441
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:22,280
The character barrel and Barrett

2442
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:27,080
That people guessed pretty much right away and I'm just going to say that that fan theory

2443
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,800
Was on to something and I will say nothing else

2444
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:33,640
So that's that's as much as I can say because I don't want to get someone in trouble

2445
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:35,560
Is who's Barrett?

2446
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,280
He's the red haired guy that you were going to play as in the demo

2447
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,160
Oh, he was from the next game. He was from three

2448
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:44,680
He was from three where he can like run up the walls and he has like the cool boots

2449
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:49,720
And he does like awesome flying kicks and stuff. He was really awesome. He rides the really sick nasty motorcycle

2450
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:52,840
It's it's cool. Is he on the is he like on the cover art or like the

2451
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:57,720
Yeah, he's there was lots of art of him. Actually. It's really a shame that he didn't you know, yeah

2452
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:59,800
Well, I didn't yeah

2453
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:03,800
But anyway, I'm this is besides the point of how we're supposed to be on mighty number nine

2454
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:09,640
I'm just saying that um legends had a lot of love in it. Keiji Inafune is not a horrible person

2455
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:14,360
Like everyone makes him out to be he really really he did a lot of damage to his reputation with the whole mighty number

2456
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:17,560
He did and so what happened was is capcom was like

2457
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:19,080
um

2458
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:24,120
He this is how this all went down and this is where things start to fall apart for Inafune and everything else

2459
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,520
um

2460
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,640
Capcom was like we never said we were going to make legends

2461
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:33,720
Three we never said we were actually going to do that. You just kind of got that in your head

2462
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:37,800
Um, but we we never agreed to it. We never actually said we were going to do that

2463
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:39,240
um

2464
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:43,240
So he's like, okay. Well, I would like to form my own studio

2465
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:48,040
Within capcom because he's like I'm at the top like Inafune. I am telling you was like literally

2466
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,240
The top executive at capcom. You could not go any higher

2467
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:54,920
It was him and a bunch of other people who managed the company

2468
02:08:55,080 --> 02:09:00,280
But they're like not game developers like he was like where he worked his way up from like, you know, just an artist

2469
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:01,480
um

2470
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:06,840
So he's like I want to make my own game studio. Uh, I want to get back to making games

2471
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:10,760
He's like I'll take a pay cut. I'll demote myself whatever it is. I just want to make games again

2472
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:16,440
I don't want to be at the top here. I can't do anything anymore. Yeah, and capcom basically said no way

2473
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:20,360
We're not giving you your own studio. You're going to stay right where you are and you're going to like it

2474
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:23,800
So he said well in that case I'm going to finish up

2475
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:28,680
All of my currently open projects and I'm going to resign from capcom

2476
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:32,760
He's like I want to finish the projects that I'm on, you know, I don't want to like leave them

2477
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:38,120
You know, he thought he was doing something nice by saying that by saying like well, I started all these projects

2478
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:43,240
I don't want to like just drop them. That would be stupid. Yeah capcom said and I quote

2479
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:47,240
That will not be necessary and then fired him and wow

2480
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:51,880
He was kicked out of capcom people say that he resigned and like yeah, that's true

2481
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,160
He was intending to resign

2482
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:55,880
But what really happened is when he had this conversation with capcom

2483
02:09:56,360 --> 02:10:01,400
And they denied him the studio to develop game like kind of like how the clover studios was like

2484
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:06,520
A studio that even though they were their own devs, they like worked under capcom

2485
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:12,760
Clover is the one that made a okami, right? Okami beautiful show godhand and then they eventually went on to go

2486
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:16,600
Become platinum games and stuff. Yeah, platinum. Yeah, right

2487
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:18,200
So he kind of wanted the same deal

2488
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:23,480
He wanted his own studio within capcom to make games the way that they did because he wants to get back in like the

2489
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:29,720
You know creative aspect of it, but they basically said no way and he said okay. Well once I finish all of these games

2490
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:30,840
I'm going to

2491
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:35,480
Respectfully resign because I want to make my own game studio where I can develop games how I want

2492
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:38,280
And capcom basically even the boot and they said no

2493
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,520
so

2494
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:44,680
Around this time is what mega man fans. I don't think we have a term for it

2495
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:51,320
But this was like the great cancellation of 2011. Yeah, we're basically legends three got canceled mega man universe got canceled

2496
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:52,520
um

2497
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:59,240
And then we've later come to find out that a whole bunch of other on like unannounced mega man games got canceled like star force

2498
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:00,280
four

2499
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:03,480
And that maverick hunter first person shooter game got canceled

2500
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:09,880
It was just they were just cancelling mega man games left right and center. It was really bad. Um, so then a little bit after that

2501
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:10,920
uh

2502
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,920
Inafuna founds his own company

2503
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,840
that maverick hunter game

2504
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,360
I that looks so ridiculous. It's like I actually

2505
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:22,920
It on the one hand it sort of is it leaves a bad taste in my mouth like why would they do that?

2506
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:26,600
But on the other hand, it's just so absurd that like I kind of would have like

2507
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:28,680
Yeah, I what would it what would that have been like?

2508
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:30,120
And you know what?

2509
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:33,320
People again always give unifunny lots of crap for this because they're like, oh, he's a hack

2510
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:36,360
He doesn't know what he's doing and I'm like, no, he's actually kind of ahead of his time

2511
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:41,960
He wanted to do mega man universe and there there is a story by um, it's an article by protodude

2512
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:45,400
uh, brian on twitter who um

2513
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:50,120
He basically, you know spilled the beans about the development of mega man universe and yeah

2514
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:51,880
Inafuna really kind of mishandled it

2515
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:54,440
But he had a great idea that he just didn't know

2516
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:57,720
How to like manage it and so the project fell apart

2517
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:03,320
But it was basically mega man maker like like mario maker before that so the idea

2518
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:09,800
Was brilliant. It's it's not it's not a it's not a terrible idea. Just yeah, and then on top of that

2519
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:15,640
Mega man x maverick hunter whatever the hell it was going to be called first person thing

2520
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:21,000
Yeah, um, if you look at it, it actually plays very similar to doom 2016

2521
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:24,680
Where you run around in the first person mode you're shooting enemies

2522
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,200
And then you do what is effectively a glory kill on them and use take their weapon and ammo

2523
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:34,360
Which is exactly how the mechanic works in doom 2016

2524
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:39,160
So i'm not saying that like they copied them or anything, but i'm saying like the idea was there

2525
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:44,520
And it i'm sure if we got to play it it probably would have felt pretty decent to play

2526
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:49,480
It's unfortunately i'm not a chance. I would i would have given i would have given it a fair shake

2527
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:53,640
I really would have yeah, i was against it at first because i'm like this looks stupid

2528
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:56,440
But then i was like well it does look pretty stupid though

2529
02:12:56,760 --> 02:13:00,360
But but i was also kind of open to new ideas at the time where i'm like, you know

2530
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:03,960
It's a it's just a new interpretation of mega man like i used to be against battle network

2531
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:08,840
But that grew on me and became one of my favorite series. Um, but anyway again i'm sidetracking here

2532
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:12,360
So i mean that's how i felt it's how i felt about legends too like before i played

2533
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,880
Exactly i think everyone should just be open-minded to give everything a fair shake. Yeah, so

2534
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:24,680
Uh, he forms concept after he gets let go from capcom capcom cancels everything he he even admits

2535
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:27,800
He goes it's my he i think in one thing he said

2536
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:32,680
um, it is my biggest regret that i left capcom when i did because

2537
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:41,400
I feel bad for the fans that were expecting these games that will never forget them and he said something kind of charming once he said

2538
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,240
um

2539
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:46,040
He's someone asked him something like if you had all the dragon balls

2540
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:49,560
What would your one wish be and he said his one wish would be to release legends 3

2541
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:51,960
Oh god

2542
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:54,040
And i'm like man

2543
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:58,120
Geez because he was he have to understand he was like asked about it for years

2544
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:02,040
When is legends 3 coming when it's legends 3 coming people on his team were just

2545
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:08,600
Taking their time to make demos for like a potential legends 3 proof of concept and he's like it's not in my hands

2546
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:11,320
I can't do anything about it guys like i can't green light the game

2547
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:14,840
So when legends 3 and universe and all that other stuff happened

2548
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:20,760
He basically was kind of throwing around his executive weight because he was at a point now where he could do that

2549
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:23,240
as a matter of fact this

2550
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:27,080
Inafune was kind of infamous for this within capcom internally

2551
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,560
where he would

2552
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,760
basically

2553
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:34,760
Greenlight a game and dump a ton of budget into it so that capcom couldn't cancel it

2554
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:41,000
Because it would basically it would be like, you know, so like we spent too much on it already

2555
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:46,200
We can't lose that investment. I think so for instance dead rising, right?

2556
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:51,320
He goes he goes to capcom execs and he's like hey listen guys. I want to make a zombie game

2557
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:53,320
I'm paraphrasing but this is more or less what you said

2558
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:59,240
I want to make a zombie game and they said we already have resident evil and he goes no no no not like horror

2559
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:02,040
survival uh game i want to make

2560
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:04,680
Uh a different kind of zombie game

2561
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:07,240
Uh one where and he basically describes dead rising

2562
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:12,600
And they were like no, that's a dumb idea. We already have we already have a flagship zombie game

2563
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:15,400
We're not going to make another one that doesn't make any sense

2564
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:19,160
So he said okay, and then he just started development on dead rising anyway

2565
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:22,680
And then threw a bunch of money behind it and capcom was like listen man

2566
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:26,520
This better be a successful game because you know if it's not you're going to be in a lot of trouble and he goes

2567
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,640
Yeah, okay, okay

2568
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:32,600
Well for dead rising games later and I would say that it was a pretty big success everyone loved dead rising when it came out

2569
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:37,160
Yeah, um they just sort of petered off at the end there because they went to different developers

2570
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:39,560
But you know it was still a good it was a success

2571
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:43,480
Um, then he said hey, you know what we don't have any shooter games

2572
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:49,320
And capcom said shooter games are for americans. We're not we're not a western developer. We're not going to make

2573
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:53,560
First person shooters and he goes yeah, I know but I want to make like a japanese

2574
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:59,800
Shooter game like what would a japanese developed shooter game look like because at the time they really weren't any

2575
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:06,360
Yeah, and so he basically pitched lost planet and they were like no no no that's stupid

2576
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:08,680
We're not going to do that just let the western developers do that

2577
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:13,400
So he goes okay, and then he threw a bunch of money behind it and I remember

2578
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:16,680
I don't remember which game came first if it was dead rising or lost planet

2579
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:21,640
But I know the second time he did that capcom said to him if this game is not successful

2580
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:25,480
You were going to be let go. We're going to fire you for wasting all of our money

2581
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:29,480
And of course both games were a success so that didn't happen

2582
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:33,400
Um, so that was you know how how how delightful

2583
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:36,200
So he's pretty ballsy when it comes to that sort of thing

2584
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:39,160
So basically what happened was is third time's the charm

2585
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:42,360
He tries to do that for mega man and he'd green light

2586
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:48,040
I guess not green lights, but he works on all of these mega man projects and capcom basically said all right

2587
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:52,360
That's enough. We don't care for if it's going to waste our money. We're just going to cancel all these games

2588
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:57,800
So that's what they did. They said we got to put a stop to this. He's he's basically throwing around our money

2589
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:04,280
And we don't want to gamble with this money because if mega man doesn't do well

2590
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:07,800
You know we'll have wasted all this money and the same thing with legends 3

2591
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:13,640
The legend series historically has not ever really sold all that well despite the fact that it's very popular

2592
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:15,160
It is a cult series

2593
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,720
So um, they were like we're not going to take a chance on legends 3 and they just they cancelled it

2594
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:26,520
So fast forward to mighty number nine. He makes concept. Uh, and he's basically like hey, I just started a brand new company

2595
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:30,600
I don't really have the capital to make anything yet. Um, but I'm going to do Kickstarter

2596
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:33,160
Uh, and the Kickstarter campaign went

2597
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:38,280
Really well at first and it got funded like immediately and everyone was super hype

2598
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:41,400
Uh, and he basically is like I'm going to give people

2599
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:47,560
The mega man that capcom won't give them. I'm going to make a mega. I'm going to make a new mega man game

2600
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:52,200
I'm going to make a new tv show. I'm going to make merchandise. I'm going to make all these different things

2601
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:56,120
Um that I've always wanted to do at capcom, but they would never let me do it

2602
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:58,760
Because they were always like controlling everything

2603
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:01,880
And that's where things start to fall apart in so many words

2604
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:06,040
He basically bit off way more than he could chew and I just don't think he understands how

2605
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:11,960
Like crowdsourcing looks to people it's bad optics when you crowdsource the game

2606
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:17,080
And then you're like not delivering on certain things or you're late on delivering things or things don't come out

2607
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:19,080
The way that you promised

2608
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:21,480
Um, you know for me personally

2609
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:24,280
I think I donated like 80 bucks

2610
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:25,880
Uh, that's all I could afford at the time

2611
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:30,840
I would have donated more at the time and I still would have donated more even today knowing everything that happened

2612
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:35,400
I still really did believe in this project and I looked at it as like a donation

2613
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:39,080
I didn't look at it as like an investment like most people did I was like

2614
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:42,360
I'm going to donate this money to it and I'm like if the game sucks a game sucks

2615
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:44,760
But I love the guy and I'm willing to give him a chance

2616
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:47,480
um, so

2617
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:50,280
I can't even describe the entire

2618
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:54,040
Debacle with the Kickstarter because I know what do I know about it?

2619
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:58,440
I mean, I know that not all of it was his fault, but he did take the fall for a lot of it

2620
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:04,280
So I know that people didn't I feel I guess I feel a bit bad saying that the game sucks. I I haven't played it

2621
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:10,440
That's just what and so that's the thing. I played the game and I love it. It's a great game. It's not perfect

2622
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,200
It's got a few things wrong

2623
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:17,640
But it's it sets such a great foundation for what could be an amazing game

2624
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:20,040
I mean mega man one was bad

2625
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:26,520
That's exactly what I said. I'm like mega man one was bad. But you know what we have and I I again, I'm not trying to

2626
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:33,080
Uh to again like glorify Inafune and like lick his asshole over here, but mega man one

2627
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:37,400
Like sucked and capcom just didn't want to release it again. They were like

2628
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:43,160
Mega man's dead franchise. Whatever. It's stupid and Inafune and Keita mora basically put their heads together

2629
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:46,440
And they said no, listen, this could be something really great. This is actually a lot of fun

2630
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:47,800
It's got a lot of potential

2631
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,360
and the the success story of mega man is that

2632
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:55,560
Capcom basically told them you can work on making a sequel to mega man as long as you do it in your spare time

2633
02:19:55,560 --> 02:20:00,280
And it doesn't cut into this other fantastic game that we're going to be working on

2634
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:03,560
I think it was like a baseball murder mystery game. I don't know something's stupid

2635
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:05,000
Okay

2636
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:09,160
And so they said, all right, cool. And they literally worked on mega man two

2637
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:15,400
Inafune, Keita mora and their team made mega man two in their spare time and it exploded

2638
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:20,440
I've heard uh, I've heard this one. I've heard that the rest is history. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2639
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:22,760
So, you know

2640
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:26,360
I was always of the mindset. Okay. Money number nine is not a perfect game

2641
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:30,760
But neither was mega man one and I'm like just look at what happened when mega man two came out, you know

2642
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:33,320
Um, and so a lot of people

2643
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:35,960
I think were tainted by

2644
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:39,160
How poorly the Kickstarter was handled. There was a lot of things that went wrong with it

2645
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:44,360
Which I'm not even going to make excuses for there's lots of people out there who think that I'm like an Inafune like, you know

2646
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:51,000
Bible thumper or something. Uh-huh like I I'm sorry, but the guy gave me like 25 years of mega man and he definitely

2647
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,520
He definitely made some mistakes. You know, he definitely made some mistakes

2648
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:58,360
I'm not going to like say that he didn't but he was also responsible

2649
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:01,080
For a lot of good that

2650
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:03,320
You know helped me

2651
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:08,520
Grow up as a person and like gave me so many years of you like you don't you don't just fail to the top of the company

2652
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:10,520
You know what? I mean, he didn't just

2653
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:14,600
Screw up like not not when you're like creative director and you're like

2654
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:19,960
Yeah, he he did worked his way up from like he was just like a like a concept artist. He was an artist

2655
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:24,200
That's all he did. He just did the art for mega man one as far. I think that's what he started as

2656
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:29,640
It was actually pretty ridiculous that that's like he's he started where he started and then he

2657
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:34,360
Yeah, he was literally at the top. There were no more promotions for him

2658
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:36,440
He could not go any higher in cabcom

2659
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:42,840
Which is why he's just started throwing his weight around to make creative decisions about games and stuff and of course the other

2660
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:46,920
Executives who are not game developers didn't like that, you know

2661
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:53,320
So, you know, that's just how it is. So so he made a lot of mistakes, but mining number nine

2662
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:56,360
I don't think was one of them. I think it's actually a competent game

2663
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,880
It plays really well

2664
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:01,000
And I think a lot of the issues that people have with it come from

2665
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:07,320
their their preconceptions about a mega about about it being a successor to mega man and also

2666
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:13,640
A lot of people have a bad taste in their mouth from how badly he botched the kickstarter towards the latter half of things

2667
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:18,200
Um and other decisions that he made which of course I don't agree with and I think were dumb

2668
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:20,760
But I don't think he was acting maliciously

2669
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:22,840
And I think that's the problem is that a lot of people

2670
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:26,200
attribute his his bad decisions to

2671
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:31,160
Like maliciously trying to scam people out of their life. Yeah, he was scamming people or he was like

2672
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:37,880
I'm like, you know deliberately making false promises or something and I'm like, oh, I'm like, wow, you know

2673
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:42,040
Last I checked scams are usually profitable for the person running the scam

2674
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:49,160
He scammed himself right into bankruptcy. So I guess, you know, what a good guide a scam artist who takes himself out

2675
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:50,680
Like what do you you know?

2676
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:52,120
So, um

2677
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:56,760
But mighty number nine itself as a game. I think is a lot of fun. It's very fast-paced

2678
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:02,200
Like I feel like I'm playing mega man x1 or like the super nintendo x games because of how the dash mechanic works

2679
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,360
It's very fast very fluid

2680
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:10,840
And I think just too many people don't understand what they were going for the comparison that I make a lot of times is that

2681
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:13,800
mighty number nine's dash mechanic

2682
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:19,080
Is to mega man as the egg throwing mechanic in yoshi's island is to mario

2683
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:24,280
It would be like if you played yoshi's island and you were like, why do I have to throw eggs?

2684
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:28,440
It's a mario game. I just want to jump on people like well, okay

2685
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:33,160
Sure, but you have to kind of learn the mechanics of the game to get the most out of it. Otherwise, you're

2686
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:35,640
Is there something weird about mighty's dash?

2687
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:38,760
Well, the dash itself feels great

2688
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:44,440
But the way that you kill enemies in mighty number nine is you shoot them enough times and then they like destabilize

2689
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:48,280
Like they get stunned and there's like a big blue aura around them

2690
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:53,960
And it has a humongous hitbox and all you have to do is dash in their general direction and you like absorb them

2691
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:59,320
And when you do that it like refills your health or it can give you points or it can give you like power ups

2692
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:02,120
Um, each one does like a different thing

2693
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,320
Um, and so that's how you actually defeat enemies

2694
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:10,040
Now if you don't shoot them, which I don't know why you would you can sit there and just leave them alone

2695
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:14,520
And they'll kind of just blow up on their own or if you keep shooting them

2696
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:17,400
They'll eventually blow up because you've shot them too many times

2697
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:21,560
So the idea is to hit them enough times to stun them and then dash through them

2698
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:25,880
And so a perfect screen of mighty number nine would be

2699
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:31,560
Lining up your shots stunning all the enemies on the screen and then dashing through them in like one smooth motion

2700
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:35,960
Like doing a dash on the ground getting a first couple ones doing a dash jump into the air

2701
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:40,200
So that you're lined up with the next ones that were maybe like floating and then doing an air dash through that one

2702
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
So you do like a nice like s-motion

2703
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:47,960
Through the screen and you've absorbed everyone on the screen. I didn't know any of this. I thought it was just exactly like mega man

2704
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:51,880
No, so it it the way that it works is that you basically

2705
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:58,040
Stun the enemies and then absorb them and when you absorb them they'll often give you like a power up and usually these power ups

2706
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:00,360
Are consistent

2707
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:05,560
So for one you'll like beat a guy and he'll give you like a speed power up or your speed is doubled for like clinics

2708
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:07,720
However, many seconds. I think it's like 30 seconds

2709
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:11,000
And then they'll give you a set of screens

2710
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:15,560
Which you can make it through on your own, but now that you have the speed power up

2711
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:20,520
There's an obvious like pattern like yeah, you ever watch like speed running how people say

2712
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,720
Oh, you want to get on like a good cycle and then you can like get through it

2713
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:25,880
Yes, that's how the game is

2714
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:27,000
That's how the game is set up

2715
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:31,560
They want you to get that like when power up and get through the screen on the right cycle

2716
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:35,640
And then if you don't well, you can just get through it, but you're gonna do it slower or do it the hard way

2717
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:37,000
I got you

2718
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:43,320
I got same thing with like a like an attack power up the attack power up lets your shots travel through enemies and deal more

2719
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:46,760
Damage and so you'll get an attack power up on the previous screen

2720
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:50,600
But then on the next one they will purposely set up enemies that are set up

2721
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:54,280
Like three in a row so that you can't hit the ones behind them

2722
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:58,600
But now that you have the attack power up you can hit that entire row in like one shot

2723
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,560
And so you can absorb all of them at once and it's it's you know, you're making me curious

2724
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:07,400
You're making you're making me want to give it a try maybe you absolutely should

2725
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:11,640
I think even as just if you're just a mega man fan. I still think you should play mighty number nine

2726
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:16,360
Um, it feels great on pc. I should note on pc is how I would do it

2727
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:20,920
I will not defend the fact that mighty number nine has some

2728
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:28,840
It's only in like a few places. So I guess it's kind of a defense some really random performance issues and like a few very specific

2729
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:32,440
Parts of the game never enough that I felt it was game breaking

2730
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:37,240
But just for no reason the screen will it'll just chug for some reason in like a few

2731
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:42,200
Sparse areas, but on pc. I never ran into that issue. So maybe maybe I could um,

2732
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:46,840
Maybe uh, it's giving me an idea. Maybe if I could get my internet sorted out a little

2733
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:50,520
A little just make sure I wouldn't have it. Maybe I could like stream myself playing uh

2734
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:55,880
I say go into a one bust out the old twitch bust out the old twitch stream

2735
02:26:56,600 --> 02:27:03,160
Not you dust it off. Yeah, no no relation and no relation and uh, uh, maybe I could stream mighty number nine

2736
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:06,440
That might be fun. I'll be funny. I think it's worth it. Um, I think

2737
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:09,720
And you know, I don't know what else this is blasphemous for me to say

2738
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:15,480
I think money number nine does certain things better than megaman 11. Oh my god. I know that's horrible, but

2739
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:18,280
So mega man 11 has

2740
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:24,360
And I I know the irony of this when I say it it has very robotic animations for mega man

2741
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:32,360
He moves very like there's a there's a youtube video about the animations of mega man. Have you seen that one?

2742
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:37,480
I've seen that one from eight bits or like 11. He did the whole thing

2743
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:41,080
Yeah, I don't I don't remember what his name is. But yeah, I I have um

2744
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:46,680
Seeing a breakdown of like all the different like the different ways that he's animated across the different games

2745
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:49,240
It was really. Yeah, it was a great video. Yeah

2746
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:54,280
Um, but in mega man 11 your run sprite or your run animation

2747
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:58,600
I should say is the thing that you're going to see the most in the game and it is so

2748
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:04,680
Robotic and like stiff and gross and I'm like, what is this? Um

2749
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:07,640
And also when you shoot

2750
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:12,040
Like the shots are kind of weird like they kind of like hover in place

2751
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:16,600
Like they like they like hover in place or follow your buster or something like that

2752
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:19,960
And the shots don't kind of like come out the way that they're supposed to

2753
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:25,880
Like the muzzle flash and the resulting shot don't line up correctly in mega man 11 somehow

2754
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:28,520
I didn't know why or how they did that

2755
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:31,960
Uh, I probably notice what you're talking about if I went back and I looked for it

2756
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:40,280
Right. Um, but in mighty number nine does there's like no robotic animation the animations for beck. That's the that's mighty number nine

2757
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:42,760
He he moves

2758
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:46,120
So fluidly and so smoothly like when he's running

2759
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:49,000
He's got like a lot of weight to him and it's like very animated

2760
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:55,320
Um, if you jump and like there's lots of like squash and stretch because like their limbs are kind of like a little stretchy like cartoony

2761
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:56,520
Um

2762
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:01,080
When he jumps he kind of stretches out the right way and then he kind of like snaps back up to like the rest of his mass

2763
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:03,160
When he's at like the top of his jump

2764
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:09,320
If you're running forward and you jump and then land he does like a little stumble before getting back to his full run

2765
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:11,320
It doesn't even like affect gameplay

2766
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:17,080
Because like he does like it's only if you're holding forward when you land that he does like the stumble

2767
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,400
Um, so if you just let go of forward you can just land

2768
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:22,360
Completely straight like, you know, precisely

2769
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:29,960
Um, the dash feels really good like he turns into this cool like data form and like he stretches out until he's like long blue thingy

2770
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:35,720
It's really it the game just looks and feels so nice. I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm

2771
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:38,280
I'm gonna have to check it out now

2772
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,560
I kind of had written it off just based on its reputation, but uh

2773
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:47,480
And that's the thing a lot of people do and I'm like, you know, it's such it's got such a good potential though

2774
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:49,080
um

2775
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:54,360
The animations are leaps and bounds better than mecha. They release that when they release that trailer that said

2776
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:59,480
Something about an anime fan on prom night. I was so personally insulted that I just like

2777
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:04,040
Believe he would say that about me. I think I forgot that was that was that you know what?

2778
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:09,480
I a lot of people were really butthurt about that and I was like, I mean, it's pretty it's pretty cringy joke

2779
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:13,880
Like it's not a funny joke, but like it's it's not that funny. I don't care. I don't care

2780
02:30:14,680 --> 02:30:20,520
I but there was actually people who did care and they were like really personally offended and I'm like guys

2781
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:24,360
I'm an anime fan and it's my prom night. Why would you say that?

2782
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:28,600
I'm like you guys would not have survived the advertisement in

2783
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:31,080
for games in uh

2784
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:33,480
In the 90s like I watched

2785
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:34,920
Uh collection

2786
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:40,680
I open up my magazine to see I open up a game informer to see an ad for earthbound

2787
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:46,360
That says this game stinks and I say, how could they say that? How could they say that about a video?

2788
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:48,920
I like video games and they're insulting one

2789
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:54,840
Disgusting. Okay. Okay. So here's an example of some edgy 90s advertisement

2790
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:58,600
And this is for when I watched a collection of uh ps1 commercials

2791
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,520
Um, just you know as you do. It's funny like I in the digital age

2792
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:05,480
We all want to avoid advertisements and yet here I am

2793
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:10,600
Watching them on purpose. No, I hear yet ads ads in the 90s were

2794
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:17,320
Really strange and I I hazely remember them like like a dream like a nightmare that I woke up from

2795
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:21,320
So there's one for metal gear solid

2796
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:25,880
I don't even have to tell you the pedigree of this game. Everyone knows how

2797
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:31,240
The the legacy of metal gear solid and how it taught me that love can bloom on the battlefield

2798
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:36,760
Exactly. So you already know the advertisement for it. Uh, I remember

2799
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:41,640
It's it's a soldier and he's doing like push-ups and jumping jacks

2800
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:42,760
and there's like

2801
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:46,440
There's like a drill sergeant and like a higher up in like a business suit or something

2802
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:53,880
And the the drill sergeant is like drop and give me 50. He's like doing all the things or whatever. Um, and um

2803
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:57,080
he's like

2804
02:31:57,320 --> 02:32:01,960
The the soldier is like struggling to keep up with the exercises and it's interspliced with um,

2805
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:05,240
You know gameplay footage and this and that or whatever

2806
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:10,520
Um, and then the the higher up the big general guy leans over and he goes

2807
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:15,480
Are you sure this is the right man for the job? And he's like, yes, don't worry about it general

2808
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:17,800
It's a suicide mission anyway

2809
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:21,640
And then the the soldier guy looks at the screen and it zooms in and he's like, huh?

2810
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:27,080
And then it cuts to I don't even know if this is anywhere in the game, but it cuts to snake

2811
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:34,280
There's an explosion and snakes character model flails through the air and like smacks into the camera and i'm like

2812
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:38,120
What the hell am I watching? I don't know what they were

2813
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:45,080
What was the I don't know. Yeah, the wet western marketing for games and that era was just so like it was they

2814
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:49,640
They insulted you for wanting to play the game and then insulted you if you didn't play the game

2815
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,600
So you can never quite tell so when I saw the money

2816
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:59,320
I'm feeling this probably just like two guys that are like the result like the reason all advertising was like

2817
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:06,040
Yeah, so it's just sort of like oh somebody had like a success with some weird ad. Let's all copy them

2818
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:08,200
Yeah, let's all be fucked up

2819
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:11,240
So when I saw that advertising campaign for money number nine

2820
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:17,960
I just laughed I was like, haha, I get it like they're they're going for like this is stupid self-referential like edgy humor

2821
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:21,960
You know, so like it was nothing new to me because I grew up with that kind of stuff

2822
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:24,920
So I was like whatever like it's just it's a riff on

2823
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:29,880
Self-deprecating self-referential stuff. Do I think it was the right move?

2824
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:33,320
No, but I also don't think it was as agreed just as people make it out to be

2825
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:35,800
Yeah, it's it's whatever

2826
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:39,320
It's but separate from that. Let's separate

2827
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:44,760
I ask I implore not ask I implore everyone to please give the game

2828
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:50,280
A shot with no preconceptions. Um, it's always on sale for like a few bucks on steam

2829
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:54,760
You know, it's I will buy the game for people who want to play it ben

2830
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:58,360
I will buy you mighty number nine. No fucking way

2831
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I will I know

2832
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:04,920
I'm dipping really deep into the maverick hunter reserves right

2833
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:06,920
I will

2834
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:10,360
I will buy you mighty number nine to give it a shot because I think it doesn't worth a shake

2835
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:14,760
That would be uh, cool. I would uh, we can I can add you on steam

2836
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:21,320
Uh, nice. Yeah, you can do that. Um, thank you. Appreciate it. Uh, oh, you know, okay

2837
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:26,280
Not to change the subject but that reminds me, uh, gib you got to tell hgb guy

2838
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:29,640
That I bought him a video game

2839
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:34,360
The other day and he has not accepted it and it's gonna get refunded if he doesn't accept it

2840
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:37,720
Yeah, oh shit. Yeah, fury fury was on sale

2841
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:41,720
And I was like, oh, I've heard of that. It's on sale. I'll buy it and I looked at my

2842
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:46,520
Who who else has it in their wishlist and hgb guy had it in his wishlist. So I bought it for him

2843
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:48,520
Because he

2844
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:53,320
Is cool and uh, but he hasn't seen it yet. I got a notification. It's like hgb guy has not accepted

2845
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:58,360
Your gift. Ah, I'll tell him. I'll tell him. I could let him know but I won't

2846
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I like your initiative. That's gib's brother, by the way. That's the reason

2847
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:10,680
Yeah, I could physically shake him and slap him over the head like

2848
02:35:11,320 --> 02:35:15,000
Yeah, get him. Make him pay attention. Yeah, get his ass. Nice. That is usually

2849
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:17,720
That that is convenient

2850
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:21,320
Can you have that sort of ability to do so? Um

2851
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:25,720
Well, uh, okay, we've been all right. We've been going for three hours

2852
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:27,560
And

2853
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:30,440
I feel like we should start we should I'm not saying we we don't have to quit right now

2854
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:33,960
But I do feel like we should move towards a resolution

2855
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:35,800
Yes

2856
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:37,000
to put it

2857
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,640
Diplomatically and and and then and then 7 20

2858
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:44,200
And then we and then we can um, we can move on to voicemails. So I don't know um

2859
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:46,920
I

2860
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:49,880
Guess I have um, I don't know. Is there anything else you wanted to like

2861
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:53,000
Talk about while you were here on the on the

2862
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:55,960
On our on our stupid little podcast

2863
02:35:56,680 --> 02:36:03,880
It's not stupid. It is. It is stupid. You idiot. All right fine. Geez. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much

2864
02:36:06,120 --> 02:36:08,120
Um, I don't know I I'm

2865
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:13,800
I'm I'm really bad. I get the sense. I get the sensation that if we if we wanted we could

2866
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:18,040
talk about mega man and mega man accessories for

2867
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:23,400
Any no any length of time and literally I could talk about mega man for days

2868
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:25,720
And I'm not saying like that as an exaggeration

2869
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:30,360
I'm literally saying that the amount of time I could talk about mega man would exceed 24 hours consecutively

2870
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:35,960
I feel like I had enough food and water. I could just keep going. I feel like we've only scratched the surface

2871
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:40,680
Oh, yeah, there's there's a lot more that I would love to discuss with you

2872
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:43,640
You have you have so many little like little examples of like, oh, yeah

2873
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:49,160
I can bring up a very specific like a thing in a reference that was here or like the time they

2874
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:51,960
They oh, they said this in that one time

2875
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:58,680
Oh, yeah, just like like in in mega man legends the the this is just a little taste the z saber item or the zet saber

2876
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:00,200
as they call it

2877
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:05,480
Yeah, um, they say that it is a toy from a tv series called mega man zero

2878
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:12,920
Yes, and that dates the game series mega man zero. So i'm just i'm just saying it's it really it says that

2879
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:18,760
I remember that it's a toy. Yeah, that's so funny. It's it's in the japanese dialogue only. I think okay, okay, okay?

2880
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:24,520
So it's interesting that they they call it. They're referencing a series called mega man zero

2881
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:28,920
Um, like three years before mega man zero one even came out. So

2882
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:34,200
I'm just it's crazy. There's a lot. It's crazy. Okay. There's a lot I can keep going

2883
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:35,640
But I'm just give I'm just letting you know

2884
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:39,480
I'm just flexing the fact that I do have lots of little things that I could go on

2885
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:45,240
I I won't because we've been doing this for three hours. We go. I mean we we often

2886
02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:50,600
We've been we've been airing more on the short side lately, but I mean three hours is not

2887
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:52,600
hugely unusual

2888
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,200
It's not overly long. Yeah

2889
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:56,200
Sometimes we go for

2890
02:37:56,200 --> 02:38:02,200
I don't think we've been a five hour episode yet. No, we no we definitely did we definitely made I think maybe even twice

2891
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:08,200
It's funny because uh me and coalman were supposed to record an episode of our podcast today

2892
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:10,200
I actually don't know what the subject is going to be

2893
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:14,440
Um, but we're always like this will be a short one and then we always drag it out for like an hour or two

2894
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:17,880
Is that on your youtube channel? It's actually on his

2895
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:22,040
I was just called on as a guest and then I've become

2896
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:25,640
The the semi permanent co-host for the show

2897
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:30,040
Um, I just love doing it so much and he was like man, you're great. Let's just keep talking

2898
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:32,760
So like we kind of became friends and like we've been doing it ever since

2899
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:38,360
Wait, wait, wait. His name is was it x coals, uh, coalman x

2900
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:44,600
Coalman x there we go. Uh, and that's his youtube channel. That's his youtube name. Um, I think if you

2901
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:52,120
His youtube url, he's gonna kill me if I don't remember. He's not I'm just just look up rambling reploids and you'll find right there

2902
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:53,240
We go

2903
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:54,200
Awesome

2904
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:58,600
Yeah, you'll find his channel that way that because we've done a lot of episodes of that and so that show up

2905
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:00,840
I was gonna ask if you've been doing it for a while

2906
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:03,960
We have, uh, we've been doing it for a couple years now

2907
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:09,320
Um, we've covered lots of cool topics. He actually has a lot of interviews with

2908
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:14,440
Some interesting people. Oh, wait. He was in he was in my chat

2909
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:20,200
He was in my premiere chat and he mentioned to me. Oh, that was him and he mentioned to me an interview with um

2910
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Oh, I said I was gonna check it out. Uh

2911
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:26,200
He he specifically mentioned one interview with

2912
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:30,760
Someone ah darn it. I can't he's done interviews with a lot of people

2913
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:36,280
We've talked to Ian James Corlett who was the original voice for mega man of the ruby spears cartoon. That might um

2914
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
It was it was a voice actor

2915
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:42,920
He wants to talk to he meant to talk to me. I don't know if we're gonna finally call in this favor

2916
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:47,640
But we want to talk to scott mcneil who voiced protoman and dr. Wiley in the ruby spears cartoon

2917
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:52,680
He's scott mcneil has also done like a bajillion voices. So he's done a lot of things outside of mega man

2918
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:55,400
But we want to talk to him

2919
02:39:55,960 --> 02:40:00,280
I'm trying to remember who else he's interviewed because we've done a lot of interviews actually. So oh

2920
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:01,960
um

2921
02:40:01,960 --> 02:40:03,720
No, that wasn't him

2922
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:10,120
Shoot, I can't remember but yeah, um, I was gonna say check out our our channel and not not to forcibly

2923
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:15,560
Stick a plug in here. But no, I mean by all he does cool stuff like it's all mega man related. So

2924
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:20,440
um, we always talk about neat mega man related topics

2925
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:22,600
Usually there's like a theme to an episode

2926
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:27,800
Uh, he he himself gets really great interviews. So I recommend checking out the interviews

2927
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:31,960
So it's a lot of fun. I he he mentioned that interview to me

2928
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:35,320
And I thought to myself and I said I was gonna check that out and I wanted to check that out

2929
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:41,320
And thank you for reminding me. I had almost forgotten. But yes, uh, that's so funny. Yeah, I will I will go

2930
02:40:41,400 --> 02:40:43,000
I will scope

2931
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:48,600
I can't remember which which interview he he recommended to me, but I was I was gonna go I was gonna go watch it

2932
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:50,600
And now I remember

2933

Yeah, I I wasn't there for the premiere unfortunately. Um, but I mean, I couldn't that's fine sat there further

2935
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:01,960
But uh, yeah, he was he was even saying, you know, I'm just gonna go ahead and throw it out there

2936
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:08,760

Yeah, just don't do not check out reploid revo on youtube

2955
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:37,480
I was gonna say that the one of your videos that I watched the most was the history of robotics series

2956
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:43,240
Um, I love that one. Definitely my favorites that I've done because because that one has you know, all the like world history and stuff

2957
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:45,960
Uh, what are the other ones that I mean, um

2958
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:50,280
You know the who the who is x the who is zero series are just very like

2959
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:55,400
You know, it's just very very important very important information to understand

2960
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:58,040
um, my

2961
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:04,360
The your iceberg your iceberg video was pretty good the the the combine. I like I like that one

2962
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:10,120
And I like and I and I like that um the one you linked me the other day, which I had seen before the um

2963
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:11,240
I forget what it's called

2964
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:16,520
But the like everything that happens in the whole time skimmer everything is or time skimmer the whole thing

2965
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,800
And it was an April actually all the time skimmer videos again. I watched all of those by the way

2966
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:26,040
Well, thank you. I do appreciate it and uh, you know, I can't wait to

2967
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:31,960
Continue on with that series. I think it's gonna be great because I wanted people are always like, why don't you talk about legends?

2968
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:34,680
I want you to talk. It's your legends three. It's your legends three

2969
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:42,360
It is but I'm it's not cancelled. It is coming out. Oh, it's I did complete all the editing for that video like several years ago

2970
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:47,160
But I'll tell you what I'm announcing it here first. I always do like an end of year video, but I'll put it out there

2971
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:51,800
Uh, I'm going to be remastering a lot of pretty much all my content. Um

2972
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:55,160
Be it's not going to be like a crazy undertaking

2973
02:43:55,320 --> 02:43:58,200
But there are certain things that like I didn't know how to do

2974
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:03,640
So I'm going to be re re-recording certain things because like my audio quality has now been way improved

2975
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:07,240
Uh, and I'm also going to be fixing a lot of editing mistakes and stuff like that

2976
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:12,280
So, um, I'll be getting to that and uh, I already finished the editing for time skimmer six

2977
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:17,800
Years ago, and I think I'm just this is the perfect time to just start over again on it anyway. So it's coming

2978
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:21,880
It's coming. I promise and I'm not I'm not fooling you radical

2979
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:23,800
radical radical

2980
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:25,800
Hell yeah, all right. It is

2981
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:29,960
All right, it's bodacious. Uh, it's been been great. Uh

2982
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,600
Now skidaddle

2983
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:37,320
All right. All right. Take care everyone. Thank you for having me. I'll see you guys next time. Bye. Bye

2984
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:39,560
absolutely

2985
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:46,040
Sweet man, what a cool guy knows a lot about mega man

2986
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:51,320
Sure does Ben. How how emasculated do you feel right now?

2987
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:54,680
Let's not talk about it

2988
02:44:54,920 --> 02:44:56,920
somebody somebody in um

2989
02:44:57,480 --> 02:45:02,440
Somebody in I think it was either a comment or someone in the chat in the premiere asked me like

2990
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:08,360
Ben, are you the most like do you know the most like does does anyone know as much as you about mega man?

2991
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:10,600
And I I think as she officially said like

2992
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:15,480
Repload Revo might know as much as me he might know as much as me

2993
02:45:15,560 --> 02:45:18,520
But I said that knowing full well like he definitely knows more than me

2994
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:24,200
Uh, I mean I I mean I literally played some of the games for the first time ever for the um

2995
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,200
Like I'd never I'd never played x5 or x6 uh before

2996
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:34,600
Then I just do it for the video. So like I'm a freaking nerd. I only did one playthrough of x4

2997
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:39,880
I only did the x playthrough. I didn't even do zeros playthrough zeros playthrough is like even more canon

2998
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:43,080
I'm a I'm a baby

2999
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:45,800
You're a fool

3000
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:52,520
How what a what a nerd you are to not have played so much so embarrassing and I can't get a girlfriend because I didn't play

3001
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:54,520
Both playthroughs of x4

3002
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:58,520
Sad uh

3003
02:45:59,960 --> 02:46:01,960
Um, do you want to go to voicemails?

3004
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:07,320
Oh, I forgot or I forgot to do my quip. I forgot to do my quip where I say

3005
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:14,600
Where's all the mega woman, huh? But it it's time. There's one there. She's you know, there's one called splash woman

3006
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:18,120
There's one. Oh

3007
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:22,680
What's the difference why is she a woman because that's her name?

3008
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:27,880
I don't know what you want me to say uh

3009
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:34,600
Uh, she's like I'm because I because they're they're robots. They don't procreate or reploids or yeah, like

3010
02:46:35,320 --> 02:46:37,640
There's no there's no reason for them to have gender

3011
02:46:37,640 --> 02:46:40,440
But they're all I mean, I guess it's kind of like the sounds honestly

3012
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:44,680
I think it's probably like a crystal gem thing like it kind of doesn't matter. They just all are men

3013
02:46:45,640 --> 02:46:47,640
Except for splash woman. Well

3014
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:49,960
reploids are

3015
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:55,160
There are more there like reploids are some of them are women like all the nap most of the navigators are women

3016
02:46:55,960 --> 02:46:58,840
Uh, what what makes them women? I don't know because they look

3017
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:01,800
girly

3018
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:03,560
uh

3019
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:05,640
And then and then I think in in zero they're like

3020
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:08,440
It's kind of just equal number

3021
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:13,960
Yeah, I don't know all reploids start genderless and then they just pick if they feel like I feel like

3022
02:47:15,400 --> 02:47:22,280
I feel I mean, I mean most most of the like bosses are like they don't really look gendered one way or another like

3023
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:24,280
They just look like an animal

3024
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:28,520
But I think they tend to call them he square when they refer to them at all

3025
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:32,440
I think they usually call most of them he I can't think of any that are called she

3026
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:35,080
until like alia

3027
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:37,080
in in five

3028
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:39,400
and then

3029
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:44,040
I don't know why they didn't you know, they they made splash woman

3030
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:50,840
In nine and like she was cool and then they never made they didn't make it anymore. They had two more games and they didn't do any more

3031
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:53,720
Woman and like why?

3032
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:55,240
Why not?

3033
02:47:55,240 --> 02:47:57,240
Everybody likes splash woman

3034
02:47:57,960 --> 02:48:03,960
Well, we'll never know because uh twitches left they probably would have been able to talk honestly

3035
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:10,280
He might have had more he honestly might have had more insight into that than me. He said he was doing he said he was working on a video

3036
02:48:11,320 --> 02:48:14,200
For his channel soon about reploids siblings

3037
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:16,040
Which is

3038
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:19,560
I thought that was an interesting topic because it actually is sort of like a mysterious thing

3039
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:25,960
There are several reploids that have like siblings, but like what does that mean for a reploid?

3040
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:28,120
You know

3041
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:31,160
Uh, and I think it kind of varies case by case

3042
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:34,600
I think some of them were like

3043
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:37,720
Originally supposed to be one robot and then they sort of split into two

3044
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:44,520
Or like the two of them are like linked by like a single, uh server or console or something like that

3045
02:48:45,640 --> 02:48:47,640
Uh

3046
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:56,360
Well, um

3047
02:48:56,360 --> 02:48:58,920
Before we get to voicemails. I have

3048
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:05,000
It's not really an announcement. It's just sort of a vibe. I've been on it's not really like, uh

3049
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:10,360
I just I'm I I want to hibernate you this this winter hibernate

3050
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:15,080
I'm getting on my hibernation. I'm gonna eat and I'm gonna sleep

3051
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:18,280
But I'm gonna roll up in a blanket and I'm gonna not think

3052
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:22,520
If I've had enough of the world you see, uh, okay

3053
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:26,760
And I would I would encourage everyone also to do that

3054
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:31,640
No more everybody everybody betray you you're fed up with this world

3055
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:37,480
Everybody is too woke you need to get some shut I get some sleepy times

3056
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:40,200
Hibernate just go into your cave

3057
02:49:41,960 --> 02:49:48,040
Exactly. It's it's I think it's good. I think it's what I want to do with my time, you know

3058
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:52,120
I'm not like deliberately setting out to do that

3059
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:58,200
But I think I kind of am subconsciously doing that because I really for like a week or more now

3060
02:49:58,280 --> 02:49:59,800
I've really needed

3061
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:01,160
Almond milk

3062
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:04,600
And it's literally like a 10 minute walk down the street to Trader Joe's to get some

3063
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:10,360
But it's just a little bit cold out. It's just a little bit moderately chilly out and that's just

3064
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:13,080
Ah, I just can't

3065
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:14,840
I just can't do it

3066
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:17,320
So yeah hibernate hibernation mode

3067
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:21,480
Yeah, I think is the vibe just stack up just let's get all fat

3068
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:24,760
Roll up and then you don't even need to leave your room

3069
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:31,480
You don't need to leave the blanket a cave is low. You're just burn off at all low key goaded when hibernation is the vibe

3070
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:36,600
I

3071
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:38,840
You should tweet that I'll you know what

3072
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:42,360
Fuck I guess I will if you

3073
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:46,360
If you insist a cave is

3074
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:50,520
Oh god, the caps lock was on. I can't I'm so embarrassing myself

3075
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:56,360
Yeah, it wasn't really like the episode to talk about hibernating and there's not really much to talk about but

3076
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:02,440
Uh, that's my that's my should I thing I'm going on. That's that's that's what I'm getting cranked on right now

3077
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:05,320
So hibernation that's totally

3078
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:11,720
Yeah, of course that totally totally normal totally reasonable thing to say and think

3079
02:51:14,840 --> 02:51:16,840
I I have no follow-up questions

3080
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:19,960
Um, I feel like this phrase it needs an adjective

3081
02:51:19,960 --> 02:51:23,080
It needs to be not just a cave is it needs to be like a something cave

3082
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:27,240
Maybe like a winter cave or like a forest cave or something. Um

3083
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:31,560
Because greater specificity a bear hole bear hole

3084
02:51:32,680 --> 02:51:34,680
um

3085
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:36,040
arboreal

3086
02:51:36,040 --> 02:51:39,480
Isn't would it would it be too obscure to say call it an arboreal cave?

3087
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:47,880
Yeah, it might be I think it'll yeah, maybe a little bit. I know arboreal is a word that I've heard before

3088
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:53,720
Yeah, maybe just winter. Maybe maybe wintery a wintery cave mystical cave

3089
02:51:57,400 --> 02:51:58,760
Uh

3090
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:05,720
All right, I'm there we go a wintery cave is low key go to when hibernation and this is the vibe banger banger banger alert

3091
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:08,840
banger alert

3092
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:11,880
Okay, um

3093
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:18,120
Well, all right, that's good a voice. I had I litter you know what I'm glad

3094
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,520
nice nice

3095
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:24,840
Have twitch on to take up so much airtime because other than the fact that like

3096
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:28,200
The video came out and I had Thanksgiving

3097
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:31,080
I didn't do anything. I don't have anything else to talk about

3098
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:36,600
There's nothing else I have to bring up. Yeah. Oh, I guess on the podcast briefly

3099
02:52:37,320 --> 02:52:40,760
I I found this website or I was told about this website called itaku

3100
02:52:41,560 --> 02:52:44,040
um, which I am going to be using as

3101
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,840
Oh someone

3102
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:49,800
Showed me that I don't know what it is. It's a website

3103
02:52:50,120 --> 02:52:53,880
Uh similar ish to twitter but mostly sort of like an art

3104
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:56,360
gallery thing

3105
02:52:56,360 --> 02:52:59,320
It's very easy to upload many images

3106
02:53:00,520 --> 02:53:06,120
And you tag you you have to tag each image at least five times to make sure that the tags are being used

3107
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:08,200
and

3108
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:11,560
um, it's good because it allows not safe for work. It's very

3109
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:15,000
Very furry heavy. There's loads of furries on here

3110
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:19,960
Which means, uh, it's probably like the best website ever

3111
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:25,960
Because furries are insane and they they care about their their own they they care about

3112
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:33,000
Preserving look out for their own. Yeah, they're not worried about advertisers or like stuff like that. They got a donation page

3113
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:35,960
and I'm like twitter could go or

3114
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:38,680
Could become like untenable

3115
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:42,280
And I don't have any real place to host all of my art

3116
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:45,560
Especially my not safe work art. So I'm putting it on itaku

3117
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:48,120
I'll have a little okay

3118
02:53:48,360 --> 02:53:50,760
For any of those freaks who like that shit

3119
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:55,000
Do you want to link it? I'm linking it right here

3120
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:57,560
There we go

3121
02:53:57,560 --> 02:53:59,560
There's like a thing like um

3122
02:54:00,040 --> 02:54:04,600
I have a safer work profile and then a not safe for work profile which changes my avatar

3123
02:54:05,320 --> 02:54:08,040
And if you're like logged on you can switch between them

3124
02:54:09,720 --> 02:54:12,840
And so all of the things that are not safe work are tagged properly

3125
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:18,840
Not tagged that there's like a setting and so you can't see not safe work things unless

3126
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:23,640
You are you have the thing turned on so it's all good

3127
02:54:24,600 --> 02:54:26,760
And it's great and it's nice

3128
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:33,240
And I feel safe. I don't feel safe posting it anything on tumblr or deviant art or fucking anywhere

3129
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:36,280
So I'm glad this website has been

3130
02:54:37,240 --> 02:54:39,240
It exists

3131
02:54:41,480 --> 02:54:42,920
That's it uh

3132
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:47,480
Cool. Good. Hang on. Replayed sent me twitch sent me a message and I just need to respond real quick

3133
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:50,520
All right, let's do let's do voicemails. Um

02:55:13,400 --> 02:55:18,680
Okay, yeah, good. I'm glad I could help. Yeah, did you forget to draw the line between

3139
02:55:19,320 --> 02:55:21,320
Wily and zero

3140
02:55:21,320 --> 02:55:27,000
Yeah, I forgot to draw the line from wily to zero. Uh, but visual stimulus is the only way I learned

3141
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:29,880
Even though like literally the entire plot

3142
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:32,680
of x is

3143
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:35,480
Did you know wily made zero actually like?

3144
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:39,480
Ah, I just forgot

3145
02:55:39,800 --> 02:55:41,480
I just forgot

3146
02:55:41,480 --> 02:55:43,080
It's fine

3147
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:47,320
The next voicemail is a tweet. What is this? I don't I

02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:50,200
Is this a real?

3149

3152
02:56:01,560 --> 02:56:07,480
Okay, that's a message from young based god. He's quoting it to him. Yeah, he just says it's called genes

3153
02:56:09,160 --> 02:56:11,800
Well, I mean I get it. I get the joke. Yeah

Well, there's um, it's an imager link

3159
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:37,720
Okay, but there there is a voicemail attached. So let's listen to that real quick. Uh, three two one go

3160
02:56:38,520 --> 02:56:45,720
You guys always complain about twitter, but I actually love it. It's really easy. Okay. I also love it

3161
02:56:46,120 --> 02:56:48,120
I'm sad about it going

3162
02:56:49,960 --> 02:56:54,120
I say it going when it's still here, but you know, I don't I don't know if I

3163
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:57,000
I don't know if I really

3164
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:03,080
Love it, but I mean sure I appreciate the value that it has even though it sucks a lot of the time

3165
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:08,840
Okay, so this image is um, this should have been obvious

3166
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:13,240
But this is how to make twitter a good experience for you

3167
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:15,240
Okay

3168
02:57:15,240 --> 02:57:17,240
Follow accounts worthy of your time

3169
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:21,960
Never enter the recommended. Yeah, never browse the timeline

3170
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:30,600
Enable this on which you like sends to you a timeline which only your belled accounts

3171
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:35,320
Yeah, I mean, I agree. This is basically what I do

3172
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:40,840
Honestly, I mean, I'm on twitter to see shitty political takes and get mad at them

3173
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:44,600
Like I understand that I understand why someone wouldn't do that. But like

3174
02:57:45,400 --> 02:57:48,680
I think I would just get I would get bored of twitter if I was just like looking at art

3175
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:57,560
I got a look at that. Look at that. Who's that? Who is she? It's bonnet with the with the the with the

3176
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:00,040
I don't care

3177
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:01,960
I don't care who she is

3178
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:07,160
She can just be herself on her own damn time. No need to drag me into it

3179
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:10,520
Bonus goth ben bigger

3180
02:58:11,720 --> 02:58:17,320
Nose piercings. Oh the the line around your eye is bigger because yeah because eyeshadow

3181
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:20,280
mascara

3182
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:22,360
Cool cool goth ben

3183
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Should make a comeback. I think

3184
02:58:25,400 --> 02:58:28,680
Yeah, um, there's a there's a youtuber whose thing is

3185
02:58:29,720 --> 02:58:31,720
Calls himself like a goth gamer

3186
02:58:32,200 --> 02:58:37,160
Honestly, he doesn't really seem very goth other than that his logo is a little bit gothy and like his

3187
02:58:37,960 --> 02:58:39,800
And then he's called he's

3188
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:41,800
Fuck what's his name? Um

3189
02:58:41,960 --> 02:58:45,080
Um grim beard his name is grim beard

3190
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:47,800
I've enjoyed a couple of his videos

3191
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:49,880
Seems pretty good

3192
02:58:49,880 --> 02:58:53,880
I don't really get the goth thing, but whatever. Maybe if I saw him in real life, I would get it

3193
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:57,240
Okay. Anyway, next one is the voicemail. It's called

3194
02:58:57,960 --> 02:58:59,480
Discuss

3195
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:05,320
The the voicemail attached is just a a pained moan. So whatever. It's a types of pasta

3196
02:59:05,800 --> 02:59:07,800
types of pasta

3197
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:16,200
He got spaghetti lasagna, vermicelli, macaroni. I've not heard of big olie. That's funny. It's just sort of thick spaghetti

3198
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:20,200
Big ol I never heard of that. I saw a I saw a tweet

3199
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
I think it was a comic. I think it was from

3200
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:26,120
I don't remember

3201
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:29,960
What it was some big ish comic account and they were like

3202
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:34,520
It was a comic that was like a dad was trying to get his kid to eat pasta

3203
02:59:34,520 --> 02:59:41,000
And the pasta was like the kid the kid was like, I don't want spaghetti. I want macaroni and the dad said it's the same thing in a different shape

3204
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:45,560
And then the italian police busted down his door and held him down

3205
02:59:46,600 --> 02:59:51,320
They were gonna beat the shit out of him, you know, I've you know, you know how it goes

3206
02:59:51,400 --> 02:59:54,520
I've eaten a lot of these I really like conch shagley

3207
02:59:55,160 --> 02:59:57,160
The conch one

3208
02:59:57,240 --> 03:00:02,280
Looks like a shell. It's quite big. Yeah. Yeah, and it's sort of the only thing that's bad about them

3209
03:00:02,440 --> 03:00:05,400
Is that they can sometimes get stuck within one of the others

3210
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:10,200
And so you have to sort of separate them to get the sauce in but they're really nice

3211
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:12,840
Well, let me see

3212
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:15,640
I'm gonna I'm gonna mark all the ones that I have not eaten

3213
03:00:16,920 --> 03:00:20,760
Yeah, let me I'll also do that. I'm what the hell is I mean, okay

3214
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:24,040
Some of these look similar enough like

3215
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:28,280
Feel like I should be able to say I've eaten even though I technically have not

3216
03:00:29,400 --> 03:00:30,280
um

3217
03:00:30,280 --> 03:00:35,240
Well, the whole point is the they're the same thing, but they just have a different texture. So

3218
03:00:35,960 --> 03:00:37,960
I would say like what is the difference

3219
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:41,560
What exactly is the difference between ditalini and rigatoni?

3220
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:44,600
Um, that one's got ridges ditalini

3221
03:00:47,080 --> 03:00:49,480
What am I where is it where the hell's ditalini

3222
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:52,040
Ditalini is on the bottom row

3223
03:00:53,480 --> 03:00:55,480
Oh, that's like a hula hoop

3224
03:00:56,280 --> 03:01:02,520
Yeah, you know, I don't know. I guess the rate on me is like the brigade they look the same except one's just got ridges on

3225
03:01:03,720 --> 03:01:08,680
Wait, is that a shortened rigatoni? I don't think usually longer than that. Was that penne?

3226
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:13,160
No, I think that's z z d or z d or penne

3227
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:16,920
All right, I haven't had but I've been that they're the same

3228
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:21,000
Crosetti, it looks like a medallion. That looks interesting

3229
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:24,440
Like what like what how would I know?

3230
03:01:24,920 --> 03:01:30,600
How would I know the difference between if I was eating stringotsi versus fettuccine?

3231
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:33,480
I feel it's fucking same

3232
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:35,960
The fucking same

3233
03:01:36,360 --> 03:01:40,280
Uh, because fettuccine is like flat stringotsi is so much different

3234
03:01:41,240 --> 03:01:44,760
It I mean, it just looks like fettuccine, but a little bit thinner

3235
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:50,120
No, fettuccine is similar to tagliatelle, but they're also different. I've had both

3236
03:01:52,200 --> 03:01:57,080
You don't have enough pasta then you're you're I've actually you need more I actually think I've

3237
03:01:58,040 --> 03:01:59,960
I actually think I've

3238
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:05,960
Wait a minute. I think I've had orzo. I've had orzo, but only in the context of

3239
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:10,040
Um rice pilaf. Is that what that is?

3240
03:02:10,360 --> 03:02:12,520
Hang on. I think so. I think it

3241
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:19,080
Yes, I think rice pilaf. It has the rice and it has the little pieces of pasta and I think that's orzo

3242
03:02:19,640 --> 03:02:23,720
Okay, so I can say I technically have had that one. I think I yeah, same

3243
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:28,200
I feel like I'm just gonna go the pepper

3244
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:31,560
In like a freaking airplane meal

3245
03:02:32,360 --> 03:02:34,360
You know what? I think I actually have had

3246
03:02:35,160 --> 03:02:36,760
most of these

3247
03:02:36,760 --> 03:02:38,760
Here's my here's my list

3248
03:02:39,240 --> 03:02:41,640
Pavette if it'll freaking load. Pavette. I

3249
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:44,360
I'm not sure that I've had

3250
03:02:44,360 --> 03:02:51,400
I really like gemili. It's like fusilli, but it's chewier. I guess. I don't know why I don't know how it does that

3251
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:54,760
Maybe I just cooked it albente or something

3252
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:58,280
I made my own ravioli one time

3253
03:02:59,240 --> 03:03:01,240
It was quite difficult

3254
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:02,280
Yes

3255
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:06,520
I've never bothered trying to make a pasta myself. I guess ravioli is the

3256
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:09,320
You don't need a pasta machine

3257
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,760
kind of

3258
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:12,760
What do you

3259
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,160
You sort of like hand squish it

3260
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:20,360
Okay, I think this is

3261
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:26,040
I know I know I've seen some of these before I'm assuming that any of these that like look similar to something I've eaten

3262
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:28,840
That that I've eaten them

3263
03:03:29,480 --> 03:03:32,440
Like I don't know if I've specifically had barbina before

3264
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
But like I look at it like I get it

3265
03:03:35,880 --> 03:03:40,840
I'm like pretty pretty sure I've had something very similar to that Italian police are coming. They're knocking on your door right now

3266
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Yeah, I think so

3267
03:03:44,120 --> 03:03:49,720
Ah filesia or how have you say these things? I like that. I know I've had that before

3268
03:03:50,840 --> 03:03:53,160
Well, they got in in asia. They just got rice

3269
03:03:54,440 --> 03:03:58,200
They don't they can't turn their rice into funny shapes get out of here

3270
03:03:59,720 --> 03:04:01,720
Uh

3271
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:04,440
Uh

3272
03:04:04,840 --> 03:04:06,120
No more

3273
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:08,120
No more italian. No more

3274
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:12,680
Next one is called mega man one exclamation point one one

3275
03:04:13,240 --> 03:04:17,320
exclamation point exclamation point three two one go

3276
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:22,360
I cannot believe that then seen

3277
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Forgot to draw the one line

3278
03:04:25,640 --> 03:04:27,640
That's so important

3279
03:04:27,720 --> 03:04:30,280
Which connects the fact that spoiler alert

3280
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:34,120
Dr. Wiley did in fact create zero

3281
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:38,280
What a that's another line line hater

3282
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:46,760
I don't know what I was thinking. I don't I don't know what what's even the point of the board if I'm not going to draw

3283
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:49,400
The line from wiley to zero

3284
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:56,120
It really ruins everything you should start over it really did it literally ruins everything literally it just invalidates the entire concept

3285
03:04:56,120 --> 03:04:58,120
Yeah

3286
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:05,320
It's so stupid. Did I mention last week that I was thinking I should try to raffle off the uh

3287
03:05:05,800 --> 03:05:11,080
Yeah, yeah, you could mention it. What if I tried to sell the um the the the paper on ebay

3288
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:13,320
That'd be really funny

3289
03:05:13,320 --> 03:05:16,120
Oh, but then they'd be they'd be mad that the line isn't written

3290
03:05:16,200 --> 03:05:20,600
But you can't like edit it because it wouldn't be in the video you'd invalidate it. Well, I could

3291
03:05:21,560 --> 03:05:25,080
Yeah, I would ask I mean if they wanted me to draw the line on it

3292
03:05:25,320 --> 03:05:27,480
I would happily do that if they wanted it as

3293
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:30,520
As it was in the video that would be okay too

3294
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:36,520
Actually, but I might have I might have drawn the line on after the fact. I'm not I don't

3295
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:39,800
Did I dream that I don't know

3296
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:46,840
Having a dream like you got the comment you realized you you forgot the line and then in your dreams you have to fix the problem

3297
03:05:47,560 --> 03:05:53,720
I I specifically call attention to the fact that I didn't draw the line in the video. So I

3298
03:05:54,840 --> 03:06:00,200
That's why people are commenting about it. It's because I said, please don't make fun of me for it

3299
03:06:01,400 --> 03:06:03,400
But they didn't listen

3300
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:06,680
Uh, next one is called. Where was I?

3301
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:13,320
Uh, el piezo from mega man at reploids on the web.gov three two one go

3302
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:20,760
So I have just listened to the new mega man lecture by ben saint and I thoroughly enjoyed it

3303
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:29,240
However, I cannot believe that people would simply paint el piezo as a pure villain with no good ideas

3304
03:06:29,720 --> 03:06:37,000
Because like the absolute naivete involved in saying on the other hand like oh, no

3305
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:43,000
We'll just give them the new energy source and then everything will be hunky dory like bro

3306
03:06:43,640 --> 03:06:46,280
the inherent racism and like

3307
03:06:46,840 --> 03:06:54,280
Dehumanization involved in in the first place thinking of reploids is completely disposable in the phase of an energy crisis

3308
03:06:54,760 --> 03:07:00,680
Is like not going to go away if you offer them exactly what they want and need like

3309
03:07:01,400 --> 03:07:06,680
That's just going to make you seem like even more of a fucking tool like a complete cuck

3310
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:10,680
That is just going to get rolled over and the next time there's an emergency

3311
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:13,400
El piezo was fucking right

3312
03:07:15,320 --> 03:07:17,080
I think yeah

3313
03:07:17,080 --> 03:07:22,280
El piezo is the villain of that game, but he's not really a villain until the baby elves drive him insane

3314
03:07:23,240 --> 03:07:25,240
So I would I I agree

3315
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:31,320
El piezo had a point even though it didn't work out and his efforts failed. Yeah, I'm see I'm team el piezo

3316
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:34,360
El piezo sounds like a pastor

3317
03:07:35,560 --> 03:07:37,240
It does

3318
03:07:37,240 --> 03:07:40,040
I think it's greek or I think it's derived from a greek word

3319
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:42,040
um

3320
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:43,160
the

3321
03:07:43,160 --> 03:07:45,160
What else was going to say about that?

3322
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:52,040
I mean, I guess maybe maybe under copy x if there was no if there was no energy crisis

3323
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:54,120
I mean, maybe the worst of the

3324
03:07:54,280 --> 03:07:56,040
robot apartheid

3325
03:07:56,040 --> 03:07:57,880
would have abated

3326
03:07:57,880 --> 03:08:00,360
I mean, obviously once vile was back there was no

3327
03:08:01,160 --> 03:08:03,160
There was no fixing that situation

3328
03:08:03,160 --> 03:08:07,160
I it definitely would have maybe there was a time when it might have

3329
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:11,640
somewhat improved the situation to give them the seal system, but

3330
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:15,000
By the time they actually had at that time was definitely passed

3331
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:17,800
um

3332
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:19,800
Next one

3333
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:22,840

Get actually in in in zero two

3335
03:08:27,320 --> 03:08:29,320
Harpuya is the head of the government

3336
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:35,880
So like our and harpuya is a good guy. He's like a reasonable guy. Maybe harpuya could have been reasoned with

3337
03:08:36,840 --> 03:08:40,360
Hmm. So at the time when operation right district was happening

3338
03:08:40,840 --> 03:08:44,680
Maybe cl that was like the time when it was like most likely that cl would have been right

3339
03:08:45,720 --> 03:08:46,520
so

3340
03:08:46,520 --> 03:08:47,400
in that

3341
03:08:47,400 --> 03:08:49,400
light

3342
03:08:49,400 --> 03:08:51,400
Maybe okay

3343
03:08:51,880 --> 03:08:58,280
Okay, anyway, uh next one is called uh x 000 x 3 2 1 go

3344
03:08:59,240 --> 03:09:02,760

3345
03:09:03,640 --> 03:09:06,120
I don't fucking know what the fuck kind of question is that

3346
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:11,320
It'll be uh the same but with the word nate somewhere in the title

3347
03:09:11,480 --> 03:09:15,480
I I don't I already I don't even know what the title is going to be

3348
03:09:16,520 --> 03:09:19,640
As it is ellie is our comes up with those later. So

3349
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:22,760

3350
03:09:23,320 --> 03:09:25,320
maratham

3351
03:09:25,320 --> 03:09:29,800
Uh discussion. No, that sucks. It would be called losing our virginity

3352
03:09:30,520 --> 03:09:32,520
With mega

3353
03:09:34,600 --> 03:09:36,600
Losing our minds

3354
03:09:37,320 --> 03:09:40,840
Yeah, that's just the show. Okay next one is called

3355
03:09:41,640 --> 03:09:46,920
Ben's weekly reminder play delta room chapter two. Okay, Ben's weekly reminder to keep up to date with one piece

3356
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:50,120
Okay, there wasn't a new episode or there wasn't a new chapter this week

3357
03:09:50,200 --> 03:09:56,760
No, well or there was but I don't I think it was last week. Yeah, we did it last week. I think

3358
03:09:57,240 --> 03:09:59,240
Yeah, I can't find another one

3359
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:04,600
On the website that I was looking at last week the one that we reviewed last week came out like

3360
03:10:05,240 --> 03:10:08,280
That morning or the night before the episode. So

3361
03:10:09,400 --> 03:10:14,920
Yeah, this week between then and now there was not a new one that dropped. Otherwise we would discuss it

3362
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:21,720
Um, it's probably out by the time you're listening to this which is probably that's just how it's gonna be

3363
03:10:22,600 --> 03:10:25,800
Don't they usually drop in like the middle of the week? I don't yeah, I think it's

3364
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:31,720
Generally been Wednesday, but like I I don't know like what's the official

3365
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:36,520
Thing the official thing on vis is different from how

3366
03:10:37,160 --> 03:10:41,080
Quickly some of the scanners can get the scans early. So it's like

3367
03:10:41,800 --> 03:10:44,440
Generally been Wednesday, but I don't actually know

3368
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:51,400
Maybe there was like an early leak of the last chapter or something perhaps

3369
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:53,560
Um

3370
03:10:53,560 --> 03:10:56,360
But anyway, yeah, I'm up to date. I'm staying up to date

3371
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:01,080
Next one is called i o I a a i o you

3372
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:04,280
I guess i o three two one go

3373
03:11:05,800 --> 03:11:08,040
Uh, I need to know your

3374
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:13,320
Opinion on tapas.io is a comic website

3375
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:17,960
Tapas I was pretending to open my shit on it in

3376
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:20,600
years, I don't know

3377
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:28,360
But did you never mention it because it is cringe or you'll never heard of it? Should I keep it? I I've um

3378
03:11:29,560 --> 03:11:33,480
I don't like it. I've never I've never I've never had any success posting there

3379
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:41,160
Neither have I it's just it's fine. I think it's just sort of like not really a site I go to

3380
03:11:41,880 --> 03:11:43,880
to read things

3381
03:11:44,360 --> 03:11:46,040
um

3382
03:11:46,040 --> 03:11:50,120
I don't know. It's nothing too much to complain about. I just got like tired

3383
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:56,120
Like posting a chapter of a thing on one like webtoon

3384
03:11:56,760 --> 03:11:59,400
and my what my website and tapas

3385
03:12:00,360 --> 03:12:02,360
And I'm like, oh fuck it

3386
03:12:03,160 --> 03:12:05,160
It's too many things

3387
03:12:05,320 --> 03:12:07,320
I'd rather do nothing at all

3388
03:12:08,200 --> 03:12:11,560
Post to my website and then link that in social media and that

3389
03:12:12,120 --> 03:12:13,400
works fine

3390
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:15,560
I never I never got any like views

3391
03:12:16,440 --> 03:12:19,960
posting stuff that I drew to tapas or to

3392
03:12:20,520 --> 03:12:22,920
webtoon mary like says

3393
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:25,640
mary loves webtoon

3394
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:31,480
But I mean mary I don't know for whatever reason mary gets like a billion views on webtoon and like I post my shit and it gets like

3395
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:34,040
it gets like

3396
03:12:34,280 --> 03:12:39,560
Eight eight views and maybe a comment if I'm if I'm really lucky. It's so like, yeah, I don't know

3397
03:12:39,560 --> 03:12:43,080
Which it doesn't feel I never get anything out of it. I feel like the webtoon

3398
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:45,000
crowd

3399
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:49,880
Similar and enough to the tapas crowd is just the sort of thing that mary withers comics

3400
03:12:50,600 --> 03:12:53,960
fit very nicely into there's a lot of anime stuff

3401
03:12:54,520 --> 03:12:56,200
There's a lot of emotional

3402
03:12:56,200 --> 03:13:02,200
I think I think he likes it because I think he likes it because it's easier to monetize than like posting on twitter

3403
03:13:02,520 --> 03:13:06,120
So I think like for him, it's like a moneymaker, but for me, it's not so

3404
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:08,920
Yeah, yeah

3405
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:11,880
Uh, that's how I feel about webtoon

3406
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:17,160
Next and and tapas next one is called billionaire man

3407
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:20,600
Uh, let's say vocaru link. So let me um

3408
03:13:21,640 --> 03:13:22,840
Get that

3409
03:13:22,840 --> 03:13:24,840
three two one go

3410
03:13:25,240 --> 03:13:30,280
billionaire man with briefcase walks down the street

3411
03:13:31,160 --> 03:13:34,520
He slips in a communist puddle

3412
03:13:35,320 --> 03:13:39,880
He drops briefcase all the money flitters out

3413
03:13:40,760 --> 03:13:43,160
He screams. Oh no

3414
03:13:43,960 --> 03:13:45,960
My billions

3415
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:48,120
Reduced to millions

3416
03:13:48,920 --> 03:13:52,840
He tries to grab up the money. He screams

3417
03:13:54,920 --> 03:14:00,920
He is so busy. He does not see little girl walking down the street

3418
03:14:01,720 --> 03:14:07,480
She slips in a communist puddle and falls into the street

3419
03:14:08,280 --> 03:14:11,960
A communist car is on the beat

3420
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:18,760
Save me billionaire man screams the girl, but he does not listen

3421
03:14:19,640 --> 03:14:29,000
I'm sorry. I cannot save you little girl. I am too busy saving money

3422
03:14:37,480 --> 03:14:39,480
It's so sad

3423
03:14:48,600 --> 03:14:53,240
Are you crying right now if only there was anything anyone could have done

3424
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:03,880
It's just I get it though, you know, he worked really hard for that money

3425
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:13,320
It's funny how like even with all of the voice stuff I can easily tell it's oblivion for

3426
03:15:14,360 --> 03:15:15,720
Yeah

3427
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:17,720
I know his voice too much

3428
03:15:18,680 --> 03:15:25,960
Yeah, I'm pretty bad at identifying voices, but I could you know, I feel like I don't think there was

3429
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:29,160
There's much attempt to hide it

3430
03:15:29,320 --> 03:15:33,240
But uh, I mean it was just gas. Oh oblivion fall you

3431
03:15:34,200 --> 03:15:36,600
I believe in fall you rascal check the next

3432
03:15:37,320 --> 03:15:42,760
Voice metal. I think it is a visual image of this this one we just listened to

3433
03:15:44,120 --> 03:15:45,640
Oh

3434
03:15:45,640 --> 03:15:47,640
All right, let's um

3435
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:50,360
Let's see about that

3436
03:15:51,640 --> 03:15:53,640
No

3437
03:15:54,360 --> 03:15:56,360
There's that me

3438
03:15:57,080 --> 03:16:01,480
It's I'm the I'm the communist car. You're in the communist car. Oh my god

3439
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:03,480
Ah

3440
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,240
What are all these trucks? I they just

3441
03:16:08,360 --> 03:16:12,520
I I mean I could imagine that it's a a reference to the truck punchline

3442
03:16:13,160 --> 03:16:15,640
from germa and star videos

3443
03:16:17,080 --> 03:16:19,080
But I have no idea about that

3444
03:16:19,160 --> 03:16:25,480
It's it's a thing where germa and star would play gta 4 and they would make videos star star is a

3445
03:16:26,200 --> 03:16:27,320
A

3446
03:16:27,320 --> 03:16:33,080
Like a video person funny gamer youtuber. They used to make tf2 stuff now. They stream a lot

3447
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:35,960
um, they do dnd stuff now, but like um

3448
03:16:36,760 --> 03:16:38,840
They had a truck punchline. He would spawn in

3449
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:43,800
So many trucks that it would crash the game or it would make things run really slow

3450
03:16:44,840 --> 03:16:48,280
And the the the joke wasn't that the trucks were funny

3451
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:53,400
It was that he would always ruin like a setup that germa was trying to do for a different joke

3452
03:16:53,800 --> 03:16:59,640
And then he would just like spawn in a bunch of trucks. It's like no not the fucking trunk the truck punchline again

3453
03:17:00,920 --> 03:17:04,280
You're always doing that. You're ruining this fucking video. No

3454
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:09,320
And I'm not sure I'm not sure if that's what this is. I can't really tell

3455
03:17:09,960 --> 03:17:12,600
I mean what why else is there trucks coming down?

3456
03:17:13,240 --> 03:17:18,440
I think maybe it's just because like there was one crash and then there was just like crash after crash after crash

3457
03:17:18,600 --> 03:17:24,200
It's like a bunch more trucks just come smash from the sky. I guess communist trucks from the communist sky

3458
03:17:25,160 --> 03:17:25,880
I

3459
03:17:25,880 --> 03:17:27,880
You're a woke sky

3460
03:17:28,280 --> 03:17:32,840
Under your wokes these communist trucks are your woke sky. They're they're delivering pronouns

3461
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:37,960
Nate seems to be having a good time tripping over all his money

3462
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:42,920
No, my billions reduced to millions

3463
03:17:43,560 --> 03:17:45,560
Sad it's a lot of billions

3464
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:49,160
That you're you're losing if it was reduced to millions

3465
03:17:50,680 --> 03:17:54,120
Yeah, it's almost that's almost all of it. Yeah, it's almost all of it

3466
03:17:55,240 --> 03:17:56,280
sad

3467
03:17:56,280 --> 03:17:58,920
Uh, unless you mean unless it was like reduced from

3468
03:17:59,640 --> 03:18:02,840
2 billion to like 900 million

3469
03:18:04,360 --> 03:18:06,840
It's possible. It's technically possible within the

3470
03:18:08,440 --> 03:18:10,200
definitions we've

3471
03:18:10,280 --> 03:18:15,400
Received next one is called should I from sorry it's long at pcp.drugs

3472
03:18:16,520 --> 03:18:20,280
Uh, let me just get that downloading. Okay, three two one go

3473
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:29,800
Hello, Ben. Hello Gib. Hello as someone who has known your names and uh

3474
03:18:31,320 --> 03:18:33,320
Just heard your voice

3475
03:18:33,800 --> 03:18:35,400
and

3476
03:18:35,400 --> 03:18:37,400
Somewhat know you through the video

3477
03:18:37,400 --> 03:18:39,400
this internet

3478
03:18:40,360 --> 03:18:42,360
Internet presence that you have proved for yourself

3479
03:18:44,360 --> 03:18:45,880
Should I

3480
03:18:45,880 --> 03:18:47,880
root for you

3481
03:18:48,120 --> 03:18:51,080
to gmi in the internet space

3482
03:18:51,880 --> 03:18:57,320
Or should I root for your downfall so you get real industry jobs?

3483
03:18:58,280 --> 03:19:00,280
and

3484
03:19:00,520 --> 03:19:02,520
Make bigger money

3485
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:04,600
in danger of your

3486
03:19:04,680 --> 03:19:06,680
potentially

3487
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:09,880
From what that we from what I gather somewhat

3488
03:19:10,520 --> 03:19:12,520
unsustainable lifestyle

3489
03:19:13,240 --> 03:19:15,720
That probably all kind of applies. I actually just

3490
03:19:17,720 --> 03:19:23,880
Should I should I should I hope for your internet career to succeed or should I should I just

3491
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:26,760
you know

3492
03:19:27,080 --> 03:19:29,080
Jill you

3493
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:30,920
So the question is

3494
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:32,600
Should he knows it?

3495
03:19:32,600 --> 03:19:34,600
Yeah, should he root for our

3496
03:19:35,080 --> 03:19:38,120
Downfall or for our internet career to succeed?

3497
03:19:39,080 --> 03:19:41,080
the downfall being like

3498
03:19:41,800 --> 03:19:44,760
Implying that if we lose our internet career

3499
03:19:45,560 --> 03:19:50,040
Then we'd be forced to get a real job which would give us more money

3500
03:19:50,840 --> 03:19:52,520
hypothetically

3501
03:19:52,520 --> 03:19:54,520
I mean, um

3502
03:19:54,920 --> 03:19:56,600
I'm not opposed to like a real job

3503
03:19:56,600 --> 03:20:01,720
But I wouldn't really want it to come on the heels of like well my internet career failed

3504
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:03,960
So I guess I better go

3505
03:20:04,600 --> 03:20:06,600
Bark up a new tree

3506
03:20:06,760 --> 03:20:11,160
I would maybe want to be I would maybe hope to be like well my internet career is doing

3507
03:20:11,640 --> 03:20:15,160
Okay, but like there are other avenues. I can maybe be pursuing

3508
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:17,960
at the same time

3509
03:20:17,960 --> 03:20:19,960
Including but not limited to

3510
03:20:20,200 --> 03:20:22,200
You know more traditional work

3511
03:20:22,760 --> 03:20:24,280
yeah, I

3512
03:20:24,280 --> 03:20:26,280
I feel like um

3513
03:20:26,920 --> 03:20:28,920
Personally

3514
03:20:29,240 --> 03:20:32,360
I don't really mind as long as I can sustain myself

3515
03:20:33,320 --> 03:20:36,840
Um like a bit like I don't need like a huge house

3516
03:20:38,200 --> 03:20:43,960
It'll be all right if I can get something like some some some building of my own, uh, but that's like

3517
03:20:45,880 --> 03:20:47,480
I don't know

3518
03:20:47,480 --> 03:20:49,160
I don't want to live

3519
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:52,840
Like a really boring life that I hate with a job that sucks

3520
03:20:54,200 --> 03:20:57,480
I'd rather be like a like a minorly

3521
03:20:57,880 --> 03:21:02,520
Successful artist online if it means that I get enough money to do what I like doing

3522
03:21:04,200 --> 03:21:10,200
Generally speaking obviously it's good to have money. Yeah, and it's good to be able to afford things, but like I wouldn't

3523
03:21:11,400 --> 03:21:13,400
I mean it's the reason I stuck with art

3524
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:16,040
so far is because

3525
03:21:16,280 --> 03:21:19,800
You know, it's not that good for making money. It actually sucks a lot

3526
03:21:20,680 --> 03:21:25,640
You have to be extremely lucky to be in the art field and be making it big

3527
03:21:26,360 --> 03:21:28,040
Making money

3528
03:21:28,040 --> 03:21:29,640
in the industry

3529
03:21:29,640 --> 03:21:34,360
It's not like I could guarantee that an industry job in the arts would be good for me

3530
03:21:35,320 --> 03:21:36,360
financially

3531
03:21:36,360 --> 03:21:39,720
Maybe just as bad and I'd be more upset

3532
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:42,360
so I don't know

3533
03:21:42,360 --> 03:21:46,200
Please don't root for my downfall. I'd rather be

3534
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
Having a encouragement

3535
03:21:49,720 --> 03:21:51,720
I'm assuming that this guy

3536
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:53,800
I'm I'm

3537
03:21:53,880 --> 03:21:56,680
Maybe I'm assuming too much, but I assume that this guy

3538
03:21:58,120 --> 03:22:05,800
Likes us and he and he's wants the best outcome for us and he is asking what is a better outcome success as an internet creator or a

3539
03:22:05,880 --> 03:22:07,880
failure that leads to

3540
03:22:07,880 --> 03:22:09,720
more traditional

3541
03:22:09,720 --> 03:22:11,720
employment, uh

3542
03:22:11,800 --> 03:22:13,800
I mean

3543
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:15,640
Yeah, I guess

3544
03:22:15,640 --> 03:22:20,360
I guess it's possible. It's it's conceivable that like someone attempts to

3545
03:22:21,320 --> 03:22:28,200
You know make a career online fails and then ends up finding more traditional employment in a in a field that is

3546
03:22:28,440 --> 03:22:30,680
You know, maybe ends up being better for them

3547
03:22:32,920 --> 03:22:36,280
Uh, that's possible. I mean, I guess I would say

3548
03:22:37,880 --> 03:22:39,640
viewer

3549
03:22:39,640 --> 03:22:42,920
That if you're hoping for the best outcome for us, I don't know like

3550
03:22:44,040 --> 03:22:46,120
What do I think is the best outcome for me?

3551
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:48,360
I mean, I mean

3552
03:22:48,440 --> 03:22:53,240
I guess what do you think is the best outcome or if you I mean if you think that I would do better

3553
03:22:54,040 --> 03:22:55,960
to quit the internet

3554
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:57,960
And and uh, you know get a job

3555
03:22:58,200 --> 03:23:01,880
Like if you think that would be a better outcome for me then you then I guess you should hope for that

3556
03:23:02,680 --> 03:23:04,680
If if what you want is the best outcome

3557
03:23:05,400 --> 03:23:07,400
But I mean, I don't necessarily think

3558
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:10,040
That's the case

3559
03:23:11,400 --> 03:23:13,400
So, I mean

3560
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:16,040
Yeah, you might disagree

3561
03:23:16,840 --> 03:23:20,120
Like I think the fact is that I know

3562
03:23:21,640 --> 03:23:23,640
With what I can do

3563
03:23:24,360 --> 03:23:26,360
And the opportunities I have

3564
03:23:26,760 --> 03:23:30,840
That I'm gonna be all right in the creative space. I'm not like

3565
03:23:32,440 --> 03:23:35,080
Like seconds away from starving to death

3566
03:23:35,800 --> 03:23:41,240
I I'm doing all right despite being so like small and insignificant

3567
03:23:42,120 --> 03:23:43,960
um

3568
03:23:43,960 --> 03:23:48,600
It it obviously isn't that but isn't that just the human condition though? Yeah, I yeah

3569
03:23:49,240 --> 03:23:53,080
Like with my skill set like I know that even if I lose

3570
03:23:53,480 --> 03:23:54,600
Uh

3571
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:58,520
All of the subscribers and patreon people I can build something

3572
03:23:59,240 --> 03:24:00,440
up

3573
03:24:00,440 --> 03:24:06,040
And like do some good work. I know how to make good videos. I'm a good writer. I'm a good artist

3574
03:24:06,600 --> 03:24:11,640
I can make enough with what I have I would I will I may never make it big

3575
03:24:12,200 --> 03:24:14,200
Um, but I don't need to really

3576
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:17,560
And so I feel comfortable. I guess

3577
03:24:18,360 --> 03:24:24,360
In the situation I'm in and I'm only gonna get better at the art that I do when I do more of it

3578
03:24:25,880 --> 03:24:30,680
So like I don't even know what a downfall would look like unless I don't enjoy doing these things anymore

3579
03:24:34,440 --> 03:24:37,400
Yeah, I mean I guess in this context a downfall is

3580
03:24:38,280 --> 03:24:40,280
Is

3581
03:24:40,680 --> 03:24:43,480
You suffer a precipitous decline in

3582
03:24:45,640 --> 03:24:47,640
A viewer's attention

3583
03:24:48,200 --> 03:24:50,200
Whatever patreon

3584
03:24:50,840 --> 03:24:52,840
revenue

3585
03:24:52,920 --> 03:24:54,120
Uh

3586
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:59,400
Like if if all of my if all of my savings are gone and I have to make money immediately

3587
03:25:00,440 --> 03:25:05,480
And uh, all of my subscribers are gone. I have no like it's probably a bad idea

3588
03:25:05,960 --> 03:25:09,320
To do that. I would have to get a little job to build up like

3589
03:25:10,040 --> 03:25:14,920
A a being a live fund so that I could maybe get back into it

3590
03:25:17,640 --> 03:25:24,520
Mm-hmm, like my skills don't deteriorate that quickly as long as I'm still enjoying it. It'll be easy to keep going

3591
03:25:27,880 --> 03:25:29,880
Um, you know, I guess I think

3592
03:25:30,840 --> 03:25:35,000
I feel like you know, I have a skill set I have some things that I'm good at

3593
03:25:35,720 --> 03:25:40,520
I get nervous sometimes. I don't know because I don't feel like I can I don't feel like I have

3594
03:25:41,560 --> 03:25:44,760
Can confidently say like oh, yeah, I'll be okay. Like I could get a job

3595
03:25:45,080 --> 03:25:48,040
Wherever I don't know if that's true. Well, I don't know I could get a job

3596
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:52,600
I'm saying I could make art and post it online and gain

3597
03:25:53,320 --> 03:25:57,320
followers again if I lose them all because I'm good at stuff

3598
03:25:58,520 --> 03:26:02,600
Honestly, I don't know. I think um, I think I've said this before

3599
03:26:02,600 --> 03:26:06,920
I think I might like to try at some point maybe in the not too distant future

3600
03:26:07,640 --> 03:26:09,640
to see if I can get some sort of like

3601
03:26:10,280 --> 03:26:13,160
work on like like more traditional work on some kind of

3602
03:26:13,960 --> 03:26:16,600
Some kind of team or studio or project or something

3603
03:26:17,240 --> 03:26:18,680
um

3604
03:26:18,680 --> 03:26:23,560
Just be part of like a creative team doing something. I think that would be pretty cool

3605
03:26:24,280 --> 03:26:26,280
I don't know what it would be

3606
03:26:26,280 --> 03:26:30,760
But I'm nervous and the thought makes me nervous because like what if I try to do that and it's just like

3607
03:26:31,400 --> 03:26:36,680
Well, you're just you're just a complete hack. Like you have no you have no skills. You have no skills. It could be

3608
03:26:38,120 --> 03:26:40,120
You you overestimate

3609
03:26:40,280 --> 03:26:44,120
What people in regular jobs have as skill levels

3610
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:49,880
But I don't want a regular job. I want a creative job. Well, I mean even regular creative jobs like people

3611
03:26:50,600 --> 03:26:55,960
My brother knows this because he went to uni for game development with a lot of people

3612
03:26:56,360 --> 03:27:02,120
Who are like dumb as shit and the only thing they're good at is talking themselves into business opportunities

3613
03:27:02,440 --> 03:27:05,160
They don't know how to code even though they purport to do that

3614
03:27:05,400 --> 03:27:09,320
They don't know that that like they have no creative bone in the body

3615
03:27:09,400 --> 03:27:16,680
But they're like a creative director for some studio and something is like they just walk their way in they talk their way in

3616
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:19,640
and they suck

3617
03:27:19,960 --> 03:27:21,960
You don't need unlike my brother

3618
03:27:22,680 --> 03:27:28,040
Charlie is like very very talented, but he didn't have that sort of social like

3619
03:27:28,680 --> 03:27:32,200
uh, yeah, I'm just gonna walk in like I own the place and so he's more

3620
03:27:33,080 --> 03:27:36,200
Stuck to like indie stuff rather than getting an industry job

3621
03:27:36,600 --> 03:27:38,600
which sucks because

3622
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:43,080
people in the industry need him because he's really talented but like

3623
03:27:44,360 --> 03:27:50,440
Being in the into it being in the industry doesn't mean that you're like necessarily good at anything

3624
03:27:51,400 --> 03:27:56,920
So you would have no problem with the skill set you have getting a job at a creative like

3625
03:27:57,720 --> 03:28:03,560
Industry profession thing because I mean it's it's it's not as like that's true

3626
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:08,200
It's not as like cutthroat everywhere as you may imagine

3627
03:28:10,040 --> 03:28:15,320
Yeah, well, I hope so. I don't know. Uh, I thought about it a lot. I still have no idea like

3628
03:28:16,280 --> 03:28:22,280
Uh, what I what uh, what that's actually gonna look like if I even try to try to do it. Uh,

3629
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:28,440
Uh, I just want to be part of a team. I want to be part of a club. I want to be part of a little

3630
03:28:29,400 --> 03:28:31,960
A little a little a little a little crew

3631
03:28:32,760 --> 03:28:38,600
You know, I'm not like rule. Yeah a little motley crew doing a doing work on a thing and

3632
03:28:39,480 --> 03:28:41,480
making a thing

3633
03:28:41,800 --> 03:28:43,800
That's the that's the dream

3634
03:28:44,360 --> 03:28:46,360
Um, but um

3635
03:28:48,120 --> 03:28:55,080
Okay, I think we've answered that question thoroughly. Yes, uh, next one is called king cringis bingis

3636
03:28:55,720 --> 03:28:58,600
viewer discretion advice three two one go

3637
03:28:59,320 --> 03:29:03,800
What's a pcb? It's a me cringis bingis the third version

3638
03:29:04,680 --> 03:29:09,400
Uh, uh this week I I watched the inside job

3639
03:29:10,040 --> 03:29:12,520
I banged it actually it was real good

3640
03:29:13,320 --> 03:29:19,880
I hope it doesn't get canceled. Uh, and I crinked at uh, Ben's videos

3641
03:29:20,680 --> 03:29:25,880
Kind of me meager viewership. No, I hope it gets better

3642
03:29:27,400 --> 03:29:29,400
By cringis bingis

3643
03:29:29,720 --> 03:29:31,240
sailing out

3644
03:29:31,240 --> 03:29:33,000
I I mean

3645
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:37,080
You sent this email yesterday. You sent this voicemail yesterday. I have like 18 by yesterday

3646
03:29:37,160 --> 03:29:39,880
I was hitting like I was hitting like 75 80k views

3647
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:44,680
It's not bad. That's not meager. That's not meager

3648
03:29:46,920 --> 03:29:52,600
It's it's doing a lot better than I thought it would like I feel I I definitely underestimated the mega man

3649
03:29:53,480 --> 03:29:55,480
fan clamoring for something like this

3650
03:29:56,440 --> 03:29:59,400
I did not I was not counting on it to be like

3651
03:30:00,440 --> 03:30:05,800
An immediate hit an immediately thing that people in the mega man fandom were talking about that is

3652
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:09,480
Something I hoped for but I didn't like expect

3653
03:30:10,600 --> 03:30:17,240
Uh, yeah, I I kind of expected that would like underperform compared to my previous videos because I didn't have

3654
03:30:17,800 --> 03:30:19,080
you know

3655
03:30:19,080 --> 03:30:20,200
uh

3656
03:30:20,200 --> 03:30:24,280
Because I didn't have like, you know dumb shits with a bunch of dumb shit followers

3657
03:30:25,160 --> 03:30:26,600
like Trixie to be like

3658
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:32,360
Duh, this thing is good and a bunch of morons go like I guess it's genius. It's genius

3659
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:39,080
Uh, I didn't have that. So, you know, I knew it was going to be a huge failure. Um, wrong. It's fine actually

3660
03:30:40,280 --> 03:30:44,280
Yeah, it's outperforming. I this is I mean, it's good. It's getting like it's

3661
03:30:44,840 --> 03:30:48,280
I mean, I don't know if this is going to continue, but it's getting about like 20k views a day

3662
03:30:49,160 --> 03:30:55,320
So does a view count if I come back to it like a day later to continue watching does that count as a second view?

3663
03:30:55,960 --> 03:30:57,960
I I don't

3664
03:30:58,280 --> 03:31:00,680
Think so. I'm actually not sure

3665
03:31:01,160 --> 03:31:07,800
I'm actually not sure about that because I know that you can watch a video multiple times and it counts as multiple views

3666
03:31:09,640 --> 03:31:11,320
But no, who does it?

3667
03:31:11,320 --> 03:31:15,240
Yeah, like but if you like but if you like it it saves your place and then you pick it back up

3668
03:31:15,240 --> 03:31:17,240
Does it count as multiple? I I'm not sure

3669
03:31:17,560 --> 03:31:21,480
Because I'm sure about that either like if I can it was a gangnam style

3670
03:31:21,880 --> 03:31:25,560
Just gets replayed and replayed and it became like the first billion view video

3671
03:31:26,840 --> 03:31:27,880
Right

3672
03:31:27,880 --> 03:31:29,400
it's not like

3673
03:31:29,400 --> 03:31:35,400
One billion people clicked on that link people have seen it. Yeah, even though I'm pretty sure billion people did hear it

3674
03:31:35,400 --> 03:31:41,400
But from like radio, but not personally they didn't personally go to youtube to listen to it. They just know about it

3675
03:31:42,360 --> 03:31:44,360
right um

3676
03:31:45,320 --> 03:31:47,320
Yeah, I don't I don't know

3677
03:31:47,480 --> 03:31:49,320
um, but I mean

3678
03:31:51,400 --> 03:31:53,000
Yeah, I told myself

3679
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:58,280
When I launched it I was like as long as as long as it doesn't get less than if it gets less than 100k

3680
03:31:59,080 --> 03:32:01,080
Then I'll be embarrassed. I'll consider it a failure

3681
03:32:02,200 --> 03:32:06,840
Uh, but it's like ever and now you're not allowed to be embarrassed about it

3682
03:32:07,560 --> 03:32:11,080
No, I feel okay. I mean, I mean, I'm embarrassed about embarrassed that I didn't draw the line

3683
03:32:11,720 --> 03:32:14,760
I'm embarrassed that everyone keeps saying oh, he's doing the tim rogers thing

3684
03:32:14,760 --> 03:32:17,880
Oh, oh, he's acting like tim rogers like no, I'm not not really

3685
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:23,320
Just because I did that gay little thing with my voice a couple of times doesn't mean that I'm tim roger

3686
03:32:24,840 --> 03:32:26,840
um

3687
03:32:27,400 --> 03:32:32,440
What else am I embarrassed what else am I embarrassed about um, I'm embarrassed about how my hair looks at many points

3688
03:32:34,120 --> 03:32:36,120
But that's that's fine

3689
03:32:37,400 --> 03:32:42,920
Oh, yeah, I forgot you shaved. I keep seeing the video of you talking about mega man. I'm like that's ben currently

3690
03:32:43,560 --> 03:32:45,560
But no no not anymore

3691
03:32:46,440 --> 03:32:49,320
That ben is dead that ben died before he even

3692
03:32:51,080 --> 03:32:53,080
Before he even got a chance

3693
03:32:53,080 --> 03:32:55,560
That get that that ben died before he even lived

3694
03:32:56,200 --> 03:33:00,680
That ben is like that ben is like the light of a distant star who's you know light from

3695
03:33:01,160 --> 03:33:03,720
From from millennia ago is only now

3696
03:33:04,360 --> 03:33:09,800
You know reaching the earth to be seen in our telescopes. It's it's exactly like that

3697
03:33:10,920 --> 03:33:12,760
um

3698
03:33:12,760 --> 03:33:14,760
But anyway the video is doing yeah, it is

3699
03:33:16,120 --> 03:33:18,120
When it when it started

3700
03:33:18,440 --> 03:33:25,000
It was doing better it it was doing not as well as the chris chan 102 because chris chan 102

3701
03:33:25,640 --> 03:33:31,240
Came out like right when chris chan was like making the news because like oh god the shit's gone down

3702
03:33:31,560 --> 03:33:36,280
Yeah, fucking sexual assault incest charges. She's going to jail like this is the most fucked up thing

3703
03:33:36,920 --> 03:33:43,880
Uh, so that was big so chris chan 102 got a big a big bump right at the start and then uh

3704
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:45,240
Uh

3705
03:33:45,240 --> 03:33:47,320
Kokoro wish had a pretty slow start

3706
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:53,880
But actually kokoro wish has actually had more sustained viewership and actually kokoro wish has more viewers now than

3707
03:33:54,440 --> 03:33:56,440
chris chan 102 did

3708
03:33:56,440 --> 03:34:00,040
Which is nice because I think that's a better light. It's my favorite lecture is the kokoro wish one

3709
03:34:00,840 --> 03:34:01,800
um

3710
03:34:01,800 --> 03:34:03,080
and then

3711
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:08,040
Yeah, this one was performing a little bit better than kokoro wish did on launch but worse than the um

3712
03:34:09,400 --> 03:34:11,400
uh

3713
03:34:11,400 --> 03:34:16,600
chris chan and I was like, okay, that's a good sign. It's definitely gonna it's definitely gonna hit 100k

3714
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:19,880
It's not gonna be a problem. You know, maybe in a month or two it'll hit 100k

3715
03:34:20,520 --> 03:34:25,560
And then it started to pick up around like day three and now it's a it's at almost 110

3716
03:34:27,400 --> 03:34:31,880
Because it just keeps it's getting like a thousand views an hour or something for the last couple days

3717
03:34:33,320 --> 03:34:35,480
So I think it might be starting to

3718
03:34:36,600 --> 03:34:40,280
Not like go down, but like it's not increasing as fast. So

3719
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:43,000
I think it might be starting to peak

3720
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:45,160
in terms of momentum

3721
03:34:45,160 --> 03:34:46,360
But we'll see

3722
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:50,200
Anyway, I'm very happy with it. It's it's definitely outperformed my expectations

3723
03:34:50,760 --> 03:34:52,760
um

3724
03:34:52,760 --> 03:34:57,480
I've gotten a few new patrons not like a huge deluge of them, but I mean I'm hoping that a lot more people will see it

3725
03:34:57,480 --> 03:34:59,480
And maybe some more will pledge so that's nice

3726
03:35:00,600 --> 03:35:05,160
If I can get if I can get the if I can get my goal of getting 100 patrons

3727
03:35:06,200 --> 03:35:07,720
that will be

3728
03:35:07,720 --> 03:35:13,320
I will not be quite at the pledge amount that I was back in like 2017 when my patreon was as highest

3729
03:35:13,320 --> 03:35:19,480
But it'll be like close that'll probably bring me to like 400 dollars a month, which is like close to what I was when I was

3730
03:35:20,360 --> 03:35:23,880
When I was uh peaking so that's my goal for the moment

3731
03:35:29,400 --> 03:35:32,520
Uh, yeah, okay next voicemail, uh

3732
03:35:33,400 --> 03:35:39,480
It's from prince isolation and it looks like it's two images

3733
03:35:40,200 --> 03:35:46,200
Is a voodoo in the voicemail as well. Oh, yeah, you're right. Let's listen to that. Okay, three two one go

3734
03:35:47,640 --> 03:35:50,520
How I predict finis comic will end

3735
03:35:51,560 --> 03:35:54,200
It's so emotional guys. I swear to god

3736
03:35:55,480 --> 03:35:57,480
It's so fucking

3737
03:35:57,640 --> 03:36:00,200
Oh the culmination of things

3738
03:36:03,240 --> 03:36:05,800
So it's the images is a view and me

3739
03:36:06,760 --> 03:36:08,760
and Vinnie's comic

3740
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:10,760
culmination of things

3741
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:16,520
culmination of things. Oh my god. I never wanted it to end like this Ben. I'm crying. I got my guitar

3742
03:36:17,400 --> 03:36:20,440
Oh, that's a princess princess such a good uh

3743
03:36:21,160 --> 03:36:22,040
artist

3744
03:36:22,040 --> 03:36:24,040
Yeah, a big old red man

3745
03:36:25,480 --> 03:36:29,960
Given the amazing red man stand if you need a music reference just call him big iron

3746
03:36:32,760 --> 03:36:38,600
Are the these are just single images, right? These aren't full albums. Yeah. Yeah, just a single. Okay, and it's you

3747
03:36:41,640 --> 03:36:43,640
What's what's been going on like this

3748
03:36:44,920 --> 03:36:48,440
You know, I never I never fat. Uh, hey, I'm sure you didn't

3749
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:57,560
So cool, why why am I crying about this and you're the one getting beaten up? Am I killing you? Why am I killing you?

3750
03:36:58,200 --> 03:36:59,800
I think we're fighting each other

3751
03:36:59,800 --> 03:37:03,000
I think the implication is that we have to fight each other. Oh, no

3752
03:37:03,880 --> 03:37:05,080
I got my

3753
03:37:05,080 --> 03:37:08,120
You knocked my tooth out and not your tooth out. Just like aqueous

3754
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,480
What the fuck? Why would you do that gib?

3755
03:37:12,520 --> 03:37:14,520
Well, I mean, what how could you do it?

3756
03:37:15,080 --> 03:37:20,760
I how could you do this to me? Why would you just hit you with my guitar really hard? That's how I could do it

3757
03:37:21,560 --> 03:37:24,280
Yeah, you know, actually that makes a lot of sense

3758
03:37:26,600 --> 03:37:28,840
That is how it would happen, isn't it?

3759
03:37:29,560 --> 03:37:31,160
Um

3760
03:37:31,160 --> 03:37:33,160
Uh, what was I was I saying?

3761
03:37:34,360 --> 03:37:41,400
Oh, I was saying I never found I tried to find the enemy sprites from clash of demon head because there were the little like red

3762
03:37:41,480 --> 03:37:44,760
Like red man faces walking around and I couldn't find them

3763
03:37:45,720 --> 03:37:51,800
No, I couldn't find no, I could not find enemy sprites from that game. I googled around looking at like sprite

3764
03:37:52,680 --> 03:37:55,000
Sheets and I didn't they might be out there somewhere

3765
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:59,160
But I wasn't able to find them eat very easily and I eventually I eventually gave up

3766
03:37:59,960 --> 03:38:01,960
I don't know

3767
03:38:02,040 --> 03:38:04,040
I guess it's just a funny game

3768
03:38:04,120 --> 03:38:09,800
It's just a funny little red little like little like smiley face little red oval man on little feet

3769
03:38:10,440 --> 03:38:12,440
It's like a little baby red man

3770
03:38:12,440 --> 03:38:15,000
Like he like butted off and do a little head that walks around

3771
03:38:16,520 --> 03:38:17,800
um

3772
03:38:17,800 --> 03:38:21,000
Oh the next one the next two I think are the same images

3773
03:38:21,800 --> 03:38:27,800
But it's like yeah at justincasehotmail.com. Oh, maybe he thought that they would get cut off. Yeah. Yeah

3774
03:38:28,760 --> 03:38:35,240
We saw and then the next next one is called btw's and it's also from prince isolation. Okay, three two one go

3775
03:38:36,040 --> 03:38:42,040
By the way, I just want to say I really do appreciate venice comics. I'm having so they're cool

3776
03:38:42,440 --> 03:38:44,440

I saw a funny at ben and that's sonic imgir album last week. Okay, three two one go

3789
03:39:34,200 --> 03:39:39,000
Yeah, I don't know if you know this one that imgir album with the vats of slime and sonic

3790
03:39:39,640 --> 03:39:43,320
There were links in the description of some of those images that

3791
03:39:44,040 --> 03:39:48,440
Of like different vats and there's some really funny and the very last one

3792
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:52,600
Um

3793
03:39:53,800 --> 03:39:55,560
A funny at ben

03:39:55,560 --> 03:39:59,640
I don't know what yeah, I don't really understand what he means, but um, all right. I'm scrolling back

3795
03:40:00,440 --> 03:40:01,560
Okay

3796
03:40:01,560 --> 03:40:03,640
Oh, yeah, I see there is a little there is a link

Here under the desert slime. There's a link to

3798
03:40:09,160 --> 03:40:12,760
Oh, wait, wait, we didn't see that slime in the sky

3799
03:40:15,400 --> 03:40:21,400
Oh, and then under that there's a link to cave slime vats

3800
03:40:24,440 --> 03:40:29,880
I mean, I remember my dream about the slime cave. Do you remember that episode where I talked about my slime cave dream?

3801
03:40:30,680 --> 03:40:32,120
No

3802
03:40:32,120 --> 03:40:33,720
He really don't

3803
03:40:33,800 --> 03:40:40,200
Didn't someone and there was a song and my dream had a song in it. Oh, I sang I forget what you talked about

3804
03:40:40,200 --> 03:40:42,840
But yeah, I remember there was a funny dream

3805
03:40:43,160 --> 03:40:48,440
I dreamed about being in a slime cave like a cave that just had slime in it with a bunch of like

3806
03:40:48,840 --> 03:40:54,600
People like villagers or just like random people from around and we were all like trying to solve puzzles together

3807
03:40:55,640 --> 03:40:57,640
Yeah, that's right

3808
03:40:57,720 --> 03:41:02,120
Oh, he says if you want it back ben saying you'll have to outspeed sonic the hedgehog with your wits

3809
03:41:02,520 --> 03:41:04,520
Until next time Sayonara

3810
03:41:04,920 --> 03:41:07,880
What sonic has fished around the scroll always holding a scroll

3811
03:41:10,280 --> 03:41:13,720
BS the pre-order gift is those brown glove and boots you can customize the way

3812
03:41:13,960 --> 03:41:17,960
What you wear the game has been playing and it's actually a good sonic game as far as the gameplay feels. Okay

3813
03:41:19,080 --> 03:41:23,080
So it's not like he he fished up the scroll got the Kawasaki scroll

3814
03:41:25,640 --> 03:41:30,200
Those those like black those leather boots do not suit him at all. No

3815
03:41:30,200 --> 03:41:34,840
No, no, but they they do suit like the photo realistic fish

3816
03:41:35,880 --> 03:41:37,880
That's fish. I don't see fish

3817
03:41:38,760 --> 03:41:43,320
Oh, well, haven't you seen the screenshots from sonic frontiers of him fishing up like photo realistic fish?

3818
03:41:44,120 --> 03:41:49,240
No, I yeah, that's just he fishes up fish that look like way too realistic

3819
03:41:50,360 --> 03:41:52,040
for him

3820
03:41:52,040 --> 03:41:55,080
Sonic's the name fish is my game. That's

3821
03:41:55,960 --> 03:41:57,480
true

3822
03:41:57,480 --> 03:41:58,440

3823
03:41:58,440 --> 03:42:03,880
Okay, I have the uh, I have the viny comic loaded now. All right viny comic

03:42:12,760 --> 03:42:14,760

Um, oh what no fucking I wasn't done

03:42:19,080 --> 03:42:20,840
She's turning into

3829
03:42:20,840 --> 03:42:23,480
Turning into water fizzling to nothingness

3830
03:42:24,040 --> 03:42:28,680

3833
03:42:37,720 --> 03:42:42,200
But I imagine give and take really just frenching vriska like back to the throat deep

3834
03:42:42,600 --> 03:42:45,560

3854
03:44:25,720 --> 03:44:31,560
Oh, I see you're crying. I'm crying herk. Good job defeating tron bond ben saint

3855
03:44:32,520 --> 03:44:39,240
Listen to me. You son of a bitch. You had that that risk of stan thing and if you told me sooner

3856
03:44:42,200 --> 03:44:44,040
To do battle oh

3857
03:44:44,040 --> 03:44:49,640
Told me sooner to do battle. I would have if I knew kissing her would have killed her. I

3858
03:44:50,520 --> 03:44:52,520
I'd have avoid

3859
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:59,160
Yeah, I think he's saying I have avoided I had avoided kissing her to kill her and I mean that's true

3860
03:44:59,880 --> 03:45:05,400
I'm very I'm very sad that she's died in me. Oh my god. What's happening now? Uh, and then

3861
03:45:06,360 --> 03:45:08,360
drops to knee

3862
03:45:08,840 --> 03:45:11,880
What mega man charging sound effect?

3863
03:45:13,080 --> 03:45:18,680
Am I doing a mega man charge slap on the ring? Do a mega man charge slap on the butt

3864
03:45:20,680 --> 03:45:24,920
Over over my knee is like like I'm I'm spanking here

3865
03:45:25,480 --> 03:45:31,480
That's like here to punish her for having brisket die immediately. I mean, this is true. This is what I would do

3866
03:45:32,520 --> 03:45:38,200
In response a reverberated slap and anime girl. Wow sound. You know the one

3867
03:45:39,800 --> 03:45:41,800
Falia defeated

3868
03:45:42,840 --> 03:45:45,960
So that your hand in the slap position. Oh, hey, yeah

3869
03:45:45,960 --> 03:45:51,160
So oblivion fall does this thing where he sends women at me to mess with me and this was just that again

3870
03:45:52,040 --> 03:45:55,560
Briska. Yeah, sorry Gib. Uh, maybe he'll send another one

3871
03:46:00,280 --> 03:46:06,040
The cinematic the PCP cinematic universe the the Vinnie the Vinnie PCP verse. I don't know how you would say it

3872
03:46:09,880 --> 03:46:15,640
It's just such an absurd concept of oblivion for sending women to mess with Ben St

3873
03:46:16,440 --> 03:46:18,440
And it happens often

3874
03:46:21,640 --> 03:46:27,080
Wait, wait, it's two. Oh my god. It's two already. It's time for me to take it's time for me to drink my coffee

3875
03:46:27,880 --> 03:46:30,440
It's time for me to drink more coffee. I'm I'm losing it

3876
03:46:32,200 --> 03:46:34,200
My mind

3877
03:46:35,960 --> 03:46:37,960
Okay, this is another page

3878
03:46:39,800 --> 03:46:41,320
Ben right

3879
03:46:41,320 --> 03:46:46,280
Yeah, if I see oblivion fall or another girl he sends I won't hold back on it

3880
03:46:47,560 --> 03:46:49,560
You held back. Jeez. All right

3881
03:46:50,120 --> 03:46:51,880
Let's go

3882
03:46:51,880 --> 03:46:54,200
Is he holding back? He's immediately just

3883
03:46:57,560 --> 03:47:02,360
Okay, so we're walking into the darkness. Look at you. You just look like pinkie pie

3884
03:47:03,320 --> 03:47:05,320
I do

3885
03:47:06,760 --> 03:47:09,800
I like the strides some good strides here

3886
03:47:11,320 --> 03:47:14,360
Enter the darkness of ben sains dwelling here

3887
03:47:14,920 --> 03:47:19,480
And here we are Casa de la Ben St. Yeah, that's what I call it

3888
03:47:20,600 --> 03:47:22,920
Your home is made of cardboard boxes

3889
03:47:23,640 --> 03:47:27,240
Yeah, uh, my landlord is a cheap ass instead of just ordering siding

3890
03:47:27,480 --> 03:47:31,800
She bought a handful of things on amazon just to keep the boxes and packaging for what you see here

3891
03:47:32,200 --> 03:47:34,200
She saved money this way

3892
03:47:34,360 --> 03:47:36,360
bizarre

3893
03:47:36,920 --> 03:47:38,200
Oh, no that

3894
03:47:38,200 --> 03:47:41,880
Upsets me because it reminds me that I got texted by my land x landlord yesterday

3895
03:47:41,960 --> 03:47:44,680
And she wants me to pay a bunch of fees that don't make any sense

3896
03:47:46,280 --> 03:47:47,880
I gotta fight her about it

3897
03:47:47,880 --> 03:47:52,440
But I'll worry about you to fight. She wants you to to to pay fees fees

3898
03:47:52,760 --> 03:47:57,560
She wants my fee fee. She wants me to pay two hundred and fifty dollars for damages that I didn't do

3899
03:47:57,800 --> 03:48:04,040
She wants me to pay a cleaning bill which seems like bullshit to me. That's that one's like debatable

3900
03:48:04,600 --> 03:48:09,080
and then uh, she wants me to pay five hundred dollars in late fees

3901
03:48:09,880 --> 03:48:11,880
for paying rent late which like

3902
03:48:12,440 --> 03:48:14,440
a late fee is not

3903
03:48:14,440 --> 03:48:19,800
Like an egregious thing like technically she's allowed to charge a late fee, but you can't charge that's like that's like half

3904
03:48:19,880 --> 03:48:23,160
That's like most of my rent and that's how that's that's outlandish

3905
03:48:23,880 --> 03:48:27,720
Um, so I don't know. Anyway, I have to fucking argue with her about that later

3906
03:48:28,360 --> 03:48:32,200
Now I'm now now i'm dreading looking at my phone because I know i'm gonna have a text back from her

3907
03:48:32,680 --> 03:48:34,680
Dang because I sent her messages telling her to

3908
03:48:35,560 --> 03:48:40,760
Fuck off with that shit and she's probably gonna send me a bunch of crap, but I'm not gonna think I'm not gonna think about it

3909
03:48:41,400 --> 03:48:42,520
I'm not

3910
03:48:42,520 --> 03:48:44,520
Going to think about it

3911
03:48:45,160 --> 03:48:47,160
um

3912
03:48:47,400 --> 03:48:51,240
Anyway, think about the comic instead. Yes last page

3913
03:48:52,360 --> 03:48:55,160
Hey there, this is my last stop of the day

3914
03:48:55,800 --> 03:48:59,640
I was waiting here for somebody to sign for this package

3915
03:49:00,600 --> 03:49:05,400
Oh wait first I said oh my fucking god. I'm a resident. Oh say us ups driver

3916
03:49:06,280 --> 03:49:07,320
Yeah

3917
03:49:07,320 --> 03:49:10,120
Great the package is for a bowling ball saint

3918
03:49:11,160 --> 03:49:16,280
It's been saint, but yeah, okay sign here on the electronic pad. Oh fucking k

3919
03:49:18,680 --> 03:49:21,480
It wasn't as cohesive as I'd like but the idea comes through well enough

3920
03:49:21,480 --> 03:49:25,400
I hope a delivery truck is waiting in the darkness and gives Ben yet another thing to deal with

3921
03:49:25,560 --> 03:49:27,960
I'm so sad to receive this bowling ball

3922
03:49:28,920 --> 03:49:31,720
What is this bowling ball for it's a just such a burden

3923
03:49:34,120 --> 03:49:37,400
Yeah, I'm sort of like looking sheepishly over your shoulder

3924
03:49:37,640 --> 03:49:39,160
uh

3925
03:49:39,160 --> 03:49:41,160
It's just like this is just like um

3926
03:49:43,240 --> 03:49:45,240
Just like in albuquerque

3927
03:49:45,640 --> 03:49:46,520
when

3928
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:51,720
Weird owl was in that plane crash and then he had to drag along his big leather suitcase in his garment bag

3929
03:49:52,280 --> 03:49:54,280
in his 12 pound bowling ball

3930
03:49:55,160 --> 03:49:59,080
And his lucky lucky autographed glow in the dark snorkel and I think I might have missed a thing on that list

3931
03:50:00,040 --> 03:50:01,560
But you get the idea

3932
03:50:01,560 --> 03:50:03,320
the bowling ball

3933
03:50:03,320 --> 03:50:05,320
um

3934
03:50:05,640 --> 03:50:10,360
Damn what will happen next tune in next time this is next time. This is really

3935
03:50:11,000 --> 03:50:18,440
Involved. This is really like like a big project. It's really involved. It's a big project and I it's just uh, it's remarkable

3936
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:25,800
I'd like how much it's grown. It's remarkable and it's commendable that there's more of these every single week. It's uh, it's crazy

3937
03:50:27,080 --> 03:50:30,760
Like the the scratchy is sort of like darkness around your house is so cool

3938
03:50:31,400 --> 03:50:33,400
Vinny, I think you should get

3939
03:50:34,040 --> 03:50:37,000
I think you should invest in like a drawing tablet of some kind

3940
03:50:37,080 --> 03:50:41,400
And I think you should try drawing digitally because I used to scribble stuff on like a notepad

3941
03:50:42,760 --> 03:50:44,760
And you know

3942
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:46,120
It sucked

3943
03:50:46,120 --> 03:50:47,160
uh

3944
03:50:47,160 --> 03:50:52,200
And I improved my my my pieces improved a lot when I just had a freaking

3945
03:50:53,080 --> 03:50:55,400
canvas in manga studio or whatever

3946
03:50:56,040 --> 03:50:58,040
To draw on and I had layers to work with

3947
03:50:58,920 --> 03:51:02,360
Uh, I think you should do that. I think you would not regret it

3948
03:51:04,280 --> 03:51:07,960
Uh, yeah, the the fucking the slap and then me just

3949
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:13,240
Sombrily with my hand in the position. It's just really funny. It's for some reason

3950
03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:16,200
In the next panel like so serious

3951
03:51:17,000 --> 03:51:19,000
Yeah, yeah the head down

3952
03:51:19,000 --> 03:51:21,000
eyes eyes shrouded

3953
03:51:21,400 --> 03:51:25,160
And I'm just walking just like oh, yeah. Yeah, you know this happens all the time

3954
03:51:25,800 --> 03:51:30,360
Wait, you have a guitar and I have a guitar on my back. I think it oh

3955
03:51:31,160 --> 03:51:33,160
Yeah, why do I have a guitar?

3956
03:51:34,680 --> 03:51:36,680
I'm holding a guitar

3957
03:51:37,000 --> 03:51:39,000
at the beginning

3958
03:51:39,640 --> 03:51:45,000
I think you did you just have two and you gave me one perhaps was one of them like a ukulele

3959
03:51:45,960 --> 03:51:52,200
Yeah, I think that's it. All right. All right next one is called uh, where was I?

3960
03:51:53,800 --> 03:51:59,080
Lingering mega man questions lingering mega man questions. Okay, three two one go

3961
03:51:59,960 --> 03:52:05,400
Now that ben's experienced all the relevant mega man games. I want to know who is your favorite boss character

3962
03:52:05,800 --> 03:52:09,880
What is your favorite music and what game overall is your favorite game?

3963
03:52:10,920 --> 03:52:14,440
For me, I like cyber peacock from mega man x4

3964
03:52:15,160 --> 03:52:22,760
I like the music from x's intro stage in mega man x4 and overall I like uh mega man x4

Yep, it's it's me the new fan favorite pcp voicemail character guy who likes mega man x4
