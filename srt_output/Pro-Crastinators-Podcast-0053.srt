00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,080
I'm the best guy ever, and we're all here for you.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,960
I love Bane, and I love memes.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
Hippocrit is here.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,480
I'm English, and I got fucking yellow taste, nigga.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,040
Digibro is here, finally, after such a long time.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,080
I really thought that I was going to be the person on here with the worst hygiene, and

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,680
then Ben Saint showed up.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,280
There it is, Ben, there it is.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm going to, yeah, no need to introduce me, Nate, I'm Ben Saint.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Oh yeah, your smell, your smell preceded you.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm Ben Saint.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm out of time.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,760
I am here to dispel any and all rumors to the effect that my hygiene is anything less

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,160
than impeccable.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,640
We're looking forward to that court case being settled down, okay.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Good luck.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
The Davoo.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
The Davoo is present.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,760
Hashtag sockless foot lives matter.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,240
Jesse would not agree, and Munchy wears tiny hats, that's all I need to know about him.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
What?

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
No!

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Oh my god!

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
No!

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Not the piss!

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Instantly!

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,040
Press one for Munchy's piss!

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
One, one, one, one!

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
He's running off of the stuff for us.

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Hey yeah, he's doing number one.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Well, yeah.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
That's right.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
That's right.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Wow.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Real synergy there.

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm honestly a little bit disappointed in myself.

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
That was not nearly enough.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
It wasn't a powerful stream.

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Yeah, it was kind of a normal piss as opposed to the like, the fucking intense, wildness.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
My fucking kill myself.

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
If I can't pee good, why is it, what am I good for?

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
You've run this meme into the ground.

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
That's right, it's all right.

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
It's all right.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,040
We're all desensitized to the sound of your piss so much that no one even got grossed out.

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Let's help the audience.

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Let's get some germics.

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Brought to you, PCP.

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Brought to you by Jermix.

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Brought to you by Jermup.

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,040
You guys know the show Monk, the obsessive compulsive detective from the early 2000s?

53
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Yeah, sure.

54
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
That show was sponsored by Clorox.

55
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
That was, was that really sponsored by Clorox?

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah, it was sponsored by Clorox, because fucking Monk always would like, use a wipe after,

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
before and after shaking anyone's hands.

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
So.

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,040
So much for journalistic integrity, am I right?

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Okay.

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,040
So much for the tolerant left, am I right?

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
That's what I was trying to say.

63
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
That's what I was trying to say.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Yeah.

65
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Anyway, we're talking about hygiene.

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Hygiene.

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
So I went to Urban Dictionary.

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Yeah.

69
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I told the definition.

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Hygiene.

71
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Hygiene.

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
I have a friend named Gene.

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
This show is dedicated to him.

74
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Urban Dictionary is the practice, to practice the art of cleanliness or to be clean.

75
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
So that's really boring.

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
What was that in Urban Dictionary words?

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't know.

78
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Just a normal dictionary word.

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Wait, hang on.

80
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
That's the top definition?

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Maybe there's a better one than the second.

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
The way that it's phrased is like a verb.

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay, wait, I got it.

84
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Okay.

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Here's the second definition.

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
That's like the second most popular.

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Hygiene.

88
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,040
The main factor in how close people are willing to stand next to you in any given situation.

89
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
That one I more agree with.

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I wouldn't be surprised if a way to, to greet someone named Gene is probably on the list.

91
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
I would, let's see how far down that is.

92
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
I happen to know it.

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
I get that joke in, in a fucking X-Men movie and I really like that.

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Really?

95
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
It's like one of the other ones.

96
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Gene Gray, Gene Gray or something.

97
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah.

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Hygiene.

99
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,040
I happen to know a quick and easy catchy guide to how to hygiene.

100
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Okay.

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,040
It goes, you gotta wash your ass if you must, you gotta brush your hair if you must, you

102
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,040
gotta brush your teeth if you must or else you'll be funky.

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Solid advice.

104
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Solid advice.

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
But I like funky.

106
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I, um, I, I also know a funky.

107
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Here's a, here's a thing I hate about the general concept of, of anything related to hygiene

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
is that funky is considered gross when it is actually my favorite type of music.

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
So fuck everyone.

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,040
But, but the Beatles, neither the Beatles nor Led Zeppelin are funk guys.

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Oh no, Led Zeppelin have some funky tunes.

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
You just gotta look.

113
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
I, I guess that's true.

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I feel similarly hippo.

115
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I mean, soupy balls is my favorite kind of music and it's always getting a bad rap.

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,040
By the way, I have, I have a second easy guide to remember the cleanliness thing.

117
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,040
And it was George Carlin's method, which is just never clean yourself ever.

118
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Just don't worry about it.

119
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
The only things you have to clean daily are asshole armpits, something in teeth.

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Fuck.

121
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
What is it?

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Balls.

123
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Gooch.

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Balls and teeth.

125
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Something like that.

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Yeah.

127
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
It's close enough.

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Asshole armpit, balls and teeth.

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Balls and teeth.

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Ah, no suck a little baby.

131
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Well, so we at the PCP are all like foremost experts on the subject of hygiene.

132
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Like if you were going to come to somebody for hygienic advice, we are definitely the

133
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,040
people you would come to.

134
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,440
So this is going to be the most informed, knowledgeable podcast in the world.

135
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,040
I thought it would be a bunch of blue pill, uh, libtard revolutionaries who are here

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,400
to change the game about hygiene standards and smash the hygiene patriarchy that's been

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
imposed on the world for so long and say, fuck that shit.

138
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
You don't need to be clean.

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,920
You just need to be a stink boy and embrace your odor and be, you know, as close to like

140
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Ben as possible.

141
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
That's, you know, the-

142
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
I hate you, Nate.

143
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I hate you.

144
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
I hate all of you.

145
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
You're all done.

146
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
You're all done.

147
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Ben, I really wonder what you were expecting when you decided to come onto the hygiene.

148
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,720
I expected to be treated as a human being.

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,920
Before we get started here, I need to mention, uh, we record PCP every week and last week's

150
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,120
recording ever since we decided that it was going to be hygiene, I have elected to not

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
change my clothes or do any hygienic process whatsoever.

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,240
Gonzo Hygiene Journalism, all right.

153
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,960
And I have to say, um, dear God.

154
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,440
Uh, Munchy, that's- I'm real glad that we have time.

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
The only words that could come out.

156
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
The only analysis.

157
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm so lucky.

158
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,440
We are real lucky to have a hardcore, deep-covered journalist like you out there in the field,

159
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Munchy.

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm getting the germs.

161
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Well, that's right.

162
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,160
What has been the reaction of people to you during this time?

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
Any difference?

164
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I've noticed anything?

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

166
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
It got kind of significant.

167
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,480
Like, after the first, like the second day, someone was like, you're wearing the same

168
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
shirt as yesterday.

169
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
I'm like, get used to it.

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,280
That sounds like a personal problem right, you shit.

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,440
And then after like the four or fifth day, people started noticing like the stink lines

172
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,160
coming off of me because I was in a loony town.

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Right, right.

174
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,160
And then recently, it's just gone, like very quickly, I realized like, even the minimal

175
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,240
hiding that I put myself through, it's still, like, I changed my clothes.

176
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,360
That ended up self is huge.

177
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,160
But now, like, my pants might as well have been peed in.

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,600
Like, they might as well have been just completely soaked in pee.

179
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,360
They might as well have been.

180
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,840
The amounts of driblets that build up over a week are not to, are substantial.

181
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,120
My balls are literally like a beef stew.

182
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Like they're literally like beef stew.

183
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Oh my God, that visual.

184
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,040
Oh my God, it's even funnier because I know exactly what he's talking about because I've

185
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
been there.

186
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,480
So, like, I know, I know what it feels like to have swamp ass.

187
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,200
Hey guys, show of hands, what is like the, your lowest point in terms of hygiene?

188
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,120
What's the longest you've ever gone without a shower?

189
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
And what happened?

190
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,920
Well, I'm going to have to change, I'm going to use a different definition than longest

191
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,240
time without a shower.

192
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:50,080
The low point of hygiene for me, I mean, pretty much my entire teens, but, like, because

193
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,760
I showered pretty infrequently and I had really long, nappy, shitty hair that I didn't, I

194
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
would never brush.

195
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,760
So, like, basically what my hair would do is it would just keep getting worse and worse

196
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:09,000
until it became such a horrible forest of tangles that I'd have to have my dad sit down

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,120
for like an hour and untangle my hair.

198
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,200
Like, like, like great apes.

199
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah.

200
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,440
Or like that scene in the Princess Diaries where that guy snaps off a fucking brush in

201
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,480
the princess's hair and has to, he's like, you're broke my brush, why would you do that?

202
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,760
Hey, Ben, you're a great ape because I like you.

203
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,840
I thank you, I thank you and I love you.

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,880
The first time I let my hair get out of control, I was 12 and it got to a point where, because

205
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,600
my idea was I would make dreadlocks because then I'd never have to brush it again.

206
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Good.

207
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,040
But making dreadlocks requires maintenance and effort and I put none of that in so it

208
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,080
just became a huge, like, fucking nest on my head.

209
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,400
And my grandma starts offering me $50 to get a haircut and I didn't take it because I wanted

210
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,760
her to give me $75 because there was, there was anime DVDs I wanted to buy so I decided

211
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,920
I would wait until she offered higher.

212
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,240
And then my dad came up to me and he said, look, I'll give you $100 to cut your hair

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,040
because you can't just bleed Mima out of all her fucking money because she was broke

214
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
at the time.

215
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I was like, sick.

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
You're a bastard, Digi.

217
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,680
He said, he said I'll never do this again though.

218
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,080
So I got my haircut, I got $100 and then I grew my hair out again and I started, you

219
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,840
know, essentially letting the same thing happen but now I knew I wasn't going to get any money.

220
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,080
I just was lazy but my dad would just sit there and untangle my hair for like hours

221
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
every couple of months when it got to a point where it was just like too much for anyone

222
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
to bear.

223
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Why didn't he just stealthily cut it?

224
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Yeah, I was going to say.

225
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,320
There was one time he did have to cut out, like he had to because it was just impossible

226
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,640
and he had to just cut off like a huge amount of it.

227
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,120
But that's not even the worst in terms of like hygiene, like that's aesthetically awful

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,880
but the worst that I got in terms of hygiene was, do you guys, are you familiar with Andrew

229
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
W.K.?

230
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I don't know.

231
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't know.

232
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Only with the name.

233
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,320
He's a musician and general personality.

234
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,880
You guys would probably know him for the fact that he did panels at Brony conventions because

235
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,440
of the fact that he became convinced he was a reincarnation of Pinkie Pie.

236
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Oh yeah.

237
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
That's true.

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Yes.

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
Because Andrew W.K. is obsessed with parties and his whole thing is that he just talks

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,160
about parties constantly and everything's a party and that's his life.

241
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,440
And so when Pinkie Pie came out then everyone was like, oh this is basically Andrew W.K.

242
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,600
When's the guy with that fucking album, the bloody face?

243
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,680
That's why there's the party hard shirt with Pinkie Pie bleeding out of her face which

244
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
is the cool shirt.

245
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Oh right.

246
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
It all makes sense.

247
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,800
Andrew W.K. writes all these different weird articles and columns on different places and

248
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,840
he had this one thing, I think it was even a YouTube video, like an analytical style

249
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,960
YouTube video before those were even everywhere, about how you don't need to wash your hair

250
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,320
because he was explaining that your scalp produces natural oils which shampoo are just

251
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,800
washing out of it.

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,720
And so if you allow your hair to start perpetuating its own oils then it will eventually be even

253
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
healthier than if you were putting shampoo in it.

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,640
Right, I remember a cracked article saying that when you shower it removes what is called

255
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,240
the horny layer for some reason and the horny layer does something to your immune system

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,360
that's good because we evolved to be apes that don't fucking have hygiene or civilization

257
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,760
or more than two people in a room at the time.

258
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,360
It's incompatible, fuck the horny layer.

259
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,360
True, but we also evolved to be a species that dies at 30.

260
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Yeah.

261
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
You know what I'm saying?

262
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
You know what I'm saying, bro?

263
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah.

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,200
So this article came out and there is some substance to it.

265
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,840
My brother Victor, he actually doesn't wash his hair anymore because everything that he

266
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,960
was using was just making it worse.

267
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,880
Every different kind of shampoo wasn't working and now that he has stopped his hair actually

268
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
has improved.

269
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,040
I tried to do this for probably a month and I have really, really bad dandruff and my

270
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,760
scalp became magma.

271
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
It got to a point.

272
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,560
There was no hard surface on the top of my head anymore.

273
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,400
It was all like a mushy layer.

274
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
The kill of the first flame.

275
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,720
I'm at that point right now, DJ.

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
You and me are fucking kindred.

277
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
You're dandruff boys, bro.

278
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,640
It's dandruff boys.

279
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,080
If I ran my hands through my hair, it would be like this mushy mashed potato-y surface

280
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,280
that would just have blood and shit in it.

281
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Jesus Christ.

282
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
God damn it.

283
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,600
You already fucking usurped my entire lowest point story, which was I went two weeks without

284
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,960
showering in the summer and whenever I scratched my leg, there was this gray goo that scraped

285
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,600
off of it that I thought could take over the world.

286
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,320
I think I was just going to leave because I don't like this stuff.

287
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
It wasn't nearly as bad as what you were describing.

288
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,680
Gray goo is definitely how I describe what was coming off of my head as well as like,

289
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,680
I mean, my head, the thing is, if I go like three days without showering, my dandruff

290
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
gets bad enough that I start scratching it and I start bleeding from my scalp.

291
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Fuck me.

292
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm pretty used to blood coming out of my head.

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What the fuck?

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,680
Even right now, if I scratch the back of my head, I can draw blood with relativism.

295
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Did you come to get that looked into?

296
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
I don't know if that's normal.

297
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Contrary to popular belief.

298
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
People always say, like people always talk about how like they joke that I never shower.

299
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
No, I actually shower.

300
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I mean, I don't shower every single day, like what some people, what normies do.

301
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,680
But I do have to shower every couple of days to prevent my scalp from turning into a fucking

302
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
volcanic crater.

303
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
So yeah.

304
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Yeah.

305
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,640
I mean, for me, it's like when my hair, when my hair gets long enough, like as my hair

306
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,600
was.

307
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Is he done?

308
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
He's done.

309
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
He is.

310
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,160
Yeah, my hair was like six plus inches up until a couple of weeks ago, up until a month

311
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
ago.

312
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,080
And like when it's that long, if it's been 37 hours since my last shower, it's like I'm

313
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,800
fucking like planting my face into like the sweaty ass of an athlete.

314
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,040
On the subject, on the subject of hair, here's, here's my thing.

315
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,320
If I go more than like maybe four days without showering, my hair gets pretty greasy.

316
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,400
And the thing, the thing that always strikes me about that experience is if, is if I go

317
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,680
out for a cigarette and I light it up and I'm thinking about what if an ember came off

318
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,280
and just landed on my hair.

319
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,920
And I wonder, and I wonder if the grease on my hair is, is enough and is the right kind

320
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,720
that it would just go up in flames.

321
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,000
And sometimes I'm pretty tempted to just tap my hair with the end of the cigarette just,

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
just to see what would happen.

323
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,200
But I like, but I like, but I like, but every time thus far, every time thus far I've walked

324
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
myself back from that precipice.

325
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I haven't jumped yet.

326
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,640
I haven't jumped yet.

327
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,960
You need to go full Lord of Cinder one of these days.

328
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,520
Did you, didn't you have someone light your hair on fire once in a while?

329
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,440
That would be, that would be the darkest timeline of the PCP is that one day my hair just goes

330
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,160
up and I'm just, and I look like that guy in the second, and I look like that guy in

331
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
the second season, and I look like that guy in the second half of Ghost in the Shell.

332
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Yeah.

333
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh right, that guy.

334
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
With a messed up face.

335
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,680
Two face.

336
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,920
One of us needs to link the flame, Ben, and I, I nominate you.

337
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Thanks, man.

338
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
The most ripe.

339
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,200
By the way, Ben, you and I, when we were young lads, we both had very long hair.

340
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Yes.

341
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,760
Just in contrast to Jesse.

342
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
And as I remember-

343
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,520
I feel like I was pretty good about washing it though.

344
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah.

345
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I think we both were.

346
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,760
And I remember spending a lot of time brushing it.

347
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,800
Ben and I both had hair roughly down to our waist in like high school just for various

348
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
reasons.

349
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Wow.

350
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,480
And I remember wanting to, I specifically was motivated by a depiction of one character

351
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
from the Wheel of Time series, which you might be familiar with.

352
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,920
The Rans like soldier guys, right?

353
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,080
It was one of the Rans like top dudes.

354
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,560
The ones that have the braids.

355
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
I forget.

356
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,040
Yeah, there was like some group of men who had long braids and they tied silver bells

357
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
to them.

358
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,800
And I always thought that was the coolest shit, but I wanted to do that, never got around

359
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
to it.

360
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
But it stuck in my mind to this day.

361
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,120
Maybe, maybe one day.

362
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Wait, wait.

363
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
No.

364
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
It wasn't his organization that had the braids.

365
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
It was some, one of the guys-

366
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
It was like some ethnicity.

367
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,800
One of the guys was just from some country where they did that.

368
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Yeah, that's right.

369
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,160
Guys, can we, can we just as an aside talk about how great it is having short hair as

370
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
opposed to-

371
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
So much better.

372
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Down to the ass hair.

373
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,720
I've decided I'm growing my hair a little long, not like crazy long, not down to my

374
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,000
waist long, but I'm going to let it, I'm going to let it get chaggy again.

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,680
Down to like, you know, the maybe shoulders in the back is fine.

376
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
But like-

377
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
Yeah.

378
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,160
God, having long hair is just such a fucking pain in the ass.

379
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Yeah, it's a nightmare.

380
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
It's a nightmare.

381
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,040
But first of all, clogs your shower all the time.

382
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Yeah.

383
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,440
Like every time I would have, any time I, a lot of the times when I cut my hair, it's

384
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,920
because my drain has started to get clogged and I go, well, that's a sign that it's time,

385
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
you know.

386
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Yep.

387
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,320
You have to start using conditioner so it costs extra, you know, because if you get out

388
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,880
of the shower after just shampoo, your hair becomes a fucking brick.

389
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,440
Yeah, it is an essential thing to have conditioner when you have long hair for sure.

390
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,120
If it gets past a certain point, you got to brush it every day or several times a day.

391
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,880
My friend, I had a friend named Mike, who fucking would brush, he had like hair past

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
his shoulders.

393
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,760
It was just the kind of hair that doesn't grow super long, even though he'd been growing

394
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
it for like five years.

395
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Yeah, sure.

396
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,320
But he would brush his hair constantly.

397
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,160
Like he had a brush on him at all times and he would just like, whatever he was sitting

398
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,080
around, he'd just start brushing at his hair, like maintaining it, making sure it's perfect.

399
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,760
Did you guys ever read stories about like old, old like lords and ladies of olden times?

400
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Yeah.

401
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
No, I'm talking about like medieval stuff.

402
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,600
There's always this image of giving your hair a hundred brush strokes every day.

403
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,000
Like Nineve from the Wheel of Time would do that shit with a very long brown hair every

404
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
day.

405
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Were you just like on a Wheel of Time?

406
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah.

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,160
The Wheel of Time, like the real historical account of lords and ladies.

408
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,440
Well, I'm willing to be credulous of the fact that old women used to, you know, women in

409
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
olden times brush their hair a hundred times.

410
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,720
That specific phrase I think is a Japanese thing though, the 100 strokes per day.

411
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah.

412
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Well, this one was, you know, with a bunch of people.

413
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,200
I just thought Sephiroth was really cool.

414
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Yeah, of course.

415
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
You were right.

416
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Oh my God.

417
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
You were right.

418
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Bindi Sephiroth, if Sephiroth was real.

419
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,560
I spent a lot of time thinking about dyeing my hair silver, but I never did.

420
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Dyeing your hair silver?

421
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Dyeing your hair silver?

422
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Yeah.

423
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
On the subject of having short hair.

424
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Yeah.

425
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
So did I, dude.

426
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
So did I.

427
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
On the subject of having short hair.

428
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,560
The hair I'm at right now is like, you know how like humans, like the one second at the

429
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,120
end of the immortal clock and the dinosaurs were at noon or whatever.

430
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,240
Like me having short hair and the length I'm at right now is that is like the one second

431
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,680
before midnight and like the bombs go off and in my log in my locker.

432
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
What does that mean?

433
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
What does that mean?

434
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,960
It means he needs a haircut in like a week, which is what he's trying to say.

435
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I see.

436
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,320
I have, I have needed a haircut immediately for like years at a time.

437
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,200
I for my entire life, like up until like maybe like a year ago.

438
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,120
I have had the most flowing of mains you shall ever see.

439
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,720
Even more main full than Davos.

440
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,440
Even more main for you see, not only was my hair long, but it was like a curly sort

441
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,640
of like jungle, like like like bonsai, like I'm like going to napalm myself.

442
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,120
What was the actual length because I want to know.

443
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,160
The actual length was down to like like like below my shoulder blades and like above kind

444
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
of.

445
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,600
So I'm the person who's had the short, I'm someone who's had a reputation of having

446
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,680
this, you know, big hair for being not female, allegedly.

447
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,320
But I actually have had the shortest, I have had the shortest hair record of anyone in

448
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
this call.

449
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not that your hair is, it's not that your hair is long.

450
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,920
It's that it is specifically big, that it flows outward as opposed to down and that's

451
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
what they would give.

452
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
That's kind of a majestic quality to me.

453
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,560
I wasn't fucking done anyway.

454
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,760
Up until recently, I've had, I've had like like long hair and it's been fucking awful

455
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
as did you could attest to now, now.

456
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,120
I've had mag, like I think I've specifically like intentionally inflicted myself with magma

457
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
brains.

458
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
What does that mean?

459
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Okay.

460
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,800
Did you use like weird like volcano brain?

461
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Oh, oh that.

462
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Okay.

463
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Okay.

464
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Okay.

465
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
So it went like this.

466
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,200
I've had bad dandruff because I would just, like I just wouldn't shout when I was a little

467
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,920
baby boy, which I still am when I was a little, when I was a lesser baby boy, I just wouldn't

468
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,400
shower because it was, I thought it was fucking gay.

469
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
And so.

470
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
It is, right.

471
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,800
I, I would have a ton of dandruff.

472
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,720
And so I've, like, like it was hard for me to like brush my hair because it was so curly.

473
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
Like I just, I just couldn't do it.

474
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,320
So I, I came up with a system where I would, you know, look at on combs, on the little

475
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,160
like points on the, on each points, there is sort of like a rounded sort of nub to,

476
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,480
to make it easier on your scalp.

477
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
So one day I cut off all of the nubs.

478
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
So it was a hard, rigid surface.

479
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
And then when I scraped my scalp, the dandruff would come off and leave a sort of resin,

480
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,880
like a gray sort of like goopy, disgusting, bloody mess on the end of the comb.

481
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,160
I know that feel, dude.

482
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,080
I know, I know about the gray goo.

483
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,520
I know about like dead skin coming off and kind of like, in like rolls a little bit.

484
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,360
But I've never, it's never been bloody.

485
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,560
It's never been bloody in my experience.

486
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,520
Are you ever concerned that if you just pushed on that gray mush too hard, you'd get white

487
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
to your brain?

488
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Yes, yes.

489
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Yes.

490
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,280
Sometimes, sometimes I do it, like sometimes I'm bad to do it, like, I'm just like, I

491
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,680
just want to reach and I just want, I just want to feel it, I just want to feel it.

492
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I just want to feel my brain.

493
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,280
Wait guys, is this, is this that thing where like, you know, you know how if you rub the

494
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,240
bottom of your foot, like the cells kind of ball up and the dead skin, you can just,

495
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,080
you can just rub your hands together.

496
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,000
You can just rub your hands together right now and you'll get a little bit of like gray

497
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
goo.

498
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

499
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,320
Not that much because I just showered because I'm a clean boy, goddammit.

500
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,680
I've been denied fruits of god for a week.

501
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,360
What are you talking about?

502
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,240
Oh, oh right, changing, being clean.

503
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,360
The shower he's probably going to take immediately after this.

504
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Exactly.

505
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
I am.

506
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,960
No, we want to hear from you again.

507
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Okay.

508
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Report in.

509
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
Right, I wasn't listening to most of that because it was gross and I fucking hate it.

510
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
You're the big beard boy, so we want to know about that situation.

511
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,520
Well, first I want to say that my hair was like DeVoo until like I decided to let it

512
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,640
keep growing and then it became heavy enough to pull it down and now if I shaved it off,

513
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm not sure that it would grow back like outwards, like big, like an afro, like it

514
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,800
used to be when I was younger.

515
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Yeah.

516
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,040
Yeah, when my hair gets passed like five inches, it becomes heavy enough to start being

517
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,600
pulled down, so then it just looks like a weird like upside down W. It looks like the

518
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
McDonald's symbol.

519
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
It looks terrible.

520
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,040
Yeah, so the longest my hair has been is actually in my give and take reviews.

521
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,600
It hasn't been before that that I had long hair.

522
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,520
I just sort of suddenly decided to have it and then based my whole YouTube icon iconography

523
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,040
around it and I'm scared to like change that at this point.

524
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,160
I don't know whether, but I have had like, like passing dreams of like, like not passing

525
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,320
dreams, but like fantasies of like, like just shaving it entirely off and then starting

526
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,880
fresh, being able to be bald for like a week.

527
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,560
In his flights of fancy, a give and dreams of being a bald boy for, for, I do too.

528
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,440
I was just going to say I want to see give and bald, but I feel like I have also thought

529
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,120
about shaving off my entire head like very frequently, but I feel like if I do that,

530
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,600
then my, the top part of my scalp would just melt down and I'll just become like a soup

531
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
head.

532
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,760
I'll be a soup head boy.

533
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,240
I suspect that give and bald will look like, uh, like a Walter White.

534
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Like yeah.

535
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Yeah.

536
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I see that.

537
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Oh my God.

538
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Yeah.

539
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Just be careful.

540
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Be careful how old you are when you do it.

541
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,840
I remember when a Stephen Colbert went to like the military for, to do shows there for

542
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,680
a week and he got his head shaved and it never grew back as full.

543
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Yeah.

544
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
And that was sad.

545
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,240
That's why I, uh, that's why I keep growing mine out because even though I don't like

546
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,080
having, like having long hair, I want to savor all the time that I can because a big part

547
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,600
of why I kept my hair long is that my parents encouraged it growing up because my mom thinks

548
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
long hair is cool.

549
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,920
And my dad was jealous because he started balding in like his late 20s, so he hasn't

550
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,160
had a long, he just can't grow it.

551
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,080
See what he was doing was he was raising three crops with, for which to harvest hair when

552
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
the time was right.

553
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Right.

554
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Yeah.

555
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,880
My dad is bald and I'm probably going to go bald as well.

556
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,160
I've actually started going bald a little bit at the top, like the forehead and it's

557
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
annoying me.

558
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Oh really?

559
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
It's annoying.

560
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
I have, I have fucking hair privileges.

561
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,920
All my uncles, like, like my hair descends from my mom's side and all the guys on my

562
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,820
mom's side have full heads of hair, no matter how old.

563
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,720
My grandpa is like in his mid 80s and his hair is becoming really thin through sheer

564
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,840
force of old, but it's still like he doesn't have any bald spots.

565
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
I'm like, yeah.

566
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Fuck it.

567
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
No guys.

568
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
Okay.

569
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Go on.

570
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Go on.

571
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Uh, but yeah, you're talking about beards.

572
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeah.

573
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,000
My, I think I have the largest, maybe aside from Ben, the largest beard growing capabilities

574
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
in this case.

575
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
My beard doesn't really get like big.

576
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,440
Like when I grew it long in like 2013 or 2014, it just kind of like, it just kind of grew

577
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,920
down and it would just kind of like, it would, I could just kind of like push it up against

578
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,400
my neck and it would just stay there.

579
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,920
Like it didn't get, it didn't get like big.

580
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
It got, I don't know.

581
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Has your beard gotten bigger?

582
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
There was like a happy medium of length there.

583
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Mine was at its biggest like a year and a half ago when I had that super long beard.

584
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,640
When you had that super, yeah, I don't think, I don't think it's been ever that big.

585
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,960
I think I've gotten close, but I shaved it away.

586
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,680
And recently I, you know, I shaved the bottom part of it and I had the mustache thing going.

587
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,360
One of my favorite things about give, well, it's just like, I really love that picture

588
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,980
that Jade Maraud drew of, you know, the one of you in the Ryuko costume with like the

589
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,900
hair goes all the way around as one like perfect circle of hair that has no separation

590
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,080
between like a beard and, you know, hair at the top of your head.

591
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,880
I really, really like that.

592
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Which one was that?

593
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,360
The way you described it was strange.

594
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,660
It was, it was the one with, it was posted with the DigiSnow picture.

595
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,960
It was that and then you and the Ryuko cosplay.

596
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,320
And then it's just your beard and hair were depicted so, so, main like in that.

597
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Yeah, unified.

598
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,960
So Nate, have you, have you ever experimented with facial hair?

599
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,920
Yeah, I can't grow it, dude.

600
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
I can't do it.

601
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I've tried.

602
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,240
I mean, but by tried, I mean I just not shaved.

603
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,740
Yeah, we don't need to do this too much.

604
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,740
I want to talk about the hygiene of a beard.

605
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Right, that's what I meant.

606
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Right, right.

607
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,940
When my beard got super long, it was definitely a hygienic nightmare because, A, everything

608
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,900
I ate got in my beard.

609
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Like everything.

610
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,940
And it just so happened that I was starting to go through a soup phase at the time.

611
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,060
So I would like, you know, like a little droplet of soup falls off of my spoon and it just

612
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,260
goes all the way trailing through the beard.

613
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm just imagining you taking a spoon to Munchie's head, eating that soup.

614
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Yeah!

615
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
You know?

616
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Just die.

617
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Just die.

618
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Stop it.

619
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,760
I won't, I am, I will, no way will anyone get me to edit this particular episode.

620
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,480
I would kill them.

621
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Even right now.

622
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
I'm on it.

623
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm on it, hippo.

624
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I'm on the cake.

625
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
All right, good.

626
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Please, please.

627
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Take this one.

628
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,280
Even right now my beard is long enough that like everything I eat, I have to have a napkin

629
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,240
with me because like I constantly, I feel weird with anything's on my face or hands.

630
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,180
I have to like constantly wipe stuff down, so I always have to have stuff on me.

631
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,420
And there was a point, when it was at the super long point, there was a time where, like,

632
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,980
I would legit just find shit in my beard.

633
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,820
Like, like twigs and stuff, like, I'd just be stroking my beard and there'd be like

634
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,500
a piece of tree that had fallen off when I was outside smoking or something, you know?

635
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,100
I do want to say like, shaving the chin only is, that's the main bit.

636
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,140
If you get rid of the chin, then nothing really falls into a beard.

637
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,040
If you just trim your mustache like it's so that it's like straight, then it's fine.

638
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,800
Like, when I had that, it was really good.

639
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:12,440
I've never had like a big beard before, as I am a greater baby, however I slam a baby.

640
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Right.

641
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
A greater baby.

642
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
I love that.

643
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,000
No, he's a dire baby.

644
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah.

645
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,880
I even started to shave my beard recently and I wanted to get it back.

646
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,940
However, even when I've had, like, at the height of my baby beard, I still, like, just

647
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,100
ever, ever so slightly, just the whisk, just a small, tiny little layer, I could feel,

648
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,540
I could feel the soup seeking out.

649
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
I could feel it.

650
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:52,260
I'll tell you right now, my beard drifts as bad as my head drifts and bleeds even

651
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
faster.

652
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
Oh, God.

653
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,740
Like, get this yourself.

654
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,320
I get some head dandruff if I go a while without sharing.

655
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,880
I don't, I don't get beard rift.

656
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,560
By the way, let me just say that I'm sitting right next to a full wall mirror and just seeing

657
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,000
the majesty that is my beard.

658
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
I look so fucking great.

659
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
I look so fucking great with a beard.

660
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
I agree.

661
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I agree.

662
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I can see it.

663
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,720
Ben, when I found out that you shaved it after Bronicon, I literally, like, sent you,

664
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,760
like, a few messages saying that I was legitimately mad at you, if you remember correctly.

665
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Yeah.

666
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Well, I have an interesting-

667
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,640
The funny thing is that Ben has spent the last six months trying to grow it back out,

668
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,140
but he habitually picks-

669
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Yeah.

670
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
This is-

671
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Yeah, this is the thing.

672
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm kind of embarrassed about it, but I was gonna mention it, is, yeah.

673
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,320
The whole time, I was like, I look so, I can't, I think, I don't know.

674
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,360
My face is not the worst, but it's not the best ever, either, in my opinion.

675
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,120
So the whole time, I didn't have a beard.

676
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,400
I was like, man, I wish I had the beard back, but yeah.

677
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,520
I have a nervous fucking thing where I will, like, pick my hair out and I would just pick

678
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,240
too hard and just make, like, a fucking hole in my beard, and then I would have to, I would

679
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,780
be like, I fucked it, and I would shave it and start again, and it took me months, it

680
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,820
took me months to fucking get that, to just hold off on that long enough for the beard

681
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,100
to take shape enough that I could have a little bit of leeway, and now if I pick a hair out

682
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,180
or two, like, it doesn't matter and you can't see it, um, but I'm back.

683
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,860
It's fucking back, baby.

684
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Yeah!

685
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Tea back!

686
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,340
Hashtag, max for five, tea back!

687
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Yes, yes.

688
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,900
Uh, I didn't really get to talk about my general showering and stuff.

689
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,360
There have been times when I have not showered because, you know, even though I hate this,

690
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,960
the stank, I can't ever smell my own, so, you know, it takes a long time for me to notice.

691
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
I-

692
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,520
Even though I know it's there, and I can't smell it, I just, like, have it.

693
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,920
I, well, here's, I can smell my own, but the thing is that I don't mind it, and sometimes

694
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,240
I kind of like it, so I'm a monster.

695
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
Ben, no, okay.

696
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,080
I definitely mind my own.

697
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,660
BenSaint is definitely, if you know Ben in person, you will know his scent.

698
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Fuck you, buddy.

699
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,660
Hey, you know what, guys?

700
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,980
Ben, it's the primary weapon of a homeless warrior, like, Ben, what else can you do?

701
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,660
We can't not bring this up, because your scent is so specific in particular, and it's

702
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,220
because your whole room, like, it gets to a point where when you open the door to Ben's

703
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,780
room, it just kind of, like, billows out onto you, like, you immediately are hit with his

704
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
nose.

705
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
We have to talk about Ben's peanut shells.

706
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,780
We have to talk about Ben's peanut shells.

707
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,960
We can not fucking go to Pugas without being about Ben's peanut shells, we can.

708
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,800
Yeah, that's, that was, I had just really been enjoying some peanuts that week.

709
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,800
They were all over you like a cracker baler.

710
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,920
Well, they don't, they're not gonna, they're not gonna attract ants, they don't have sugar

711
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
in them, whatever.

712
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
I'll just, I'll sweep them up later.

713
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,420
You go, you go to a fancy country restaurant, a barbecue place, they have sawdust all over

714
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
the floor.

715
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
It's the same thing, same idea.

716
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,700
I'm dragging on Ben's hygiene, but it's not necessarily complaining, because I was actually

717
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,420
kind of excited when I, when Ben moved in and I realized that his hygiene was as bad

718
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
if that worked.

719
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
The standards are going so far down, you're in the career now.

720
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,500
He was like, it was exciting to know that my new roommate wasn't going to get on my

721
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,420
case about my hygiene, you know, that like, that we were kind of stank buddies together.

722
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
Yeah.

723
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Oh my God, a new variant of the spicy bro pack, the stank buddies.

724
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
We have to fucking be stank buddies.

725
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,820
I want to be fair though, like, I mean, the first couple months it was like, everything

726
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,420
he did you was describing was true, but I feel like the last couple of months, it seemed

727
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,420
like Ben wasn't, seemed like he may have been taking showers more often, maybe because

728
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,080
we were, I was trying to not make fun of him about it, but then one time I said, he smells

729
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,420
like a 3D armpit, which I didn't think would be offensive, but that's, that's a really

730
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,920
terrible thing to say.

731
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Whoa.

732
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Here's, here's, here's what I'll say.

733
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,420
Here's, I just want to make this one statement in my own defense.

734
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Okay.

735
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
You guys know me.

736
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,420
You guys know me from living at your house and never leaving.

737
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
And you know, I love you, I love you boys.

738
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Mwah.

739
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,920
But, but I don't feel any need to impress you.

740
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,920
So yeah, when I, when I, when I never leave the house and I never leave my room, yeah,

741
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,420
my hygiene is pretty bad.

742
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,420
When I go out, generally I shower and I fucking make sure I smell okay.

743
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,920
Not a hundred percent of the time.

744
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,920
There have been times when I've been like, well, I fucking, I let the day get past me

745
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
and it didn't shower.

746
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Fuck it.

747
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,420
And I go out smelling like, smelling like, like, like a scrapbook of farts.

748
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,920
But, but, but most of the time I go out.

749
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,420
You nonetheless concede that you do only wear like two pairs of pants in three shirts that

750
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,420
you don't wash very often.

751
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,920
Six shirts, but yes.

752
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,420
What would you say the longest you've ever gone wearing the same pair of pants was?

753
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
Is it six months?

754
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,420
I've definitely been wearing those fucking shorts for at least a month.

755
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Oh yeah.

756
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Yeah.

757
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
I would, I would grant you a month.

758
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
Do you mean underpants?

759
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
No.

760
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
No.

761
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
No, like actual pants.

762
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Have you seen his, his orange?

763
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
American pants.

764
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,920
His like yellow and orange, uh, like long baggy shorts.

765
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Yeah.

766
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Slums that look like starbursts.

767
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,420
What do you call short pants in England?

768
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
Shorts?

769
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
Okay.

770
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
But not trousers.

771
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,920
But you also call underwear shorts, right?

772
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
No.

773
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Underwear is pants.

774
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Those are pants.

775
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Okay.

776
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Yeah.

777
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Well anyway.

778
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Yeah.

779
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Rouses.

780
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,420
What the wrong trousers?

781
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,420
It's not a little bit of cheese, sir.

782
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,180
Well, Ben has this pair of shorts that goes like past the knees and they're these like

783
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,920
acid, yellow, uh, orange.

784
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,420
Oh, I've seen those all the time.

785
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Yeah.

786
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,920
And he will wear them for literally a month at a time.

787
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Well, that shorts aren't like, you know, they're just touching your legs.

788
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,420
Legs themselves don't get too...

789
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
I don't know, man.

790
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
My shit.

791
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,920
I know people that have worn the same pair of jeans for a year and never washed them.

792
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
And it's fine.

793
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
You're a fellow homeless people, Ben.

794
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:40,420
I have to change my clothes, like, every couple of days because they legitimately get filthy.

795
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,920
Like, I get my clothes really dirty.

796
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,420
Well, because I constantly wipe shit on them and, uh, like, just drop stuff.

797
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,420
Like, I'm a messy eater and I eat all the time, so I'm constantly dripping shit on my fucking pants.

798
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:59,420
Uh, you know, uh, don't clean up your jizz well enough and you got a jizz stain on your pants.

799
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
Yeah.

800
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Yeah, you know, admittedly, like, despite everything you said about Ben, like, nothing that he's done has ever, like, been in my way,

801
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,920
slightly that's, like, causing me some amount of discomfort.

802
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
But didgy jizzing just gets all over the place.

803
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,420
There's a couple of times where didgy's breath in the car became, like, unavoidably felt like I was smelling an asshole.

804
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,920
And I don't know why.

805
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
I don't...

806
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
He's just eating something disgusting.

807
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Like an asshole.

808
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Hold on.

809
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Let's go to mouth because I have a lot to say about mouth when I think...

810
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

811
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
I wanted to say...

812
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Yeah, hippo, hippo, go ahead.

813
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Well, I was gonna ask, like, because, you know, what was the longest...

814
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,420
I will say mine, but what was the longest people have gone without changing their underpants?

815
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,420
Because I think I've gone a whole week when I was just...

816
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
I've probably gone a week, yeah.

817
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,420
I think four days is probably my maximum.

818
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,420
Sometimes I put on the same ones I was wearing just because they don't get that...

819
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,420
My underwear don't get as dirty as the rest of my fucking clothes.

820
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,920
It gets to a point where it's like, I wonder how much worse this place can become.

821
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
You're just wondering.

822
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
I would say the smell doesn't get necessarily worse.

823
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
It's just, like, the feeling.

824
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,920
There is a definite end to that, like, downward bell curve where it basically makes no difference.

825
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
It just levels off.

826
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
It just levels off, yeah.

827
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
You might as well just keep going.

828
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,920
You asymptotically approach zero hygiene and then you just stay there.

829
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,420
My understanding is that a lot of women just wear the same bra for basically indefinitely

830
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
because nothing really gets all that sweaty there.

831
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
That's bullshit.

832
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,420
I don't believe that for one fucking second.

833
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
I've heard that.

834
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,420
You can basically go weeks without changing your bra because it's like...

835
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,420
Ladies, we're going to need you to weigh in on that in the comments down below.

836
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
I'll tell you, man, what made me learn...

837
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I see some women in the comments, I'm going to kill myself.

838
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,420
What made me learn to appreciate...

839
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,420
Women don't have breasts.

840
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,420
Never bring that up again.

841
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Okay, I'm sorry.

842
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,420
What made me learn to appreciate showering, like, because as a teenager, I just didn't

843
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,420
do it at all.

844
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:58,120
I would go to anime conventions, like, three days of nonstop heat and people moving and

845
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,420
being in cramped rooms and stuff, and I just wouldn't shower because I just felt like I

846
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
didn't have time.

847
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,420
Everybody else can do it, but I can fucking muscle through this because I'm a...

848
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
I don't know.

849
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,920
I have a weird pride in being able to do that.

850
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,920
But then there was one year where I got a violent case of swamp ass where it was just

851
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,920
like all of the sweat coming from my ass hair had made it just rub my ass raw.

852
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,420
My ass was burning red, and my thighs were burning red, and just everything was swampy

853
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,420
and shitty, and it was like, that was when I learned that, yes, at a convention, you

854
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,920
need to fucking shower in the middle of the day.

855
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,420
Hang on for one sec.

856
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,920
I just heard someone loudly vaping.

857
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I believe that we just have discussed the vaping etiquette on this show.

858
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
God damn it.

859
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Please calm your shit down.

860
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
I set my audio thresholds that it wouldn't pick up.

861
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Fuck.

862
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
You're vaping.

863
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
Pretty fucking clearly.

864
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Yes, man.

865
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
We get it.

866
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
You vape.

867
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Let's move on with our lives.

868
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Can you hear this?

869
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Yeah.

870
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Clear as day.

871
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,420
The fucking icon, the audio icon's off.

872
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,920
You shouldn't be able to hear it.

873
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
This is bullshit.

874
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,420
Imagine if it shows up for us, it'll still be in the audio recording on Audacity.

875
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
That's true.

876
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420
The audience can suck it up.

877
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,420
Fuck the audience.

878
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,420
So one time, I think I was probably 11.

879
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,420
I was just like, I think previously, the previous year, just the previous summer, I just,

880
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
my butt sweated so often, and it was so uncomfortable.

881
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,420
That's actually not sweat, that's called poop.

882
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
There's a difference.

883
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,420
Well, that was a kid.

884
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,420
I couldn't deal with being hot or being sweaty.

885
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
It would just bug the shit out of me.

886
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,920
One year, I just thought, I'm not going to wear underwear this summer.

887
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Okay.

888
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
And there were pros and cons to that.

889
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,920
I don't remember exactly the nature of it, but I remember concluding, this is ultimately

890
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
better somehow.

891
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,920
I guess because my ass is being aired out more.

892
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Because when I had underwear the previous summer, I would just put, rub the back of

893
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,920
my butt crack and to shove the underwear in there so that it feels like there's a cork

894
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
going on.

895
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Yeah, I do this.

896
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,420
It doesn't feel like it's like, like, like, you know, sweat that's clamily moving back

897
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
and forth.

898
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,420
You put a cork in your butthole?

899
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
No, not an actual cork.

900
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Just shove your underwear up into your ass crack to avoid shaving.

901
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,420
I do, I do often, I do, well, walking around, I do, I do get thigh chafed sometimes, and

903
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,420
I'll, and I'll scooch, and I'll scooch my underwear up between the thighs.

904
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Yeah, I do that all the time.

905
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,420
I wear, I wear very soft, I wear very soft, very soft silky.

906
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
No, no, no, no.

907
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
You guys need to work on your thigh gap.

908
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
I've never done it for chafing.

909
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I believe you mean chafing means like it eventually starts to, like, hurt because of, you know,

910
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
I've never been fat enough for that.

911
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
It's just that it's uncomfortable.

912
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,920
It just feels clammy.

913
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
That happens whenever I go to Disneyland.

914
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
My thighs get super chafy.

915
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,920
I can't tell what's a joke about Disneyland and what's serious.

916
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,920
I get chafing not from my legs rubbing together, but from them rubbing against my gigantic

917
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
balls, and that's what causes it.

918
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,420
You just got to lubricate.

919
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,420
You just got to lubricate with some well-placed piss and just lubricate between the thighs.

920
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,420
My brother Shade has never worn underwear in his life.

921
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
What?

922
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,420
The fuck?

923
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,420
He has been free-balling for 20 years.

924
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,420
Holy shit.

925
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
That's cool.

926
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,920
He just decided as a little kid that he hated underwear and refused to wear it and has continued

927
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
to refuse.

928
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,420
I don't know if he wears it now that he's at work.

929
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,420
I don't know if that's harder to wear a uniform.

930
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
I mean, they're not going to force him to, you know?

931
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,920
The greatest fucking fear is that I'll either piss my pants or I'll come across like a dime

932
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,420
bridge and he'll be like, I forgot my pants.

933
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,420
I'm going to a job interview.

934
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,920
You need to give me your pants.

935
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
I'm sorry.

936
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
You'll see my beanie, sir.

937
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
I can't.

938
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
I can't give it to you.

939
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,920
It's the worst fear I could ever fucking have.

940
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,420
I get free-ball because of the kinds of pants I wear, because all of mine have just the

941
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,920
one button holding the print together.

942
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,920
And so, I mean, I sometimes have to be underwearless because I'm like doing laundry or something.

943
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,920
And my dick, I have to just like rearrange my pants and wear a big shirt so my dick doesn't

944
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
just fly out that hole.

945
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Not to brag or anything.

946
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Not to brag or anything, but I can't free-ball because my fucking bold is just too pronounced.

947
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
It's just-

948
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
You know, my brother-

949
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
I need some-

950
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,920
You have a pretty pronounced bold.

951
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
I do.

952
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
I do.

953
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
It's true.

954
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,420
I need the tightness of the underwear to like tamp it down a little, just so it's not completely

955
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
obscene.

956
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,920
Yeah.

957
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,920
When my brother was like fat, when he was chubby, he developed a special technique for

958
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,920
the amusement of others where he would stand up, lift up his right leg, and then like shake

959
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,920
his leg to where the fat on his leg would smack his balls and make him kill over, and

960
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,420
he would do it every time and it was super fun.

961
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,420
It was a very specific like martial art move, and it was really funny.

962
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
What the-

963
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
What?

964
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Ball kata.

965
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,420
Okay.

966
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I want to transition us from-

967
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
To female.

968
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,920
To teeth, and here's how I'm going to do so.

969
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Because one of the reasons I have to change my shirts is that my version of quote-unquote

970
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,920
brushing your teeth is that when I wake up and my teeth feel a little fuzzy, usually just

971
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,920
the front six on the top, I just take my shirt and I rub it against my teeth.

972
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Holy shit.

973
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Why don't you just brush your teeth like a human being?

974
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Alright, I'm done.

975
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,420
It's literally a sin.

976
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,420
It's literally a sin.

977
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Did you redo, right?

978
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Yes.

979
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Use like a tissue, at least.

980
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,420
I've done this, I use tissues, I throw them away, I don't have-

981
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,420
Tissues will get up and they'll dissolve and get all on your teeth though.

982
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,420
Yeah, that's why you fold it once so that it doesn't.

983
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,420
I don't know about that.

984
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,420
I just have the inside of my shirt.

985
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Did you secretly do an experiment or a towel?

986
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,420
Did you secretly part of an experiment to have the world's worst possible teeth and

987
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,920
everything he does feeds into it?

988
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,920
We both went to the dentist the last month, but he forgot the appointment just long enough

989
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,920
to where I could go to the dentist, but he had to reschedule for later.

990
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm not super scrupulous about brushing my teeth.

991
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I fail to brush my teeth sometimes, but when I do, when I do, I am so intense about it.

992
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,920
I get all my teeth and then I brush the roof of my mouth and the tongue and I fucking gag

993
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,420
myself on the brush because I'm like, I gotta get it all.

994
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,420
I gotta get all the surfaces, all the surfaces need to be clean.

995
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Yeah, that's not how it works.

996
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I've brushed my teeth maybe 15 times in the last 15 years.

997
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Whoa, alright.

998
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I have a little yarn to weave.

999
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I have a little yarn to weave.

1000
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,420
When I was a lesser baby, I truly, truly loved to brush my teeth.

1001
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
It was the greatest pastime I could possibly have.

1002
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,920
I had the fucking toothbrush that would play sick jams such as We Are the Kids of the Nation

1003
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
whenever I brush my teeth.

1004
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,920
Yeah, the singing toothbrush.

1005
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Sick, dude.

1006
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
What are you talking about?

1007
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
You had a musical toothbrush?

1008
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Yeah, it's like you press a button and it just starts playing a song and you're meant to brush

1009
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,920
for the length of the song, so it teaches kids how long they should brush for.

1010
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
Whoa, that's cool.

1011
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
That's a very mid-2000s thing.

1012
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I would walk into my dentist's office and I would slap her ass and I would say,

1013
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,420
Doc, how's my teeth?

1014
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,420
And she'd be like, oh boy, you did a good job.

1015
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,420
And I'd be like, sick.

1016
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,420
And then I started watching a little man, a little boy, that I had to get my inspective

1017
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420
monoclonal.

1018
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,420
I would have to inspect him and he would say, did you bro?

1019
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,420
And he was like, are you talking about something like making a fan thick or something about

1020
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,420
pink probably brushing your teeth or something?

1021
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,420
Oh yeah.

1022
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,420
And then I was like, you know, maybe brushing your teeth isn't cool.

1023
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,420
And I stopped brushing my teeth.

1024
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,920
So my fan thick that was meant to teach kids how much they should brush their teeth taught

1025
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
you to stop.

1026
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
Yeah.

1027
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,720
I assume, Digi, I know about that fan thick and I assume that you wrote that because

1028
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,420
you had at some point learned the value of brushing your teeth and wanted to impart

1029
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
it to others.

1030
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,920
So no, it's meant to be a don't be like me fan thick.

1031
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Digi, it's not too late.

1032
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
You can change.

1033
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
I don't think so.

1034
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,420
Half his teeth are gone now.

1035
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,920
That's not even true.

1036
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,420
Well, here's the thing.

1037
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,420
By the time I was like 11 and I was brushing my teeth as a kid, just not well.

1038
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,420
I was doing it like once a day when I got up for school and never on weekends.

1039
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,420
But I drank soda constantly for most of my life.

1040
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,420
So by the time I was 11, I already had like 10 fillings.

1041
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,420
Like I was already just constantly getting cavities.

1042
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,420
And then there was a period of like four years where I just like didn't brush, didn't go

1043
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,420
to the dentist at all because we had just been changing houses so often that I didn't

1044
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,920
have like a assigned dentist.

1045
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,920
And I was convinced when I was like 14 that.

1046
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Oh, I remember this.

1047
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Holy shit.

1048
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,920
I forgot about this.

1049
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,920
If I didn't brush my teeth, I would eventually build up an immunity.

1050
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:53,920
I thought I would be the beginning of a new stage of human evolution where like the stuff

1051
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,920
that would build up would eventually protect me from the other stuff or something.

1052
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,420
And you would pass it on to your children?

1053
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
Yeah.

1054
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,620
So I just thought like because you know how like everything else on your body works that

1055
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,620
way.

1056
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,620
Like, you know, you rip your muscle and it grows back stronger.

1057
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,620
So I thought.

1058
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,620
Not if you break your bones.

1059
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,620
Let's just get weaker.

1060
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,620
Yeah.

1061
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,620
What about, uh, she's, she's, uh, what's his name?

1062
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,620
Fuck you.

1063
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,920
His bones kept coming back stronger and he's a real person.

1064
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,920
He's not an animal character.

1065
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
Yeah, he's a real, real man.

1066
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,420
DG Browns is going to break his bones.

1067
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,420
So yeah.

1068
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,020
So and then I was drinking Mountain Dew for like 10 years.

1069
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,020
So I ended up with.

1070
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,120
That helped.

1071
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,220
I'm sure I probably have like green teeth.

1072
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,520
I probably have like 20 to 25 fillings in total.

1073
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
And then I quit drinking Mountain Dew.

1074
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,120
I gotta have at least a dozen.

1075
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,320
I finally stopped getting nearly as many cavities once I stopped drinking soda regularly.

1076
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,520
Like once I switched to green tea, I've gone years without them.

1077
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,020
Uh, like, like, like, I don't mean I have gone consistent years without them.

1078
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,520
I mean, there have been years where I didn't have a cavity as opposed to every year I have

1079
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
three.

1080
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,020
Um, so yeah, I do have really fillings and bumps in my mouth.

1081
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,020
What really bums me out about cavities and fillings is that like at some point, like

1082
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:10,220
I got fillings throughout my life, but at some point they started giving me the white ones

1083
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,220
and those are great.

1084
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,520
But like the early ones, the ones I got early in my youth are the shitty black metal ones.

1085
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,520
Yeah, I've got a lot of those.

1086
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,520
Yeah.

1087
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,520
And I had like my back molars have these disgusting black fillings and like they're normal because

1088
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,020
like my, my dad had them.

1089
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,520
So like they seem normal to me, but I think about like to a person that doesn't have cavities,

1090
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,520
it must look fucking horrible and I feel so self-conscious about it sometimes.

1091
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,520
Who the fuck is looking at the inside of your mouth?

1092
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,520
My lover.

1093
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
She's your age.

1094
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,520
Uh, like, I mean, I, all of mine, maybe I don't feel self-conscious about that because

1095
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
they're all on the inside of the teeth.

1096
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Like none of them are on the front or anything.

1097
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
But yeah, I have a ton.

1098
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
The smiling is what counts if you ask me.

1099
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,020
Even though I've been, I, I, I am, I do have gross teeth and they're all like yellow and

1100
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,020
like if I can just, I just touch it like real quick like uh, uh, uh, oh that's, it's fucking,

1101
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,520
it's about to fall out.

1102
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,020
If I just pull, I just feel like if I just pull it a little bit, it'll fall out and

1103
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,020
they're awful teeth and my, my breath could inspire racial riots.

1104
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,020
It's that bad.

1105
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,020
The thing about, the thing about getting into brushing your teeth.

1106
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,020
Fuck up.

1107
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,020
Thank you.

1108
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,020
Are you finishing your point?

1109
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,020
All right.

1110
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,020
No, I wasn't.

1111
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,020
But I am happy to report.

1112
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,520
That through, for my, all my years, I've only had one cavity, even though I literally

1113
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,520
never brushed my teeth and I drink soda every day of my fucking life.

1114
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Wow.

1115
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
You don't have to get there.

1116
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Give it time.

1117
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
My teeth are just perfect.

1118
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,520
Um, I remember, and I, I, I'm the kind of person who will take all kinds of selective,

1119
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
uh, uh, encouragement.

1120
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Like one time when I was like 15, I was listening to this radio show and this guy was calling

1121
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,520
in about how he was like 23 and he'd already lost all his teeth.

1122
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Um, but and he had like dentures, but he was talking about how the ladies love it when

1123
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
he goes down on them.

1124
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,020
Cause he could just pop out his teeth and just.

1125
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,020
Oh my fucking god.

1126
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,020
You see, you see folks, there's a silver loud cloud by every lining.

1127
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,020
Yeah.

1128
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,020
Yeah.

1129
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,520
Um, but like the worst thing about trying to get into brushing my teeth like is that

1130
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,020
it is really painful cause my gums can't handle it.

1131
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,020
So I just bleed profusely if I brush my teeth.

1132
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,020
Yeah.

1133
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,020
You gotta keep it up.

1134
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,020
You gotta keep it up.

1135
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,020
It's constant.

1136
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
And flossing sucks.

1137
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,520
Uh, as an English man, I would stereotypically have the worst teeth here, but I think, I

1138
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,520
think it's, it's a combination of, cause I don't brush my teeth as much.

1139
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,520
I mean, I've been trying to recently, like every day I've been like morning and night,

1140
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
morning and night.

1141
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,520
It's actually been working and the, the first few days it was bleeding and now it's not

1142
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,520
bleeding.

1143
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,520
So I guess, you know, just keep doing it.

1144
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,520
But yeah.

1145
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Um, I think it's a combination of, of the fact that I've never, ever liked soda in any

1146
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
form is disgusting.

1147
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,020
And I don't have a sweet tooth the same way that other people do.

1148
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,020
I don't even.

1149
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,020
And I've just been lucky in that, but I still, I think I have like six or seven feelings

1150
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,320
I think, but it's, you know, I, I, I think my teeth, and they're not crooked.

1151
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,100
I've never needed braces.

1152
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,100
So I'm lucky.

1153
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,820
Why, why is the amount of brushing I don't do, they would, they would have been far worse

1154
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,220
if I ate like the wrong stuff.

1155
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,220
Yeah.

1156
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,460
But why is it that, that English men are known for their bad teeth?

1157
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,100
Is it just that your culture doesn't care as much or?

1158
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,000
I think, um, part of it is probably, yeah, that I think I've explained this somewhere

1159
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,680
before, but it's the, the idea that people who get on British TV, they don't need to

1160
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,320
have perfect teeth to, you know, to be allowed on.

1161
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,720
So people get this, this, uh, this idea that all British people are like, I remember when

1162
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,320
a really, I think, I think it's, I remember a cracked article saying that like, well,

1163
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,440
they did some studies and British people actually have the best teeth in terms of not having

1164
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,360
fillings and, but, but, but they're not great in terms of being white.

1165
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,060
Like that culture doesn't care as much about yellow teeth.

1166
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,420
So they're presenting themselves grossly, but they're actually really good at tooth

1167
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,420
maintenance.

1168
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,420
Well, that's the thing.

1169
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,860
The thing is that it's not that it's actually gross to have discolored teeth.

1170
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,420
It's just that our, like, we just have grown in obsession with the idea that teeth should

1171
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,300
be white because it's more aesthetic.

1172
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,660
I feel like culturally America really adopted and got into the idea of orthodontia and braces

1173
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,040
to like, like, or they were early adopters of that idea.

1174
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,800
Cause when I went to Poland, a bunch of the adults that I worked with had like braces

1175
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,560
and it was because like the idea of getting braces to fix your teeth was like not a thing

1176
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,100
for their parents, but like they grew up and were like, yeah, I'd like to get some braces

1177
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,240
and fix my teeth, but it was like a newer thing to them.

1178
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,440
Incidentally, my mom got braces when she was like 48 and that's when she finally got her

1179
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,680
teeth corrected.

1180
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,500
My mom had braces like right up until like right before I was born actually in her mid-30s.

1181
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,020
See, the reason I don't care, like people have constantly, like my parents are always

1182
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,860
asking me like, are you sure you don't want braces?

1183
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,860
Are you sure?

1184
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,660
Cause I have, you know, fucked up misaligned teeth and I was just like, have you like literally

1185
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,180
everyone I've ever known who has braces, those are like the most miserable years of

1186
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,020
their entire life because not only do braces look fucking hideous, like they are the worst

1187
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Normal braces look totally fine.

1188
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,320
It's only when you get like head-to-head or like the weird shit, like I had some weird

1189
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,520
shit in my mouth for a while now.

1190
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,520
Braces are the most aesthetically unappealing thing I've ever seen.

1191
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,880
No, they're just, I mean, maybe I'm crazy, but when I was a kid, seeing people with braces

1192
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,520
was just normal, like just like half the people I knew had braces, it wasn't weird.

1193
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Yeah, it's normal, it's just all so gross and shitty.

1194
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,440
And entirely because of American TV shows, I associate braces with young teenage girls

1195
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,520
and that means I like them.

1196
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:40,520
I find braces hideous and disgusting and also they make it so there's like all kinds of shit

1197
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,020
you can't eat while you've got braces, there's like you have to maintenance them or else

1198
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,020
they don't even work.

1199
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:51,020
You know what, Shade had braces for like two and a half years and they didn't even fucking

1200
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,020
work properly because he maintenance them so badly it didn't take care of them that

1201
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,020
now he's got other teeth issues.

1202
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Keep crying about braces but here's the deal, you put in the effort, you take the time,

1203
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,520
you make the sacrifices necessary, you reap the rewards, whatever they may be, they're

1204
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
purely aesthetic, they're just aesthetic.

1205
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,520
The reward is that you have to wear a retainer every night for the rest of your fucking life.

1206
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,520
No, you don't.

1207
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
Hold on, hold on.

1208
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,520
If you want it to say perfect, you do.

1209
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
They tell you that, too.

1210
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,520
I wear my, okay, here's the thing, I do wear my, all right, you guys have been dancing,

1211
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,520
you've been dancing with my date, this entire podcast.

1212
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Me too.

1213
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
It's not for me to take the reins over, okay?

1214
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Because you guys are a bunch of fucking pansies.

1215
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,020
But you're not ready to step up to the plate to be men and deal with this hygiene thing

1216
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:36,020
because I would say that I definitely have the best hygiene of anyone in the PCP.

1217
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,020
For sure.

1218
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,020
Because I am on top of this shit.

1219
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,020
No one would question that.

1220
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
I am dedicated.

1221
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
I don't know, I'm not convinced.

1222
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,020
Fucking state your case, bitch.

1223
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:48,520
Okay, well first of all, I am dedicated to personal betterment and in a physical sense

1224
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,020
and that I'm certain that I have the best routine when it comes to that shit.

1225
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,020
And I would argue that is an extension of that.

1226
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,020
But every single day, I brush my teeth twice a day.

1227
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
I floss once a day, every single night.

1228
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,520
I do not, I shower every other day at least, generally every single day.

1229
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:08,020
But I'll, the one thing I do that is slightly unhygienic is that I go,

1230
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,020
and it's because of my fucking clothing system.

1231
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,020
Okay, every day, every week I do my clothes once, one time.

1232
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,020
I do all my laundry.

1233
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,520
And I don't have many gym clothes.

1234
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,020
So I end up wearing the same gym clothes every day for one full week.

1235
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,520
And I do not smell good at the end of that week.

1236
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
Yeah, it's not good, it's not good.

1237
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,520
What a disaster.

1238
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
Are you getting off the topic of teeth here?

1239
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:35,520
Who could bear to be around someone who gets sweaty and smelly in the gym?

1240
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Yeah, it's a nightmare.

1241
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,020
But I don't know, other than that, I'm perfect.

1242
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,020
That's what I'm trying to say, I'm the best person in the world.

1243
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,020
The thing that I've always wrestled with as a teenager,

1244
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,520
because I had acne and all that stuff,

1245
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,520
and it's like, you have to suddenly really pay attention to how you wash yourself.

1246
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,520
Because before, as a kid, you're always clean, kind of.

1247
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,520
But then suddenly there's grease coming out of you, and you're like,

1248
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,520
I don't know what to do.

1249
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:09,520
And I've always had this, like, I know I can be clean, and I know it's better to be clean.

1250
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,020
Yeah, I don't care what the fuck that was, Ben.

1251
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,520
Excuse me.

1252
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Sorry.

1253
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
What's happening?

1254
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,520
God damn it, what the fuck was anyone talking about?

1255
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:28,520
I was gonna say, there's always been this, like, the cool kids were the ones that were well kept.

1256
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
Right, right.

1257
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:38,520
It felt like, you know, if you weren't popular, there's no reason to be well kept.

1258
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,520
Did it ever occur to you that maybe that well keeping of oneself is what makes them popular?

1259
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
No, no, no, no, this is my point.

1260
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,520
I knew deep down that I had to do all these things.

1261
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,520
I was just lazy, and it was just me trying to come to terms with the fact that I was so lazy,

1262
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,520
and this is the root of all my real problems, is that sometimes I stink a bit,

1263
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:03,520
and sometimes my breath probably is a little bad, and that, you know, I was never gross in public, obviously.

1264
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,520
I developed something of a reputation amongst my friends, not in high school, but after high school,

1265
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,520
of, like, taking long to get ready for things, because I wouldn't want to do anything until I had, like,

1266
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
perfectly prepared myself.

1267
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:22,520
See, that right there is the epitome of everything that I find, that is why I don't do hygiene,

1268
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,520
because it's just, it's in the way.

1269
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,520
It is in the way, that's true.

1270
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,520
It's in the way of everything else, and, like, the idea of it is that it'll make the experience better, right?

1271
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
Like, if you're feeling...

1272
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,520
Socially, yes.

1273
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
It'll make the experience of you better for others.

1274
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Well, yeah, which can make the experience better.

1275
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,520
I mean, if you don't smell, that also helps you.

1276
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
You don't want to smell yourself.

1277
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,520
You want to feel confident that other people like the way you look, you know?

1278
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,520
Yeah.

1279
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,520
And so it does benefit you.

1280
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,520
Right, right.

1281
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:55,520
But at the same time, the amount of preparation that there is in everything to create this...

1282
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
It's really, it's a lifestyle, is what it is.

1283
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:04,520
It creates this perfect version of you that, like, you know, that maybe will be, will just have a better time in general.

1284
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,520
But for me, it's like, I want to be able to just hit the ground running in everything I do.

1285
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,520
Like, I'm the type of guy who, when I wake up in the morning, I jump out of bed and I get right on the computer

1286
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,520
and I continue what I was doing the night before.

1287
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,520
There's no, there's no moment where I have to, like, wake up, get ready to start the day,

1288
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,520
take a shower, brush my teeth, do all that shit.

1289
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,520
There's no, like, preparation.

1290
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,520
Like, if I want to go out, it's because I'm hungry and I'm gonna go.

1291
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,520
I'm not gonna sit around and do all this other shit.

1292
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,520
Which is why I have such a difficult time brushing my teeth.

1293
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,520
Because, like, my dentist is always like, why don't you just, you know, find, like,

1294
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,520
maybe every time you take a shower or something, it's like, yeah, but I take a shower at completely random times

1295
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,520
because I've decided I smell too bad to deal with myself.

1296
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,520
Like, it's not something I do with this, this, like, preparation formula that I think a lot of people have.

1297
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,520
I just, to me, it's not worth the effort because I don't feel like the...

1298
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,520
I mean, I totally appreciate the gains you get from it.

1299
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,520
Like, I do, sometimes, I take a shower, I put on, like, some well-fitting clothes,

1300
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,520
and I go out into the world and I feel more confident than usual.

1301
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:13,520
And I'm like, yeah, okay, this is a cool feeling, but it's not worth the effort to have that all the time.

1302
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,520
If I think I smell, but, like, I, you know, on the one hand, mind over matter,

1303
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,520
and, like, it's just a confidence thing, whatever.

1304
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,520
But, like, if I go out and I know that, like, I'm unkempt and I smell weird,

1305
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,520
I definitely act different and I am, like, shy and I don't want to talk to anyone.

1306
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
I will be more sheepish.

1307
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Keep myself at arm's length from everyone.

1308
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,520
Particularly if I'm, like, really disgusting and wearing the bathrobe and, like, flip flops or something,

1309
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,520
then I'm, like, I will be more, like, yeah, I don't deserve to talk to these people.

1310
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,520
You know, I do have good hygiene.

1311
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,520
Hang on, I have good hygiene, but I have been known to just wear my pajamas,

1312
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:56,520
throw on my bathrobe and my fucking beanie, and just bomb down the road in my fucking minivan.

1313
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,520
See, here's what I do.

1314
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,520
KFC to pick me up some fucking golden nuggets.

1315
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,520
When it comes to, like, cleaning shit and maintaining myself as a person,

1316
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,520
I just kind of weave it naturally into, like, like, like compulsions I get.

1317
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,520
I try to, like, reprogram my own compulsions, right?

1318
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,520
There's so many times when you have to be doing a thing, like, editing a video,

1319
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,520
and you're like, you just want to come up with something to do to distract you,

1320
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,520
like, I'm going to go out and, you know, either send them in a roll or I'm going to go...

1321
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,520
I set that moment where I realized that, like, the time that DeVue is on this podcast

1322
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,520
is taking away from time he could be editing my video right now.

1323
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,520
Oh, fuck off.

1324
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,520
Yeah, yeah.

1325
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
We're in a time crunch, as always.

1326
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,520
Yes, so, uh, fucking...

1327
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,520
Life is a time crunch.

1328
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,520
All I did was I just convinced myself that brushing, flossing, and mouth-washing my teeth

1329
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,520
is one of the many things I can do to, like, put something off for five more minutes,

1330
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
or to think about something.

1331
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
You know what's a key for me?

1332
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
Fucking don't take my earbuds out ever.

1333
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,520
There was one fateful day when I realized I just have my earbuds in all the time when I'm at work,

1334
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,520
the whole time when I'm asleep, I'm going to go brush my teeth with my earbuds in.

1335
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,520
My brother saw me in the bathroom, burst out laughing.

1336
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,520
I don't give a shit.

1337
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,520
I never take my earbuds out.

1338
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,520
I'm hearing about the history of Nazi Germany for the third time this year,

1339
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,520
and I'm going to fucking do it while brushing my teeth, while cooking food,

1340
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,520
and I also have a shower speaker that's waterproof, and you can Bluetooth it to your phone.

1341
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,520
So anything where, like, I want to hear someone's voice.

1342
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,520
I want to, like, hear someone vaguely talking about something,

1343
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,520
but I don't want to necessarily hear exactly what they're saying because I can't hear it.

1344
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,520
I just put on one of Digi's vlogs, and then you go take a shower that way.

1345
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,520
Speaking.

1346
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
And so that way I never get bored.

1347
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,520
That way I can never, as long as I'm listening to something, I can always just keep going forever.

1348
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:46,520
I'm very much into, like, to mood-crafting, and so if I'm going to, like,

1349
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:52,520
if I'm going to go, like, shave or something, I'll throw on some, like, loud masculine music, you know?

1350
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
Yeah.

1351
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Like, when I shave, you know, I throw off my shirt.

1352
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,520
I'm, like, you know, getting all ready.

1353
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,520
I've got all the shaving stuff around, and it's like, yeah, this is a man's time.

1354
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,520
I need some abrasive masculine-sounding shit, you know?

1355
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,520
Speaking of crafting your own, like, habits, DeVoo.

1356
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,520
Okay, so I have a number of weird, like, nervous compulsions and ticks and stuff.

1357
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,520
And I have tried in the past to stop some of them.

1358
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,520
But what always inevitably happens is that if I manage to stop one, something else pops up to replace it.

1359
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,520
And, like, I have a rotation of them that I sometimes go through.

1360
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,520
And, like, specifically I'm thinking of biting my nails.

1361
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,520
I've always bit my nails, like, right down to the quick, all the time, my whole life.

1362
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,520
And one time I was like, I'm not going to do that.

1363
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:42,520
But what ended up happening is that I stopped biting my nails, but I started compulsively clipping them all the time.

1364
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,520
And it was just as bad. And, in fact, it was way less convenient.

1365
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:54,520
And I have, yeah, like, I have the hair-pulling thing, and I have another thing where I do where I'll, like, twitch my, like, abdominal muscles sometimes.

1366
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,520
And that's weird. Like, I hate that, because if I do that in public, I feel like everyone's staring at me.

1367
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,520
Even though I don't think anyone has ever noticed me doing that, and yet I feel super weird about it.

1368
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,520
I used to have a lot of weird compulsions.

1369
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:12,520
And one I'm still not completely down with is scraping my index finger on my right hand into my thumbnail.

1370
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,520
And it slowly creates a twitch.

1371
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
Literally what I'm doing right now.

1372
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Right. Now, the reason why I started doing it is because...

1373
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,520
I can't even get my index finger to, like, touch my thumbnail at, like, a proper angle.

1374
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:29,520
Well, what happened is that one day I was, like, reaching for the door and I jammed my fucking thumb against it and cracked it in that exact spot, right?

1375
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,520
And so, like, it was like, ow, pain, bitch, ass, nigger, fuck.

1376
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,520
And then, like, it happened, like, three more times in the course of, like, 18 months for some fucked-up reason.

1377
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,520
I think it was just the specific angle that I was grabbing that doorknob with.

1378
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
Just sometimes I would crack my thumbnail.

1379
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,520
So I became so compulsive to have that little trench be there that eventually I started...

1380
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,520
I built up this weird habit of doing that.

1381
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,520
And you can actually see it.

1382
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,520
I was getting away from hygiene.

1383
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,520
In the cuticle...

1384
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,520
Well, when the fuck...

1385
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,520
When top of game, am I gonna talk about my cuticle?

1386
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,520
The part of your nail that goes on?

1387
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,520
Yeah, it has to come...

1388
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,520
Why discuss this at some point, did you?

1389
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,520
There's, like, a weird rift in it.

1390
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,520
That's, like, weird.

1391
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,520
Anyway, well, hey, you know, we were supposed to talk about braces and we switched that top before I got to go to it.

1392
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
So can we go back to braces?

1393
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,520
Yeah, so listen, here's the thing.

1394
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,520
But no, I want to ask Nate a question about fingernails.

1395
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,520
Because Nate, you seem to be an expert on hygiene.

1396
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,520
What is the...

1397
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,520
How long do you go between cooking your fingernails?

1398
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
What do you think is the proper amount of time?

1399
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,520
Here's the thing.

1400
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:31,520
My biggest failure in life, in my life, is my obsession with biting and clipping my fingernails.

1401
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,520
Nate?

1402
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
Which fucks me up.

1403
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,520
I'm not gonna go into details, but Nate...

1404
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
No!

1405
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,520
Fuck his fingers up at certain points.

1406
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
No!

1407
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,520
Nate, fuck them right the fuck right.

1408
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,520
That's not true.

1409
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,520
I've always...

1410
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,520
You're going over the top.

1411
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,520
No, I'm not, dude.

1412
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,520
No, I'm not.

1413
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,520
I've always been a long fingernail boy because I just don't...

1414
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,520
Like, they grow really fast.

1415
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,520
I don't know how long after I'm supposed to clip them.

1416
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,520
I probably do it once a month, but they're always...

1417
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,520
They get really fucking long.

1418
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,520
But I always got complimented on them by girls.

1419
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,520
Because my fingernails just happen to grow perfect.

1420
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Like, they're just beautiful white.

1421
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,520
Yeah, they're like, wow, those look like real good hand job giving hands.

1422
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,520
You could really, you know, make some money with those.

1423
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,520
Girls would ask me if I had had a French manicure, like, all the time.

1424
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,520
And I was like, no, I don't know what that is.

1425
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,520
But yeah, so I have perfect, beautiful hands and nails.

1426
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,520
I'm basically like a hand model.

1427
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,520
Basically, George Costanza.

1428
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,520
George Costanza.

1429
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,520
Yeah.

1430
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,520
But, yeah.

1431
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,520
But then guys would always say that my nails are too long.

1432
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,520
They'd say I was a faggot.

1433
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,520
I got no idea.

1434
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,520
I would say that a lot of people...

1435
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,520
I don't know.

1436
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,520
It's considered effeminate to have nails that even show, like, any of the white at the end.

1437
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,520
So, like, I don't know, I guess, like, for guys.

1438
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,520
Well, I just...

1439
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,520
It just so happened that I happened to watch, like, some ASMR video

1440
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
where there was just, like, a guy's hands the other day.

1441
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,520
And, like, a lot of the comments, like, he just had, like, a little bit of the white.

1442
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,520
Like, they went, like, to the edge of his finger, you know, like, not really past,

1443
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,520
but to the edge.

1444
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,520
And there was some white.

1445
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,520
And, like, a lot of the comments were talking about how girly his fingernails were.

1446
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,520
Dude, guys, you're missing the male ASMR.

1447
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,520
You can't complain about gayness.

1448
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,520
I only listen to male ASMR because female ASMR is literally gay.

1449
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,520
Yeah.

1450
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,520
We're gonna have a podcast about that one, though.

1451
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,520
Deal with it.

1452
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
Deal with it.

1453
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,520
Even though I'm a gross boy, whenever I go out of the house,

1454
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,520
like, no matter what, no matter how long it would be outside the house,

1455
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,520
I will take a shower.

1456
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
I'll take a shower and I'll put on a new pair of clothes.

1457
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,520
And I often stay in my house, so I'll go every few days without taking a shower or anything.

1458
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,520
But no matter what, no matter the circumstance, if I leave the house,

1459
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,520
I will take a shower.

1460
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,520
I wish I had your discipline.

1461
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
So here's the thing about nails, right?

1462
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,520
Like, my dad, a couple, because back when I was a teenager,

1463
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,520
I didn't have the habit of doing it until I built up the compulsion to do it sometimes.

1464
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,520
And, like, my dad was like, I don't know why you like growing your nails out long.

1465
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,520
And I feel like he was saying it with the connotation of, I'm wondering if you're gay, right?

1466
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
Are you gay, right?

1467
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,520
And, like, because my dad is just, my dad is really great hygiene, right?

1468
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
So, like, that's how I was able to build up decent habits, right?

1469
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,520
Like, my dad brushes his teeth, I think, three times a day.

1470
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,520
Okay.

1471
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,520
And, like, when does he do the third one?

1472
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,520
Just, like, in the middle, like, after lunch?

1473
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,520
Maybe it's two times a day, I don't know.

1474
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,520
Like, maybe when he's home on a weekend, it's three times a day.

1475
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Yeah, so, like, you know, when I was a kid,

1476
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,520
I had a big ego about, like, being a good kid, you know,

1477
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,520
because this was before I hit puberty and also before it turned out everyone hates me

1478
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,520
and I can't finance it with society.

1479
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,520
So, when I was a kid, I had this, you know, this big, yeah,

1480
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,520
just driven by my self-image of being, like, well-kempt and stuff, right?

1481
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,520
You know, back when I was, like, good at math and shit, lol, in, like, second grade, right?

1482
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,520
So, like, yeah, like, oh, I brush my teeth, you know?

1483
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,520
It's never been about not having good teeth.

1484
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,520
It's never been about avoiding cavities, blah, blah, blah.

1485
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,520
You don't want to get dentures, you don't want to look old.

1486
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,520
It's just, it's entirely been a lifelong campaign of pride for me.

1487
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
And so, like, my whole childhood never had any cavities.

1488
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,520
My brother got some cavities, my sister got some cavities,

1489
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,520
because they aren't fueled by ego as much as I am, right?

1490
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,520
So, but then when I was a teenager, like, like, it finally came time

1491
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,520
to deal with my incredibly fucked-up sharp teeth, right?

1492
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,520
I have, um, I have, like, what you call a bonus tooth.

1493
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,520
Well, that's what it is now.

1494
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,520
But yeah, I had just, like, I had this, like, tooth room.

1495
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,520
It was the council of teeth and my tongue could just sit in there

1496
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,520
and just, like, rest in this little, little tiny couch of teeth.

1497
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
It was terrible, horribly uncomfortable.

1498
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
I had this incredible compulsion.

1499
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,520
I have no idea what you're describing right now.

1500
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,520
It's just extra teeth. It's like I had multiple rows of teeth, right?

1501
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,520
I had so many fucking extra teeth.

1502
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
My mouth is too small.

1503
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,520
How many extra teeth did you have?

1504
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,520
I mean, wait, were you Sharkboy and was your sister Lavagirl?

1505
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,520
Is that what you're telling me right now?

1506
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
Yes, absolutely. She also has too many teeth.

1507
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,520
I kind of know what you're talking about,

1508
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,520
because I grew a, like, a set of canines over my canines

1509
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,520
and that eventually got, like, pushed them out and destroyed them.

1510
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,520
What the shit, dude?

1511
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
Is it literal?

1512
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,520
Are you sure you're not talking about baby teeth and adult teeth?

1513
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,520
I'm talking about when I was, like, 18.

1514
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,520
Manchi, what the fuck kind of humans are these?

1515
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
I don't know.

1516
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,520
I long after having lost all my baby teeth,

1517
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,520
grew in an extra pair of canines over my original ones

1518
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,520
that pushed them out and eventually moved all the rest of my teeth

1519
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,520
out of where they were so that they could fit in

1520
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,520
and slot into the rest of my teeth.

1521
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,520
I thought everyone had the same amount of teeth.

1522
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,520
I don't know. I don't know.

1523
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,520
Yeah, I know.

1524
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,520
People have different sizes of mouths, right?

1525
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,520
I thought, like, humans were, like, defined by their number of teeth.

1526
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,520
And the new ones, like, grew way bigger than the old ones.

1527
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,520
I think everyone has the same amount of teeth.

1528
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,520
I think everyone has the same amount of teeth.

1529
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,520
Wait, wait, wait.

1530
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,520
Are you just talking about, like, your adult teeth

1531
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,520
grew in around your baby teeth?

1532
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
No, motherfucker.

1533
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,520
I'm talking about, in my late teens, a brand new set of canines

1534
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,520
grew in and pushed the old ones out

1535
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,520
and then moved all the rest of my teeth out of their way

1536
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,520
so that they could fucking find a place.

1537
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,520
Amazing.

1538
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,520
So, yeah, so, like, if you guys want to know,

1539
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,520
like, look, yeah, having braces is terrible.

1540
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,520
There's a lot of things that suck about it,

1541
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,520
particularly, like, when they fuck up or something goes wrong

1542
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,520
or they're adjusting them, you know.

1543
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,520
But for some mouths, it is fucking worth it, right?

1544
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,520
And mine were.

1545
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,520
Like, I have videos dating back to 2008.

1546
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,520
Go to my playlists. You'll find them.

1547
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,520
Listen to how I talk.

1548
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,520
I struggled to speak.

1549
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,520
I still do because I learned to speak, you know,

1550
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,520
with a fucking fucked up set of teeth.

1551
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,520
And I think I also have some sort of weirdly deformed tongue

1552
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,520
that isn't long enough.

1553
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,520
My tongue isn't long enough.

1554
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
I can't stick my tongue out very far.

1555
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,520
And it ends with, like, a nipple.

1556
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,520
So I have a really weird tongue.

1557
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,520
My whole weird, lispy voice, it's because of these two things.

1558
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,520
Having bad teeth my whole life and having this weirdly fucked up tongue.

1559
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,520
That's why I lisp like this.

1560
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,520
That's why I sound like a huge fucking nerd all the time.

1561
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,520
I've looked it up and what I believe it's hyperdontia,

1562
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,520
the condition of having super, super numerary teeth,

1563
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,520
or teeth that appear in addition to the regular number of teeth.

1564
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,520
I didn't know that was a thing.

1565
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,520
So, yeah.

1566
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,520
So before they even started with putting on the braces,

1567
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,520
they had to pull four of my fucking teeth out.

1568
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,520
Four of my fucking teeth out.

1569
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,520
And then it was like four years of having braces on,

1570
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
although it could have probably been like three and a half,

1571
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,520
because I got to the point where it was just like,

1572
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,520
they weren't taking the braces off because like,

1573
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,520
there's really no such thing as perfectly straight teeth,

1574
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,520
so you can theoretically have them on forever.

1575
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,520
So we had to specifically ask, can we have them off now?

1576
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
And they're like, oh yeah.

1577
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,520
And it was literally only the exact fucking moment

1578
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,520
the braces were finally taken off in the clinic.

1579
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,520
She gave me the retainer and said,

1580
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,520
oh yeah, well how long do you wear these for?

1581
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,520
As long as you want to have straight teeth.

1582
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,520
I'm like, what the fuck?

1583
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,520
I would not have signed up for the whole operation if I had known.

1584
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,520
You would have had to permanently deal with bullshit.

1585
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,520
This is my whole thing, right?

1586
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,520
I don't want to have to deal with bullshit permanently

1587
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,520
in any sort of way, right?

1588
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,520
I'm fine with doing something as long as it's a temporary thing.

1589
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,520
So I had the retainer on for one year,

1590
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,520
and I'm like, this is not worth it.

1591
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,520
No one I know keeps it in.

1592
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
I still wear my braces.

1593
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,520
I still wear my fucking retainer.

1594
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,520
That's crazy dude, I don't wear mine.

1595
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,520
I gave mine up in like a month.

1596
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,520
I lost the bottom of my retainer though.

1597
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,520
See, I talked to Shade and he's like,

1598
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,520
yeah, my teeth are slowly going back out of alignment

1599
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,520
because I didn't wear retainer and none of it was worth it.

1600
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,520
Well, parents made so much money, we got to do it right by him.

1601
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,520
I have one fucking tooth that's going out of alignment.

1602
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,520
Okay, one of my molars is out of alignment

1603
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,520
because the retainer cracked in that spot early on,

1604
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,520
which is fucking fucked up,

1605
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,520
and I didn't want to have to spend hundreds of dollars

1606
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
to get it fixed and stuff.

1607
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,520
But yeah, over time, I worked for a year, I gave up.

1608
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,520
There is one tooth in the front of my teeth

1609
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
that is being misaligned.

1610
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,520
My girlfriend thought that I had just never gotten those teeth fixed.

1611
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,520
She's like, when are you going to get bottom braces?

1612
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,520
I'm like, but anyway, it is messed up.

1613
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,520
Don't bitch fucking slut, god damn.

1614
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,520
For the longest time, I've also had this one gap in my teeth

1615
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,520
that always has a deposit of food every night,

1616
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,520
which is a good-

1617
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,520
Okay, great. That's a little snack for you at the end of the day.

1618
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,520
Which can be a good survival tactic, you know?

1619
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,520
You're like a chipmunk who stores shit in his face.

1620
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,520
Can we move on from teeth to-

1621
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,520
No, I'm not done yet.

1622
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,520
This is not the teeth test.

1623
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,520
Well, hold on.

1624
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,520
It's not really about hygiene at this point.

1625
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,520
It's more about the entire history of your teeth and how they've shaped it.

1626
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Well, hold on. I'm fucking doing it.

1627
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
I'm fucking doing it.

1628
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,520
So when I had the braces on, I didn't floss hardly at all

1629
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,520
because you can't use those little convenient flossers.

1630
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:00,520
You can't even do the thing where you wrap the floss around your fingers.

1631
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,520
You have to fucking sew the food out.

1632
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,520
You know, like, where you sew with a needle?

1633
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
You have to do that shit, but to get food out of your teeth

1634
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,520
takes 15 fucking minutes.

1635
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,520
Almost never did it.

1636
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,520
So, like, I was pretty concerned that I wasn't taking proper care of my teeth

1637
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,520
and I could have had a cavity, but, you know,

1638
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,520
I brushed them so much when I was a kid.

1639
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,520
Also, like hippo, never drank much soda or had much candy.

1640
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Or at all, really.

1641
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,520
But then, but then, as an adult,

1642
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,520
I finally, like, got too old for the youth dentist.

1643
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,520
And so my teeth were going un-maintained by a dentist.

1644
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,520
I was brushing them.

1645
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,520
I was also drinking lots of tea.

1646
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,520
I was also drinking some coffee.

1647
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,520
And, like, like, buildup was building up.

1648
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,520
You know, staining.

1649
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,520
And I remember talking about...

1650
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,520
That is what buildup tends to do.

1651
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,520
God damn it.

1652
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
Like, I wrapped this shit up.

1653
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
Where are you going with this?

1654
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,520
And so then, my girlfriend was like,

1655
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
dude, those might be cavities.

1656
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,520
And I was like, holy shit.

1657
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,520
Okay.

1658
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,520
Because I remember saying this, like,

1659
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,520
three or four weeks ago on a previous podcast

1660
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,520
that, like, when I was a kid,

1661
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,520
I was just boasting about how I've never had a cavity.

1662
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,520
And my older cousin, Patricia Lepleb, said,

1663
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,520
don't get cocky.

1664
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
I got my first cavity when I was 22.

1665
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,520
And I'm 22.

1666
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,520
Almost, you know, almost done with being 22.

1667
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,520
Might have cavities.

1668
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,520
And it was literally the most nervous I've ever been

1669
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,520
about anything in my life.

1670
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
Purely as a matter of pride.

1671
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
And I finally looked at them.

1672
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
It was fucking buildup.

1673
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
I was right.

1674
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,520
I sent a huge boasting text to my cousin.

1675
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,520
She's like, I don't remember saying that.

1676
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
Like, I remember everything.

1677
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,520
Of course not.

1678
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,520
Of course not.

1679
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,520
Having you learn how...

1680
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,520
Tuesday.

1681
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Yeah.

1682
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,520
That was just another day when I told people

1683
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,520
that they are fucking going to get cavities.

1684
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,520
Yeah.

1685
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,520
Anyway, that's the reason to maintain yourself.

1686
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,520
You'll feel superior over everyone else,

1687
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,520
as I'm sure Nate has this whole podcast,

1688
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,520
just being like, I'm such a better person.

1689
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,520
You know, I do.

1690
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,520
I do.

1691
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,520
But the thing is, I spend my time in a gym

1692
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,520
with people who are way above me,

1693
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,520
so it keeps me looking for stuff

1694
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,520
to be even more better than you guys.

1695
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,520
When it comes to, for me,

1696
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,520
I think I just don't like admitting that I'm wrong.

1697
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,520
Right.

1698
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,520
To admit that I've been, like, wrong

1699
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,520
for not going all hygiene

1700
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,520
of my whole teenage life.

1701
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,520
And I, you know, I went to the dentist recently

1702
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
and, you know, did all the checkups,

1703
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,520
and I didn't get a feeling this time.

1704
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,520
But they, you know, they said,

1705
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,520
you should brush twice a day.

1706
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,520
And every time I'd gone to the dentist,

1707
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
they say that, and I'm usually like,

1708
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,520
okay, like I'm not going to, but okay.

1709
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,520
Yeah, okay, guys.

1710
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,520
All right.

1711
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,520
But this time, I just saw her.

1712
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,520
I was an adult, and I was just looking at her.

1713
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,520
And I'm like, yeah, you're right.

1714
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,520
And now I'm doing that.

1715
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,520
And that's just, I just,

1716
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
because I know that, I know that being clean

1717
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,520
makes me feel better than normal.

1718
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,520
Yeah, it does.

1719
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,520
So it's like, it's, it's,

1720
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,520
I don't like to admit that I'm wrong,

1721
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,520
but I'm totally wrong for ever being.

1722
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,520
Guys, I have a huge branch

1723
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,520
that this conversation could take

1724
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,520
if you're down here.

1725
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,520
Hold on.

1726
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,520
Just to finish off,

1727
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
to go off what Hippo was saying,

1728
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,520
one of the recent times I went to the dentist,

1729
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,520
she got so exasperated with me

1730
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,520
that she literally said, like,

1731
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,520
why do you even come here?

1732
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,520
Like, if you're not going to take,

1733
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,520
and I said,

1734
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,520
I come here so you can see if I have cavities

1735
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,520
so I can get them filled.

1736
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,520
Like, I don't care about the cleaning

1737
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,520
that you're going to do.

1738
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,520
I'm just here for the X-rays, you know.

1739
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,520
That's pretty fair.

1740
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,520
When I say branch,

1741
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,520
I'm saying it's 100% relevant.

1742
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,520
It's just a subcategory, right?

1743
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,520
Okay, well, what is it?

1744
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
Well, I also, somewhere I want to take this,

1745
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,520
but I'll hear yours.

1746
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,520
We've been talking about like, you know,

1747
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,520
like things you do on a daily basis

1748
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
or a weekly basis, stuff like that.

1749
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,520
What about stuff you do on a minute-by-minute basis?

1750
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,520
Like, some shit got on your hands.

1751
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,520
What do you do next?

1752
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
Right?

1753
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,520
That's a huge...

1754
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,520
Well, there's specific ways to do it, you know.

1755
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,520
Like, what's your policy on, like, you know...

1756
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,520
Oh, I have a thing on this.

1757
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,520
You throw it in the general direction of a trash can

1758
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,520
and if you miss, it's no big deal.

1759
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,520
I agree.

1760
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,520
I went on the carpet.

1761
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:39,520
When it comes to, like, small things like that,

1762
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,520
if I've got a runny nose

1763
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
and it's mostly water coming out of my nose,

1764
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,520
then I will just get it with my hands if I don't have a tissue

1765
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,520
and just rub my hands together until it evaporates.

1766
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,520
Yeah, that's not real.

1767
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,520
That's not a real thing.

1768
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,520
No, if it's like an actual booger with, like, greenness in it,

1769
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,520
then I will, like, get a tissue.

1770
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
It's all booger.

1771
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,520
It's 100% booger if it throws your nose.

1772
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,520
If it's a runny nose, I will use my hands

1773
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,520
and then evaporate it with friction.

1774
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,520
No!

1775
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,520
It's fine.

1776
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,520
No!

1777
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,520
Please!

1778
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,520
On the onset of the nose, all throughout my childhood,

1779
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,520
I was super, I was super, like,

1780
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,520
get a Kleenex, I'm not going to pick my nose.

1781
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,520
And then, like, one time, I was at my cousin's house

1782
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,520
and he was playing Call of Duty and he wouldn't let me play

1783
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,520
because he was an asshole.

1784
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
Fuck you, Josh.

1785
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,520
And then...

1786
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,520
And then he started picking his nose.

1787
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,520
And I was like, you shouldn't do that, bitch.

1788
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,520
You shouldn't fucking do that.

1789
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
That's wrong.

1790
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,520
That's immoral what you're doing right now.

1791
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,520
Yeah, exactly.

1792
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,520
And he was like, you're gay, dude.

1793
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,520
You should try it.

1794
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
It's cool.

1795
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,520
Oh, no.

1796
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,520
He said you're done in dark.

1797
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
Maybe I should.

1798
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Maybe...

1799
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,520
And I only quit picking my nose,

1800
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,520
like, two years ago.

1801
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,520
Why would you quit?

1802
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,520
I think everyone picks their nose at least a little bit, right?

1803
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,520
What do you do to get the stuff out of your nose?

1804
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,520
I get a napkin.

1805
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
I pick my nose almost constantly.

1806
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,520
Here's my nostril thing.

1807
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,520
If it's, like, big, like, goopy, like,

1808
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,520
I'm going to die, I can't breathe, sort of stuff,

1809
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,520
then I will let it build up overnight.

1810
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,520
And then, like, cannon blasts, like, explode.

1811
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,520
I do that sometimes.

1812
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,520
Yeah.

1813
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,520
What else can you do?

1814
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,520
I get in there constantly.

1815
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,520
And I've got to say that my old chair,

1816
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,520
one of my old black chairs,

1817
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,520
which you've all sat in on the plebe and the weeb set,

1818
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,520
for years, I was just wiping boogers on the back of the chair.

1819
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,520
Amazing.

1820
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,520
I would just pick my nose and go right to the back

1821
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,520
or on the bottom.

1822
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,520
And the bottom had sort of that, like,

1823
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,520
like that fuzzy stuff on it.

1824
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,520
And so the boogers would kind of, like,

1825
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,520
hang from that.

1826
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,520
No!

1827
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,520
It was like all these hanging,

1828
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
like, like, like the Pokemon Kokuna,

1829
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,520
how it hangs from a, like that,

1830
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,520
with a bunch of boogers.

1831
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,520
No!

1832
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,520
Like the Pokemon, not like the actual thing.

1833
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
Yeah.

1834
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,520
There was, like, hundreds.

1835
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,520
Much more relatable.

1836
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,520
There was, like, hundreds of boogers

1837
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,520
all over the back of my chair.

1838
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
And if anybody sat behind me,

1839
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,520
they thought it was the most disgusting shit.

1840
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,520
It sounds like some pretty disgusting shit.

1841
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,520
But it's all behind me, so what do I care?

1842
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
Yeah.

1843
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,520
That's my retort.

1844
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,520
When I finally replaced the chair,

1845
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,520
I just took it out back

1846
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,520
and just hosed it down.

1847
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,520
Burned it?

1848
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,520
Okay.

1849
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,520
My brother had this.

1850
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,520
You've all sat in it.

1851
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,520
You've all been in this chair.

1852
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,520
Had this childhood friend,

1853
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
this childhood friend of my brothers

1854
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,520
who lived in a bunk bed on the bottom bed,

1855
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,520
and it was wooden.

1856
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,520
So, like, above him was just this big plank of wood,

1857
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,520
and he built up a deliberate booger collection,

1858
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,520
which was quite a sight to behold.

1859
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
But yeah, okay.

1860
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,520
Guys, the subject of hands.

1861
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:27,520
How much awareness do you have

1862
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,520
about, like, the registry of everything

1863
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,520
that's happened to these hands

1864
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,520
since its last washing?

1865
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,520
I'm like, okay.

1866
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,520
Zero.

1867
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,520
I make an effort to forget.

1868
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,520
Sometimes I look at my hands,

1869
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,520
and it's just fucking bleeding.

1870
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,520
That's not a joke.

1871
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,520
Sometimes I look at my hands,

1872
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,520
and it's fucking bleeding.

1873
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,520
That's true.

1874
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
It's happened.

1875
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,520
Why?

1876
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,520
How?

1877
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
I don't know.

1878
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
What do you mean how?

1879
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
It's just fucking bleeding, Nate.

1880
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,520
I just burst my heartbeat.

1881
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,520
It's too strong.

1882
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,520
It clips the fucking microphone.

1883
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,520
Exactly.

1884
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,520
It's just out of my body.

1885
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,520
What can you do?

1886
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,520
I go by the George Carlin thing,

1887
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,520
where I just, I mean,

1888
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,520
I wash my hands when it's in a public place,

1889
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
because, you know,

1890
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
I don't want to look like an idiot.

1891
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,520
But most of the time,

1892
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,520
I just, you know,

1893
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,520
if it doesn't feel gross,

1894
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,520
then it isn't.

1895
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,520
I wash my hands whenever I do anything

1896
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
in my fucking life.

1897
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,520
I do it at least, like, every 30 minutes.

1898
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,520
For me, it's like a sixth sense.

1899
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,520
It's like a seventh sense,

1900
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
where it's like,

1901
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,520
I have, like, this, you know,

1902
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,520
subconscious knowledge of, like,

1903
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,520
what each finger has done,

1904
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,520
you know, and, like,

1905
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,520
I make compromises

1906
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
based on what's going on

1907
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
in my environment.

1908
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
Again, if I'm in a public place,

1909
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
I'm like, okay,

1910
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,520
if I have to touch a door handle

1911
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,520
out in public,

1912
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,520
then I will change my behavior

1913
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520
accordingly, you know.

1914
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,520
That sounds like some super OCD shit.

1915
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,520
No, I wouldn't say that.

1916
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,520
Well, it's not really,

1917
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,520
because it doesn't occupy my thoughts

1918
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,520
that vividly.

1919
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,520
It's happening sort of like

1920
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,520
in the lower registry of my thoughts.

1921
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,520
I mean, you know what I did?

1922
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,520
I came up with a system,

1923
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,520
sorry, I came up with a system years ago

1924
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,520
that whenever I go to the bathroom

1925
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,520
in a public place,

1926
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,520
when I, you know,

1927
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,520
I wash my hands,

1928
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,520
I do whatever,

1929
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,520
I get the paper towels,

1930
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,520
I dry my hands,

1931
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,520
I then use those paper towels

1932
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,520
to open the door to exit,

1933
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,520
because I know people

1934
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,520
have been touching that shit.

1935
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,520
I just discovered that one day.

1936
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,520
I remember one,

1937
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,520
I remember one time being in a public bathroom

1938
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,520
that had this specially designed handle

1939
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,520
that deliberately lets you

1940
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,520
just open it with your shoulder or something,

1941
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,520
and it had this huge list of instructions,

1942
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,520
and it's like being put in there.

1943
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,520
It felt like I was in some sort of like

1944
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,520
torture device.

1945
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,520
It felt like the position I had

1946
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,520
to demean myself to assume.

1947
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,520
I thought you were going to say

1948
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,520
you felt like you were in the future.

1949
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,520
Well, what happened was like,

1950
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,520
the position I had to be in was like,

1951
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,520
if someone were to push the door open

1952
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,520
on the other side,

1953
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,520
it's going to break my fucking arm.

1954
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,520
So like clearly those things

1955
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,520
didn't catch on, right?

1956
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,520
That is awesome.

1957
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,520
I love that.

1958
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,520
Yeah, I guess we would pun it.

1959
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,520
I have a system,

1960
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,520
I mean, if anything gets on my hands,

1961
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,520
I'm wiping it off.

1962
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,520
I always have a towel next to my desk

1963
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,520
at all times for anything

1964
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,520
on my face and hands,

1965
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,520
or just dripping.

1966
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,520
But like, when I,

1967
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,520
I basically just wash my hands

1968
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,520
under two circumstances.

1969
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,520
I just took a shit,

1970
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,520
or I just jacked off.

1971
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,520
Those are the two absolute

1972
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,520
wash hands with soap circumstances.

1973
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,520
You know what,

1974
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,520
it's going to be real with you guys.

1975
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,520
To me, jacking off is not a hand washing activity.

1976
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,520
If you take a shower that day,

1977
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,520
if you've taken a shower within like

1978
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,520
20 or so hours,

1979
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,520
then jack off,

1980
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,520
you don't have to wash your hands.

1981
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,520
If I was a good boy,

1982
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,520
I would wash my hands after jacking off,

1983
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
but I'm big enough to admit

1984
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
that I'm not that boy.

1985
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,520
Nate, how are you not grossed out by that,

1986
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,520
but you all grossed out by me

1987
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,520
wiping my boogers with my hands?

1988
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,520
Ew, boogers are gross!

1989
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,520
A man's seed,

1990
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,520
a man's seed is pure hippo.

1991
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
A man's seed should be celebrated.

1992
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,520
It's the same stickers.

1993
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,520
I don't get any like,

1994
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,520
jizz on my hands when I jack off.

1995
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,520
Right, yeah, that's the thing.

1996
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,520
But just the smell of my dick

1997
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,520
like gets on my hand

1998
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,520
and it does not get off.

1999
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,520
Like, I can smell my hand

2000
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,520
from the full length of my arm away

2001
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,520
for like hours

2002
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,520
if I don't wash my hand after jacking off.

2003
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,520
I would probably go longer

2004
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
I would probably go longer without showering

2005
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
if it weren't for the fact that

2006
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,520
my dick starts to smell.

2007
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,520
I just want the audience to know,

2008
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,520
if you shake my hand, I just jacked off.

2009
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,520
I remember fucking vividly

2010
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
the first time

2011
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
I ever like came in my pants

2012
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,520
like after a wet drain

2013
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,520
and I had to touch

2014
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,520
my weenus penis

2015
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,520
and feel the

2016
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,520
straight up slime

2017
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,520
Slime, straight up slime, dude.

2018
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,520
Yeah.

2019
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,520
I definitely have

2020
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,520
I've seen a bunch of you knew that sex was a sin

2021
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,520
and to never, you know, go back.

2022
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,520
I guess I have a pretty high tolerance

2023
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,520
to jizz just because

2024
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,520
the way that I jacked off for several years

2025
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
was entirely by laying on my belly

2026
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
and doing it in my pants every time.

2027
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,520
So I guess my tolerance is kind of weird.

2028
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
In all my favorite RPGs

2029
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,520
I always stack high jizz resistance.

2030
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,520
High jizz defense.

2031
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,520
Yeah, so I definitely have a hierarchy

2032
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,520
of bodily fluids resistance.

2033
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,520
Yeah, like cum, I really

2034
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,520
don't mind that much.

2035
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,520
I think it's pure, man.

2036
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,520
Well, the first day I live.

2037
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,520
I do because it sticks to everything

2038
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
and it gets in your hairs and then it's

2039
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,520
like impossible to get out once it dries.

2040
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,520
I made out with a girl after just coming in her mouth

2041
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,520
so at this point, you know,

2042
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,520
she swallowed, right?

2043
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,520
She swallowed first.

2044
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,520
She swallowed first.

2045
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,520
I'm a big snowballer.

2046
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
You know me.

2047
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,520
The first day I lived here

2048
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,520
I just like sat down

2049
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,520
on Digi's bed.

2050
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,520
I was like kind of like laying down on Digi's bed

2051
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,520
and he's like, just know I rub my dick

2052
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,520
on every square centimeter

2053
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,520
of that bed. I don't really mind.

2054
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,520
I don't really mind dicks that much.

2055
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,520
And then like pee, you know,

2056
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,520
I'll compromise if need be.

2057
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
That's the first step to being gay to boo, just so you know.

2058
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,520
I don't mind cum so much at all.

2059
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,520
So much for snakes.

2060
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,520
He just said pee was next.

2061
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,520
I got a bro, he just needs to get jacked off.

2062
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
You know, it just had to be done.

2063
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,520
It's not gay, it's just helping a friend out.

2064
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,520
Leading up to moving in with Digi, right?

2065
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,520
I'd seen what his toilet looked like.

2066
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,520
I knew it was very, you know, pistuous.

2067
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,520
But then when I finally saw it

2068
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,520
When I finally saw it

2069
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,520
Hashtag pistuous!

2070
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,520
It was P-I-S-T-O-U-S

2071
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,520
Where does T-O-U-S?

2072
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,520
T-U-O-S

2073
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,520
I finally saw it because it's just that like

2074
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,520
The entire

2075
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,520
two foot radius of around his toilet

2076
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,520
is a layer of pee.

2077
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,520
I wanted to get into that.

2078
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,520
That's what I've been waiting for.

2079
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,520
But we've been so far down this fucking rabbit hole

2080
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,520
that we've been only focused on

2081
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,520
like self hygiene.

2082
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,520
But what about your environment?

2083
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Exactly, I have a huge thing about and nose about that.

2084
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,520
Oh my god.

2085
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,520
Can I just mention the story

2086
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,520
at Radcon 2

2087
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,520
when I got fed up with the environment

2088
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,520
and insisted that we all clean.

2089
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,520
I mean I was going to do it myself

2090
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,520
but other people felt guilty and joined in

2091
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,520
I didn't feel guilty. I just felt like it was a good idea.

2092
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,520
I felt like Tom felt guilty, you know?

2093
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,520
I guess I'm basing it off of him.

2094
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,520
The best fucking moment of my entire fucking life

2095
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,520
was when I pissed on Digi's house.

2096
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,520
When was that?

2097
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,520
It was so fucking good.

2098
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,520
When I went outside and I just got to piss on the walls

2099
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,520
and I just got to piss on the grass

2100
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,520
it was so fucking

2101
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,520
Yes Queen!

2102
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,520
Yes Queen!

2103
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,520
I pissed in my yard at least once a day

2104
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520
if not multiple times a day.

2105
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,520
Yeah.

2106
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,520
When I lived in my parents' house

2107
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,520
I loved peeing outside. Peeing outside is great.

2108
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,520
Me and Ben do it all the time

2109
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,520
because we go out to smoke and each one of us

2110
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,520
will just go out behind the bushes and be like

2111
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,520
I'm going to go piss.

2112
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,520
I'm a big peer. If I'm outside

2113
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,520
there's a good chance I'm going to have to pee

2114
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,520
and I'm not going all the way back inside.

2115
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,520
It feels amazing to piss outside.

2116
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,520
It does.

2117
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,520
This was meant to be given to God before God

2118
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,520
out in the open.

2119
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,520
I wouldn't be okay with it if not for the fact

2120
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,520
you don't have any toilet paper to deal with

2121
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,520
some drips.

2122
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,520
I was shaking off dude.

2123
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,520
It was a leaf all over my body.

2124
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,520
Yeah that's the thing.

2125
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,520
I don't get much pee drip honestly.

2126
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,520
Maybe I'm just blessed.

2127
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,520
Well I have an extremely long foreskin

2128
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,520
and therefore

2129
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,520
I get flung all over the place

2130
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,520
which is why my bathroom is entirely

2131
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,520
covered in piss.

2132
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,520
And the reason that I don't like...

2133
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,520
Wait you don't peel it back?

2134
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,520
You don't understand how long it is.

2135
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,520
It's abnormal. Is it like a meter?

2136
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,520
Yes it's exactly like that.

2137
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,520
It's basically the equivalent

2138
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,520
it's a man equivalent of beef curtains

2139
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,520
holding on the end of it.

2140
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
Yeah it's a beef curtain.

2141
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,520
I'm not even joking.

2142
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,520
I have an exceedingly long foreskin.

2143
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,520
It's a condition called femorsis.

2144
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,520
And even then I have an extreme example of it.

2145
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,520
Oh yeah.

2146
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,520
So yeah that's why in order to get the piss

2147
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,520
out of my dick I have to like shake it violently

2148
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,520
and it just gets everywhere.

2149
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,520
People look at my toilet and will think

2150
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,520
this is such a huge build up.

2151
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,520
But like it gets that way after

2152
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,520
a couple weeks.

2153
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,520
That is why I did you.

2154
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,520
You have to clean every single time.

2155
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,520
Every single time.

2156
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,520
You do a little bit.

2157
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
I'm talking like if you stand.

2158
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,520
If you stand.

2159
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,520
If you use his toilet and you're standing up

2160
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,520
because you're male right.

2161
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,520
Any woman has ever gone into his room ever.

2162
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,520
That's not true.

2163
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,520
Sheepovers had to use that bathroom.

2164
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,520
Oh you did that to sheepover?

2165
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,520
That's a sin.

2166
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,520
So if you stand there.

2167
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,520
Whether or not you stand on it or sit on it

2168
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,520
you're going to put your feet by the toilet.

2169
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,520
There will be now crusted like caramelized pee

2170
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,520
on your feet now.

2171
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,520
It's not just pee.

2172
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,520
The whole floor.

2173
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,520
The entire floor of my bathroom is sticky

2174
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,520
and it's not just because of piss.

2175
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,520
I don't know what else it is.

2176
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,520
It definitely leaves me with a disturbing feeling.

2177
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,520
I'm just going to use one word to describe the experience

2178
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,520
of your bathroom.

2179
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,520
The only reason to bother you is because you don't wear socks.

2180
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,520
I want to get to the feet situation.

2181
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,520
Ditchy's bathroom is like a silent hill.

2182
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,520
It is a nightmare.

2183
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,520
It was legitimately terrified

2184
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,520
the first time I went in.

2185
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,520
I mostly use it at night

2186
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,520
where I don't notice as much

2187
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,520
but when I see it in the light of day

2188
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,520
it is definitely horrifying.

2189
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,520
It's a war zone.

2190
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,520
I have a very specific foot

2191
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,520
policy

2192
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,520
which I am not able to fulfill

2193
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,520
but when I have my own place

2194
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,520
hopefully I'm going to get it figured out

2195
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,520
which basically is just

2196
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,520
I just want to avoid things

2197
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,520
that cause bad germs.

2198
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,520
Stuff like mold

2199
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,520
and mildew.

2200
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
Like bodily fluids past the giz level.

2201
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,520
That kind of stuff.

2202
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,520
Not too many foreign substances.

2203
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,520
Nothing is past the giz level for me.

2204
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,520
Other than maybe...

2205
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,520
Are you talking about bloods?

2206
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,520
He just considers giz

2207
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,520
to be the least offensive bodily fluid

2208
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,520
whereas I would consider it to be the most offensive

2209
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,520
other than shit.

2210
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,520
It propagates life and you oppose life.

2211
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,520
I am in favor of life.

2212
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,520
That's right.

2213
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,520
Because it's a sticky, disgusting substance

2214
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,520
that permanently gets on everything.

2215
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,520
And it smells, dude.

2216
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,520
It smells.

2217
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,520
I'm not saying...

2218
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,520
I've never seen that.

2219
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,520
If you ever giz

2220
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,520
and then don't clean it up

2221
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,520
watch it for a couple days.

2222
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,520
No thank you.

2223
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,520
I'm not saying I don't clean it up.

2224
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,520
I'm not saying I don't mind it.

2225
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,520
I do mind it. It's just the lowest rank

2226
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,520
and I will clean it up.

2227
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,520
The idea is just have a whole environment

2228
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,520
that is clean

2229
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
and have your feet exist

2230
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,520
and you can walk around and you don't have to worry about it.

2231
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,520
See, I started developing this policy

2232
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,520
because my family started getting dogs.

2233
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,520
Right?

2234
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,520
We got to the point where we had two dogs at a time

2235
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,520
and it was just gross because dogs are disgusting

2236
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,520
and I despise everything about them.

2237
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,520
And they're just gross and terrible

2238
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,520
and they shit and they pee

2239
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
and they also will lick the floor.

2240
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,520
They'll lick fucking food on the floor

2241
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,520
and it's five times worse if it's a dog.

2242
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,520
Undertale

2243
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,520
is an 8.7 out of 10

2244
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,520
because it has dog residue in the game.

2245
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,520
It would be a 10 otherwise.

2246
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,520
So I started wearing slippers

2247
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,520
and then when I go into my room

2248
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:08,520
I take the slippers off right outside of the bedroom.

2249
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,520
It was a strict fucking policy

2250
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,520
for me to never have my bare feet

2251
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,520
around because there's dogs around.

2252
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,520
So the problem with this house

2253
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,520
is that there are so many people that have

2254
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,520
a different policy

2255
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,520
and it seems to be more like

2256
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,520
it's okay to have fucking stuff on the floor

2257
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,520
just have socks on all the time.

2258
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,520
We have mostly hardwood floors

2259
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,520
in this house

2260
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,520
or different stuff

2261
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,520
and it's just physically

2262
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,520
impossible to keep them clean

2263
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,520
for more than one minute.

2264
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,520
There's just stuff you can't even see

2265
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,520
that will get stuck to your foot

2266
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,520
and personally I freak the fuck out

2267
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,520
if anything is on my feet at all.

2268
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,520
With the second something touches my foot

2269
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,520
and I have to get rid of it.

2270
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,520
So I wear socks at all times

2271
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,520
if I'm looking around the house

2272
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
sometimes socks and slippers

2273
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,520
because I would just wear slippers

2274
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,520
but I have a condition called

2275
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,520
my feet sweat like hell

2276
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,520
and if I wear anything without socks

2277
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,520
I will destroy it

2278
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,520
immediately.

2279
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,520
I've had pairs of slippers

2280
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,520
that literally fell apart within a week

2281
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,520
because the strength of my foot sweat destroyed them.

2282
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,520
Fuck.

2283
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,520
It's really weird Digi.

2284
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,520
I actually have

2285
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,520
very weirdly dry feet

2286
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,520
to the point like it's like a mummy.

2287
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,520
I have mummy feet.

2288
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,520
Do you have to moisturize them?

2289
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,520
Yeah, I have to moisturize them.

2290
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,520
My feet are fucking white.

2291
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,520
I think that might be an ethnic thing.

2292
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,520
I think you might have ethnic feet.

2293
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,520
I have dangerously ethnic feet.

2294
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,520
It's the name of a new podcast

2295
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,520
by the way coming down.

2296
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,520
I want to say that

2297
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,520
that's the other reason I wear socks

2298
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,520
because I don't want to look at feet.

2299
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,520
I love walking

2300
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,520
outside barefoot

2301
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,520
on hot tarmac roads

2302
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,520
and stuff.

2303
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,520
I used to as a kid walk

2304
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,520
on rocks and hot sand at the beach

2305
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,520
barefoot and I just love

2306
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,520
walking on

2307
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,520
like a bumpy, really

2308
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,520
searing hot tarmac road

2309
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,520
for some reason it's just really pleasurable

2310
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,520
and I enjoy it.

2311
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,520
I love walking on gravel

2312
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,520
and Legos and all that sort of stuff.

2313
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,520
It has to be really fucking cold

2314
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,520
to convince me to wear socks.

2315
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,520
Only in the dead of winter

2316
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,520
am I finally cold enough on the feet

2317
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,520
to wear socks because it's just uncomfortable.

2318
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,520
I'll wear socks in

2319
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,520
I'll wear socks with my sandals

2320
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,520
in the 100 degree weather

2321
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,520
like socks are just

2322
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
necessary to make things

2323
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,520
not gross.

2324
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,520
But yeah, to get back to the environment

2325
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,520
like aside from my bathroom

2326
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,520
my whole room is filthy

2327
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
like in terms of

2328
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,520
the daylight is hitting my desk

2329
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,520
right now and there's just

2330
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,520
there's just flakes

2331
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,520
everywhere.

2332
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,520
Who knows what this is all about.

2333
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,520
It's dust.

2334
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,520
A lot of it's probably skin

2335
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,520
a lot of it's probably food

2336
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,520
a lot of it's probably just whatever

2337
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,520
is floating in the environment

2338
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,520
it's just

2339
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,520
has a thin veneer of bullshit

2340
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,520
on it in my room.

2341
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,520
There's nothing that's just clean.

2342
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,520
If you took all the dust in my room

2343
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,520
and then like compiled it together

2344
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,520
it would be like at least a hamburger

2345
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,520
or maybe even two.

2346
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,520
It's fucking dust.

2347
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,520
There's a ton of

2348
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,520
fucking burger juice around me.

2349
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,520
It's fucking gross.

2350
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,520
It's all covered in fucking snow.

2351
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,520
Do you actually wipe it down?

2352
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,520
I do.

2353
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,520
You see my kitchen it is immaculate right now

2354
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,520
it looks great.

2355
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,520
My work area I'm less particular about keeping it clean

2356
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,520
but I do make sure that

2357
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,520
the services are never sticky

2358
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,520
and I wipe it down occasionally.

2359
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,520
I'm not really concerned about clutter

2360
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,520
all I can't deal with is

2361
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,520
if there's like shit like gross shit

2362
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,520
I gotta deal with that.

2363
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,520
The funniest shit is that on my keyboard

2364
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,520
all of the keys that I actually

2365
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,520
use are like

2366
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,520
black as they should be

2367
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,520
from the grease of my fingers

2368
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,520
So mostly the letters

2369
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,520
N-I-G-E-R

2370
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,520
They see a lot of use right?

2371
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,520
But then all of the F keys

2372
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,520
and the number keys and the home insert

2373
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,520
are just caked in filth

2374
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,520
You can't even read them

2375
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,520
because there's so much shit on them

2376
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,520
My old laptop used to be caked

2377
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,520
the buttons used to be caked

2378
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,520
It was horrible.

2379
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,520
I scraped it off with a screwdriver

2380
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,520
At the very top of the keyboard

2381
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,520
with the extra buttons and stuff

2382
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,520
All of them are caked except for the volume up

2383
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,520
and volume down which have a little halo

2384
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,520
of beautiful pristinness around them

2385
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,520
because I press them constantly

2386
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,520
I use them all the time

2387
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,520
Everything else is horribly filthy except for those buttons

2388
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,520
So yeah, you can immediately

2389
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,520
at first glance

2390
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,520
tell what buttons I press on this keyboard

2391
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,520
because all the ones I don't are like

2392
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,520
It's fucking horrible

2393
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Does anyone else do the thing

2394
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,520
where they take the keyboard and shake it upside down?

2395
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,520
I do that very regularly

2396
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,520
Sometimes nothing comes out

2397
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,520
and I'm like, yes

2398
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:08,520
For me, dealing with the keyboard

2399
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,520
Oh god, my mouse looks fucking

2400
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,520
like there's so much

2401
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,520
just gunk on my mouse

2402
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,520
from my greasy hands

2403
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,520
I try to clean my mouse fairly regularly

2404
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,520
but it just built

2405
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,520
I don't even think about it and then I look at it

2406
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,520
I usually have to start cleaning it off

2407
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,520
when it actually gets so caked up on the bottom

2408
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,520
that I can't move it correctly

2409
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,520
Yeah, that happens

2410
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,520
I wanted to raise

2411
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,520
a different issue

2412
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,520
to all of this stuff

2413
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,520
because we've been talking about hygiene

2414
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,520
in the context of the real world

2415
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,520
and the social standards

2416
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,520
that we're generally used to

2417
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,520
but I wanted to just

2418
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,520
I had a whole different way of looking at it

2419
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,520
based on one word

2420
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,520
and that word is pheromones

2421
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,520
If there is any reason to actually be

2422
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,520
worried as a society

2423
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,520
if we should shift our thinking

2424
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,520
to fuck all this hygiene shit

2425
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,520
embrace the fact that we're gross

2426
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,520
and we get oil on everything

2427
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,520
and that we're just animals and shit

2428
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,520
because I'm worried

2429
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,520
that I'm repressing my raw sexual energy

2430
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,520
by not getting my stank out there

2431
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,520
via pheromone

2432
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,520
or my pheromones out there via stank

2433
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,520
and my sexual prowess is being hampered

2434
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,520
by not being able to

2435
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,520
as a species, we've come to

2436
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,520
enjoy the feeling of being very clean

2437
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,520
so I don't think that's going to change

2438
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,520
I prefer being clean

2439
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,520
to being gross

2440
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,520
but I know what being gross is like

2441
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,520
I feel like people when pressed

2442
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,520
are eager to embrace

2443
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,520
hygiene and celebrate it

2444
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,520
but I think that

2445
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,520
almost everyone is nastier than they admit

2446
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,520
that B, because we all

2447
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,520
have different hygiene standards

2448
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,520
and all of us are nasty about something

2449
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,520
the other person doesn't think is nasty

2450
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,520
like DeVu not thinking comes a big deal

2451
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,520
whereas I think it's a

2452
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,520
totally gross and DeVu thinking

2453
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,520
that my bathroom being completely covered

2454
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,520
and piss is gross when I also agree

2455
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,520
that it's disgusting

2456
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,520
I really fucking hate this piss

2457
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,520
shaming going around

2458
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,520
I just think that

2459
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,520
when it comes down to it

2460
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,520
most of us don't care

2461
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,520
that much

2462
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,520
it's one thing when you're trying to be like

2463
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
oh I'm out on the prowl

2464
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,520
trying to pick up chicks

2465
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,520
I'm going to try to look smooth

2466
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,520
and confident and stuff

2467
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,520
but it's like when you actually have a girlfriend

2468
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,520
you probably spend a lot of time with the two of you

2469
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,520
you fucked 12 times in the same day

2470
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,520
you're both literally disgusting

2471
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,520
you are at the worst grossest you will ever be

2472
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,520
and that's just natural

2473
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,520
that's a natural state of being

2474
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,520
to just be covered in your own filth

2475
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
it's fucking natural

2476
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,520
you don't have to bring to piss

2477
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,520
piss isn't anything to be ashamed of

2478
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,520
it's a thing to be celebrating

2479
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,520
what makes the world go round

2480
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,520
piss is the only thing that I fucking live for

2481
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,520
in my entire life

2482
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,520
it's the only reason I work for the money

2483
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,520
why I even come on this podcast

2484
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,520
it's the only thing I want to do with my fucking time

2485
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,520
I feel it in my ears

2486
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,520
it's the only thing that I want to believe in

2487
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,520
now that's a munchy piss

2488
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,520
yeah he's got a lot more piss now

2489
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,520
but he did last time

2490
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,520
that's an impressive

2491
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,520
were you like chugging waters this whole time

2492
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,520
all of my DNA is piss

2493
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,520
that's all it is

2494
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,520
press one for piss

2495
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,520
munchy how much did you drink

2496
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,520
in the course of this

2497
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,520
I just want to fucking live in piss

2498
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,520
that's all I want to do

2499
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,520
I just want to continue being a piss boy

2500
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
that's all I fucking want to do

2501
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,520
I just want to become a piss guy

2502
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,520
I think this is a good time to take some

2503
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,520
reader questions

2504
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,520
we'll just let him

2505
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,520
we'll just let the sound of munchy's piss just be background noise

2506
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,520
is it still going

2507
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,520
it can't be

2508
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,520
well with that

2509
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,520
let's address at ken cray

2510
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,520
crayley

2511
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,520
yeah okay ken crayley

2512
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,520
yeah okay he asks

2513
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,520
I learned this week that a co-worker of mine

2514
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,520
knows about the PCP

2515
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,520
what should I do

2516
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,520
buy a fucking shirt from

2517
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,520
payompaom.com

2518
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,520
slash ben saint

2519
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,520
buy your fucking PCP guy's shirt

2520
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,520
if a guy take him out for beer

2521
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,520
if it's a girl take her out for beer

2522
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,520
and ask her or tell her that she has nice shoes

2523
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,520
tell her that she's young

2524
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,520
and that you have sex with the young

2525
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,520
munchy literally what did you drink

2526
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,520
what do you mean

2527
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,520
what did you drink in the last hour and a half

2528
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,520
to have that much piss

2529
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,520
maybe he drank it before the show

2530
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,520
but he pissed right at the start of the show

2531
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,520
yeah he did

2532
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,520
all I fucking do is

2533
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,520
I just drink my own piss

2534
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,520
what do you mean

2535
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,520
he drank last show's

2536
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,520
load

2537
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,520
oh no

2538
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,520
that's johnny walker

2539
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,520
third or fourth harvest

2540
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,520
I'll just drink a johnny walker

2541
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,520
and then my fourth harvest

2542
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,520
after I pissed it out and drank it back again

2543
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,520
that's what I'm drinking right now

2544
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,520
I'm honestly on my fifth harvest right now

2545
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,520
it's getting pretty up there

2546
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,520
let's move on to our next question

2547
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,520
I'm so fucking pissed right now

2548
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,520
the procrastinator's podcast is going to develop

2549
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,520
a reputation as the podcast

2550
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,520
where a guy pisses on air

2551
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,520
that's gonna be what we're going for

2552
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,520

oh man you know what um

2571
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520

2585
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,520
that's all you had to say

2586
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,520
that's all you had to say

2587
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,520
that's all you had to say

2588
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,520
is it normal for your piss to be like

2589
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,520
boiling

2590
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,520
usually

2591
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,520
that would mean that you haven't

2592
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,520
you haven't been hydrated well

2593
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,520
it's like

2594
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520
if your piss boils

2595
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520
I feel like it is top ramen juice

2596
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520

2597
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,520

bestest guy ever

2605
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,520
I tweeted a bunch of shit today

2606
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,520
oh my god that picture with the lady

2607
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,520
today

2608
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,520
April 15th 2017

2609
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,520
go back to that day

2610
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,520
go to that day and look at my shit

2611
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,520
so I was at the creationist museum

2612
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
so my parents are in town

2613
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,520
they were just coming for a visit

2614
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,520
and then they were just looking for

2615
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,520
shit to do and one of the things

2616
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,520
that was like suggested

2617
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,520
to my mom which is like at the hotel or something

2618
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,520
was doing ziplines and so the place they were

2619
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,520
signing up for didn't have any available

2620
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,520
so we were just like hey well that sounds like a cool idea

2621
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,520
let's see if there's another one nearby

2622
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,520
and the second one was this it was called like

2623
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,520
scream and raptor ziplines

2624
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,520
and we're like okay that sounds cool

2625
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,520
so we get there and we realize it's

2626
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,520
the fucking creationist museum

2627
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,520
I had no idea such a thing existed

2628
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
I've heard about it a lot over the years

2629
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,520
I listened to a bunch of fucking atheist shit

2630
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,520
because that's all I think about I much hate fucking god

2631
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,520
so I get there and

2632
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,520
you just

2633
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,520
you just choose to hate him

2634
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,520
that's the atheist position

2635
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,520
we know he's real we're just mad at him

2636
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,520
when you go there do they just hand you

2637
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,520
a flyer that just says

2638
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,520
carbon dating what

2639
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
dude the thing about this that was most

2640
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
fascinating was that the place was covered

2641
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,520
in dinosaurs it was like

2642
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,520
mostly dinosaur themed

2643
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,520
right I couldn't like we didn't buy tickets

2644
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,520
to go inside to see any of the

2645
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,520
indoor exhibits and shit but I've seen

2646
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,520
like pictures because this place is famous

2647
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,520
I know they have pictures of like cavemen

2648
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,520
hanging out with dinosaurs in that place

2649
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,520
obviously it's fucking fascinating

2650
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,520
you know because it's like

2651
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,520
the humans live together with dinosaurs

2652
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,520
on Atlantis I mean before Atlantis

2653
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,520
or El and the Mars came

2654
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,520
they were hanging out with the necals

2655
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,520
I'm pretty sure like four out of five necals

2656
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,520
were raptors

2657
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,520
let me just clarify right they based

2658
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,520
the zipline technology on the necol

2659
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,520
technology that's right just so you people know

2660
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,520
the creations zipline technology

2661
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,520
brought to us from

2662
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,520
fucking Mars

2663
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,520
just so you know

2664
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,520
people the creations museum just to clarify

2665
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,520
it is a Christian

2666
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,520
biblical like Genesis origin

2667
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,520
museum like evidence for

2668
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,520
why Genesis is true and accurate

2669
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,520
fucking yes like this is a six thousand

2670
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,520
years old thing and they like

2671
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,520
and

2672
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,520
a model of the

2673
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,520
like life-sized model of a room on Noah's

2674
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,520
Ark that you were at

2675
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,520
yeah and that's like

2676
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,520
check it out guys we remade

2677
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,520
one of the like hundred and sixty six rooms

2678
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,520
that was in Noah's Ark

2679
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,520
here's the Bible passage that talks about it

2680
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,520
here's and this is it this is what

2681
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
Noah was dealing with when he packed literally

2682
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,520
two of every animal onto this Ark

2683
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,520
everyone else in the world was killed by God

2684
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,520
and he and his family single-handedly restarted

2685
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,520
humanity yeah and every other animal

2686
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,520
is there a big display all about the

2687
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,520
is there all a big display like about the continental

2688
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,520
drift and it was like after Noah

2689
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,520
continental drift really got its head out of its

2690
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,520
ass and made Australia

2691
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,520
that's why

2692
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,520
not at that part now if I worked for the

2693
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,520
creationist museum I know and I worked to like

2694
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,520
design a set I know what I do because

2695
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,520
it'd be based off of a really good creationist

2696
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,520
argument I once heard so this would be

2697
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,520
the display there'd be the

2698
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,520
the skeleton of like a Chihuahua

2699
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,520
and it'd be like uh-huh look at this

2700
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,520
Chihuahua you know we you know

2701
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,520
using our top scientists you know we can guess

2702
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,520
it was like 500 million years ago 700 million

2703
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,520
years ago we just make guesses we scientists

2704
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,520
we know what we're doing right you know

2705
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,520
the fact that meteorologists can't predict the

2706
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,520
weather within the next week but they all know about

2707
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,520
climate change and evolution sure sure we all

2708
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
know that right lol then

2709
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,520
then right next to it show the body

2710
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,520
the skeleton of a great

2711
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
Dane be like see now look at this

2712
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,520
look look at how the Chihuahua

2713
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,520
evolved into a great Dane over the course

2714
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,520
of millions of years right because this is

2715
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,520
hypothetical if this took place 50

2716
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,520
million years in the future where all dogs were

2717
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,520
extinct and all we had with the bones we'd be like

2718
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,520
look see this evolution where this creature got

2719
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,520
tall huh see that's evolution

2720
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,520
right right guys huh

2721
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,520
huh and then like when you leave that particular

2722
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,520
place there's like there's like five people

2723
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,520
who like rub their their elbows and you'd be

2724
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,520
like huh you get it you get it see see

2725
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,520
how that looks like evolution

2726
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,520
I are you making an argument about how like

2727
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,520
I know a lot of creationists make the micro

2728
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
like they say of course my oh yeah

2729
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
oh yeah it's like macro evolution

2730
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,520
to say and that they're that there's things

2731
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,520
that could be mistaken for yeah yeah

2732
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,520
and that's evidence against oh man

2733
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,520
oh my god oh my god yeah

2734
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
the whole micro evolution thing is my favorite

2735
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,520
argument and having a creationist dad I've gotten

2736
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,520
to have a number of times this for like a

2737
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,520
Christian well it's so short though it's

2738
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,520
a really short debate right so it is

2739
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,520
as follows but it's like well yeah I know

2740
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,520
speciation where like

2741
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,520
you know hair can grow in or shrink in

2742
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,520
length and colors can change and I'm

2743
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,520
like doesn't that shit stack

2744
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,520
yeah and then he's dead he's

2745
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,520
dead he's fucking dead it's the shortest

2746
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,520
debate I've ever had in my life and yet

2747
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,520
they I don't know they cling to it for whatever

2748
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,520
but anyway well it's because it's the

2749
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,520
species is defined by what you can breed

2750
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,520
so even if you micro evolve

2751
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,520
the whole fuck ton if you can still

2752
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,520
breed with the original species then you

2753
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,520
haven't become a new me I love that quote you did

2754
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,520
cling to it they cling to their guns and

2755
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,520
to their religion Pokemon go to the polls

2756
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,520
that's that's that's why I voted for

2757
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,520
Hilary got into this museum

2758
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,520
and you took this amazing picture where

2759
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,520
this this lady looks

2760
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,520
really upset well hey let me let me

2761
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,520
say there's a couple big yeah the first

2762
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,520
one is is me like bowing

2763
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,520
in awe of the creationist museum and then

2764
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,520
the next one is me yeah so

2765
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,520
like so I'm I want there's a dinosaur

2766
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
there and before we left I wanted to get a picture

2767
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,520
of it so my mother who I had

2768
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,520
with me I had to her take the picture

2769
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,520
by the way my parents are basically

2770
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,520
non-religious for the most part I think

2771
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,520
my dad believes in some spooky shit but he doesn't

2772
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,520
really talk about that much so I don't really know

2773
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,520
like we all made fun of this shit the whole time

2774
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,520
yeah

2775
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,520
the Holy Ghost

2776
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,520
all the time this spooky shit

2777
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,520
I don't want to get haunted by the Holy Ghost

2778
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,520
dad dad dad

2779
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,520
except the existence of the occasional

2780
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,520
Babadook

2781
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,520
yeah that's right

2782
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,520
he was off of the bathroom and so I give my mom

2783
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,520
this thing and I'm just like I just yelled at my mom

2784
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,520
so I had just done the pose in front

2785
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,520
of the in front of the thing like like looking

2786
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,520
up at the sign in awe and

2787
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,520
I was already yelling I'm just like yo ma

2788
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,520
I'm gonna throw up some gang signs I say

2789
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,520
just like that and I pose in front

2790
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,520
of this dinosaur and the just the best thing

2791
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,520
was that this this fucking family

2792
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,520
was in the picture go go look at the

2793
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,520
fucking tweets the best thing I've ever done

2794
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,520
and she just she's so mad

2795
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,520
she's so fucking mad

2796
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,520
she's making a mockery

2797
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,520
also you know what this is this is relevant

2798
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,520
she was all because that family was black

2799
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,520
right they should have like a black guy

2800
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,520
who like works there is like yeah you know

2801
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,520
when you think about it the theory of evolution

2802
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
is essentially racist because it implies

2803
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,520
that there was this evolution after black

2804
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,520
people and white people are a higher

2805
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,520
advanced state of evolution that white

2806
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,520
people are the superior

2807
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,520
races that's what we're talking about here

2808
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,520
interesting interesting platform

2809
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,520
you guys have yes yes

2810
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,520
that's my platform for sure

2811
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,520
that's what I was trying to communicate through this tweet

2812
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,520
she definitely her face to me

2813
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,520

2818
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,520

01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,520
and Chuckie I mean I

2820
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,520
show of it I was sort of yelling to

2821
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,520
people I was

2822
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,520
sort of just mocking everybody there yeah

2823
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,520
it was great it was super fun by the way those

2824
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,520
were tight as fuck and there were

2825
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,520
biblical scriptures like on the ziplines

2826
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,520
like oh yeah

2827
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,520
oh my god

2828
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,520
god is god is my wings let him carry me

2829
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,520
oh my god this fucking zipline

2830
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,520
Exodus 102 from that shit

2831
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,520
I don't know

2832
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,520
every time you go down the zipline

2833
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,520
one chakra aligns

2834
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,520
in your body every

2835
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,520
trip down the zipline increases your christ

2836
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,520
consciousness by one dimension

2837
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,520
yeah exactly but walking back

2838
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,520
it takes it away

2839
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,520
well you gotta find

2840
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,520
like an infinite zipline that just keeps going down

2841
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,520
at my max what do you think my christ consciousness

2842
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,520
was elevated to just by being in proximity

2843
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,520
of all this all these normally like like

2844
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,520
normal people are at a two

2845
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,520
baseline and and I'm

2846
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,520
I would say that you like at your

2847
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,520
height would honestly get to like

2848
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,520
like a hard like five

2849
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,520
or a or a or a light six

2850
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,520
check those tweets I was

2851
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,520
I was feeling I was feeling that crystal and energy

2852
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,520
pulsating within me I could feel it

2853
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,520
just check that like your blood

2854
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,520
probably turned into crystals and like

2855
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,520
hard and you can see the fucking Nicole

2856
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,520
trying to teach you about stairs type evolution

2857
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,520
fucking toad son probably

2858
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,520
no toad son came down to the

2859
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,520
creation museum and he was like

2860
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,520
hey god hey bros doing good

2861
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,520
shit I got from

2862
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,520
god check it ziplines

2863
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,520
and the creation museum

2864
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,520
god's real we knew it

2865
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,520
got that fucking stairs

2866
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,520
evolution motherfucker

2867
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,520
and

2868
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,520
that's the story

2869
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
my christ consciousness is not high enough

2870
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,520
level to understand what's going on here

2871
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,520
yeah you can't even process that shit

2872
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,520
yeah we got a couple more here's one

2873
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
jenny's at jenny's

2874
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
maku domaru maku domaru

2875
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
this guy tweets us all the time

2876
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,520
says what's up with the hacking

2877
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,520
these days

2878
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,520
there's trouble with that shit

2879
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,520
there's this hacker group called

2880
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,520
ourmine

2881
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,520
they've got their own wikipedia article and everything

2882
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,520
they've hacked everybody in the world

2883
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,520
apparently lots of famous

2884
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,520
people and shit and now they've

2885
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
been hacking into youtube

2886
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,520
networks and just getting access to

2887
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,520
all their channels and changing the

2888
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,520
titles and descriptions on the videos

2889
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,520
just to advertise themselves

2890
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,520
I think they're probably selling something

2891
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,520
but you know what they're selling

2892
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,520
they're selling like anti piracy

2893
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,520
shit like anti

2894
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,520
that's being able to hack you

2895
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,520
software but uh

2896
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,520
they just so happened to

2897
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
hack the network studio

2898
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,520
71 like three days

2899
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,520
after I joined that studio

2900
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,520
after like four years of not

2901
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,520
having joined a network so

2902
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,520
get fuck dude

2903
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,520
are you staying with that those guys

2904
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,520
for now I mean

2905
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,520
I signed a contract with them but

2906
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,520
the thing about it is that they're

2907
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,520
I'll talk about this at a later date

2908
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,520
sure but the thing about it is that they're

2909
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
not exactly a network

2910
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,520
they're more of a talent agency that

2911
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,520
has a network so that's

2912
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,520
why I'm working with them but uh

2913
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,520
you know I'll get into that later when I've got

2914
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,520
more to say about it

2915
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,520
I almost

2916
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,520
I got a vibe okay

2917
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,520
yesterday I spent the better half

2918
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,520
of my afternoon pissing my pants

2919
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,520
because I was

2920
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,520
I had actually

2921
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,520
it's an all day affair

2922
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,520
I

2923
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,520
I was on google

2924
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,520
and this isn't a fucking joke

2925
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,520
I was typing in what causes

2926
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
autism

2927
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,520
and I

2928
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,520
it's not a joke

2929
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,520
oh god

2930
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,520
and I clicked the first link

2931
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,520
and I went to a page

2932
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,520
like I have

2933
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,520
since done this on other devices and it doesn't go

2934
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
to the page that I clicked on so I literally think

2935
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,520
it's an autism ghost

2936
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,520
page that I found

2937
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,520
and I clicked on like I took I clicked on a link

2938
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,520
and took me to like this weird like this

2939
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,520
weird like obvious porn ad and it was

2940
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,520
like a booming face came over and it was like

2941
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,520
uh I am from

2942
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,520

2944
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,520
and I'll fucking fix your shit dude promise

2945
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,520
and I was like oh I'm

2946
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,520
scared of things so I

2947
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,520
I close I close

2948
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
my firefox and I didn't I didn't want to have

2949
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,520
anything to do with it but

2950
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,520
here's the thing the voice

2951
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
kept going after I closed

2952
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,520
firefox oh no

2953
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,520

2954
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,520
they're in the walls now dude

2955
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,520
exactly exactly so I

01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,520
immediately piss and shit my pants

2957
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,520
me too

2958
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,520
it's a defense mechanism

2959
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,520
it's self defense

2960
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,520
self defense

2961
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,520
no one's gonna want to hack me if I pissed myself

2962
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,520
they will be so I called

2963
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,520

01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,520

yeah exactly

2982
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
all because I wanted to know what caused

2983
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,520
autism

2984
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,520
autism you know I think we if we

2985
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:52,520
could find if we can find pinpoint

2986
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,520
if we can use our fucking crystalline

2987
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
sensor technology to find the one place on the planet

2988
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,520
where some persons Christ consciousness has

2989
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,520
spiked to unbelievable level

2990
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,520
we'll know who has munchies secrets

2991
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,520
we'll know where he is

2992
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,520
we'll never find out what causes autism

2993
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,520
no

2994
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,520
he never found out

2995
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,520
that's the greatest crime of all

2996
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,520
oh tragic

2997
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,520
this is like a superfine version too

2998
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,520
like the entire time I had to jump through hoops

2999
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,520
I had to download a whole bunch of shit

3000
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
and the entire time

3001
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,520
a couple times my computer just

3002
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,520
shut off at random

3003
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
and I relate this to my

3004
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,520
friend and this is

3005
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,520
my greatest fear

3006
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,520
at one time Nate talked about how like

3007
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,520
if he had a runny nose and he couldn't breathe

3008
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,520
baby shit

3009
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,520
here is the greatest fear

3010
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,520
I could possibly have not a fucking joke

3011
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,520
I get a virus

3012
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,520
and then I'm like I'm going about my day

3013
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,520
I'm just going about like doing whatever

3014
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,520
playing games I have a virus

3015
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
it's dormant and then like

3016
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,520
a pop-up window happens and like

3017
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,520
some dude just starts laughing at me and it's like

3018
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,520
I'm in the computer bitch

3019
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,520
and then he's like he just starts laughing at me

3020
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,520
like I don't know what to do because he's

3021
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,520
complete control of my computer and then he just starts going

3022
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,520
to like gore websites and he's like you like this

3023
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,520
huh this is what you like

3024
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,520
and I'm like no it's not

3025
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
it's not what I like

3026
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,520
that's the worst thing

3027
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,520
that's all I could think about when I was trying to

3028
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,520
get the virus off my computer

3029
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,520
it's like a black guy is going to show up and he's going to make me see gore

3030
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,520
he's going to make me see gore

3031
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,520
I think something similar

3032
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,520
I mean I haven't like had my computer

3033
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
completely taken over but there was this one time

3034
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
when I got a virus and it changed

3035
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
my desktop background and it would not stop

3036
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,520
playing music and I couldn't

3037
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,520
do anything so I had to reformat the whole

3038
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
hard drive I think I was like 12

3039
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
I remember one time when I was a kid

3040
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,520
I was like wondering to myself is it possible

3041
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,520
just possible like theoretically

3042
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,520
to have a virus that just overloads

3043
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,520
the wires and like

3044
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,520
mechanizes them and like turn and like

3045
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,520
all the wires and fucking systems

3046
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,520
they start flapping around in there

3047
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,520
making a huge noise and they turn into like a little RC

3048
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,520
helicopter or a little drone

3049
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
that busts out of your case

3050
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,520
and stabs the shit out of you

3051
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,520
that's basically possible in that show

3052
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,520
fucking computers are terrifying

3053
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
I want more questions man these are good questions

3054
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
we got two more yeah these were pretty good

3055
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,520
I went through the whole list ahead of time and found the best ones

3056
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,520
okay here we go

3057
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,520
at Zana J

3058
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,520
it's like x-i-n-i-j-e I don't know how to pronounce this shit

3059
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,520
okay this person has some very important questions

3060
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,520
guys jesus man

3061
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,520
yeah I don't know man this person

3062
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,520
asked what would you do

3063
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,520
to punish Ben St.'s crimes against humanity

3064
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,520
I assume

3065
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
this is a good question

3066
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,520
it's gotta come up at some point

3067
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,520
is it

3068
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,520
Ben's Crimes Against Polk?

3069
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,520
that's what I was wondering

3070
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,520
I would make Ben take a public shit

3071
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,520
no

3072
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
I can't even take a private shit

3073
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,520
without running the water so no one can hear it

3074
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,520
exactly

3075
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
we gotta have a toilet

3076
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
up on a podium in the middle of town

3077
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,520
square and he has to take a public shit

3078
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,520
I'm just saying

3079
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,520
that's one step up from a group shit

3080
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,520
that's like a public shit

3081
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
we should do a group public shit

3082
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,520
I'm imagining

3083
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,520
I'm on murderers

3084
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,520
row

3085
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:18,520
I'm being walked to the gallows and the whole PCP

3086
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,520
is prodding me along

3087
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,520
and they walk me up a big ramp

3088
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,520
up to the top of a statue

3089
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,520
in town square and I squat down

3090
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,520
and I'm just like weeping

3091
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,520
the tears are flowing

3092
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
and I'm like I can't do it

3093
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,520
and then just

3094
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,520
munchy comes

3095
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,520
and squats down next to me in solidarity

3096
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
and then everyone looks at each other

3097
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
everyone looks at each other

3098
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,520
and they all come and squat next to me

3099
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,520
and the tears just get even stronger

3100
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,520
and I'm like I love you guys so much

3101
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,520
and

3102
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,520
I'm imagining this is like

3103
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,520
a possibly tall statue

3104
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,520
and the people can barely hear us

3105
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,520
but then people are like

3106
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,520
shush shush shush we need to hear the shit

3107
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,520
we need to hear the shit noises

3108
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,520
and then it's like

3109
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,520
Bahudorus the song from

3110
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,520
the Grinch and then they hear from the top of the statue

3111
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,520
and we're all singing like group poop

3112
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,520
group poop

3113
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,520
I imagine this

3114
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,520
and passersby just behold

3115
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,520
this miraculous spectacle with tears in their eyes

3116
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,520
as shit as just particles of shit

3117
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,520
and splatters just like come down

3118
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,520
just rain down upon them

3119
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
I think that's far too romantic of a possibility

3120
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:28,520
I think more of that he gets the chair

3121
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,520
and it's all dramatic and some fucking

3122
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,520
some sort of like a new metal song

3123
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,520
is playing over it like

3124
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,520
into the ground

3125
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,520
and his heart stops

3126
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,520
then fucking Max revive

3127
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,520
he busts out

3128
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,520
he gets out

3129
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,520
because you know the law says

3130
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,520
according to the law

3131
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,520
if you survive

3132
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,520
the fucking execution then you're off free

3133
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,520
apparently that's what I've heard

3134
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,520
you're not punished to be killed

3135
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,520
you're punished to have this thing happen to you

3136
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,520
that kills you so like if it doesn't kill you

3137
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,520
then you're fucking free

3138
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,520
fucked up

3139
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,520
and on that

3140
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
hygienic note

3141
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
I think we should end the podcast

3142
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,520
that's a good shit moment to end

3143
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,520
possibly

3144
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
that is fine by me

3145
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,520
wasn't there one more question

3146
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,520
maybe there was

3147
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,520
but by the way about the shitting thing

3148
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
I just want to let you know once you get someone

3149
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,520
Ben in this case to shit publicly one time

3150
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
once you force him to do it you won't be able to stop

3151
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
you shit publicly

3152
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,520
I'm just letting you know

3153
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,520
a whole new world opens up

3154
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,520
yeah exactly

3155
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,520
he's not proud of it

3156
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
he just can't stop

3157
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,520
people are coming up to him

3158
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,520
what are you fucking doing man

3159
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,520
I don't know

3160
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,520
I can't shit in that tiny bathroom anymore

3161
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,520
it just feels wrong it doesn't feel right anymore

3162
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,520
I have this new urge

3163
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,520
these are horizons of Ben Broden

3164
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,520
I have a punishment

3165
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,520
for Ben Stain

3166
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:00,520
every time that he

3167
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,520
fucking gets a dollar on Patreon

3168
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,520
his bones get stronger

3169
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,520
he gets more calcium

3170
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,520
why is that a punishment

3171
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,520
he is

3172
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,520
