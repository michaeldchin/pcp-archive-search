00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi, Ben from the future here with a, I think this episode merits a bit of explanation. You see, you know, as every commenter has pointed out, the PCP has been a little bit, a little bit low energy lately, a little bit, a little bit low attendance lately.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You know, it's just been, just been some quiet, intimate, one on one, one on one on one kind of little conversations, just about whatever I want to talk about.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And that is obviously a huge, huge problem. So instead we decided, we decided to swing the pendulum hard, well I decided, this is me, it's my fault, blame me.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Swing the pendulum hard the other way, and say, no, fuck that, high energy, everybody, get in here, so I, you know, I had a couple of vodka gimlets, and I decided to put out a tweet saying, who wants to be on the next PCP episode?

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And that's what this is. This is PCP episode 200 and whatever. Oops, all guests addition. Anyone who wanted to be on the podcast? Here they are. On the freaking podcast. I hope you enjoy the high energy that is about to ensue.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Power to the people, you're welcome. Oh, but anyway, before we get underway, I want you to know that this episode is actually seven different episodes because the guests were split into teams.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They were invited to separate themselves into six colored teams, red, blue, yellow, green, pink, purple, before the episode began.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I did not explain to them what the teams would be used for, but in the end, we split up the team, or the guests into groups, and then went group to group to group, having conversations, doing voicemails, doing a little chit chat, having a little sesh.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So we have the main episode that follows me, Tom, and Gibb going group to group to group talking to everyone, but we also have the separate editions. We have red edition, yellow edition, blue edition, etc.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That is just the groups chat alone, including the parts that me, Tom, and Gibb were in. So if you want to hear, we have a we have a little like a like light through a prism. This episode is split split into a rainbow, a rainbow of content for your enjoyment.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So we'll put this, we'll include a link to a playlist of all the different teams. There'll be link link in the description. So if you are interested to hear each individual team and what they talked about during this clusterfuck of an episode, there you go.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There'll be down there in the, in the, in the box. Just, just a heads up. Okay. Without further ado, let's, let's get this show pony on the road, pony. Baby.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:20,000
One more time. Three, two, one, sing. Okay. And remember, do not leave the call at the end until we sync at the end again. Very important.

14
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Welcome to the pro crass podcast. We're on, we're live, we're doing it. It's the, oh God, how did all these fucking people get in here?

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Ben saying, and we've got, we got Tom Oliver, we got Gibb and take, and we have like 40 other people.

16
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
People are saying that was decided to remedy that by inviting everyone on.

17
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Everyone said, oh, oh, where, oh, where's Jeff? And you know what, we've got, we've got better, we've got better options now.

18
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
All those people are in the past. This is the future. And the future belongs to the people.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
As someone could say, we're better than they.

20
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ah, yes. The people's favorite.

21
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So, um, all right. Topics, suggestions, everyone.

22
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We're going to need some order in here.

23
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Guys, we're really going to need some order in here. Everybody's going to need to quiet down.

24
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Guys, we're flamboyant. Are you sure you go to voicemails?

25
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

26
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How about voicemails? It just is the topic.

27
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have a question. You guys are all, you guys could all like give a voicemail live inside the call.

28
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

29
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Too much pressure.

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can we go to voicemails?

31
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We've got a lot of ladies.

32
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is a very good game.

33
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We've got the voicemail team.

34
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I got it.

35
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I love the energy and I want to say this is exactly what the PCP has been missing lately.

36
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I feel refreshed. I feel energized. I feel empowered. I feel emboldened.

37
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do we dare to go like down the list and like have everyone introduce themselves?

38
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think I want to do that. I think we can do it.

39
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's start at the top.

40
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Bring back the interview.

41
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No, shut up.

42
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Who fucking invited you?

43
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Pap Jelly Beaner. Who the fuck are you?

44
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hold on.

45
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Welcome to the Skauby Snacks Man.

46
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hey, Jelly Beaner. What's going on?

47
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Pap Jelly Beaner.

48
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
A great quote from a great man in Talladega Nights. If you're not first, you're fucking last.

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If you want great fucking shaggy impressions, go to fiverr.com.

50
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's the best thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hey, who's Pap Ben Sainte?

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Bitch on Ben Sainte.

53
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It is.

54
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Bitch on Ben Sainte.

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm excited to tell everyone.

56
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Bitch on Ben Sainte.

57
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who's this Pap Kosol?

58
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Kosol.

59
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How do you say it?

60
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, no.

61
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
C-Tool.

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
C-Tool.

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You say it like C-Tool.

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
C-Tool.

65
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh my god.

66
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She's a long time.

67
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't even know what you mean, Quinn.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why would you say C-Tool?

69
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't care.

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't care.

71
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's just funny.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She doesn't care.

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm C-Tool.

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She's too old.

75
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm C-Tool.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But you might know me, but I'll ask the person who makes you want to die.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm too old.

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I am too old.

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, no, no.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Can I get an U-Woo in chat, please?

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's the stuff.

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Guys, what's your favorite anime?

84
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wait your fucking turn.

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's just Ben Sainte guy.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Who's FAP Tony M?

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you doing?

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That would be me.

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm here because I sock Ben on Twitter.

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How my life is gone.

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Follow Ben on Twitter.

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Follow my hot takes on Twitter for more of that.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No, don't do it.

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No, don't do it.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hap Chocomoto.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How are you?

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You know, I'm doing good.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm that fucking duck Chocomoto.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm repping my purple bros.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's it.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey-oh.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Purple bros.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We will talk about this later, but we did.

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We are divided into teams.

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We do have races, if you will.

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Races, if you will.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We do have allegiances.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But we'll raise war.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Who's up next?

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hap Duncun.

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hi, I'm Duncun.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm also not a daddy anyway.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am the most racist.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I run the purple team and we will destroy the other teams

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
because they're different colors.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Raise war.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Raise war.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Raise war.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Raise war.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Raise war.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Raise war.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Base war.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Nice chance to be a purple team.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Very coordinating.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hap Eleazar slash FER.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who the fuck are you?

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm the editor of the PCP.

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Ben, why do you do this to me?

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How do you prepare for me to edit this episode?

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My beauty is going to blow.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We have an editor?

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We have a podcast?

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't edit anything.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Just put all the audio files together.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And that's the episode.

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't do anything.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, yeah.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's so fun.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Eleazar is so easy.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like, what are you even talking about?

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah.

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Like, what do you do?

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What do you do?

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm making a joke about not having an editor.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So why don't you make this episode sound like we don't?

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Perfect.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Kajorah Bitterthorn.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's just going to be why Kajorah Bitterthorn.

He's also brown.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Same.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No need, bro.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Who are you?

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm here to also wrap the purple team.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Procrastinator's Anonymous is better.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Procrastinator's Anonymous swiftly colonized the purple team,

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
leading to a huge power imbalance that will have repercussions throughout history.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Rito Torpedo also, Pap.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What's up?

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, yes.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I majored in offensive cooming and I have a minor in phrenology.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
With a pedigree like that, you're doomed to be a barista, I think.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Bazinga.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No barista.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No barista.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Pap Shondan.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How's it going?

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey, guys.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm a big gamer, notorious gamer, big Yu-Gi-Oh head.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's also what I'm known as.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm also a big proponent of the N word, because I am the king of the Nate heads.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Fuck them.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Fuck Nate heads.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, no.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Amen to that.

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The real N word.

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That took a good twist.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We all got nervous, but humor is the relief of tension.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So you create that tension, then your relief, and everyone goes, ah, ha, ha, ha.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And we're in that way.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just like bad sex that could have been worse.

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Pat Kodow.

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Pat Zach Def, what's up?

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, sup man.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is going to be hell.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He's so silly, so funny.

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I wanted to die.

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That concludes the anonymous proportion of the introductions.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah.

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
See you next episode.

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, that's it.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Boop Mozilla Fennekin, what are you doing here?

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's a good question.

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How did I get in here?

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's all because I finally got out of voice jail.

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hooray.

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I would like to thank the Academy.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thanks.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And now I'm starting my own podcast.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I am the sole representative of the podcast of old fashioned piss shitting.

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How did you get out of voice jail again?

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You bailed me out.

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Who the fuck?

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I bailed myself out, actually.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
On the stream?

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Was that from the stream?

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's all thanks to Black Lives.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The stream that destroyed the channel, you know.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The stream that got it.

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Hey, Bev, who are you again?

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm here to rep the yellow team and the real purple team, the cop killers.

240
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes.

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Just going to say, it's almost just a school certainty.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Someone here has coronavirus and that's pretty funny.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah.

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is it, is it, do you think so?

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How likely do you think there's 50 people?

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Or something like that, 40.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, maybe in the server, not in the call.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, it's a good one.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Fun fact.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If you cough into your microphone, you give people computer viruses instead.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, no.

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Gabe, why would you even make it when you have people to cough on their mic?

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like, yeah.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The podcast is very dangerous.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Please don't.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Everyone start coughing on their mic right now.

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That would be so terrible.

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is the place.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Come now.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay.

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Shut up, everyone.

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Hey, Bobby.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey, Bobby.

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's up?

268
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What's going on?

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What's happening?

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm just here to rep the pink team today.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I want to say fuck purple team.

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
None of you guys are funny.

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, you can suck my dick.

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're late to a death.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, no.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Totally not something so beautiful like pink.

277
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Listen, buddy, don't threaten to have me suck your dick.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You'll regret it.

279
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah.

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, my God.

281
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This check out really gay real fast.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey, what's a chilling chocolate?

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think I've seen, I think I know that guy.

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What's up?

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I fuck ass.

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I shouldn't glass.

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I fuck wrong.

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I break off.

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm just here.

291
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
To represent the yellow team, the purple team blew their load.

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We're already past them.

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And now all us yellows can just come together and recognizing purple is a horrible color.

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's for the children of the lie.

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yellows.

296
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm all sick of you.

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

298
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, God, love this.

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I preach.

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Praise God.

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yep.

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
CJ, how are you today?

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I loved you and GTA.

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What?

305
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Is it the fat guy?

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, no.

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I didn't get the black guy.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I was thinking the fat guy I was thinking of was also black.

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, sorry.

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hard one.

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You don't like big smoke.

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's the GTA 5 protagonist.

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So like interesting caricature characters.

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Um, so anyways, CJ, how you doing?

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm doing good.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm happy to be here to represent the blue team.

317
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Perpetual underdogs, the blue team.

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We are the underdogs.

319
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm pretty sure we actually have like the least team members.

320
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, it's green.

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's green.

322
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is there is?

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, God knows guys.

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Blue team is still better.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Green is a numerical minority, but they have an outsized cultural impact.

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They own the entertainment industry.

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So it's not a creative color.

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Guilty as trash.

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Uh, hey, Dan.

330
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What's the big smoke doing?

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hello there.

332
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I just wanted to say that can we please make the thumbnail for this episode

333
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that one image of Homer in the bar with all the,

334
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, you can't.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, we can't.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Homer in the bar with all the what?

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
All the people around and he's just so cramped and uncomfortable.

338
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Post it.

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Post it in general.

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know the senior talk.

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I am in favor generally of, um, Simpsons posting.

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Great idea.

344
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But Eleazar, can you edit the faces of each Simpsons character to all of our faces?

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah.

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I want exactly this many figures on the thumbnail.

347
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I want each one to be discernible at a glance in the side.

348
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Can you deep fake the entire episode to their faces?

349
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I like the idea.

350
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Jamele boss being our favorite.

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Icon on the screen.

352
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This is like cats where the whole thing is just introduction.

353
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Come on.

354
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I, all right.

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
All right.

356
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
All right.

357
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Fan base.

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey, who's that fan base?

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What's up?

360
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I made his video.

361
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay.

362
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

363
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I thought you were silent for a second.

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You edit videos.

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Who would do such a thing?

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's a bad reaction.

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Fan base is lagging a little bit.

368
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Maybe it's like far away from my microphone.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That might be it.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, there you are.

371
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I was just leaning back.

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But I guess I can't do that.

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, maybe that's why you're quiet.

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's like, it just takes so long for my voice to reach the microphone.

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm speaking through a tin can to connect to do a string from like my neighbor's tree

377
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
house.

378
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's been a little loopy.

379
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's been a little loopy.

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a sound wave.

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It moves slower here in England.

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm not sure if this person joined.

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We have been saints now.

384
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
One of those fun Google.

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah.

387
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, the other one.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Wait, who is that?

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think they joined.

390
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's been saying, duh.

391
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Who are you?

392
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Wait, can we just all.

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This person's verified.

395
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This person's blue.

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So they should be.

397
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No.

398
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't think he's not recording.

399
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you?

400
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Are you sure?

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He hasn't said anything at all.

402
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah.

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
By the way, I think.

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay.

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

406
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Wait, what?

407
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Greg.

408
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's over.

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Killed.

410
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, I mean, okay.

411
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I mean, whatever.

412
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's fine.

413
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's fine.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No, no.

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's been.

416
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We can all be bent.

417
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We could.

418
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah.

419
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's fine.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's fine.

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We're.

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
We're changing.

423
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay.

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay.

425
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Fat man falling.

426
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
How, how's it going?

427
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hey, I am doing good.

428
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I just put out a video.

429
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm only here for self promotion.

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Go watch it.

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hi.

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey.

433
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm only here for self promotion.

434
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Go watch it.

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hi.

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm a degenerate.

437
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Go punish me by disliking my video.

438
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait, you don't know what your video is.

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tell us what your video is.

440
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Post.

441
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, what is the video?

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's a Ruby volume six review.

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I complain about fake anime.

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I have no personality of my own.

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I want to watch it.

446
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I want to watch it.

447
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ruby rose better than age bomber guys with you.

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It is.

449
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think I can.

451
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Your channel is also called fat man falling.

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay.

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
All right.

454
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Give it a fucking.

455
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Give it a fucking down vote.

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Give go report it.

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't wait to learn that Ruby season six is bad.

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I can't wait to find that out.

459
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This mystery.

460
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Fuck boy McSweet.

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Tell me your life story right now.

462
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
My life story.

463
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay.

464
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So here we go.

465
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I am the bastard spawn of sick Rick the creator of multiple me by

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
unless just.

467
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then I died.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And in that span of time, I created an album.

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And now I'm just dead.

470
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If only we could have had sick Rick in here instead of his

471
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
worthless fail son.

472
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That was that would be that would be legendary.

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Who's playing that.

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Based.

476
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Who's this Gibbon take character.

477
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think we can skip that.

478
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't think that's important.

479
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Did she.

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They're not recording.

481
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
She's not.

482
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She's not recording.

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
She's not talking.

484
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

485
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
This is the worst thing that I'm going to fucking have.

486
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm going to have her pay deducted.

487
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm going to have.

488
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Penalty, penalty, penalty.

489
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's like.

490
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Given he takes us out of here more like how much of a cut of

491
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
how many PCP dollars do we get for this episode.

492
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Haha.

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You all this is slave labor.

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This is fucking.

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm crowdsourcing this to save on production costs.

496
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You're all.

497
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We'll get another pin.

498
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You will getting paid.

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Did anybody hear anything?

500
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Did anybody hear anything?

501
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're back.

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What's up?

503
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Go to.

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Everyone in the call.

505
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And you will see me drawing the Tezuka.

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And if you are listening to this episode.

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's like, like the one person who didn't appear here.

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And it's like listening to it like later on Friday.

509
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I will have almost completed the Tezuka manga.

510
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The Clarissa.

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And it's real cool.

512
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll be there.

513
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And I just want to, I just want to like bring forth a topic of

514
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
discussion for this podcast after everyone has said who they

515
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
are.

516
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Is a person and how big she is and how she gets stomp on you and

Yeah.

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah.

520
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He's a kid.

521
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The most can't wait.

522
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If.

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No.

524
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If.

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If she went toe-to-toe against muscular.

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Ask.

527
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Ask.

528
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000

531
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Ask.

532
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Ask.

533
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ask.

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Ask.

535
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Here in the Chad.

536
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How would she do.

537
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
She do hers.

538
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What would happen.

539
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

540
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yes.

541
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's go.

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Missing.

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
All right.

545
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's move on to do.

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What's up.

547
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000

You're very,

553
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900

Can you get close to the.

555
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Like one inch tall.

556
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You know where it's quiet.

557
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Your voice is a reflection of how tall you are.

558
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Please suck on your mic.

559
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hoodie, I'm a YouTuber, but fuck that.

565
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
More importantly, I write comics.

566
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You can go on webtoons and shit.

567
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You don't draw comics.

568
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
How do we find them?

569
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What's your handle?

570
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You can just look up Hoodie Song on webtoons.

571
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You can find all right a Pokemon comic.

572
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I also did like a fantasy comic about it.

573
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Is it a Nuzlocke comic?

574
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It was loosely based on a Nuzlocke that I did, but it is like a narrative.

575
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay.

576
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000

577
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000

578
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000

585
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I started 50 million things and I finished single one of them mostly.

586
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And I am the best because I am in the red team.

587
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Kill Communism, Communism Scrinch.

588
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I wow to give all the proceeds from these episodes to Eleazar to buy a new computer.

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000

V-E-L-V-E-D-I-S-T.

597
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's like GTA, but during Communism.

598
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And then you go through the Velvet Revolution and into the 90s.

599
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And it's a gangster mafia comedy.

600
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Velvetist.

601
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000

723
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,620
The brown on cast literally the worst thing I've ever heard of why would you put pro-crash pro and on with that?

724
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,660
Like 15 episodes that's like literally hours of content you could have spent doing really anything else

725
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,220
You could have spent it getting muscle. You could have spent a game

726
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,340
You

727
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,740
Can I stop and say something real quick? Yeah. Yeah, go for it. Well, I'll sorry. I'll sorry

728
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,880
I live in the same country as you if you keep interrupting the people with your music

729
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:19,980
I'm gonna go and kill you and if you kill the editor of the PCP you become the editor

730
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,660
Argentina screaming

731
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,780
These we have three people left

732
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,900
Ben said he likes people being based not playing base

733
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Oh

734
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,900
We got we got this is beans who is who is this is beans?

735
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,060
Fight me. Yeah, I am the only person here who is unironically black

736
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
I

737
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Know what's making money, it's great. What do you mean by unironically?

738
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,820
I was an ironic I was ironically black, but then you know

739
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,820
I

740
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,820
Mean I'm in way I'm in way over my death here. This is beans as bean boys. We're gonna stick together. You know what I mean?

741
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
We're done this podcast

742
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,980
Tom fucked it up he left the call. I love this episode

743
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,100
Right now, I don't know how to do

744
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
No

745
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,500
Continue I love you Tom. Toya. Hey, Toya

746
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,060
Hey, my name is Toya. I'm a voice actor. Yeah

747
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:45,340
Wanna fucking kill myself I entered this call an hour ago, and I am convinced that this is what hell is

748
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,900
Remember we decided teams for this. Yeah, me too

749
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
I think

750
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,820
I

751
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
Just made a tweet

752
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,540
Anyone want to be in this he's a pause for a second to give the actual backstory for how this happened, right?

753
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,460
I think I'm staying up really fucking late all week

754
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:25,180
In the morning Ben adds everyone in the procrastinators chat. This is the idea. I'm pitching if nobody says no, I'm doing it

755
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,140
No one responds because it's more in the morning. He's like I'm doing it

756
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
I

757
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Different person okay drunk

758
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:49,420
It's completely unrelated to sober Ben and sober Ben cannot take responsibility for any of his actions. Thank you

759
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
It's not our fault

760
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,660
I don't I don't know if that's true, and I have no way to confirm

761
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,740
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do unless anyone begs me to stop and even then they really have to milk it

762
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,140
I'm really appealed to my kinder nature. I'm gonna put out an open call

763
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
Anyone who wants to be a guest in the PCP

764
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
Having an all-guest episode

765
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,460
Members are too busy with so many lofty pursuits

766
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,700
And you know what why should I deny them base base base for 25 a.m. Okay

767
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,820
This is

768
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,300
According here

769
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
This is not a troller meme

770
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,340
No, no, that can't be that does sound like something I would say and do

771
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,100
It's time to talk about how big Clarissa is and how much she can crush me. So, okay, I'll go first

772
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,900
I'm sweet mouse and I'm like very small so I could be extra crushed by Clarissa

773
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
You will try

774
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,180
If Melissa would be able to crash them I think that sounds like a good use of time

775
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Here

776
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,740
Big tits are fucking disgusting small tits are way better

777
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Oh

778
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,380
We can talk with we can talk about teams, you know, I'm actually reconsidering the whole team idea

779
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
I

780
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Was playing what was your plan initially well my initial plan was I didn't have a plan and I was just gonna think of something to do

781
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,940
I was considering

782
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:30,820
separating you all into teams and then like in a in a twist like like turning around and turning you all against one another and like

783
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,980
Isolating you and like forcing you to like do some sort of like prisoners dilemma like everyone

784
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,580
Caps a secret vote on which of their teammates is getting like kicked from the call next

785
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Except only for the purple team

786
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,460
Sounds like a great idea the rest of us will totally fall

787
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,820
And they want to do the podcast with us

788
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,900
Actually do a fucking podcast that is quality. Wow doing a podcast a very

789
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,300
Quality are literally like those are mutually exclusive terms

790
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
You never got to experience

791
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,660
I'm running in her

792
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
ASMR episode was a masterpiece

793
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,620
One person every two minutes until there is only like two people in the call

794
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,500
Give and take how's the how's the Tezuka contest how's your drawing going?

795
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,820
Watch the fuck

796
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,580
Subscribe to streams put bits in the jar, but it's getting it's a page

797
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:15,860
Out of 50 and so the I think by Wednesday, I should be done with a line art on Friday. I might be done with the whole thing

798
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,340
Do you actually like cut out all the panels you needed to to make it a coherent with the within the constraints?

799
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,780
It's coherent enough like like the the story is unfinished

800
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,620
Like the story that I'm set out to make it goes to page 50 where

801
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,700
Something bad happens and it could be continued, but it also could be like a bad ending

802
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
Yeah

803
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,940
Oh, no, how will she get out like in the real story there's

804
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,660
Explanations for that but for the Tezuka that's 50 page 50 and I'm like I'm cutting it off there

805
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,660
I'm gonna submit it if they say it's not a satisfying ending

806
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,740
I'm gonna nod my head and say Ohio because I must and that'll be that

807
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,860
Thank you. Thank you. I got a question. You might be spoilers. So like

808
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,980
Feel free to not answer but do we find out what's up with the hat?

809
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,500
Do we find out what's up with the hat?

810
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,740
No, the guy's hat I

811
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Want to know what it's deal is

812
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,300
There's I mean

813
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,260
Initially like when I was sketching it out

814
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,540
I was like, it's just he's just a guy with a like he's he's the bandit king

815
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,060
So he's the king of the bandits so he's got a hat that looks kind of like a crown

816
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,100
But then I drew an eye on it and I'm like hmm

817
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,380
Laura potential so I won't answer the question

818
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,580
I got a question for Tom. Oh someone else is talking. What was that? Yeah, let the Australian speak

819
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:00,300
You make it real and physical and much so we can buy it and then

820
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,620
Ranch ranch ranch it would be right

821
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,860
If I could get like a like a toy story like Woody like doll of Clarissa. It'd be great

822
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,820
I

823
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,660
Know jelly asked earlier if there's a cool Clarissa porn right jelly is that what you asked? Yes, I want porn

824
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
There is

825
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,660
Encouraging some porn and you have

826
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,540
You were literally the first

827
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:47,780
Is Clarissa gonna is Clarissa gonna start an only fans like prompted no

828
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,860
She'll do it for free

829
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:08,420
Wasn't a slut she just like didn't understand sexual so she just talked about a different character. Oh, okay

830
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,020
Pump pump doesn't big big as big as the fan is is a fan favorite my fan. I mean me

832
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,580
She's nine feet tall and she's nine feet thick

833
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,700
From a certain angle, yes

834
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,740
Hey, Tom, I really been waiting on a

Because I'm super fucking lazy. Oh god damn canvas 16 pro good buy it. There you go

838
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,020
In the description

839
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,900
Podcast I could if everyone's missing my patreon podcast

840
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:08,260
I'm telling you there's like 60 of them now. They come out every week not every month like these fucking lollygaggers over here

841
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,060
I only have so much to talk about. I'm not very interested. That's why you just

842
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,260
What was I'm addressing me no when is when is the been st. Livestreams gonna come back. I miss them

843
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,780
I

844
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Yeah, I

845
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,740
I think they're probably gonna come back kind of soon cuz like I'm I finished the thing

846
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,260
Yeah, no, I

847
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,820
Wait, I finished slime and punishment and I'm gonna put out the sonichi lecture like pretty soon

848
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,400
Yeah, and after that. Oh god, there was like one other thing but like after that. I'm like

849
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,020
I have a little more

850
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,680
I'm like I'm like done and I'm like

851
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,740
Yeah, excuse me

852
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,020
Every now and then I just fucking finish season one of the Winnie the Pooh

853
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,060
I think I might I think I might I don't know

854
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,100
Yeah, they really are the best

855
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,460
You gotta make the you gotta make the Winnie the Pooh analysis so you two

856
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:50,140
Like you do the exact same thing you do you do the exact same thing you did before but then you say and that's why the left is right

857
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,300
My biases I feel I feel like the Winnie the Pooh videos were like overly there was like a they were like

858
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:10,140
Disproportionately liked like like a lot of people seem to really like them for some reason which is weird because they don't do very well

859
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:15,500
But like a lot of a lot of people are like they say like if asked they would like I would love you to please

860
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,380
Do do more of those. I don't know. I don't know why they seem to appeal

861
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,420
They didn't go viral

862
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:36,380
They're Winnie the Pooh who was craving Winnie the Pooh analysis. They're good. So I mean if you make a long enough one

863
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,460
Like anything can get big it just like I feel like it's it's not the sort of thing that would become viral

864
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,580
And and like and like skyrocket

865
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,820
It's the sort of thing that like over many years of consistent uploads suddenly everybody

866
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,780
Realizes it and then they go back and watch all of the things

867
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,780
Then make it make like a video at the end that is like a big

868
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,100
Yeah, just combine the videos or something

869
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,780
Yeah, put them all in one big video call it like the definitive Winnie the Pooh analysis and it'll get like four million views

870
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,260
Literally, yes

871
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,620
Like Winnie the Pooh was deeper than you thought

872
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,260
But it's not it's not though

873
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,980
It's how much

874
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
When they realize they'll be able to watch

875
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,700
You could see me lie about events that happened in between the lines. Come on. We need a poo and cap. Call the video

876
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,900
Call the video why eor betrays the depression community

877
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,700
Down the rabbit hole, but it's because it's rabbit

878
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,580
Going out instead of like down the honey pot we could we could we could call it like we could call it like like

879
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,100
We could call it like in rabbits back door because like as a reference

880
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,860
Should I do a Winnie the Pooh lecture, I don't know if I be qualified

881
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Down rabbit hole

882
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:15,580
Down the rabbit hole call it stuck in the rabbit hole as a reference to that classic Winnie the Pooh episode

883
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,740
Oh, no step bro. I'm stuck in the rabbit hole

884
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:26,540
Tigger this is Kang this is rude. Feel old yet you you have to

885
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,020
So that I get too fat and stuck

886
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,660
That's okay. I see I see an opportunity. I'm taking it. We need a round table everyone all together

887
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,660

00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:53,980
Okay, like I'm okay. I'm all for shitting on someone. I have no idea who the identity of us. I'm all for shitting on michelle. Yeah

892
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,700
I mean, we should be glad that michelle isn't here, right who also said that they want to be on may

893
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,700
Is that what you said?

894
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:33,580
You should talk about uh slime and punishment releasing, uh, uh, how do you think it turned out? Uh, how was the release?

895
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,460
Oh, yeah, I've been hyping that up for for years. Um

896
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,860
Um

897
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,540
It was on

898
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:48,140
It was on on the slime during slime fest a debuted slime and punishment finale. It's done. It's out. It's three and a half minutes

899
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:54,380
Uh, it's got music. It's got music by six in it sounds amazing. It sounds really great for the tracks

900
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,740
Sixten who who tried to be here but couldn't a one minute silence for for six

901
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,420
But why don't you have slime and punishment on your website ben?

902
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,500
It it it is I I put it on it wasn't before but I I updated it

903
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,140
It's um, it's um, and I I think I I keep I watched it a bunch of times back

904
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:21,260
And I think that I'm really happy with some of the visual especially the part in the time void

905
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,540
I am really happy with how that looks and I feel like I

906
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,740
Kind of I in terms of like putting my vision of what it should be into

907
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,740
Into the video I I nailed it. It looks exactly how I wanted it to

908
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,500
No, can I can I can I drop some critique here some harsh real critique?

909
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,900
Oh, okay. No, no, you know, you know, uh, it was really cool

910
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:48,940
We had to wait a long time like almost a year for it to drop or something like that

911
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:55,100
It's not a year. No, no, well like eight months or something. Yeah, like nine months. I mean, yeah

912
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,100
Eight months of work, but it's okay. It is good

913
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,340
Uh, it's like genuinely like

914
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:06,780
Like it's like I after after ben said that like, oh, it's not as good as I thought it would be after eight months or something

915
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,540
Or not. It's not eight months worth of work. I thought it would be like bad, but no, it's like actually good

916
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:16,620
Yeah, this is what I said on the last episode is I know it's not eight months worth of work, but I still think it's good

917
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,700
Yeah

918
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:24,460
Months of time you have to like sleep and eat and live your life while also working on a thing

919
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,540
Yeah, it's like a week and a half, you know

920
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,700
I mean, it should have been a week. It should have been out sooner, but it wasn't so what are you gonna do?

921
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,220
It's fine. Well, but you took the time you needed and that's okay. Don't fucking condescend to me

922
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,380
Don't don't fucking talk down to me like I'm some kind of idiot who needs to be

923
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,260
Yeah, you're sucking his pee all right

924
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,140
I'm invalid I'm invalid

925
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,900
I mean truth be told truth be told, um, maybe maybe uh

926
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:02,460
I really like I really like the flip the flip was like literally all the aesthetics over actual substance

927
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,980
You know, I think it wasn't much as much as could have happened in a finale like this

928
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,940
So my final score is 10 out of 10. I appear upfront and do a funny jump and I was really glad

929
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,620
Okay, okay, okay

930
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,300
Tom Tom for real for real. Whatever you

931
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,700
Think like

932
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,180
Shut the fuck up god everyone everybody back to joining

933
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,140
Why is this 45 person

934
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,860
like people talking

935
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,060
Most people aren't talking I that's

936
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,300
I expected this to be a complete cluster fucking now because I understand anyone at all

937
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,700
I

938
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,860
Everyone

939
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,420
All right, all right, that's enough that's that's enough of that

940
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
That

941
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,700
There would be like this is why I thought there would be mini podcasts by team

942
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,460
Yeah, well, that's what I was gonna. That's what I wanted to bring up. I was

943
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,460
And with all the ideas shut up

944
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,540
What I was going to what I was going to do was we were gonna

945
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,500
I was gonna have an initial section that was everyone

946
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,380
And and and I assumed it would just be complete chaos

947
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:43,020
And then at some point I would we would split into teams and then I would you would keep recording

948
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,500
You like like keep recording yourself even when I when like us we are not in there

949
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,220
Or I mean

950
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,260
We could yes

951
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,380
We could

952
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:57,100
We could split it me like ben takes one and top takes a team and tom takes a team and give

953
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,380
Or we could just the pcp members could just go like in cycle one to the other and I was thinking maybe

954
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,500
It's on gib we can go

955
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,260
Okay, okay, so so do we want to split up into teams?

956
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,660
That's great

957
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,060
You been this podcast

958
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,220
I do think it's a little too late for that. No

959
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:26,380
No, it's gonna make it way more complicated. There is no need for it. No

960
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:39,340
If we just like the conversation it might be possible with uh, with you long interruptions of streaming in between, you know, I mean, I think

961
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,220
You know, you know what?

962
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,020
We're gonna have a vote. We're gonna have a fucking vote. Yeah, we're gonna do it. We're gonna vote

963
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
How are you gonna do that?

964
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,860
I

965
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,060
Okay, yeah, yes already has a majority

966
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:21,100
Uh, yeah, but okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. All right. Fine. Yeah, bobe bobe posted it in the general chair

967
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,660
Okay, fine. Just yeah, just react to vote

968
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,180
What are we voting? What is yes on whether

969
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,860
We don't have whether whether we split into teams whether we say no, okay

970
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,020
I'm I feel like that could maybe be interesting. So okay. Yeah, because we have lull michelle

971
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,580
We have we have teams she will she it's too late. She's not joining

972
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,860
I'm

973
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,100
Get out

974
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,260
Okay, so it looks like all right

975
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:11,580
We don't have to split up right now, but at some point we I don't know. Should we should we should we split now?

976
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,180
Okay

977
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:22,140
Keep recording keep recording yourselves. Um, we're gonna make different videos and you can choose your own

978
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:29,020
My team or how we I have an idea. I'm gonna make the team chat to the team voice chat, right?

979
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:35,740
I yeah, I'm going to make them available right now and we are gonna fucking go and and do that

980
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,700
Starting with red team

981
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,700
Welcome to the progress seniors and only monsters show about pcp

982
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,140
But then they all play at the same exact time

983
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,020
Yes

984
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,020
Pan slightly

985
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,780
Isn't it we are give him a second. We are we are I need I need to fuck around with the channel

986
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,140
I'm not going to cut anything

987
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Okay, you know what that's fair

988
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,740
Hey, ben

989
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,420
Yeah, what's up?

990
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:24,540
Okay, so you can make the channels so that everyone can listen but only the colored team can speak

991
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,180
And that way

992
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,740
This is new age reparations

993
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,220
That might be the worst idea I've heard on this poll point

994
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:47,420
Ben, I know how discord works. I run a discord make me a model make that happen

995
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,980
Ben, I know how discord works. I know how children would all be the best discord moderator ever

996
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,420
All right girl girl inside ben saint lemal. All right. How do I how do I do that? I think I will do that actually

997
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,220
Yeah, just just make an admin role and then give it to me

998
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,660
We're instating trans fascism now, um, you're all my slave

999
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:22,060
Do you do you all do you all see do you all see the the color?

1000
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,420
Yeah, I don't see the color ben wait you can't join them

1001
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,700
Okay, you should you should be able to I can't join purple for some reason I can't join pink

1002
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,660
Yeah

1003
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,100
Yeah, let's just do the podcast here like that's a trick

1004
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,180
We're just gonna we're just gonna split up keep recording yourselves, you know

1005
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,060
Red team is the best but there's like only

1006
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,980
Guess it's not that great then, huh?

1007
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:13,020
Okay, so Ben Ben. Oh my god, what do we just split into teams and each team will have like a long time

1008
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:23,580
I think we're are you doing the rotate thing or the uh, whatever I think actually

1009
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:31,340
You're fantastic purple gone. I still can't get into pink. I think they're still working on pink. All right

1010
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,020
This episode it's so fun

1011
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Right. Yes, hard

1012
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,980
Massachusetts. All right, right cool red team

1013
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,100
Uh, uh, I

1014
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,820
What's what's going on? I gotta get I gotta get tom and uh

1015
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,700
I gotta get tom and gibbon here

1016
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:59,820
Hello, this has been a terrible idea frankly. Yeah awful. Yeah, it'd be the worst idea you've ever had

1017
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:10,140
Yeah, well, you know terrible ideas actually. No, I know everybody is uh being ironic about this being the worst idea

1018
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:14,620
But I think it's the best idea and because everybody is here and is having fun

1019
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,700
I think it's actually the best idea and I you know

1020
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,420
The the point of it, you know, it's

1021
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,860
It's about

1022
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,380
It's not about having fun. It's about making the commenters mad

1023
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,980
It's about it's about all the angry comments that are going to be under it

1024
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:36,300
Like wow, the pcp's really gone downhill. Like wow, they're doing this now like cringe, you know, like wow unsubscribing

1025
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,020
Nate's not on the podcast. No, Nate. No, listen. See you next week. Uh, yeah, I did yeah

1026
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:47,020
You fucking comment every fucking week for like four weeks now. I've seen that same comment and you fucking weirdo

1027
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,020
Uh, uh, uh, what's your what's your what's what's what's his problem?

1028
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,580
You know, like what's his deal liking Nate on ironically

1029
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,740
Sure, I mean and that's just the start. That's just the start of this problem

1030
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,700
The worst thing about those those comments are like the

1031
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,420
the sort of smug

1032
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:11,020
Satisfaction that the sort of like self-assuredness that they are like destroying our psyche and that they are like really fucking cutting deep

1033
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,420
and it's like

1034
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,900
No, it's no we're just doing the podcast and other people aren't showing up

1035
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,060
It's as simple as that

1036
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,660
It does seem like the pcp has both an incredibly dedicated audience

1037
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,180
Like, you know, I don't mean this offensively

1038
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:31,180
But like you guys do get relatively low numbers and still you have really high engagement on like your uh, patreon and whatnot and at the same time

1039
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,700
it seems like

1040
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:39,580
Your audience completely hates like half like each member each audience member probably has like three or four

1041
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,060
You know members of the podcast that they just hate and it's like a really weird dynamic

1042
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:51,580
That's quite that's what happens when you have a cult following that attracts autists that have hyper focus and

1043
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:56,940
It's just it's just the way there's there's some weird intangible thing that these people

1044
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:04,060
Really find themselves interested in and when it's not there the entire facade falls apart and they're like wow, this is terrible

1045
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,420
I guess we set ourselves up. Yeah, you know

1046
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,580
We definitely had like like great moments in the past

1047
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,900
I'm sure people are just remembering those but like

1048
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:19,340
I don't know. I don't necessarily think that the future is always worse

1049
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,780
Like they they don't like the dynamic anymore

1050
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,580
When there's less people some people do prefer it. So it's just it's a different show

1051
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,060
Yeah, it's they they want it to be

1052
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,700
Like the yellow episode every episode

1053
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,500
And that's just like it's kind of in his in history now. You can't recreate that

1054
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,700
I think yeah, I think there's a lot of people there was a lot of people to whom the yellow episode is the ideal pcp episode

1055
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:47,980
If every episode was the yellow episode the yellow episode would not be special or interesting

1056
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:54,460
It would just be worse than the noise. It's true. That's true. If every pcp episode was good. We wouldn't have hot dogs

1057
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,780
I was just thinking about that

1058
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,780
How much I want a hot dog

1059
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,780
Last night. I was really hungry

1060
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,820
I was curious how thick you guys's skin is because like

1061
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,980
I do do you guys

1062
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:11,020
I mean, oh like metaphorically you talk about how the yellow episode is the best episode to me that episode is like

1063
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,420
No, literally how many inches how many how how hard would it be to skin you?

1064
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,580
Yeah, I can't put them to me the the yellow episode is

1065
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,740
It's almost hard to listen to sometimes because it's just arguing it is just no

1066
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:27,580
I agree the yellow the yellow episode was not fun to record

1067
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:32,300
It was like actually really tense and unpleasant. Yeah, I don't like it much

1068
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,380
It really needs to be stated that like

1069
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:41,260
I think it's obvious if like you kind of understand that episode but like it started in the beginning

1070
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:46,300
Already kind of in an awkward situation because the argument had been going on before the episode started

1071
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,980
And I think most of us thought it was just gibbs and gaffes and jokes

1072
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:55,260
But it quickly became apparent. No, this is real rage and the longer it went on the more is just like

1073
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,820
Oh god

1074
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:59,820
This is really happening. Yeah

1075
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:04,060
Yeah, yeah for sure for sure. It was not a meme. It was that was a real

1076
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:08,300
I think people still think that it was like a meme and it was not a meme. No, no

1077
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:13,980
It literally wanted to murder us for like a year after that and he probably still does I'd argue

1078
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:20,300
I actually had had a similar experience, you know, uh when I staffed at

1079
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:26,860
brony fair in in germany in berlin one year, you know, and

1080
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,420
Uh, I I stayed at some people some people's house

1081
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,540
Uh, some people's flat, you know, and I I like

1082
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:42,780
And after the con I like was packed and everything and uh, you know, just chilling and I just asked the guy

1083
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,540
Oh, so

1084
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,060
What did you think of of the convention? You know, how did you like it?

1085
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:53,580
and he just started going off and he he like started

1086
01:09:54,060 --> 01:10:01,180
Telling like one thing that was wrong after another and you know and in my mind. I was like, uh at the start

1087
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,540
I was just

1088
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:08,620
Thinking of what I would reply, you know, but after like the five minutes. I was like, okay

1089
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:15,020
Maybe he's not stopping then 10 minutes. I'm like, okay. Maybe this is not worth it

1090
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,780
And then, you know, when it started to go over 20 minutes

1091
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,540
I was just resigned to just listening and

1092
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,460
and he

1093
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,220
he like

1094
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,660
Yeah, he like

1095
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:32,220
Complaints about a con for like 40 minutes. It was unbelievable

1096
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:39,580
Yeah, yeah, that well that was my first experience of something that extreme. Well personally speaking. I think the podcast

1097
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,860
I mean, listen, it's not perfect right now. I do think you guys on the upwards trend

1098
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:47,980
I I think some of those past episodes aren't good to be frank. I don't hold the yellow episode in that high regard

1099
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:52,460
I think the podcast as it is right now is a lot better than the audience seems to give a credit for

1100
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,580
I think you guys have an audience that is full of whiny bitches to be honest

1101
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,660
I I want to

1102
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:02,540
As much as their favorite member is in it. So if you don't yeah the podcast is garbage, right?

1103
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,580
If if the way if the podcast lately isn't to your taste

1104
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,140
I'm not gonna say like I disagree like that's wrong

1105
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,500
But but I definitely agree that they are a bunch of whiny bitches

1106
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,940
Well, that's that's been the case since episode one. So I'm yeah

1107
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,460
Yeah

1108
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,740
Um, okay, we've been I think we're gonna do like a little five minute

1109
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,780
John's we've been in five minutes. So we're gonna move on a blue team, but we will be back

1110
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:28,620
No, I wanted to ask about freely printing. We will we will be we will come next time next time

1111
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,540
I will I will be

1112
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,140
Happy to chat about that. Okay. Here we go. Um, all right. Peace out

1113
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:39,020
Oh god, this is awkward. I better I better I better

1114
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,060
They'll

1115
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,060
Oh, shit. Okay, they're here

1116
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,180
They're here get your guns out get your strengths. What do you think?

1117
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:52,140
I want to I want to I want to I want to talk on behalf of my team

1118
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,780
We we learned what we learned as a team blue team blue team, baby. Here we go

1119
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,220
Okay, we learned we learned that the pope in one timeline

1120
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:05,340
Learned the beauty of Undertale and became game developer and made Dark Souls 4

1121
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:11,020
Uh, thanks for listening to our thesis. Thanks. Thanks Matt. There's a lot of indie titles on steam

1122
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:14,300
Who's to say that the pope isn't publishing right now?

1123
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,540
God

1124
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,060
I'm just trying to imagine

1125
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:25,580
The pope that was like like the fucking map pack gave the pope a just a steam code not even a physical

1126
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:31,900
Uh, okay, you can fight you for this out, man. You're you're good. Do you think the pope is like right?

1127
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,460
Is do you think the pope is supporting yandere dev?

1128
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,180
Absolutely

1129
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,860
God has spoken to him and he says yandere yes

1130
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,020
Actually, did you guys hear?

1131
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,220
No, no

1132
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,620
It's still upon him the cum chalice

1133
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:54,380
Did you guys hear about uh, lovesick or the

1134
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:02,220
They destroyed yandere dev's game by making the game better in like

1135
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,180
I did

1136
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,660
I don't know how long

1137
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:11,580
Yeah, we should give that to better like they used the same

1138
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:17,500
Fucking free ass free public assets and they just made the same game except better in two weeks

1139
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,500
And then they're just like yeah, you're a fucking idiot

1140
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,780
That sucks so bad. Oh my god

1141
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:28,620
He threatened to kill himself over the fact that this game was made like please don't do it or I might hurt myself

1142
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,340
Why don't we just do why don't we just make that game like over the course of this podcast, you know

1143
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,940
We have done right now

1144
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,940
like yandere dead

1145
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,820
We should make a game jam podcast

1146
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,300
and just

1147
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,300
Yandere simulator

1148
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:52,460
You know, we just it should be a trend just yandere devs like like speedrun just making the game

1149
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,900
Yandere but it's but it's ben talking about communism to every single member of the

1150
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:03,580
I don't understand how those things are related at all

1151
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,860
I mean communism

1152
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,340
You purchase the game on steam and it's just a lecture saying how you're bad

1153
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:25,420
No, god, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism and it's no one's fault that they're complicit. Oh my god. Okay

1154
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,300
Ben just goes up to people, you know capitalism kind of weird

1155
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:40,220
You know, uh, uh, I just uh, I mean, uh, uh, I don't want to talk about this change the subject, please

1156
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:48,700
I want I want to be I want to attempt to be like the straight man. Uh, not the not the straight man. That's like in jokes

1157
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,860
Amen

1158
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,340
Actually

1159
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,100
Something meaningful and not like every other. Yeah pretty cringe

1160
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:01,180
But you know, you know, if you are enough cringe surrounded by other people are cringe

1161
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,900
might be a little bit base

1162
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,900
That's what I learned from the pc

1163
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:09,260
That's what I learned when I played undertale with the pope

1164
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:16,940
Yeah, see it seems to be noted. So, uh, uh, well, what what do you guys think about like this?

1165
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,900
Like having your fans get inside the thing you are making your

1166
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,620
Your fans getting inside

1167
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:31,180
I think that it's a great I think that it's a great source of free labor for me to extract surplus value from

1168
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,300
So you're saying you're not having the mobile move

1169
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:43,340
We are we are not capitalists. We are slave owners right now. We're we're we're straight up feudal monarchs

1170
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,100
Anymore permanent podcasts us

1171
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,420
Extract those tives, you know

1172
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:55,580
Feels good. This is this is this is it. It's time for you all to pay the piper. We've entertained you for years and now

1173
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,820
We call upon you

1174
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,740
Jesus Christ

1175
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:05,500
We know it was then it would like jesus on the beach now you have to carry us. There's only one set of footprints

1176
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,060
But it's actually like 40 sets because there's like 50 people in here. So, you know

1177
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,780
Ben points at the crowd now it's your turn

1178
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:19,020
Yeah, I totally was not just away from my computer just now guys. I was I'm

1179
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,580
Completely in on this conversation

1180
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,980
That sounds like a great time for us to move on to yellow team, but we'll be back

1181
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,780
I can't do this

1182
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,820
We're just waiting for ben. Why is he taking so long? Why does he take even one side?

1183
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,980
How is it that ben is late even when

1184
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,100
Yeah, like on the thing

1185
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,540
I'm a fucking idiot

1186
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,940
It takes me so fucking long just to move craig from one room to another

1187
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:21,420
Ben you can and you can just click on craig and drag him to a different

1188
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:28,380
If you're on death, you really want to realize that craig is not a person. That's epic. Wait, really? Yeah

1189
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:34,060
I think that breaks them. I think that breaks it. Uh, I oh if it breaks it, fuck you

1190
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,060
Okay, I don't want to I don't want to risk it. I don't want to I know it breaks music bots

1191
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:42,380
That's all I know or you stew. Okay better better not to better not to chance it then

1192
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:47,020
Um, but so how how's everyone doing over here in the yellow room?

1193
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:52,540
We're doing good. We were we were positive talking the pcp and shit talking the purple team, you know

1194
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:58,620
Exciting stuff. We were trying to work our own identity. Let's let's shit talk the purple team. Yeah. Yeah

1195
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:08,300
Before we shit on the purple team, I want to take an extra moment to shed on ellie is our specifically

1196
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,260
Who was by far the most disruptive person in the general chat?

1197
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,220
You're supposed to be the fucking editor. He went he leaned way too into the meme

1198
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:22,220
He expected it to be chaos. We wanted to play into that and it didn't work and he was not charming and I fucking hate him

1199
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,700
and I guarantee

1200
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:29,980
He's he's not he's not gonna use the audacity audio from fucking anyone because someone's gonna fucking

1201
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,980
There's no point in all of us recording. He's going to use craig because he's a lazy piece of shit

1202
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,740
There's no he's gonna sing all these different

1203
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:42,540
Podcast I don't think ellie is lazy. I think I'll use it. I mean, I I don't know. I guess I'm okay. No

1204
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,860
Your rent is like completely leaped out

1205
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
Because I was in charge. Yeah

1206
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,940
I know you're listening ellie is our fuck you guys

1207
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,820
I have the power to erase you from existence

1208
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,420
I don't want ellie is our to erase this group for

1209
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,220
The coolest stalin picture

1210
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,420
The person next to stalin it's just like rubbed out, you know

1211
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,740
Yeah

1212
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,660
He has a full nine inches. He's the best guitar player on earth

1213
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,140
Uh, uh, yeah, he probably probably the most I haven't seen his face

1214
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:20,060
But like you can tell he's incredibly handsome like at least

1215
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,900
I wish that apple was me

1216
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:31,260
I'm speaking possibly, uh, give stupid idiot corner a funny jingle a good part of the podcast

1217
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,660
That's too, uh, you know, yeah

1218
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,580
Yeah, yeah

Given I want to say thank you on stream for the flourisheship for randomly drawing a hoop snake

1220
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,940
And then drawing it again once you realize that you do it wrong

1221
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,900
Oh, yeah, yeah

1225
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,860

We are we are the color of the sun we bask in light

01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:17,660
Uh, every purple team is like that's just following the crowd pink is like, oh three people

1229
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,740
I just want I'm not like the other girls

1230
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:23,100
All right, my my experience with the other team is red red is pretty chill

1231
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:27,500
Blue is kind of is kind of rambunctious yellow is like caddy and like mean

1232
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
Good

1233
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,740
Ben, you know, I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna overcome the reputation by saying, you know

01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,620
Slime and punishment of base a winning 5-0

1235
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,820
Talking about rck and pcb is always good by the way. Um, I mean I appreciate that

1236
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,700
You know, I don't ironically

1237
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:52,860
I don't ironically been I've actually been rewatching, uh, the nuzlocs. I'm they're really good

1238
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:56,300
I really hope you do one again someday every every once in a while

1239
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:02,300
Someone someone like messages me on twitter or on or I get a message on a youtube videos the nuzloc videos

1240
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:06,700
It's like yeah rewatching these again like, you know, I come back to these every once in a while and I'm like, ah

1241
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:11,180
Man, I love I love I love I love that people do that. Yeah, okay

1242
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,820
Speaking of teams having

1243
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:22,140
This is a call out post to everyone. I don't have a middle of ground. I'm so sorry. No, this is much better. This is much better

1244
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,460
Yeah, okay. This is this is a call

1245
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,300
Oh my god

1246
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,220
Say his thing

1247
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,340
Okay, so yeah, so I realized something so we know that now

1248
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,860
Diginee has changed her channel to diginee and digibro

1249
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:43,660
So with what said I have realized that technically digibro aka may has been grandfathered in the procrastinator's podcast

1250
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,580
So therefore I was wondering

1251
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:51,420
Ben could you theoretically change your name to ben saint and the entirety of antifa and therefore make all of antifa

1252
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,900
a member of the procrastinator

1253
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:55,660
um

1254
01:21:55,660 --> 01:22:00,060
Mom could also add a zoomie or whatever and give him a handle of the characters

1255
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:06,220
You've explained it so clearly that I you've answered your own question. Obviously. Yes, I can do that

1256
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:13,580
That's that's well within every every uh member like all of all of the signed up members of antifa

1257
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:17,980
All the members of the antifa organization are about to

1258
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:22,940
I've seen I've seen like fake sign-up forms going around and I'm pretty sure it's like

1259
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:26,300
It's like right wingers like sending them around to get people to sign up

1260
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:30,140
I'd like to get their identity and like harass them or something to put them on

1261
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:35,420
I know this one. There was there was this website that was like join antifa dot com and somebody just

1262
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:41,500
Somebody just looked in the like in the like data of the website and it was Ben Shapiro's

1263
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:42,780
Uh email

1264
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:48,540
It was made by it was made by a left-wing person and it was just a joke. It was an easter egg

1265
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:53,340
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was it was funny. It does exist. It was really funny. Yeah

1266
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,260
It was funny

1267
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,860
uh

1268
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:00,300
It was deliberately funny, but it's still funny. Yeah, okay

1269
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,420
A sign what were you saying before I started to cut you off

1270
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:09,020
Yeah, I feel like an idiot for speaking over death alchemist, but I'm I guess I'll say it anyway

1271
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:15,260
I have the spotlight now. This is this is a call-out post because uh to anyone who listens to this bullshit

1272
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,300
Right now. Oh, yeah

1273
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:24,460
We we have we have we have teams. They have personalities. We need fan art. I want fan art

1274
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:31,980
Of the teams. Yeah, you're listening right now. Make the fucking fan art or I will kill you. This is me being catty

1275
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,740
Maybe a team or the catty team. So we need to all be cat

1276
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,900
Maybe I maybe I can get maybe I can get married

1277
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:42,860
Yeah, we need to like hire someone to draw like red team chan and like blue team

1278
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,820
Yeah

1279
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,460
Well-rounded rich characters

1280
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:53,740
We need to be like the short spiky haired yellow haired girl with like the two little like spiky tooth

1281
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:59,260
The that's like max from Beyblade. That's that's well, that was I won't talk about rad con

1282
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:03,820
But that reminds me of something from rad con that is a still a secret. Hey, we got to get moving. We got to move

1283
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:07,180
Wait, I have one final PSA. I have one last thing to say

1284
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:08,380
Uh

1285
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:13,900
PCP terrible for your health. You're the reason people are dying one hurry. Hunna speedrun

1286
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,020
You should not be conditioning for less than three minutes

1287
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,980
Your hair will get dry and you will be a bad person

1288
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:25,260
So three minutes is the absolute absolute minimum for the speedrun and two keto diet is shit

1289
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:30,460
I did it lost 15 pounds gained it all back. I did a real diet and I lost 50 pounds

1290
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,860
Uh keto is bad

1291
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,620
Um

1292
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,620
Stupid

1293
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,500
Uh now now 10 years of been trying to move craig

1294
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,860
Oh

1295
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:10,860
Why are tech god, they're right endless war is impossible to play text commands are so difficult

1296
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:18,860
Okay, hello, we're we're here we're here green team. How's it how's it how's it hang it's going good

1297
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,860
Energy is nice and calm. It's it's it's a good feeling

1298
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:29,660
My regret is that my name starts with t and my team was green. So in both cases

1299
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,740
I'm like three quarters of the way down the list

1300
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,060
Uh

1301
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:38,060
Oh, I thought you were gonna say it was like a pun like green tea. I thought that's where you're going with that

1302
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,900
That would have been that would have been way more more coherent

1303
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,860
They're thinking that we have a sense of humor

1304
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,100
What do we think guys

1305
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,140
Who's the worst team? Who's the worst team?

1306
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:57,180
There are no worse team. We're all the same. We just split off from like a main team. We're the same team

1307
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,740
That's that's too. That's a little too

1308
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,140
That's a little too reasonable

1309
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:08,540
This is the reasonable group. We figured it. We found them. This is the reasonable people the neutral party red was pretty reasonable

1310
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:14,780
I'm forced to pick one. I'm going to pick purple just because of the the total number of people who are

1311
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,580
shit posters without substance

1312
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:25,180
That man has good content. I don't know fat man has pretty solid content. Yeah, but we're not counting good things

1313
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,260
We're counting bad things

1314
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,740
We're gonna be counting all day bad things

1315
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,860
um

1316
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,300
guys

1317
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:39,900
You uh, you how about how about how about how I murdered munchie and slime fast pretty funny, right?

1318
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:46,780
Pretty cool. Yeah, I lost all my slimes. I've been playing much, but uh, you know, that's

1319
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:54,860
Uh, munchie lost all his too. So fuck him, you know, you know, he's that's that buster. He got busted

1320
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:58,620
Bro, I didn't even get killed. I just it was just like nope level one again

1321
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:04,140
Oh, you you fell victim to um, what do you call it a slime decay?

1322
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,940
That must be it, right?

1323
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:09,980
Just like I think it was after an update. I think it just happened right after an update

1324
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:15,260
Oh, maybe that was during the dream arc when everything everyone was asleep and it was all a dream

1325
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:20,460
Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Also, I'm a little concerned because I'm hearing thunder out my window

1326
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:23,900
And if my power goes out, I will perish. No, same

1327
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:29,260
I'm about I'm in middle sex county right now. So like, uh, it's not not it's not that bad

1328
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,700
It's not that bad

1329
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:37,020
What you need is an uninterruptible power supply. So it gives you like a five minute buffer for you to save and shut everything down

1330
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:45,820
Uh, what is that? Is that like a generator or is that real? It's it's like a it's like a power strip

1331
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:51,020
But like big kind of running and it's got a small battery in it

1332
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,900
That battery backup power

1333
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,900
Well, that battery continues or running after the power goes off up to a certain limit and then like

1334
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:03,580
Shut down or yes, that's exactly that's that's good. That means you can save your work

1335
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,780
That's always the worst thing. Yep

1336
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:09,180
I haven't had a power outage in like

1337
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,980
A number of years

1338
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:17,820
I'm jelly. We have power out. Okay. So guys, should I talk about shit core right now?

1339
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,420
Well, before you get into this, I want to

1340
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,180
I want to fulfill the prophecy

1341
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
Hey, Tom. Okay. Yo, what's up?

1342
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:34,700
So you probably will only remember this about halfway through me explaining it, but okay. Um

1343
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:41,420
Millions of years ago when the world was new and you made videos about my little pony

1344
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,020
I hate you up

1345
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,820
Uh to ask if you wanted a custom belt

1346
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,780
Yeah

1347
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,860
Yeah

1348
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:53,260
Literally in my field of vision right now

1349
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,660
Right belt saga actually began with tom

1350
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,140
I see

1351
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:06,060
Yeah, everyone it seemed like when we got to brony con it seemed like everyone knew you and like you were the belka

1352
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,220
And like I had never heard of you before and I was like, what is what is this? What is what was it?

1353
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:17,500
Was it I think it was you found nate first or something and and natin happened to need a belt and then that was very

1354
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,860
Amusing that you were a belt guy. Yeah, and then I

1355
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:24,300
Spotted into something amazing like that. That's so fucking sick

1356
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:30,700
Yeah, I and I saw you and I saw you making the belt live the belt has your belt skill improved

1357
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:37,420
Substantially since that long distant past. Well when I set you that belt I had

1358
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:43,820
Six patterns that I could weave and now I have 42 and all the rest of them are my own invention

1359
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,940
That's pretty intense

1360
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:50,540
Yeah, I think I like send you a high resolution photo of this belt

1361
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:57,260
So you can do one of those memes on twitter where it's like 2013 versus 2020 and uh blow people's minds

1362
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:03,340
Yeah, yeah, do you think you could like make a cape out of that?

1363
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,220
Like a belt that just keeps on going

1364
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,620
I could it could be done

1365
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:14,380
It could be done. It would be a little unwieldy to wear because nylon is very heavy

1366
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:22,140
Maybe a like a flower buds get or something. Hmm. I think you could make like a pleated kilt or something like that

1367
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,860
That's a little more doable

1368
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:29,820
But I mean to anybody who was there on the day, you know what the process looks like

1369
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:33,660
That is and to get more width. I need more fingers

1370
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:38,460
Which I uh, I'm currently at my at the limit of my finger subscription

1371
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:42,140
This is as high as the uh as the subscription tier goes

1372
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:48,300
And I hope I don't miss a payment. Otherwise, I'll just be like down half of my usable usable digits

1373
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:54,060
Do we we gotta we gotta move on to purple team? Is there anything any any last minute last minute things?

1374
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:58,620
Hey, what the fuck? I never got to talk about shit core. I didn't mean oh, you're right

1375
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:02,380
Uh, you yeah, what's about what about shit core?

1376
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:06,540
Okay, so do you do y'all know about shit core?

1377
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:12,060
No, don't know. No. Okay. So shit core is a genre of music

1378
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:19,980
Except it's not really a genre because you can play any genre you want. It's just about making the music bad

1379
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:25,900
And so how I found out about this is from absolute trash media

1380
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:31,580
Jesus, I found I found out about this from miss sarah louise

1381
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:39,820
Uh, in other words blind sky watcher who is the musician who created a lot of the instrumentals for digi

1382
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,620
nay digi nays

1383
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,820
What's it called?

1384
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:49,740
Go trial of the golden witch. Yes those albums. Yeah

1385
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:52,620
and so

1386
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:53,980
Okay

1387
01:31:53,980 --> 01:32:01,020
So there are a lot of albums on this label absolute trash media

1388
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:07,900
Uh, in uh, in fact, you can just scroll for ages and never get to the bottom

1389
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:15,500
Because more and more people just joining and create albums for this shit wait

1390
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,460
And this is this third generation of this

1391
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:26,540
Because the first generation you can't even write you you can't even reach that on the internet because that has been deleted

1392
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:31,500
But the second generation vortex of crap dot bandcamp dot com

1393
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:39,900
But there was a previous vortex of crap which contained like a hundred albums and that's just deleted

1394
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,020
so

1395
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,020
We got

1396
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,660
Anyway

1397
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:52,860
What's what's what's the what's the pitch like how does it sound like? Well, how would you describe it?

1398
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,900
um

1399
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:00,060
It sounds like a quality genre rather than just like blowing out your speakers with like

1400
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:05,660
Times the amount of gain is actually kind of nice. It's weird. Okay, so you you can make that

1401
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,300
um, that is actually

1402
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,100
A lot of the albums are just like that

1403
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:16,780
That ties the genre together than in a than like a sound is that kind of like the idea

1404
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:25,740
How they would describe it on their discord channel it's just that they make music in order to make each other laugh

1405
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,780
Okay, so it can make

1406
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,860
Yeah

1407
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,700
Okay, okay

1408
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:42,380
Sorry, I'm sorry, but we've been here for too long. We gotta keep moving. We will be back

1409
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,380
We will be back

1410
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:49,980
Okay, we are going we're going to purple. We will be back in a little bit when we make our way around again

1411
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:55,100
Oh multiple laps cool. We're making we're doing multiple laps. Yes, uh

1412
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:01,500
Trying to keep the pace up. We'll be a group sinks in case we need to leave or at the end. We will probably all

1413
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,060
um join up again

1414
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,060

Shut up. I'm gonna shut up

1417
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:19,420
One of the best is not a mess with a guest the the pcp the only three members

1418
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:32,220

1419
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,020

01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:53,580
But if that if that happens top common give I have given you admin permission you have control of the voice of the

1423
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,220

I'm on your resume right now

1427
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,340
Okay, that's fair

1428
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:27,900
Why do you do this to me? Why I send you messages on this or about my concerns regarding anything this episode

1429
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,380
You didn't answer none. I do answer none of them

1430
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,940
Why do you do this to me? Yeah

1431
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,940
Wait, you didn't you didn't DM me did you?

1432
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:49,740
What are your concerns because they are never communicated to the rest of us. I know I

1433
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:58,860
Don't know what what do you want from me, you know, we tell the film but all they hear is uh, hola, how are you?

1434
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,460

01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:11,820
PC pc in the magic universe

1438
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,140
Oh, who the fuck checks that

1439
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,340
I see

1440
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:29,660
I want the other podcast. Yeah, how's how are they going for you?

1441
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:34,460
I don't know. Eleazar that last statement you put out seems to cover everything Ben's done so far

1442
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,060
So

1443
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,060
For the audience

1444
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:44,940
To be a one episode thing I would have no problem on having lots of people and it being a clusterfuck you gave

1445
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,580
Of course

1446
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,900
You saw

1447
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,180
Message

1448
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:58,060
Are you've lost your melanin privileges hand them over?

1449
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:06,620
Yeah, Eleazar you better vote for jellybiden

1450
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:09,340
Yeah

1451
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:25,340
Certain groups have certain auras

1452
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:31,100
So we're gonna we're sort of thinking who's the best one and we're gonna ask everyone

1453
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,980
Like who's who's the best

1454
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:38,460
And shit talk and do bad things right now the funniest and the coolest

1455
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:40,700
That is true

1456
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:42,700
Beatable. We are the cute and the funniest

1457
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,900
We're the biggest

1458
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,100
Are we doing voicemails? Is that happening?

1459
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,300
We're floundering

1460
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,100
Ben load them up

1461
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:10,540
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. No no problem. I got one for I got one hot and fresh out of the oven for you

1462
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,020
No, this will be the first one, but

1463
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,980
Okay

1464
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,460
We are all gay

1465
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,140
And I'm posting it in the in the purples in the purples chat

1466
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,700
You can just scream it, you know

1467
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:46,460
We are listening to it right now, I think a lot of people in this world are by and just don't know it

1468
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:55,100
They are able to get by by being straight and they don't even consider the alternative

1469
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,300
So

1470
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:00,300
Just go out

1471
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,380
eat a pussy

1472
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:11,980
Being straight is a gateway sexuality to being by I never thought about it like that

1473
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:20,700
You should wait wait what I mean. Yes, but why I think he's he's just right

1474
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,660
What

1475
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:32,380
Not not to be that guy, but I think conventional like sexuality is literally just a myth propped up by christian and

1476
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,180
Yeah, he's clearly just on the recruit

1477
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,580
We're all on the spectrum, right? We're all on the fucking kinsie scale

1478
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,700
This is true

1479
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:58,620
Hold on hold on hold on that is true

1480
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:04,300
Sam, will you get a voicemail like this? You need to preface it by saying this is liberal propaganda for the all that

1481
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,140
That would be fair. I can't do it

1482
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:11,100
I

1483
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:19,340
Had a very serious question about your slime and punishment

1484
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:26,700
Yes, very good. Was there any uh inspiration drawn from the world plates and that um, what is that?

1485
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:36,060
Yeah, no good quit. No, not really. It's actually based on um, because in episode 15 and 16 of sonichu

1486
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:42,060
Magi-chan they go to the time point and magi-chan creates a ball and sonichu runs in the ball

1487
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:45,660
And it rolls like a hamster wheel and that's what moves it forward and back up your time

1488
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:50,220
Yeah, that's how they use the time orb to yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so the idea of it rolling

1489
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:57,740
That the other day in preparation for slime punishment and 102 and I am mix. I'm on the edge of my fucking seat waiting for it

1490
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:00,780
Can we get done a good job for what?

1491
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:03,420
for the lecture

1492
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:09,020
Oh, probably not more than a few weeks. I think awesome. Awesome. Yeah pretty pretty spaced

1493
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:18,860
Can I just say you're an absolute chad for like low key dissing digi and they in the fucking

1494
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:24,940
Message you sent them you are a chiro. You're a champion and I mean, I mean, I just don't understand

1495
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,940
I don't understand people that just

1496
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:30,940
A little bit of

1497
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,420
More a little bit

1498
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:51,180
Consistent

1499
01:41:51,180 --> 01:42:01,900
We got a we got a we got a we got to move on to pink team any last

1500
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:05,260
Okay, can I just say one thing? We're sorry

1501
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:16,220
Give you are cool and I love you and I like you but please for the next lecture explain what you're talking about

1502
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:27,340
It's riska that that's that's the best thing around you don't need to know nothing except that riska is base

1503
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,820
When will you be in the green ranger? When are you going to do a green ranger cosplay?

1504
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:35,020
When I've always thought that if I ever got to like $2,000 on patreon

1505
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:39,740
I would spend all the money on getting a complete accurate green ranger outfit. You know what to do everybody

1506
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,300
patreon.com slash tomyoliver

1507
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,420
Literally since 2012 that's always been like a

1508
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,820
Is a goal

1509
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,420
Our guests have left us

1510
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,180
We're back in the

1511
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:31,980
Okay, I'm getting I'm getting faster at this I'm getting faster at this whole

1512
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,900
Hello, what's up?

1513
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,260
We've you're you're the you're the last boys

1514
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,900
Yeah

1515
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:47,100
We have sampled we have sampled every team thus far and gotten a taste of their unique culture

1516
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:51,740
Uh-huh, and we're gonna do the same to you whether you like it or not. What's what's going on?

1517
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,900
What's going on over here in the in the pink team?

1518
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,100
I'm talking

1519
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:59,820
Sorry about stuff

1520
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:02,220
Like half the people who are supposed to show up

1521
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:07,820
So it's just been a real quiet quiet. Yeah, we thought we were like more than double our size

1522
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:10,060
But we're just three lone souls

1523
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:12,780
Three lone creatives. Yeah

1524
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,860
That's uh, that's that's how it be. I I expected a lot of people

1525
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:23,180
That like got verified wouldn't actually show up. That's just how these things go. Yeah, I mean we're lucky

1526
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:26,220
Yeah, yeah

1527
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,540
So what's what's the worst team?

1528
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:30,700
purple

1529
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,700
Okay, everyone has said purple

1530
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:39,180
In this time we've decided to start beef with the pro and on cast so yeah

1531
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:41,420
Good has been declared

1532
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:45,900
Even even the even the humble green team the the green team is very like

1533
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:50,620
It's pretty serious. It's pretty like it's not not overly concerned with uh with sentiment

1534
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:54,780
It's just kind of like well here we are and we're gonna do or go through the craftsmen

1535
01:44:55,100 --> 01:45:00,140
They're craftsmen over there. What about the red team? Like is it awkward for just two people there?

1536
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:04,300
They seem fine. Maybe when we get back there at all more than two people when we

1537
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:07,980
No, that there was only two and then the three of us made five

1538
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:11,820
I think yeah, I think it was just it was just the two of them. It's just two people

1539
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:14,220
um

1540
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:19,420
Even even the even the humble green team was like, eh, I guess purple team is probably the worst so

1541
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:26,700
No, we hate the purple team with the with the passion. That's great. I love that

1542
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:33,020
That's those are the two team personality traits hating the purple team and chilling our art

1543
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,940
Yeah, yeah, shilling is good. I like already made a group

1544
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:41,900
Really never we've shared our art shamelessly

1545
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:48,060
I never paint. I I saw your film the other day. I liked it. It was very good. Thank you film

1546
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:53,740
Wait, you really? Yeah, it's a short short anime. It's an animated short. It's like six minutes or something

1547
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:58,620
It's it's two minutes. It was it was it felt like longer than two

1548
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:05,580
Link in the description. Oh, yeah, put that in the description. You're on a speed more work. I'm gonna get to work

1549
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:11,260
Um, yeah, no, that was that was very nice to work on. It's my first

1550
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:17,660
Thingy that I did like everyone always talks about how animation is that big scary thing

1551
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:22,940
That's so much work, but they never talk about that. It's also fun and rewarding and cool

1552
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,500
But you like draw something and then it moves

1553
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,300
It's like you're done, but the process leading up to being done is a painful nightmare

1554
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,180
I think the love of the time it's it's because people have

1555
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:40,220
Lofty ambitions of making an entire show or an entire like movie feature film like a gibby

1556
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:45,740
And like making a an animated short is like relatively doable. You just need a couple months

1557
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:50,940
Um, depending on the size and you can make a little thing and it'll it'll be great. It's fun

1558
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:55,900
Only took like three weeks for this one. It was a school project

1559
01:46:56,140 --> 01:47:02,140
It's always nice when you can do school projects, but also do your own thing because the topics are loose. Oh, yeah, totally

1560
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:06,940
Yeah, because I um, I am on like the school news

1561
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:14,140
We're at where I'm at and I've been able to make a couple just really stupid projects and just have that

1562
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,620
Also in the school news

1563
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,700
Yeah, holy shit

1564
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,700
I'm a real

1565
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,660
Schools have news

1566
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,540
Do you report on?

1567
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,340
On campus this week

1568
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:35,340
How many wedgies were there do you have murder mysteries at your school infinite wedgies?

1569
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:38,940
What kind of school do you go to where there's murder mysteries?

1570
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:45,180
Yeah, it's just that cool. You know, we kill people criminal justice school, you know, they gotta gotta keep them on their toes

1571
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:48,300
The school newspaper has to murder people themselves

1572
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:51,740
I get you gotta learn by doing

1573
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:52,860
Yeah

1574
01:47:52,860 --> 01:48:00,380
Also, ben, I just want to say I am the sociopath who started the uh started the uh canonized ben as a saint petition

1575
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,940
Oh

1576
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,940
What's what's your name on twitter?

1577
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:09,820
I think it's it's like will turn turn because that's my real name and then like some numbers

1578
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:16,060
But squilliam fancy son. I think is the name. Yes squilliam fancy son. Okay

1579
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:21,340
That that was like my that's like my artist's name that I chose a long time ago and I've regretted ever since

1580
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,620
Yeah, seems seems good choice to me

1581
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:33,340
Uh, uh, I should I should retweet that more often and be like, hey guys, we still and we've only we still have not gotten 100 signatures

1582
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:38,140
What the fuck? Why are we slacking? Hope frances has not canonized you yet

1583
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,500
Does he have the power to do that?

1584
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:45,740
I mean, yes, I think so. I guess if anyone does it would probably be him

1585
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:49,020
So, okay

1586
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:55,580
And we should just get him we should just talk to him about undertale. He look we know he loves undertale

1587
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:58,940
And that's another one. We should bond. We should just bond with him over that

1588
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:02,220
Do you think we can get him in call right now? Does anyone need to have his discord?

1589
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,740
I would say timezones, you know timezones. Oh, yeah

1590
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:09,180
It many times on nine. I'm in the same time zone

1591
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:17,740
Yeah, yeah, it's my neighbor. Are you in italy? No, I'm in germany

1592
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,220
Okay

1593
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,220
Yeah

1594
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,540
Both uh, horde your roman empire. So it's fine

1595
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:29,900
Uh, do you guys want to hear a voicemail?

1596
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:31,500
Yeah

1597
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:38,540
Let's let's do a voicemail while while we're here. Okay. I'm gonna post it. I'm gonna post it in the pink chat. This one is called

1598
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,500
Want to do bitcoins?

1599
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:43,980
Oh, no

1600
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:47,340
Here we go. We're gonna we're gonna let's give that a listen on

1601
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:55,580
Three two one play. Hey guys, it's me david here. I was watching my favorite youtube channel

1602
01:49:56,300 --> 01:50:01,100
Jake paul the other day and I realized, you know, jake paul is rich

1603
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:04,620
And I I want to be rich

1604
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:08,860
So I was looking into developing my own own bitcoin

1605
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:14,220
And I asked my mommy about it and she told me I was too young to do that

1606
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,820
So what I wanted to know is if you guys were interested

1607
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:21,260
In DMing me to launch our bitcoin up off the ground

1608
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:30,460
So we can become like jake paul one of the 1% and so ben can shed a tear because he's a socialist cry, baby

1609
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,420
I

1610
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:40,620
Could I just say I really feel the power trip for making shitty voicemails to listening to them? Yeah, right?

1611
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,260
It's a whole different world over here

1612
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:45,580
On this on this side of the equation

1613
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:52,140
I think we had pc pennies and like as a potential concept

1614
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:57,100
Yeah, but but nobody wanted to actually figure it out on the records and it's it's you know

1615
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:01,580
It's a lot of work if somebody made real pc penny crypto

1616
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:07,260
That would be the most amazing thing and I'm sure that it would go to the moon. It would put ripple xrp to shame

1617
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,900
I will say

1618
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:15,740
Because I never too young to bitcoin. They were talking about being too young

1619
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:20,300
Bullshit, you can be six years old and make a coin and we're like go

1620
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:25,420
There's like a whole video about like some really young kid or like did a startup to get like a coin thing going

1621
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:28,860
He's going to conventions and stuff for crypto. This is real. You could do it

1622
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:34,700
This guy's just using his mom as an excuse. You think real self starters don't listen to their parents

1623
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:39,020
Fucking idiot have to be a true and cap and just sell your body for some bitcoin

1624
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:44,220
I don't I don't even think this mom who doesn't think who thinks he's too young to make his own bitcoin is real

1625
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:48,300
I think that's just like the personification of his internalized self-doubt or whatever

1626
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:54,700
Agreed. Oh, I think you completely hard agree. There is no mom in quotes. You know what I'm saying

1627
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,660
I

1628
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:01,580
Okay, I think we got to move back to red. So we're gonna be we're gonna be

1629
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:07,980
How often do you switch every I try to keep it to five minutes, but I usually go a little bit over

1630
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:11,580
I've been going over a little bit. So five to ten minutes per per so we will be

1631
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:15,420
How much longer is this going to go just wondering because I'm dying

1632
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:21,260
Uh, I would say I'm gonna try and get it to be like maybe in probably less than another hour

1633
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:27,420
Maybe down to half an hour one more rotation. If we do one more rotation, there'll be 30 minutes. I think we can do

1634
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:34,460
Okay, let's let's let's try to do a reland after another rotation. Yeah, let's do another rotation

1635
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:38,140
And maybe we'll do two more, but we'll see it. We'll see how long it takes. Okay. We are out

1636
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:45,740
What what pink team out you guys doing another full round through all the parties? I think that's the plan

1637
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,980
At least one more

1638
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:49,180
Uh

1639
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:54,540
We're really all right putting in the effort this week. What can I say? I wanted to ask a question real quick

1640
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:58,940
I guess specifically towards gib, but have you considered doing like

1641
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:04,700
Approaching like a publisher for your comics at all because I was we I was just talking uh with ilazon about

1642
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:11,420
Uh, some comics he was reading some web comics and some that I were reading and it seemed like you could probably bring yours to something

1643
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,420
Like I don't know like hive works or something

1644
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:15,980
Hive works. Um, um, yeah

1645
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:20,300
I've not thought of uh, I've not thought of anything like that. Um,

1646
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:24,220
I don't know why I I guess it's it's obviously like a

1647
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:26,060
possible

1648
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:30,140
If it looks good enough. Okay. Okay. I applied to hive works one time

1649
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:37,020
They they used to do like calls for submissions and I applied and during a call for submissions and I did not get accepted

1650
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:41,740
Like very shortly after that they went like they changed their models

1651
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:46,860
So they don't do calls for submissions. They just like anytime you can like email them and pitch them

1652
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:51,740
Yeah, I think it's open all the time now. I I'm actually pretty good at their pitch right now that I'm trying to submit to them

1653
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:57,340
I was I didn't realize you had submitted them. Did or did you say you actually did Ben? I did. Yeah, I did

1654
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:00,220
And what probably would have been a like pitch look like

1655
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:02,460
um

1656
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:08,300
Well, they have like a an information like page that's like explains how to structure a pitch

1657
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:13,740
You know, I had like like character like character art and like, um

1658
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:20,380
Like a few a few pages of your of your it's just that's it just like a couple pages of your comics

1659
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,380
so they can see what your art looks like and

1660
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:26,700
Are you like text like one page or less like sort of text?

1661
01:54:27,180 --> 01:54:32,220
just explanation of what it is and like character uh, uh art

1662
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:35,740
design whatever of an individual main characters

1663
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:38,860
And that's it. Um, yeah

1664
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:44,460
The one thing that sort of seemed weird to me about high works and this is I guess coming from a perspective of someone who doesn't

1665
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:48,540
I guess the the amount of web comics I've read is fairly limited

1666
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:51,580
I was talking to illison about this gaia web comic which I saw

1667
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:55,980
Updated a page every couple of days. So we're talking like maybe two or three a week at most

1668
01:54:56,700 --> 01:55:01,420
How does yeah, how how do you even amass readers in such a way?

1669
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:08,060
Like I don't how does how does someone decide to jump on a story that they know is going to be updated at such a slow pace

1670
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,260
And it seems I mean it seems like that's like a pretty reasonable

1671
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:16,380
That's like a pretty moderate pace for the for a web comic if you're uploading more than one page a week

1672
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,460
You're like ahead of the pack

1673
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:22,060
Yeah, I don't feel like that I don't like for a web comic. I don't feel like that's that slow

1674
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:30,540
I think updates like the web comic format does work better for strips because you can jump in and jump out without having too much context

1675
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:35,100
I think that's a why like four panel comics and stuff do so well. They're just so much more approachable

1676
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:37,740
Strips are bad because

1677
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:41,500
There's just too much of them and I'm going through the whole archive

1678
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:46,220
But there's but like the biggest ones are those because like if you get a formula that works

1679
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:49,980
Like they're so easily shareable. They're easily memeable

1680
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:59,580
I saw um this this one that's like been recently getting big the the like great aliens that just say normal things but with like

1681
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:05,020
Um, like a lot of words. I can't remember what it's called. That's not you on a web comic

1682
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,660
It's just something that pops up on my facebook

1683
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:11,580
Well, it is on the web. So I think it's on the web and it's a comic

1684
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,460
I guess it's not a healthy comparison

1685
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:21,500
But you think of like the stories that I guess most people would be used to is like manga and even beyond that

1686
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:27,340
Obviously manga produces at a rate that no human should really strive for but even if you look at something like, you know, western

1687
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:32,860
You know big two comics dc marvel. They're they're coming out like every month and to me that seems so

1688
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,100
incredibly fast

1689
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,700
compared to

1690
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:37,660
the web comics

1691
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:43,020
So I I guess to me it seems sort of like I don't understand how this works and yet it does seem to be working

1692
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:47,900
And I I don't know just seems weird like imagine having to read one piece one page a week

1693
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:53,260
And you get 50 pages a year. That's like that that is such a dwarf story at that point. You know what I mean

1694
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:59,020
I mean, that's huge. That's kind of why I don't read a lot of story based web comics just because that drags so long

1695
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,820
I'd rather just like read them in chunks of like a completed

1696
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:03,980
Issue. Yeah

1697
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:07,340
Imagine trying to read like scott pilgrim a page every week

1698
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:12,860
It's kind of why stop. Oh god. That would suck. It would be terrible

1699
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:20,460
But what you do is just have a larger number of them have them into ours as reader

1700
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:25,180
And look look at it every day and every day you have different comics

1701
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:29,340
That you read a page of work and like that's why they exist

1702
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:33,100
It just like aggregates all the web comics because that's like the was the problem

1703
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:36,220
Especially for me is like there'd be comics. I'd be reading like lc. Hooper and shit

1704
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,060
I have to go back to the website

1705
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:39,180
I'd always just forget about it

1706
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:42,620
But then I'd have like a back luck to go through when I finally remembered six months from then

1707
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:45,020
But it's not really good for audience retention

1708
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,140
So I don't know it's not a great it's not a great format like story based stuff updating one page a week

1709
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:54,460
It's just not ideal which is why nobody in like a professional capacity publishes that way

1710
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:58,460
Yeah, just I guess it just only it seems like the only option

1711
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:03,180
For someone who does not have the funding to gather a whole team

1712
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:07,340
Like if you are just an artist maybe an artist and a writer you're not

1713
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:13,740
You don't you just don't have the resources to have those six assistants that are necessary to be producing an issue

1714
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:18,620
Right and you're also if you're starting out you don't this is probably not the way you're making money

1715
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:21,180
So you also have to like work your day job and all that other shit

1716
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:27,660
And so like it's just like a lot to ask of somebody in their free time to produce 24 pages in one month

1717
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:33,980
I think what we're learning here is that comics is an inherently classic system that needs to be abolished at all costs

1718
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:36,220
What else is new?

1719
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:41,660
All you got to do is just be worse at art and you can make 50 pages in a month like me

1720
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:47,660
That's how I made slime and punishment. You got to streamline some shit. You got to you got to make your choices. Everything's a compromise

1721
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:53,020
Do you feel like slime and punishment is going going to affect the way you approach something like the vapors moving forward?

1722
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:55,100
Are you going to simplify?

1723
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:57,100
future

1724
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:00,780
Maybe in places

1725
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:07,020
Maybe in places. I think it was it slime and punishment was good practice for drawing efficiently and not like

1726
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:11,260
Worrying about like small details where they aren't necessary

1727
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:14,540
So yeah, I think in a way probably I will

1728
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:17,260
be less inclined to like

1729
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:22,380
Fucking spend an entire day like drawing and redrawing some like irrelevant thing

1730
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:27,660
Which is something I was prone to do before which I'm sure I still will but maybe a little less. So that's cool

1731
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:31,740
Hey, do you guys want to do do you guys want to hear a voicemail? Do you need to listen to a voicemail?

1732
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:37,660
It's a goddamn voicemail. Yes. Um, okay. How about um, how about this one?

1733
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:42,860
It is called metaphysics of frogs and I'm putting it in the reds only chat

1734
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:51,260
All right. Okay. Uh, we're gonna listen to it on the count of three one two three play

1735
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:55,740
Ben this one is for you buddy because something my brain just snapped

1736
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:03,180
A few years ago. I was in a big uh, Jordan Peterson kick. Yeah, I grew out of it before becoming a far-right activist

1737
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:09,820
Our fridge what really matters is that they get the the cookie omen to make a video

1738
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:13,980
on the metaphysics of frogs because

1739
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:18,940
He kind of sounds like kermit and cause pepper the frog and shit like that

1740
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:27,020
So, um your character on the dnd is like a frog jesus in this interesting because frogs

1741
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:34,140
They are amphibian. So they translate between the the water world and the earth world

1742
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:36,540
and

1743
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:38,060
this

1744
02:00:38,060 --> 02:00:40,940
mirrors the descent of the

1745
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:46,700
Hero the hero's journey to the underworld to get the something that is most valid

1746
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:54,220
Like in the tale of the princess and the frog when the frog descends to get the princess golden ball

1747
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:55,900
um

1748
02:00:55,900 --> 02:01:03,980
It like in the bible when jesus he descends. Oh my god. How much longer is resurrected five second deeming humanity

1749
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:07,740
That was very um Peterson core. Yeah of like loosely

1750
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:16,300
The frog truly represents the mediation between the dragon of chaos and and the upper world of the of the goddess

1751
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:21,900
Any frog start black and then turn green. So there's a clear

1752
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:32,380
I mean, okay, well, I guess on the metaphysics of frogs. I agree

1753
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:38,460
I agree with you about it. I'm with him and fuck Jordan Peterson. Yeah. Oh, no, no

1754
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:44,780
Jordan Peterson is a funny meme man who eats nothing with beef. I hope I hope he's doing okay

1755
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:50,620
He's he's going through a rough human level. I hope he's not literally dead. That is ideal. Oh, yeah

1756
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:54,860
He seems like he's had like last I heard he had like brain damage

1757
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:58,780
He was in russia recovering from like some medical bullshit. The winter soldier program

1758
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:05,420
He was like they like induced a coma in it. Yeah, what there's so many based things about Peterson, you know

1759
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,220
Like

1760
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:13,020
He's like a cautionary tale of like what happens if like you blow up on the internet and are not ready for it

1761
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:15,100
Like I just oh god. I don't I mean

1762
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:20,700
I mean, he was ready for it and he was he he did he did pretty great

1763
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,500
For

1764
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:27,740
I'm like addicted to painkillers like that was like his wife got cancer

1765
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:33,020
It was like the same time. So like he might have this might have been something that would have happened regardless

1766
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:38,460
That's fair. Has anyone checked up on Nate to make sure he's not going down this path. Is he in russia right now?

1767
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:40,620
We can we can only hope

1768
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:45,100
Well, I hope for his sake that he's eating nothing but beef. That's the one thing I agree with

1769
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:52,780
Okay, nothing to hurry. We are we are going to move on to blue. Wait, wait, what about what did you print last time?

1770
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:55,020
What did I print?

1771
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:59,100
Oh, okay, I've been 3d printing a bunch of stuff

1772
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:03,740
Uh, I can't talk about some of it because it'd be spoiling other content. I'm working on but

1773
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:10,860
I got some some some dnd minis. I printed some benches. I've been dialing in the settings on the anycubic i3 mega

1774
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,700
I got it pretty nice now

1775
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:17,500
I was having a lot of problems with bed adhesion and I realized it's because even though I had uh,

1776
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:21,500
I had zhop enabled there was another setting that was overriding the zhop

1777
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:24,940
So the nozzle kept clipping the supports and knocking it off the base and I thought it was

1778
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:29,500
Problem with me leveling the bed, but it wasn't so I fixed that it's working good now

1779
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:33,580
Uh, I just ordered replacement nozzles because the nozzle's like leaking shit. It's gross

1780
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:37,740
It's probably all clogged up. So I'm gonna clean out the hot end and did you order different sizes?

1781
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:42,140
Uh, yeah, I got 0.2 nozzle now. I'm gonna go even tinier details. It's gonna be sick

1782
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:47,260
Also, I'm heavily considering getting an elegoomars pro. I really want to go resin. It's fucking cool

1783
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:50,380
That's where yeah, none of those words were real

1784
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:53,100
None of that was

1785
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:55,260
Being encoded. Yeah

1786
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:57,100
This is star trek technobabble from my

1787
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:06,860
Just wait till he prints prints you an actual doll of of your character and you you'll start seeing it

1788
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:09,740
Fucking cool. You can just do that

1789
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:16,140
Okay, but we we must we must away. I think probably we're we're gonna make one more down

1790
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:19,420
And then we will let you know we're gonna everyone will rejoin the general at the end

1791
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:25,340
So I just wait wait for that. Okay. All right. He really is the best guy. I got no

1792
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:31,100
You ruined it. You ruined it. What is Ben saying? I want Ben to say the counter

1793
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:34,140
Understand what he's doing

1794
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:39,580
Wait, yeah, we're we're not understanding what he's doing. I guess

1795
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:44,940
If you are the best minor ever

1796
02:04:45,980 --> 02:04:48,300
No, thanks for watching Ben. Why are there?

1797
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:57,340
What why are there two craigs? Yeah, what's up with that? Well, it's because I want to overlap them

1798
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:01,340
I well, there's well, I mean lonely. There's there simply are two craigs

1799
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:03,500
You can get craig and you can get craig too

1800
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:07,980
And with them you you can you can be in two you can be in two rooms at one

1801
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:14,140
How many audio files are we gonna have to stitch together to make this in any way too many? Oh

1802

1804
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:29,020
Nothing could be less interesting to me

1805
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:35,340

1813
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:09,500

We became friends. We are best friends now the blue team is now a band

1821
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:35,740
Love Nakamas talking about Nakamas

1822
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:41,580
These guys don't know shit about one piece, but I bring something to them that they don't need to know about one piece

1823
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:44,060
But just a german open

1824
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:48,060
Yeah, the german opening of one piece. I don't know if you guys heard about it

1825
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:50,460
I

1826
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:53,020
I don't know if you guys heard about germany, but it's this really

1827
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:56,060
It's a really cool country

1828
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:00,220
Whenever it's a young weave

1829
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:06,940
And but there's a bunch of germans on this call actually

1830
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,020
Oh, really?

1831
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:11,020
Yeah

1832
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:14,300
Jews

1833
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,500
We might need to cut that we might need to cut that

1834
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:24,460
But okay, so when you're young and we people tell you oh search the german naruto opening

1835
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:30,540
So funny and you hear to it and you are like naruto blah blah blah sask the beautiful and it's so funny

1836
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:34,380
So in one point I was like I'm watching one piece and I really like one piece

1837
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:38,700
What about the german opening for one piece? Is there something out there?

1838
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:42,380
And I searched it I found the the intro the first intro

1839
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:47,020
It's like over over we are the the visuals of we are they don't say oh this is gonna be so bad

1840
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:53,580
And I was surprised this it might be like top 10 one piece openings because it's a really

1841
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,700
That sounds like actual pirate music

1842
02:07:57,100 --> 02:08:00,380
Okay, that's that's cool. That's cool and all

1843
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:03,180
Uh, uh, and I'm a big one should watch this

1844
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:05,820
Okay, good

1845
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:08,540
Yeah, and riddle me this okay

1846
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:11,340
Have have you guys considered?

1847
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:18,220
Uh making commentary tracks for stuff someone I feel like someone brought that idea up

1848
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:20,940
Wait, it was me

1849
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:24,940
I think like a couple weeks ago

1850
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:26,140
I think like a couple weeks ago

1851
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:29,900
I might have like gone to the pcp chat and like said like hey guys idea

1852
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:33,660
Movie commentary track or maybe or maybe we talk about that idea

1853
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:37,740
I don't care what you do commentary tracks over just fuck

1854
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:44,220
Ben didn't you record a commentary like video thing on uh for at radcon?

1855
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:46,620
Oh, oh, was that the tarantino?

1856
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:52,060
You know, I've never I've never actually watched the tarantino cast so it might be that and I just didn't even know

1857
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:57,260
It's not in the podcast, but we did record the entirety of us watching that movie

1858
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,860
Oh

1859
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:02,780
But I don't know if we ever did anything with it. No, no, that was that was spiker that spiker

1860
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:06,300
Video I think I don't know if that was turned into a video

1861
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:10,060
I don't know what ended up happening to half the stuff we did at wreck

1862
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:13,900
I don't know it sounds like

1863
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:15,900
Uh

1864
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:22,140
Okay, you know, you know what I actually really like I actually really like the idea of common like movie commentary tracks

1865
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:25,340
I feel like that would be like pretty fun to do and not that hard

1866
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:30,060
Yeah, I get favor spark to do it because like we watch all these bad movies all the time

1867
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:33,740
In a call and we could just do reg and record. Yeah, because like

1868
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:38,700
All the bad movies he records like half the time we'll like I'll get in a call and watch them together

1869
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:42,060
I'm like, why aren't we like making this bonus content to make you even richer and he's just like

1870
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:45,180
Profiting

1871
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:52,940
At all and it's very strange to me coming from the pcp where everything we do is about making a buck and I'll like say

1872
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:54,380
Look at all these great ideas

1873
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:57,020
I have from the pcp you have a million subscribers

1874
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:59,980
You could make like a hundred times the money and he's just like

1875
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:01,980
I'm like, okay

1876
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:04,780
Like we all get together and hang out like for new years and stuff

1877
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:07,340
I'm like, why aren't we making content and crowdfunding this instead of like

1878
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:11,740
Get here by ourselves. You have a million subscribers. He's like, hey, I'm like, okay

1879
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:14,300
I'm leaving so much cash on the table

1880
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:23,260
Well, that's what we also thought we were so so good such business people that we thought about another idea

1881
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:27,580
Though if you're gonna include this in the in the main like everything we said in the main podcast

1882
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:28,380
Well, that's fine

1883
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:33,420
But you can chop everything up and like I said before but we we we brought up with with the guys

1884
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:39,420
You can feel like your truth your own podcast and make like the blue path. Yeah branching branching paths

1885
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:42,460
If you know if only fucking annotations were still a thing

1886
02:10:42,940 --> 02:10:44,940
Oh, yeah

1887
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:47,020
This is like what they were for

1888
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:49,580
For no reason. Yeah, I think we're having

1889
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:52,860
Features this one like the bell and then you're like, okay

1890
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:58,300
I'm so glad they took out annotations to make my subscriber feed not work and have to have like

1891
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:03,980
Really like I'm so glad I get this trending tab, right guys, right?

1892
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:10,940
It's more like the propaganda tag has nothing to do with trending. All right, that's hot

1893
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:16,380
Okay, I think we're gonna soon. We're gonna move on to the to to yellow and then we will

1894
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:22,300
The entire time here, that's crazy, bro. We but before we go. Love us. Should we do our own children?

1895
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:25,180
Shut the fuck up

1896
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:30,700
Let's do a voicemail. Shall we a voicemail? Yes. Oh, absolutely. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Okay

1924

I

1925
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:08,940
I

1926
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:17,260
I ran away for a reason. I didn't want to study the blade. I wanted to make a podcast

1927
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:22,540
Okay

1928
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:25,980
Did you guys watch the how is the show? I don't know the name in english

1929
02:14:25,980 --> 02:14:28,780
But the show with mr. T and the other get more dog and the guys

1930
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,340
Yeah, a team a team

1931
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:35,660
The a team, yeah

1932
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:37,660
Then you love the a team was so fun

1933
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:44,140
Like a friend of mine gave me a dvd with like a whole season of it on it and I got I got really into it for a little bit

1934
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:46,620
Very briefly

1935
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:52,940
Okay, that's it. We got to go. We got to move on yellow team. Hang around here. We're gonna join. We're gonna we're gonna go back to the general

1936
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:55,900
Yeah

1937
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:58,860
Later losers

1938
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:14,700
Everybody wants to be a cat because the cat's

1939
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:26,860
We've for concepts everyone in here has named themselves cat

1940
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:34,380
So we became catty

1941
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:47,500
I like I said that I said that could like completely off hand and I come back here and like it's like the entire culture the culture

1942
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:50,460
But often evolved from it

1943
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:55,020
The body you broke you broke the prime directive and this is what happens

1944
02:15:57,980 --> 02:16:00,780
So I like yeah cat girls now it's cat season

1945
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:06,380
I like how you the yellow the yellow team's a team chat is like

1946
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:11,660
As it has the least of any other it's just like gang gang gang epic

1947
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:17,020
Everyone else

1948
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:21,980
He said well, that's because we have that saying we have synergy

1949
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:24,540
So we just talk in real life and we communicate telepathically

1950
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:28,700
We really uh, we really uh, we really bonded in the time that you were gone

1951
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:33,100
You use your you use your cat like anal like like scent glands to like

1952
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:39,260
We we had a kind of a kind of a renaissance in the interim. Yeah, we're close now

1953
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:41,820
We don't need you guys anymore. You can get out of here

1954
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:44,540
We have a whole

1955
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:54,060
Oh, yeah, we were going to

1956
02:16:57,660 --> 02:17:00,300
The non feline people here, I do want you to guys to

1957
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:03,580
Say you you guys do agree that cat girls are better than dog girls, right?

1958
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:07,260
No, we this is this is a this is not actually

1959
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:10,620
No, I would I do I do agree with that

1960
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:14,460
But it's I mean, I don't think dog girls are very appealing and that's why you never see him

1961
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:17,260
Like when was the last time you saw a dog girl? I I saw

1962
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:23,900
I saw no game no life once as a child and and that's that's formed my personality sense and always but especially in my

1963
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:27,100
regard for dog girls, uh, and and Stephanie

1964
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:29,820
Wait, actually, you know what my regard for lollies

1965
02:17:30,380 --> 02:17:33,020
You know what there's actually I just remembered

1966
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:39,740
There's a twi an artist on twitter called they call him cake who draws the the biggest titties and

1967
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:46,380
And his his characters his characters are dog girls. So actually I know I like dog girls better. I'm sorry. Yeah

1968
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:48,780
Oh, no

1969
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:55,660
The thing I associate with with with cat girls is like anime girls with cat ears, which is inherently lame

1970
02:17:56,300 --> 02:17:57,980
If you're gonna go with the cat

1971
02:17:57,980 --> 02:18:04,220
Yeah, I don't know about that given you do I think anime girls with cat ears are are are slightly better than like full furry

1972
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:09,340
But I think for every I think honestly for dog girls. Uh, that's the case too, but you know, uh

1973
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:15,340
Uh, uh furries are still good and uh are like more iconic at least, you know, like full anthro

1974
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:19,020
Yeah

1975
02:18:19,660 --> 02:18:24,220
Like acceptable anthro aesthetic some of it is just like so jank and gross

1976
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:30,220
Well, the problem is just furry artists are bad. Not that anthro is inherently bad. Uh, I think it's for me

1977
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,700
I definitely

1978
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:39,980
Disney aesthetics really animals with hints of human qualities rather than humans with hints of animal quality like if you go

1979
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,300
Into the human

1980
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:49,420
It starts becoming like really uncanny valley territory, but if it's just like a cartoon animal, that's a cool aesthetic that can be good

1981
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:54,140
Uh, I think I think I think there's a broad base is what you're actually saying

1982
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:58,380
Because for me, I love the disney aesthetic though. Though I probably wouldn't fuck it, you know

1983
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:01,980
And I love the anthro and I love the I love the just like uh, what's it called?

1984
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:07,260
Like, you know, kimono knee or whatever bullshit japanese. Oh, yeah, you know, I like I think all of them are good

1985
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:11,180
And that's pretty indisputable. Uh, welcome to the furry cast guys. Um

1986
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:15,740
Yeah, hey a pcp members. Are you team maw or team paul?

1987
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:19,340
Oh

1988
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:20,780
Uh

1989
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:23,260
More's too like like too close

1990
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:25,980
I guess paul because like

1991
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:31,100
Because because like in real life you get a cat and you pick up the squishy paws like I enjoy that

1992
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:33,580
Yeah, I guess i'm team paul

1993
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:36,940
What do I need with a fucking animal's mouth? Nothing?

1994
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:44,620
I don't understand the ramifications to this question because i'm sure it's heavy and scary

1995
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:47,100
Maul and paul is mouth and paul

1996
02:19:47,580 --> 02:19:49,580
Yes

1997
02:19:53,180 --> 02:20:01,340
Oh my god, you know, you know, I makes perfect sense actually yeah people who are I love my ma

1998
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:06,140
Who are in favor of ma are all childish and uh

1999
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,900
Tit lovers too, you know, that's that's the people

2000
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:12,620
Wait wait

2001
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:17,260
The mommy milky's versus big boobies, right? That's team maw versus team paul

2002
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:19,900
Yes, they precisely

2003
02:20:19,900 --> 02:20:22,140
Wait, but they're both big boobies

2004
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:27,820
It's the it's a slight subtle difference preference thing and big boobies won by the way

2005
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:33,420
Big boobies, I thought it was big boobies win. I agree. I agree big boobies pulled ahead

2006
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:39,100
I think mommy milky's is I I've I explained this at some point before but you know big big boobies

2007
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:44,540
Are are like, you know, the foundation upon which mommy milkers stand like no mommy milkers are not big boobies

2008
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:48,300
Without being squares and rectangles

2009
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:56,620
No, the the literal like genesis of that was like, um, what if ready fuckers cup killers, but big boobies mommy milkers like every every

2010
02:20:57,180 --> 02:21:00,860
We have a baby lovers and now big boobies mommy milkers

2011
02:21:02,140 --> 02:21:06,620
AU universe don't forget pissy baby fucker fappers. Yeah, that's that's the one pissy baby fucker

2012
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:11,500
How could I forget?

2013
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:16,940
You're right that boobies are the like foundation upon which milkers are built. That's like saying

2014
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:21,020
Oh, I I prefer a wheel to a car because you can't have a car without

2015
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:25,900
You know, you are absolutely right 100 agree

2016
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:31,260
Someone was like, what's the more important invention? What's the more important invention the car or the wheel?

2017
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:37,180
The milkers are yeah, but if you're choosing which is the more important invention is the milk

2018
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:43,100
But which is better. It's the better one, you know the one that took the original and improved upon it

2019
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:46,380
What's better the base of the mountain or the peak of the mountain?

2020
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:53,100
This is this is you can't have one without the other. Yeah, but it is where you can it's still the peak like

2021
02:21:55,820 --> 02:22:00,140
If you put the peak on the ground and it doesn't have a foundation, it's not a peak. It's so there's nothing it's the ground

2022
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:07,100
Uh, uh, but but it wouldn't be the peak then so it's definitely up high somehow. Yeah, that's why that's quite a question

2023
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:10,620
Other than the base of the mountain. Hey guys, it could be like a

2024
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:15,340
Yeah, yeah, we got listen. I could talk about this all day, but we gotta get going

2025
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:21,900
Oh, oh, hold on hold on. Okay. All right. How long we how long were you hanging out with blue team?

2026
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:24,780
This is discrimination. This is

2027
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:29,180
Well, no, no, no before we go before we go I want to do a voicemail. Shall we? Oh, whoa

2028
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:31,820
Yeah, yeah

2029
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:36,620
Real quick. Um, my cat is literally right here on my lap. My cat just walked into the room. Well, ain't that

2030
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:41,980
Ask the cat four or more. Um, okay, I can open a voicemail

2031
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:49,020
Uh, this one is I'm gonna post it in the yellow chat. So to go look at the yellow chat. Uh, this one is called, uh

2032
02:22:49,580 --> 02:22:51,580
Failure is imminent

2033
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:54,940
And we win listen to that. Oh god. Oh god. Um, three are we?

2034
02:22:56,060 --> 02:23:00,460
We all played at the same time. Yeah, you played at the same time three two one play

2035
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:04,060
We have to kill god

2036
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:09,580
He's a tyrant a self-righteous tyrant that blames all his mistakes on humans

2037
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:12,860
But what if he's not real sir, then what are you yelling about?

2038
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:19,020
But what if he is real then it's at the top of our drawer list to kill him. We have to do the chores

2039
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:21,900
But how do you kill someone that's omnipotent?

2040
02:23:22,060 --> 02:23:27,020
But what if he's just shitposting and he can be killed then we have to do it sir

2041
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:29,020
There's no way you can know that

2042
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:34,460
Failure is imminent. But so is our counter strike. Well, I'd like this

2043
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:43,180
Voicemail so it gets a little bit of credit, but it is bad and not funny. So no, this is

2044
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:52,620
Extremely philosophical voicemail because it sets up a um, uh, what is it a pose mugging?

2045
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:55,900
Uh, it's it's um, oh, what's this fucking name? Hang on

2046
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:59,900
Yeah, pascals wait

2047
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:05,260
Yeah, it sets up it sets up a pascals mugging where it's like we can kill god on the bet that he

2048
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:10,940
Isn't god that he's just lying about being god, which is infinitely more probable than him being god

2049
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:13,740
You know, I I do I do like that

2050
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:15,820
That's a very good hypothesis

2051
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:20,940
But I want to say that this this like performance wise it started out strong and it kind of peed it off a little bit

2052
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:26,380
I I feel like it I feel like it started out at this at at a level and it it just kind of stayed there

2053
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:31,580
Yeah, but it emotionally peed it out by not exceeding my expectations

2054
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:33,660
Yeah, I would agree

2055
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:39,260
And and I have the privilege of some experience with killing god with your lungs sound files

2056
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:43,020
Um, and this isn't living up to the levy jevy ones

2057
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:48,060
There's a little bit of of my mom's in other rooms so I can't scream too loud. There's a little bit

2058
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:55,500
Yeah, I like their use of the hegelian dialectic. Um, I thought I thought that was really effective. I don't know

2059
02:24:56,140 --> 02:24:59,020
Um, it sounds like we've got a good writer who should have hired up

2060
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:01,180
There's a you know, there's a lot

2061
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:04,620
There's a lot to love here. There's a lot to love here. Okay. There's a lot to not life

2062
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:07,900
Yeah, can I submit a last minute voicemail in yellow chat?

2063
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,700
Uh, uh

2064
02:25:11,660 --> 02:25:17,420
Just an image here. Uh, sure a voicemail voicemail aka an image file

2065
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:24,220
New piece of time image because it's pizza time. It's the joker and he's got pizza

2066
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:35,740
Everyone listening go to the comment section. We're making yellow episode two. This is the yellow cast two

2067
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:39,340
Uh, uh for yellow teams yellow cast two

2068
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:45,420
So, uh, you can get all the juicy details of what happened while the pcp. We're slacking off talking to

2074
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:10,620
I made it back

2075
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:12,620
Okay

2076
02:26:13,580 --> 02:26:16,220

It's uh, yeah, it's it's beer. It's beer. Okay. Good

2081
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:34,060
excellent

2082
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:36,060
Anyone else drinking anyone else got a beverage?

2083
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:39,180
God, I wish I was right now

2084
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:42,540
I have three cans deep in diet coke

2085
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:47,820
Nice jealous. I have I have a cup of um

2086
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,740
water

2087
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:51,980
That I have added a blue food coloring

2088
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:54,300
citric acid

2089
02:26:54,300 --> 02:26:57,500
uh, a blueberry flavor extract

2090
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:00,540
and and stevia

2091
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:02,540
And I'm swelling it around

2092
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:04,620
And it feels pretty good

2093
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:07,020
Think until like stevia drops or like the powder

2094
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:08,460
Oh

2095
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:11,660
I have I have come full around. I was using the powder for a while

2096
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:16,300
Now it's all about the drops. It's all about the flavor the flavor drops now

2097
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:21,100
Do you are you you do you do keto keto? Have you checked out my protein?

2098
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:25,420
Like they got some good deals on protein powders my I don't really do protein powder

2099
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:27,580
They're they're not like

2100
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:29,980
It's like not not so much for like working out or anything

2101
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:32,700
It's just like a supplement when it needs supplementing so you're not getting protein

2102
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:36,460
You know just like putting your diet as like because you know, maybe you're not getting enough

2103
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:39,020
It's just you know a replacement or a supplement, you know

2104
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:44,860
Well keto is about it's about fat. It's you want to go high fat like you want some protein, but not too much

2105
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:49,820
God like I went to I went to fucking like school for keseology and like I've hated keto for the longest time

2106
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:54,460
I still hate keto, but like I know it's usefulness and like interventions and how it can save lives

2107
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:56,300
I mean

2108
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:58,300
Like if you think back to

2109
02:27:58,460 --> 02:28:02,380
I'm not think back to because you're not a thousand you're not like you're not 10 000 years old, but

2110
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:05,340
Before the invention of agriculture

2111
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:07,260
You were in ketosis

2112
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:11,900
99% of the time and you only had like little bits and bobs of sugar every once in a while

2113
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:14,860
Yeah, that's the natural human state's what we're for

2114
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:17,420
Thank yes one

2115
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:19,020
Correct

2116
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:23,500
Factually factually accurate, but bread is so nice. It goes crunch

2117
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:26,220
It is really satisfying

2118
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:29,420
And that's why it's the devil's invention

2119
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:32,220
I wanted to be unsatisfied

2120
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:40,060
Um throughout my life. I would um, I already am so I don't want to add to that being off not helping you

2121
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:44,540
So why being off keto people say like oh, you know just eat moderately

2122
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:45,180
It's like okay

2123
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:49,740
Well being keto makes it easier for me to eat moderately because when I'm off keto

2124
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:52,780
I I like have no impulse control and I will just eat me

2125
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:55,740
I will eat an entire loaf of bread without even thinking about it

2126
02:28:55,740 --> 02:28:58,540
I do keto because I have no self control

2127
02:28:58,780 --> 02:29:05,420
Yeah, that actually makes sense if it's more sustainable sustainable for you than keto would be the thing to go with like eat what's sustainable

2128
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:07,980
Yeah

2129
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:11,260
I guess that makes sense. Yeah, do you like one piece?

2130
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:14,780
Yeah, I do a podcast about it

2131
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:17,980
I know I know I know

2132
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:20,140
Yeah, but do you like it though?

2133
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:22,540
Yes

2134
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:24,700
It's it's my favorite thing

2135
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:26,700
I think uh

2136
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:28,780
Ahead of berserk in mangas

2137
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:34,940
It's one of my favorite things too. Like I spent like many hours making this giant one piece video and then

2138
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:36,540
in like

2139
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:43,260
Fucking action giraffes in it. It's sick. It's awesome. Oh to shout it out. It's pretty neat. If you have time check it out video

2140
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:45,740
Wait

2141
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:52,540
I'm sorry, can you what do you mean oh to shout it out a video that you made this is what you're saying to me?

2142
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:55,420
Yes, yes, I I'm saying this like okay

2143
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:59,500
I'm saying it the the special intersection of

2144
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:04,780
Oda shouting out a video that has action giraffe in it is is the best thing

2145
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:06,060
What?

2146
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:10,140
How did this happen? It's my favorite thing ever giraffe is not in the title

2147
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:12,540
I can talk links about but that takes a lot of time

2148
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:18,220
But like so I'll just tell you like, you know how Oda how Oda found it. So yeah, uh, japanese yahu

2149
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:24,380
You know shared the video on like on a japanese news site after they'd been shared around on an amy news network and like um

2150
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:28,300
Some other things that's the name of the video. How do I pass the vivre car?

2151
02:30:28,300 --> 02:30:30,700
I pass vivre car and I started the hashtag

2152
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:36,060
It was cool and there's some ambiguity about who did all the work by spent many hours on it and like I didn't get paid for

2153
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:39,500
It was a passion project, but it's a giant cosplay collaboration

2154
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:45,260
Where I basically put a bunch of you know cosplayers from around the world and this giant pass the brush challenge

2155
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:49,100
But like, you know, it's not like, you know next person next person because that'd be too fucking long

2156
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:53,740
It's like a bunch of people on screen. It's a collage. It's basically a fucking video collage

2157
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:55,820
and you know with

2158
02:30:56,060 --> 02:30:58,060
It's your own staff's twitter

2159
02:30:58,220 --> 02:31:00,860
What they what they do from my understanding is um

2160
02:31:00,940 --> 02:31:04,860
Oda sort of like has someone else this like team or two people or one person

2161
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:08,700
Tweet on his behalf and they were like, this is pretty neat and like a lot

2162
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:11,980
You know the japanese have a lot of nice things to say about it and that made me feel good

2163
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:14,380
So now I edit stuff and now um

2164
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:17,020
Nice

2165
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:22,620
I was completely convinced that you were joking and there was no aspect of Oda shouting it out. That was true

2166
02:31:23,900 --> 02:31:27,740
But that that's that's great. It's like my yeah, like I asked, uh,

2167
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:32,860
Mr. Best best guy like it's like, hey, could you just give me bare minimum action giraffe

2168
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:36,780
Footage and he sent me like a like two minutes of just static action giraffe

2169
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:41,260
So instead of taking a png I like like uh rotoscope like, you know

2170
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:49,100
Action giraffe out of that video into my video and he plays kakku. I only like color like, you know changed it to make him more like kakku

2171
02:31:50,380 --> 02:31:52,380
But like uh, yeah, no, it's uh

2172
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:57,340
It's action giraffe. We got anri okita, you know, very nice woman. Uh in the video. We got, uh

2173
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:59,820
What's we got?

2174
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:03,020
We got some italian hosts and we got a bunch of nice japanese

2175
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:06,940
Footage and the japanese cosplays were fantastic. They all gave me their footage. Um

2176
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:11,980
They all gave me their footage like in a nice folder for me where it wasn't like, you know

2177
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:18,700
Later anything and they gave me 75 clips 76 clips of footage. It was easy. Everyone else was like, oh get to you later

2178
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:21,820
I heated it. I heated it. I was angry all the time. That's why there's two versions

2179
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:24,380
But the newest version has a nail in it. So that's kind of cool

2180
02:32:26,140 --> 02:32:31,660
Uh, that's uh, that's great. That's amazing. It's I was expecting it this to be like a viral video

2181
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:33,660
But like it it's only got a few hundred views

2182
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:37,980
So i'm really shocked that it would have made its way to oda himself

2183
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:44,060
Well, no, there's a 20. No, there's uh, there's the one that's like, uh, they linked in the chat is like 20 is like, uh,

2184
02:32:44,300 --> 02:32:45,420
20 000 views

2185
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:51,420
But like, oh, okay. That's not that's not that's not like that's the version that was shared and like the original plan was like

2186
02:32:51,740 --> 02:32:57,900
To like, you know, keep it unlisted because like, um, some other channel want to like post it but like it's like, you know

2187
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:01,180
America's like it was Funimation's uh one piece like

2188
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:04,380
PR department not PR but like marketing department or something like that

2189
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:09,580
Where they're like, can we post this on the Funimation channel? It's like cool, but they didn't so I just said, all right, whatever

2190
02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:14,060
It got enough traction where it was like, I'll just post it on my channel and make it unlisted and like

2191
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:18,620
It was unlisted so people were still getting to the video anyway from the news sites and like, uh

2192
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:21,100
The you know and shit

2193
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:23,180
He's really cool

2194
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:29,260
But uh, yeah, no, uh oda saw action giraffe. I think that's fucking hilarious. That is that is that was funny

2195
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:35,100
Um, shout that from the heavens, man. That's we know the purple story. Okay. Um, we um

2196
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:38,700
All right, we can't we got we got to get moving but before we go

2197
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:42,460
I am actually gonna take this chance to talk about

2198
02:33:43,100 --> 02:33:45,100
She's core once again

2199
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:47,580
Okay

2200
02:33:48,380 --> 02:33:51,340
Get absolute trash media on the map

2201
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:58,860
Absolute trash media. That's absolute trash media on bandcamp. Did I if you don't know where to start

2202
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:04,700
You you'll just you'll just search for chicago house classics

2203
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:12,300
That that that's a good part of that record label on bandcamp. That's absolute trash media

2204
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:18,300
Sure, I have seen us before and I'm not sure if you recommended it to me or someone else did

2205
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:21,740
But I have seen that I've seen this thing you're talking about. Okay

2206
02:34:22,380 --> 02:34:30,220
If you if you uh, don't want to check out chicago house classics check out whopper billionaires come album series

2207
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:34,380
There is come one two three four five and seven

2208
02:34:34,860 --> 02:34:43,340
If you want to find uh come six that doesn't exist as an album because that was just actually sarah louise coming for real

2209
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:46,860
And that's all I have to say about that

2210
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:54,860
Um, good. I thought it was really good. Fuck fuck. Yeah, but you're doing great before we go. Let's let's do a voicemail

2211
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:56,220
Shall we?

2212
02:34:56,220 --> 02:34:59,100
I've never done a voicemail before can we leave after that?

2213
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:02,700
No, you got to stick around we are going to go through the last two teams

2214
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:06,940
And then we will join up again at the group at the general chat for the end

2215
02:35:07,340 --> 02:35:10,620
But um, let's hear. Let's hear um, um, let's hear from uh

02:35:34,860 --> 02:35:36,540
It was uh

2220
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:42,940
What's the spicy the spicy cheese cheddar jack? I believe I could be wrong cheddar. I apologize if i'm not correct me

I believe it is cheddar jack and it was a really good

2223
02:35:47,420 --> 02:35:49,420
It was a really good grilled cheese sandwich

2224
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:51,420
I bet

2225
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:53,420
so

2226
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:57,820
I'm going to assume you're an intelligent person whoever maybe you want to respond to this

2227
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:02,620
And you don't see you're a real cheese sandwich normal cheese you do with a different cheese

2228
02:36:03,180 --> 02:36:06,300
What cheese is that because if it's normal cheese, which would be uh

2229
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:12,460
What would you call normal cheese the normal cheese everyone thinks of why did I choose this boring basic bitch ass

2230
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:15,180
clean looking yellow

2231
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:17,500
Pepper jack is the superior

2232
02:36:17,980 --> 02:36:23,740
The thing is I actually did and I actually did curate the voicemails and I deleted a few and this one made it made the cut

2233
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:30,300
Me I use clearly my group. Oh, we're actually talking about cheese earlier. So this works out very nicely. Good job

2234
02:36:30,460 --> 02:36:33,260
Yeah, let me tell you about the best cheese in the world

2235
02:36:33,740 --> 02:36:36,540

Yeah, yeah

2244
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:19,260
Oh my god. Yeah, well shit the difference. What's the what's the what's described the taste?

2245
02:37:20,220 --> 02:37:27,020
Okay, so it's a strong cheese and it's not stringy. It's not a stringy cheese. It's a runny cheese

2246
02:37:27,580 --> 02:37:29,580
And if it's in a solid

2247
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:36,380
State if it's in a solid state and it's not melt if it's not molten

2248
02:37:37,180 --> 02:37:42,620
Then it has a lot of holes and the holes are tighter and there are more of them

2249
02:37:43,340 --> 02:37:47,180
Okay, I can picture it. I can picture it in my mind

2250
02:37:49,340 --> 02:37:51,340
I would love to try it

2251
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:55,580
All cheese is not good. I don't like any of it. I haven't good

2252
02:37:55,900 --> 02:38:02,140
I've never eaten a cheese that I felt that I would want more of this fucking christ. Really? This is the worst thing I've ever heard

2253
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:05,820

02:38:54,860 --> 02:39:00,700
Oh, we were talking. Were we talking about that yesterday and I thought that that tweet was real, but it was fake. Yes

2265
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:06,220
Yeah, it's so believable. It's something he would absolutely say

2266
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:07,740
Yeah

2267
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:09,740
The one that's like, um, I know

2268
02:39:10,460 --> 02:39:15,580
The jokes about me and my wife don't bother me. We know that there's more to a marriage than sexual satisfaction

2269
02:39:15,820 --> 02:39:20,780
Yeah, my wife don't bother me. Um, I know there's more to a relationship than uh sex

2270
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:27,420
That's a lie. No, it's a lie. That's a lie. We need we need i'll be in here to get the impression just right

2271
02:39:27,740 --> 02:39:33,900
Yeah, it's funny because like if it's someone you thought would be having sex you'd be like, yeah, I know but it's Ben Shapiro

2272
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:37,900
Exactly

2273
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:42,060
Hey, you guys know Ben Shapiro's Jewish

2274
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:44,940
I've heard that

2275
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:46,940
I've heard that. Yeah, that's crazy

2276
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:51,500
That's like the first thing I learned about him. Do you have the recent papers?

2277
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:56,780
Lock it up. It's kind of weird Gib. We look at that. Yeah, why would you look that up?

2278
02:39:56,860 --> 02:39:58,860
That I just like I heard about him

2279
02:39:58,940 --> 02:40:04,540
You're looking at a list of as a he was a guy in a in a in a that's is in some video and he was like

2280
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:08,220
Honing noobs and he had of one of the funny caps on owning well, so

2281
02:40:13,820 --> 02:40:15,820
The hat on so I guess that makes sense

2282
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:18,540
the funny hat

2283
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:21,980
Why why isn't it no bigger?

2284
02:40:21,980 --> 02:40:28,220
Yeah, I I always I always thought it was called a a yamaka, but like lately I hear I hear everyone call it a skull cap

2285
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:30,620
I'm like do they change

2286
02:40:30,620 --> 02:40:32,620
Is just the Hebrew word

2287
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:34,620
Oh, okay

2288
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:39,820
Beanie but like it's

2289
02:40:39,820 --> 02:40:43,340
One that's like more form fitting to your head that's called a skull cap, isn't it? Yeah

2290
02:40:44,460 --> 02:40:47,260
I feel like I've heard people for yamakas as well

2291
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:53,340
Yeah, I've heard I've heard people more often in recent years. I've heard people refer to a yamaka as a skull cap

2292
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:55,420
And I thought it was weird. I thought

2293
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:59,660
Why is it what is it? No, come on

2294
02:41:00,380 --> 02:41:07,020
Is it is it is it okay? Well, maybe is it maybe a thing that it's like cultural appropriation like to like to say it in their language

2295
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:11,660
I'm thinking

2296
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:20,060
Yeah

2297
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:25,420
I mean, I don't I don't I don't I don't think it I don't think it would be weird either

2298
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:28,620
I'm just speculating on what the motive could be for this change that I've perceived

2299
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:31,100
SJWs

2300
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:40,220
You're not allowed to say yamaka. In fact, all Jews are banned to the ghettos because having them live with us would be cultural

2301
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:42,220
Appropriate

2302
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:51,020
You're slipping you're slipping back

2303
02:41:55,660 --> 02:41:57,660
Disavow disavow disavow

2304
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:03,500
I'm probably genetically Jewish myself anyway, who gives a fuck

2305
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:11,900
Ben can be a bigot. He's not one of the goys. Hey, yeah, thank you very much. I love that

2306
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:21,660
Yeah, you can get a voicemail

2307
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:28,140
Oh

2308
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:30,460
Here we go. Here we go. Yes

2309
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:36,860
Okay, in in in the purple chat in the purple chat, we're gonna listen to uh sefirio

2310
02:42:37,420 --> 02:42:39,420
You crin you just smooth brained

2311
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:42,460
Virgins who just left the chat somebody

2312
02:42:43,580 --> 02:42:46,540
Do you want to give a quick countdown ben? Yes. One two three

2313
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:51,820
Shut up. It's it's in the it's in the purple chat there. Uh, three two one play

2314
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:54,860
They're like two hours on a sunday afternoon

2315
02:42:55,260 --> 02:43:00,060
That is like so important that like being on the fucking podcast would have prevented that from doing

2316
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:04,620
I know the answer. It's nothing. This is like a complete like this is like a total like false

2317
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:09,820
Perception to be on the podcast is just to be present when the podcast is being recorded

2318
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:15,660
I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it. Um being on the pcb is like such

2319
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:18,300
It is like such an easy thing to do

2320
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:21,660
I actually kind of feel like not doing it is like irresponsible

2321
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:28,940
I challenge every pcb member that is not currently recording or has recorded in the last couple of weeks

2322
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:34,860
To come debate this point come on to the podcast and explain why it's so hard to get onto the podcast

2323
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:37,820
because if you don't

2324
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:40,380
and uh

2325
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:42,780
Checkmate

2326
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:50,300
That's

2327
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:56,540
Topic for topic next next topic episode. The topic is why we can't be on the podcast

2328
02:43:58,460 --> 02:44:00,460
And everyone's there

2329
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:02,540
Everyone shows up back

2330
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:04,940
This is a matter of great interest for everyone

2331
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:07,340
Jesse everyone is here

2332
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:12,940
Just like old times

2333
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:15,340
Yeah

2334
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:22,540
I hope it's transition and pre-transition eating and like

2335
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:33,500
All of our pony sonas come in

2336
02:44:36,860 --> 02:44:38,860
All of the jennesy characters

2337
02:44:39,740 --> 02:44:46,460
Whoever the the the north cast should work on a uh a pcp fighting game next. Oh, yeah

2338
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:52,460
Oh, yeah, just get on that. Yeah, just actually develop the rail rumble like

2339
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:11,260
From that one manga where he's like all his spine's broken, but he'll use his muscles to stand that's

2340
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:21,180
I think it might be I don't think it's was it. Oh god. I don't know

2341
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:25,980
I've only seen a little bit of baki. So I don't know. Yeah, I'm pretty stupid

2342
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:31,980
That sounds like something the way would happen in baki though. Yeah, it's yeah, it's that kind of show looking it up. I'm gonna find it

2343
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:37,420
All right, any members. What would your ultimate attack be in in the pcp fighting game?

2344
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:39,820
Yeah, what would your noble fantasy

2345
02:45:41,740 --> 02:45:44,060
My ultimate attack would probably be

2346
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:51,660
I think it would oh, okay. I think it would probably be I summon endless war and he delivers a bone herding beam

2347
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:56,060
Like mirrored like fox and falco

2348
02:45:56,860 --> 02:45:59,740
Yeah, I mean when she have like this mirror move sets

2349
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:05,660
Your move says but mirror special special file moves. Yeah, I think I think so. Yeah, I think so

2350
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:08,140
That makes that makes sense

2351
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:16,540
Oh

2352
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:27,420
It would be like peach and daisy pulling on veggies

2353
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:33,500
Like he pulls up winning the poo characters out of a vvhs tape. So if it's piglet, he throws it at him

2354
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:38,860
He gives him honey to recover health

2355
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:43,820
Yeah, I was gonna ask are the cop killer and ben saint two separate characters?

2356
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:49,420
Are the echo fighters or is one I think yeah, I think yeah ben saint is the c1 is the is the

2357
02:46:50,140 --> 02:46:54,540
Dimension 1218 one the cop killer is the one that exists in dimension c197

2358
02:46:54,940 --> 02:47:00,860
Duh, so so they would be they would have to be different characters because you know the echo fighters because yeah

2359
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:04,700
They have different stats, but the same like moveset. I yeah

2360
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:08,140
I think they'd be I think they'd just be echoes of each other

2361
02:47:18,940 --> 02:47:21,740
Munchy's neutral B is that he shoots you with a deagle

2362
02:47:24,220 --> 02:47:28,940
Okay, hey, okay, we we've been here in 10 minutes. We gotta move on to pink. We gotta move on to pink

2363
02:47:28,940 --> 02:47:30,940
Understood

2364
02:47:31,580 --> 02:47:35,260
When we're done, we will be we will all be we will all be meeting hey shut up

2365
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:38,620
We will all be meeting again in the general chat. Just so wait for that. I'll let y'all know. Okay

2366
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:41,580
What is the next video, Tom?

2367
02:47:42,940 --> 02:47:44,940
What

2368
02:47:55,820 --> 02:47:57,820
No, what's up

2369
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:00,940
It

2370
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:07,020
Hi, we've been bad now behind your back. Yeah, we've been talking about your back. That's that's what I like to hear

2371
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:09,900
Actually, not not really y'all but mostly ben

2372
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:16,060
We're back. What about we do that all the time? Oh, we've been talking behind your back. Yeah. I mean, that's what I expected

2373
02:48:16,700 --> 02:48:21,100
I would expect no better from the from the likes of you. Well, we just wanted to come clean with you

2374
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:28,060
Yeah, and just tell you that like up that the rain fall down and coming cleans my favorite hillary duff song

2375
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:33,740
I love that song my favorite hillary clinton song. It's my it's my favorite song to listen to the nightcore remix

2376
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:38,060
I was just I was literally just gonna say that it's such a good nightcore song

2377
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:45,180
It uh, I can't I can't believe you're unironically agreeing with me. But yes, it's true. I fucking love nightcore

2378
02:48:45,500 --> 02:48:47,100
There's a couple different versions of it

2379
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:52,140
And the the good one is the one that has the art of the anime girl like skydiving out of a plane

2380
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:54,380
That's the good one. The other ones are shit

2381
02:48:55,020 --> 02:49:01,740
I I definitely have had phases where I'm just like all I want to listen to is fucking fallout boy nightcore

2382
02:49:02,140 --> 02:49:03,100
Kesha nightcore

2383
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:06,140
I'll just type it in youtube and just go down the rabbit hole

2384
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:10,060
Like fallout boy normally not great. No

2385
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:11,660
Trash

2386
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:13,740
Yeah, fallout boy nightcore is completely different

2387
02:49:13,820 --> 02:49:17,500
I heard a snippet of like some pop song today and I like

2388
02:49:18,220 --> 02:49:20,620
I'd never heard it before and I heard like two seconds of it

2389
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:25,340
But I was like, hey, that's like a catchy beat and it sounds like just like some piece of shit generic pop song

2390
02:49:25,420 --> 02:49:27,420
I should look this up and like look into more of this

2391
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:29,900
Because I because I'm vibing with this right now

2392
02:49:30,460 --> 02:49:34,060
Uh, uh, this this is this is to my boring tastes

2393
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:36,780
Uh dab

2394
02:49:36,940 --> 02:49:38,940
I thought you were gonna say that you were gonna nightcore it

2395
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:43,820
No, no, I would never do that. I would never do that

2396
02:49:44,300 --> 02:49:50,300
I mean making nightcore it's not it's not just speed it up like a good nightcore mix is like mixed

2397
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:54,140
Yeah, you have to make it. So yeah, so you just beat it up. It's gonna sound like shit

2398
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:58,380
And I'm and I don't have the skills to do a good job with it. So why even bother?

2399
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:03,340
I make a ton of nightcore edits of songs that I need to be faster. Yeah, I have tons there

2400
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:09,820
Uh, do you listen to ag cook? You just put out like a new 49 song album. No, I don't know who that is

2401
02:50:10,380 --> 02:50:12,780
He's he's like the creator of pc music

2402
02:50:13,340 --> 02:50:15,340
Um

2403
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:17,180
I'm not familiar with that

2404
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:24,700
So he put out a 49 track album and like pretty much immediately after I nightcore like five of them and then put them all on youtube

2405
02:50:25,180 --> 02:50:31,340
Because I just needed them to be nightcore. Why would anyone do that to themselves a 49 track album? That's terrifying

2406
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:38,700
I don't know. I think he had a bunch of stuff saved up because he released a 49 track one and then announced a 10 track one

2407
02:50:39,100 --> 02:50:43,020
Oh god, because yeah, I can I can barely put 10 songs together much less

2408
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:49,260
Anywhere close to that the 49 track one is kind of like just a huge compilation of b-sides

2409
02:50:49,900 --> 02:50:51,900
But it's super good

2410
02:50:51,900 --> 02:50:53,900
I mean that is pretty cool. Yeah

2411
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:59,500
Then we came to the conclusion that at the very least this whole podcast is an interesting social experiment

2412
02:50:59,900 --> 02:51:02,060
Yeah, yeah, that's my excuse too

2413
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:09,500
Because we've just been hanging out here for like two hours now just getting to know each other at least three random people

2414
02:51:10,220 --> 02:51:15,100
At least drunk ben, you know drunk ben knew how to run a good social experiment

2415
02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:19,100
sober ben has no fucking clue what he's doing

2416
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:24,220
So sober sober clue is floundering. Oh god. I'm floundering. Oh god go to voicemails. Oh fuck

2417
02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:26,700
That's why you're part of the social experiment

2418
02:51:28,060 --> 02:51:32,860
Yeah, I'm as much I'm as much as subject as anyone else because drunk ben initiated this whole thing and and

2419
02:51:33,260 --> 02:51:38,860
Sober ben is just like his victim. He just has to like live in this in he just has to lie in this shit

2420
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:41,820
That's drunk ben made in the bed

2421
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:48,620
So do you think this is going to do anything to like dissuade you from getting drunk ben out of the cage in the future?

2422
02:51:49,260 --> 02:51:51,420
Um, or is it gonna push him further?

2423
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:55,660
No, this won't but other things probably will

2424
02:51:56,780 --> 02:52:03,820
Uh, uh, like how I fucking ruined my other roommate's day by waking him up at four in the morning yelling on my fucking computer

2425
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,780
Oh, he was mad

2426
02:52:07,180 --> 02:52:09,180
And they made me made me upset

2427
02:52:09,580 --> 02:52:10,780
Okay, I gotta ask here

2428
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:15,660
So you fell asleep like midway through that voice call and were like muttering no in your sleep

2429
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:19,180
Were you being prevented by dream demons? I was muttering no

2430
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:25,260
Yeah, and it was right as we're I mean it was where we were watching the every no and mlp video

2431
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:29,500
But oh, but you are on the stream. So there's no way you could have heard it

2432
02:52:30,460 --> 02:52:32,460
What the fuck

2433
02:52:33,580 --> 02:52:39,100
Do you remember do you remember being in the call and like I mean, I do you know that you fell asleep and

2434
02:52:39,660 --> 02:52:41,660
Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I remember that

2435
02:52:41,820 --> 02:52:46,220
Okay, a lot of people jumped in and talked around you which was funny

2436
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:52,060
I mean, I probably couldn't hear anything because I wouldn't have had my headphones in if I fell asleep unless I fell asleep with them on

2437
02:52:53,660 --> 02:52:55,100
I don't which be

2438
02:52:55,580 --> 02:52:59,740
Seems unlikely seems unlikely, but I guess I guess you never know seems uncomfortable

2439
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:06,300
Yeah, aren't you screaming in your heart and wake you up prove the headphone? Well, that's well, that's embarrassing

2440
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:10,860
Terrible just just terrible

2441
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:18,780
Uh, how would you do you guys want to listen another voicemail or you guys want to you know, what do you what do you want to talk about?

2442
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:20,860
And here we got a couple more minutes

2443
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:22,940
I wanted to tell a little story about

2444
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:24,700
uh

2445
02:53:25,020 --> 02:53:30,300
Me and some friends met up over new years and some of them were also working on the dating sim

2446
02:53:30,780 --> 02:53:34,060
and on new new year's eve like after midnight

2447
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:35,980
uh, we

2448
02:53:35,980 --> 02:53:42,220
I I basically we came to the conclusion that the release of a pcb dating sim would either mark

2449
02:53:42,700 --> 02:53:48,620
The beginning of the end of the pcb or revitalize the hype and i'm not sure what happened

2450
02:53:48,940 --> 02:53:55,900
I'm not sure which of these two things has happened. What what what made you think that one of those things would happen

2451
02:53:57,020 --> 02:54:02,540
I don't know because okay, it was around the time that um that we heard that mage left and

2452
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:07,580
like a few weeks a few weeks later fucking, uh, bread happened

2453
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:09,820
and

2454
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:12,060
I don't know everything seems kind of

2455
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:17,180
Uh, kind of climb climb mactical, you know, yeah, yeah

2456
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:19,900
And with rad con, you know

2457
02:54:20,780 --> 02:54:21,820
Yeah

2458
02:54:21,820 --> 02:54:28,140
Of the other end rad con happened around that time. Yeah, that was three rad con and then there was rad con rad con was a high point for sure

2459
02:54:28,940 --> 02:54:33,580
I think on what's a high point, but then this came another dark age and it's it's yeah

2460
02:54:34,300 --> 02:54:36,300
I didn't see another one coming

2461
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:37,900
Yeah, so

2462
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:43,260
All of the all of the stuff with with brad and then how it came back and destroyed the videos

2463
02:54:43,820 --> 02:54:50,300
That's been a low point. I feel like we're getting back to things though. Like things are videos are being released

2464
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:53,820
If it's another low point

2465
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:56,540
It's it's climbing up

2466
02:54:56,620 --> 02:55:03,340
Yeah, the the second the second hack like felt worse than the first the second dark age felt worse than the first one

2467
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:06,620
Oh, yeah, I think it's because it came. I mean the first one came unexpectedly

2468
02:55:06,860 --> 02:55:09,580
But it's like since you had already weathered one of them

2469
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:12,140
It just felt sad

2470
02:55:12,140 --> 02:55:13,980
Yeah, it wasn't like

2471
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:19,420
It wasn't there wasn't the sense of like, oh, how is what's gonna happen? Like how like what like what is our fate?

2472
02:55:22,540 --> 02:55:24,940
It was like we had survived the first one

2473
02:55:25,020 --> 02:55:30,540
But we hadn't had long enough of like a time to like feel good because the world had gone to shit

2474
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:33,180
You also didn't have rad con to look forward to

2475
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:36,060
Yeah, no and and then

2476
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:40,780
Yeah, it's just sort of like we didn't get up to a high point before we were brought back down

2477
02:55:41,580 --> 02:55:47,740
It just kind of it just kind of felt like the first one had never actually ended. We were just like still in it

2478
02:55:49,020 --> 02:55:53,740
You know because it was like technically caused by the same problem or it was like an outgrowth of it

2479
02:55:53,980 --> 02:55:57,420
Do they ever specify like the reason why they terminated it?

2480
02:55:58,460 --> 02:56:00,460
Or why they like or why they

2481
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:03,340
No, because I know it was related to the hack

2482
02:56:03,420 --> 02:56:08,060
But they never really said for what purpose we we assumed it was related to the hack

2483
02:56:08,060 --> 02:56:13,260
Because it was just the videos that came out after we got the channel back. I think it was it was um

2484
02:56:14,140 --> 02:56:16,140
It was for like illegal activity

2485
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:20,380
Which i'm pretty sure means they thought they were branding banning like brad garling house

2486
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:26,060
They're like ripples streaming or whatever. I think that's what they thought they were doing or what the algorithm thought it was doing

2487
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:30,060
That's yeah, that's what I assumed. I just my that's my theory

2488
02:56:30,220 --> 02:56:31,820
I'm not entirely

2489
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:36,460
What was weird to me was the part where you couldn't it was like the old content was fine

2490
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:40,300
But then anything past a certain point got flagged that was fucked

2491
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:43,420
Yeah, that's why it had to be hack related

2492
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:46,940
The only exception was the the rad con stream the opening ceremony

2493
02:56:46,940 --> 02:56:50,780
That was the one thing that like escaped the the notice or whatever

2494
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:56,220
Okay, anyway, uh, yeah, that was all shit. It was all terrible. We're talking about

2495
02:56:56,700 --> 02:56:58,060
voicemail

2496
02:56:58,060 --> 02:57:02,460
Yeah, let's let's do a voicemail and then let's jump back into okay. This is um

2497
02:57:03,180 --> 02:57:08,380
Okay, I won't do that one because that's just what we were already talking about. Let's do um, let's do uh

2498
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:11,020
barefoot on the freeway

2499
02:57:12,060 --> 02:57:16,380
This isn't oh wait. No, I post shit. I posted in the wrong chat Lamal

2500
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:21,900
Uh a bare barefoot on the freeway in in the pink chat

2501
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:25,580
Okay

2502
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:29,340
We gonna play this on three two one go

2503
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:37,340
Okay, so I'm here with my brother. Um, and we're in California and the smoke is so thick currently that I can

2504
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:41,340
I'm looking at the sun while I'm driving right now. Um, that's dumb

2505
02:57:42,220 --> 02:57:46,220
And it's it's fine. It looks like the moon. No, don't stare at the sun

2506
02:57:46,460 --> 02:57:50,940
But what I want to complain about is that there's no words at the end of the podcast

2507
02:57:51,340 --> 02:57:53,340
Uh, there's just the bum-ba-bum-ba-bum

2508
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:57,820
What happened to this sucking and jerking? Please? Please help

2509
02:57:58,060 --> 02:57:59,580
Oh

2510
02:57:59,580 --> 02:58:05,340
In the sun my dick. I'm sucking myself. I'm jerking right. I didn't even notice that

2511
02:58:05,740 --> 02:58:07,740
Uh, I guess elias are stopped using that

2512
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:09,980
um

2513
02:58:09,980 --> 02:58:14,220
I guess I guess the I mean maybe the idea was that the outro was like too long

2514
02:58:14,460 --> 02:58:16,620
So he just cut it down to only the music

2515
02:58:17,260 --> 02:58:19,260
No, no, no the the music um

2516
02:58:19,980 --> 02:58:23,500
Oh, is there not even a tune? There's an instrumental version. I yeah

2517
02:58:24,140 --> 02:58:27,180
Yeah, like I've I've in the past used

2518
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:34,620
The uh, the one with vocals and then sometimes the one without vocals most of the time without without work focus, I think

2519
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:39,820
Um, it's just because when you fade it out, you don't want to fade it out in the middle of a word. I guess

2520
02:58:41,580 --> 02:58:43,580
I mean if people miss the words

2521
02:58:44,460 --> 02:58:49,020
I just want to say I really like the voicemail because it was like an authentic conversation in a car

2522
02:58:49,740 --> 02:58:54,780
No, it wasn't any other guy. There's a special guest on the voicemail. Yeah

2523
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:58,940
That guy's voice was scarily familiar to me and that worries me

2524
02:59:00,380 --> 02:59:05,100
Uh, dude, I don't know how much can you tell from the cell phone?

2525
02:59:07,420 --> 02:59:09,420
It's probably because you've talked on a phone before

2526
02:59:12,220 --> 02:59:15,900
But on the other hand, I'm kind of miss the high production voicemails

2527
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:21,740
I missed them snakes. There's there's yeah. Oh man. I remember them snakes

2528
02:59:21,820 --> 02:59:25,180
There's one there is one in here that I got this week that was like

2529
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:30,460
Someone just like says something stupid and then starts like playing a guitar or whatever starts like playing the piano

2530
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:33,900
Uh, and I was like boy, that takes me back. That used to be a whole genre

2531
02:59:36,380 --> 02:59:40,620
Uh, they they've fallen they've fallen out of fashion, I guess but they could always be brought back

2532
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:43,980
Uh

2533
02:59:44,300 --> 02:59:46,780
Was the do you remember the communist hell saga?

2534
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:49,980
Yeah, a little bit. I don't know if it ever

2535
02:59:50,700 --> 02:59:52,220
Exactly ended

2536
02:59:52,220 --> 02:59:56,300
Yeah, I mean, I just can't I just went on and like cussed you guys out in spanish, but that was about it

2537
02:59:57,420 --> 03:00:03,100
Was that you was it or were you part of it? Yeah, I was communist shea gavara the ghost of shea gavara

2538
03:00:03,580 --> 03:00:09,980
Okay, I really killed it was the ghost of chairman mal. That's the one I remember is is the ghost of chairman mal

2539
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:11,740
um

2540
03:00:11,740 --> 03:00:13,020
I don't

2541
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:18,780
I don't did I I don't remember if the pcp communist hell arc ever concluded

2542
03:00:19,740 --> 03:00:22,380
Someone comment. I don't know how did that result?

2543
03:00:22,780 --> 03:00:29,340
I think it was it was like a weird thing where many people were like working on responding to another one another

2544
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:32,780
Yeah, it was it was not a centralized effort

2545
03:00:33,100 --> 03:00:37,740
It was almost like a weird arg because then it overlapped where there was like the pc police

2546
03:00:38,140 --> 03:00:43,900
Trying to take you guys down. Yeah, I feel like that was happening like concurrently and it felt like related somehow

2547
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:45,980
But it wasn't quite the same

2548
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:48,620
There was a whole saga going on for sure

2549
03:00:49,180 --> 03:00:53,260
Multiple there are multiple multiple sagas. Um, okay. I think

2550
03:00:53,900 --> 03:00:57,740
We should break and I'll head back to the general chat. What are we? Oh, yeah

2551
03:00:58,540 --> 03:01:04,780
Sounds good. Yeah. Okay. We're headed back for for I'd I guess closing ceremonies or whatever. Okay. Fuck. Yeah

2552
03:01:04,780 --> 03:01:07,420
Last seconds of chill, okay

2553
03:01:35,580 --> 03:01:37,580
I

2554
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:47,100
Told you it's not okay. You are a minor. I'll keep it down. I'll do it a little more quietly. Thanks. Thanks

2555
03:01:48,780 --> 03:01:51,980
Well, well, uh, we're all here now because uh

2556
03:01:56,220 --> 03:01:59,260
Today I learned the pcp fans are the worst

2557
03:01:59,580 --> 03:02:04,300
Um, they can't shut the fuck up and I became one of them. I am part of the problem now

2558
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:07,180
I should be put down like a dog in it

2559
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:14,700
Thanks so much. It was very peaceful. The yellow cast was great and peaceful. I think you just had a bad hashtag down

2560
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:17,500
We became best friends

2561
03:02:19,980 --> 03:02:21,980
This is a new arc for the pcp fan

2562
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:24,380
Shut up

2563
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:26,540
Oh my god

2564
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:28,540
This is the best in the list forever

2565
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:31,900
100 episodes a week

2566
03:02:56,540 --> 03:02:58,540
Oh

2567
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:24,700
Where are you

2568
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:27,820
Are you real are you a real person? I don't think no nobody here's

2569
03:03:42,940 --> 03:03:46,460
