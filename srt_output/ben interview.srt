00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello everybody and welcome to a very special podcast that I'm doing. I'm doing an interview with Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Patreon.com slash Ben Saint. That's what my mother used to say as she dand-dandled me on her knee.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:26,200
I-I real- the inspiration for this came from me realizing that me and you have never done a, uh, a just direct me and you collab before.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,800
We have never collabed. We've never even had like a one-on-one conversation except- except through text.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,600
And, uh, we were gonna- we were gonna work on that thing. I don't know if I can- you- you mentioned hiring-

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah, you mentioned hiring me one time to draw an- an- an animatic for the sort-out-online rewrite, but, uh, I guess that hasn't gone anywhere.

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah, there's a- I- I came up with this whole alternate version of sort-out-online that, uh, that I was excited about.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,200
And then as I was, uh, talking about it and stuff online, people kept telling me that that's essentially what sort-out-online abridged is.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,200
Where their show is- they're trying to like make it like a good- like they're- they're trying to make a good version of the show and, um,

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,400
But I'm sure theirs is completely different from mine because they're using assets that are in the show already, so there's only so much they can even do with it.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Whereas mine is like a total rewrite, um, but- and I haven't watched it yet.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,200
And that's kind of like the main thing is that as I was writing this, I kind of felt like I should know everything about sort-out-online before I do this.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,000
You know, like, maybe I should read the books or watch SAO Abridged and like make sure I know that my version's unique and interesting.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, I really like the idea of the project. I really liked, um, the thought that I might get paid, um, at all. It was pretty nifty.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it could still happen if, uh, if I ever get around back to it. It's just a- like, I don't know how excited you decide to do it.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah. It's basically supposed to be like the Star Wars- what if the prequels were good videos by belated media was the inspiration.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, um, for our audience who might not have an image in their head, uh, where he was doing with the animatic versions of his remake and I was going to have Ben draw them for me,

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
because Ben is really great at that kind of animatic work, because you have these- you're-

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You, uh, you were really excited about my, um, the things that I drew in the comics jam at BronyCon that one year.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah. You said you were really impressed by the- by my swiftness in just turning out like a multi-panel little bit.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've been impressed with all your work because of the fact that I think you have very dynamic panels. Like, regardless of the- like, you can draw something with no detail and it looks good,

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because, like, you could draw a good stick figure drawing, because you know how to frame stuff in these dynamic ways, which I think is the biggest weakness of most, like, internet artists,

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is that they know how to make things look detailed and, like, pretty, but the poses are terrible.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I agree. I think that a lot of comic artists- like, like, I go on- I go on Reddit r slash comic crits a lot.

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I'll see- I mean, some- some people are just terrible, you know, obviously, but other people are, like, kind of good.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But, I don't know, there's one guy in particular, like, he posts and, like, he does really great pages, and they're really highly detailed, but, like, they're not interesting.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like, they're really- like, he'll draw, like, a monkey screaming and he'll have, like, every, like, you know, line in the monkey's face and every hair on his face, like, you know, painstakingly inked in and, like, it's a gorgeous rendering.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But, like, it's not- it's not any better, you know, I think simplicity. I'm all about simplicity. I'm all about that Scott Pilgrim's iconic simplicity.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, I think that's kind of one of the most interesting things for me about you is that you have, like, a very clear taste.

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I feel like me and you are alike in this regard, and not- like, not that we have the same taste, but that we have something very specific that we look for,

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
where, for me, it's density. It's like, I like for there to be as much going on at a given time as possible, but I also-

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, I like that too. I like things with a lot going on, but I really hate-

34
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But I think you also value brevity a lot, you know?

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, I mean, the brevier something is, the denser it is. If there's the same amount- if there's the same amount of stuff in it, but it's briefer, then it's also denser.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's why I like- yeah, I like Fully Coolie more than Ava, because I think it does more good in its six episodes, you know?

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Like, per- like, minute to minute, I think it's got more going on.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, and you tend to value this from YouTube videos as well, that you really like the shorter ones.

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I do, and that's why I complain to Jesse all the time, that his videos are too long. They've got, like, funny nuggets in them.

40
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But then there'll be all this, like, ranty stuff, and I'm like, just get the good part.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm willing to waste all day just sitting through every Jesse video, you know?

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And, like, if one part of it makes me laugh, I feel like I didn't waste my time, but I also am not doing anything, so it's-

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But you're always, like, the- you like those little three-minute ones, the ones that are just, like, a gem of, like, hardened gold, you know?

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, I liked Man Child Marsh. It was, like, pretty concise. It had stuff going on throughout. It was always progressing.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I think that's what attracted you to Davoo's videos as well.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I love Davoo. I love his- his- his conciseness.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, he definitely values that. He does- he doesn't like to have to over-explain anything for the sake of the audience, which unfortunately, I've had to, like, talk him into adding more clarifications,

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
because, like, when you're on YouTube, people just don't get it, like-

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Davoo is hard to- he's hard to understand sometimes. His point doesn't always come across that clearly.

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think it's a matter of, like, you know, you can be obtuse and some people will get it, and you're never gonna make everybody understand, so you don't want to go too far out of your way to, like, over-explain anything.

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean- I mean, Best Guy Ever is that other extreme. Best Guy Ever explains too much, and goes, yeah, and, like, recounts the show.

52
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But at the same time, you know, it means that nobody watches Best Guy Ever's video and doesn't get it, you know?

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, nobody doesn't get it, although someone like me is, like, just get to the fucking point already. What are you trying to say?

54
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know this stuff. I don't know. Yeah, but he says he writes his videos as, like, I don't know, he writes them to be accessible, which I guess they are.

55
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Right. And I also think that another thing that me and you have in common is that the work we make very much reflects our taste.

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You have- your artwork is usually pretty pared down. You like sparse dialogue, I've noticed a lot. There's almost never any, like, long dialogue sections in your comics.

57
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, Digi, this new one that I'm working on, Champion, is really wordy. Like, I need to go back and cut it down.

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, because there's a lot of, like- there's a lot of- I mean, maybe it's just because the first chapter and I'm establishing the scenario, but, like, a lot of characters have to deliver a lot of exposition in this first bit to, like-

59
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, this is more of a-

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Fill in what's happening. It's really wordy. Like, some of the pages are, like, half-words.

61
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It is- it is- I mean, there's more of a- there's more of an actual plot that needs to be presented instead of the, like-

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The Vapors has almost no dialogue. Like, the Vapors is just, like, images of people being miserable or being terrible.

63
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's, like, very- I think it's kind of remarkable that you have the whole scene where, like, Vincent walks into the anime club or whatever it was.

64
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a game- gaming club.

65
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, gaming club. And completely no dialogue. We understand everything he thinks in that moment, because he just starts fantasizing about himself with this girl and, you know, the A-rank.

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, yeah, the one-

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This epic fantasy of him with girls on both legs and stuff, and it's, like, you completely get his motivation, and there are no words there. So I think that's really impressive, personally.

68
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thanks. I, um, yeah, I don't know. I guess something about-

69
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Something about the story or what I was presenting with the Vapors, I just felt like dialogue wasn't the way to do it, uh, which is, uh, I think it came out alright.

70
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think it- I think that's what makes it, uh, kind of sets it apart from, like, because you've compared it a lot to Watamote.

71
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, Watamote explains itself very clearly, though.

72
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Right. Watamote is always internal monologue and everything.

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Which I think is-

74
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Honestly, like, I think in comparing Vapors to Watamote, that's, like, the big difference that stands out to me.

75
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

76
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And that kind of made me want to make my next thing wordier, because, like, the thing about the Vapors is it took me months to make, and you can blast through it in, like, five minutes.

77
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

78
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can read the whole thing in, like, five, ten minutes tops.

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think that's always the biggest problem with being this kind of artist is, like-

80
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, because, like you said, you're doing, like, long- it takes a lot longer to make than it does to read, and I think when people read something that fast and it doesn't have, like, a clear punchline, then they feel like they haven't consumed as much.

81
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It is. The Vapors, you know, like, much like its name, the Vapors is- it's kind of insubstantial, you know, it's like-

82
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

83
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It only takes, like, five minutes, whereas, like, the more words on a page, the longer it takes, and, like, the longer you're looking at that page.

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right.

85
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So I kind of wanted more words, and, you know, more of a plot, things like that.

86
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I would say, like, when I first read Brunswick, I was, like- I was, like, taken aback by how fast it moves.

87
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But I think it still worked, and it was really interesting to me that, like, the emotional gut punch at the end was still so strong, even though I hadn't spent much time with the characters or talked to them at all, you know.

88
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's very self-insert, where, like, you have to put yourself in the mindset of the trainer and his, like, sort of, cutthroat attitude in everything that he has, which I really love.

89
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I love that your characters are all dickbags. Like, that's the best part to me.

90
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean, I didn't set out to make the trainer in Brunswick a dickbag, although he kind of is, but that's just because he- everything he thinks is what I would think.

91
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So he's just kind of like, well, kill these guys, kill everything, whatever. Brunswick, you're ugly. I hate you. Oh, now you're cool. Well, now I like you.

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He- yeah, I tried to give him- I tried to give that- even though he's sort of a non-character, I tried to give him an arc of, like, he starts out being totally impartial to Brunswick,

93
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and he only wants him for utilitarian purposes, and then he kind of gets- like you, the reader, hopefully, you kind of get attached to him.

94
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I just spend a little more time with him. He grows into a big badass, and then you're like, yes, yes, but then no.

95
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And it's just the phrasing of how, like, he's so disappointed in it, but then as soon as he sees it, he's like- he's like blown away.

96
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Like, you're a badass! It's the perfect choice of words, you know? A badass!

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah. I wanted it to- I don't know. I tried to make- I tried to make it a little goofy, you know?

99
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah.

100
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like, when Brunswick shoots the ice shards, and just, like, skewers that gravel area, he's like, ah, shit!

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know. I had more fun with it, and with Brunswick.

102
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Like, I always- I worry a bit, and this is part of why I wanted to interview you.

103
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Like, I worry a little that your readers might not get where the comics are coming from as much.

104
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Where, like, for me, because I know you, and I've known you for a couple years now, I've met you in person, and, like, the way these comics are is, like, exactly how you are.

105
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's-

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm happy to hear that. I'm glad that you think that.

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah. I think a lot of you comes through in these comics, and your general attitude towards the world where you don't really hold anything on us pedestal.

108
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
No.

109
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have a very, like, what's the word I'm looking for? Not grim, but, like, cynical view towards other people and to yourself, and you're not easy to impress.

110
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm definitely not easy to impress, and I'm very, like, I don't know, I guess I just see the world in a very pragmatic way, but, like, I've come to terms with it, like, I don't see that as a negative way to look at things.

111
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's just how- it's just the easiest way for me to deal with the world.

112
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, it makes it great when you- because you're the kind of person who, when you pay a compliment to something, I always feel like it's, like, yeah, I've done something great, you know?

113
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's what I want. Like, I don't- yeah, I don't want to be willy-nilly with my praise or my criticism, you know? I want it to-

114
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right.

115
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, I- you know, I mean, you talk a lot about authenticity. I try to go for authenticity as much as I can.

116
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think that's a pretty common element among the procrastinators in general, is we're all very, like, you know, this modern internet kind of person of kind of bearing it all and we're not really-

117
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know, you're more private in terms of, like, specific details of your life than maybe me or Jesse, who is, like, here's a video of me eating a taco, you know, like-

118
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think-

119
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is what I did today.

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, I mean, I think people- yeah, I feel like I have a decent grasp of, like, your day-to-day life. Jesse's, like, not quite as much, but, like, I kind of have a foggy idea of it.

121
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I've been thinking about doing some, like, draw vlogs, like Will Terrell does, where, like, he'll draw and talk at the same time, just so I can try to, like, I don't know, I feel like people that-

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
even listening to the PCP, people don't really know, you know, much about who I am. Like, yeah, like you were saying, like, you've met me in person and you kind of know what sort of person I am.

123
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I feel like a lot- like, no one else- I wouldn't expect anyone else to really know me, except through my comics.

124
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I mean, for a lot of- like, I think for a lot of people, they wouldn't- like, what does it matter? Like, you're an artist, but-

125
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah.

126
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Like I said, for me, so much of you comes through in the comics that it enhances it for me, where I really- like, especially with Brunswick, where the character feels so much like, I know this is totally what you went through, you know?

127
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

128
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Like, this had to be the exact thoughts you were having.

129
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, I've thought about this a lot, and like, even though I haven't produced that many comics, I feel like there's a real strong thematic thread in all my protagonists.

130
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Like-

131
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

132
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like, Phantom Horn is basically Vincent, and Vincent is basically Sophia. Only Sophia's in, like, this magical world of, like, bullshit.

133
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But yeah, they're all the same kind of dick.

134
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And something about their, like, stories in the world they live in is that they're the only dick in a world of, like, otherwise nice people.

135
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Pretty normal people, yeah.

136
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, but like, they're the biggest dicks, but they're the most- they wear their heart on their sleeve.

137
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Right. And they don't try to. They have this mental image of themselves as that they are great, and everyone can see through it quite easily.

138
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah. But at least- but they're honest, you know? They're honest about their disdain.

139
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think to get a little analytical about the Vapors versus Watamote, I think-

140
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah.

141
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think Watamote much more invites the audience to, like, to say, like, I'm totally like that. Yeah, this is relatable.

142
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I think with Vincent, there's a little bit more of, like, being out- like, you have to really- like, how do I put this?

143
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
With Watamote, she kind of makes it easy for you to say, like, oh my god, I'm just like her.

144
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because she's, like, kind of a cute girl, and she's, you know, kind of- like, that's always been my biggest issue with the show is just kind of that-

145
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why would a cute girl be so unpopular?

146
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah. And I mean, they do a decent enough job of, like, I love that when she tries to look cute, then she comes out looking hideous, you know?

147
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

148
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like, the art definitely makes it like, okay, she looks fucking weird when she tries to, like, you know, dress up and stuff.

149
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But her normal mode looks pretty- her normal mode looks pretty good, though, just in that generic way that all anime characters just kind of look cute, no matter what they do.

150
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And I think it's just- it's very easy to be on her side and to sympathize with her, whereas-

151
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean, I hate her. She's like- I think she's terrible.

152
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah.

153
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I mean, I'm rooting for her to get better.

154
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Right. I think with Vincent, though, it's a lot harder to be on- to, like, to say, yeah, that's totally what I'm like, you know?

155
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, I mean-

156
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know, he's- if you- you look at him and you're like, he's a real shit, but then if you have the strength of mind to then admit to yourself that you do have some things in common with Vincent, then, you know, it's like even- even more powerful, I think.

157
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, he's-

158
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In a way.

159
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He's just like me.

160
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
He's just like me, did she?

161
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But he's-

162
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's me.

163
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But he's got the fedora in the-

164
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

165
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Or the-

166
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, he's like- he's like a caricature of, like, my younger self.

167
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He's like-

168
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Right.

169
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He's like how I used to be only worse.

170
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He's just the worst parts of myself.

171
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I just- I love how completely hateable he is.

172
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And-

173
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I love to hate him.

174
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah.

175
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's great.

176
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I-

177
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

178
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I connected with him pretty- like, I love Vincent as a character.

179
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like, even though it was only two chapters, like, the speci-

180
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's just that the specific things you made the characters do were all so great.

181
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Like, Magda turning on the shower with her clothes on just because she wanted to avoid people.

182
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Like, I thought that was like a powerful image where I was like, oh man, that's- that's heavy.

183
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And it's just one thing, but I completely get her character now, you know?

184
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I didn't need anything else.

185
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I mean, that's- that's something that I have done myself.

186
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've just, you know, pretended to be in the shower and the bathroom just to wait for people to leave

187
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
just because I don't want to make eye contact with anyone.

188
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You know, when I- when I'm feeling more antisocial than usual.

189
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've- I've been there in- in my own weird- I- I like a- you know, if I have to take a shit in a public place,

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't want to leave while anyone else is in there.

192
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You know?

193
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

194
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Like, I don't want people to see the guy who took the shit.

195
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah.

196
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't- I don't like people hearing me in the bathroom.

197
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I like to turn on the faucet so no one can hear me- can hear my- my gross body sounds.

198
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I mean, that's so, like, I don't want you to know what my poop sounds like.

199
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's- that's fucked up, dude.

200
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I totally get it, though.

201
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, yeah.

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Nobody gets it.

203
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And then, of course, like with chapter two, like, of the Vapors,

204
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
just the fact he was reading Infinite Jests made it so perfect.

205
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Like, that book was the optimal choice.

206
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And you yourself have read it and carried it around.

207
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I had finished reading it, like, a couple months before.

208
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So, like, I know- so, like, I know what the- what it looks like when someone reads that book

209
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
because, like, I was aware of it and, like, I picked it up to read based on that image that it has

210
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
of being, like, this big, like, important quote-unquote, you know, a fucking complicated thing.

211
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Incredibly long.

212
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

213
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And it has a title, like, Infinite Jest, you know?

214
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's, like- it's-

215
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, if you finish it, if you read the whole thing, it's, like, a- you know,

216
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
you put a little feather in your cap because you're a cool, smart guy.

217
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

218
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And it- the title is, like, that- it's that perfect mixture of, like, Infinite,

219
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
like, all possibilities, and then Jest, it's all a joke.

220
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's, like, everything's a joke.

221
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's, like, the ultimate irony, you know?

222
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
True.

223
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And then that level of irony, nothing.

224
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But it's- it's also a Shakespeare reference.

225
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, I did not even know that.

226
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That just takes it to the next level.

227
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I hope I'm not- I hope I'm not wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's from Hamlet.

228
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Probably from Hamlet.

229
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I wouldn't know.

230
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah.

231
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Not a Shakespeare guy myself.

232
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Uh, Shakespeare, uh, he wasn't that cool.

233
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I agree.

234
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Unpopular opinion, I know.

235
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

236
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Um, so I am consistently fascinated whenever you tell me about some of the things you've done.

237
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah.

238
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because of the fact that I think most- you're a little older than the rest of the PCP, yeah?

239
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You're 28?

240
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think- I think I am the oldest by, like, a slight margin.

241
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like, I'm slightly older than Tom.

242
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, how old are you exactly?

243
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm 28, yeah.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay.

245
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I think Tom's 27.

246
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I want to say it goes you, Tom, Nate, Jesse, or-

247
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Is Nate older than Jesse?

248
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What the fuck?

249
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Jesse turned 26 this year, I think.

250
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Uh, yeah, I guess Nate's turning 26 next month in, like, a month.

251
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yep, shit.

252
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, and I'm turning 25 in August.

253
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Um, but yeah, you- you have, like, a bit- like, I think because the rest of us got into, like,

254
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you know, for me, I got into YouTube kind of young, so I haven't had the opportunity to have done all these other things

255
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
before settling into a career that involves being at my desk at all times.

256
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

257
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Um, and you've done a lot of other stuff before YouTube in terms of, like-

258
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I did a lot of bullshit.

259
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, I did a lot.

260
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Like, I went- I went to school, like, I went to college.

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I did thinking, and by the time I graduated, I thought I was going to be a scientist, so I majored in-

262
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I majored in physics, but you know, I also was kind of a- kind of a cool, pretentious, intellectual dude,

263
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
so I double-majored in philosophy, because that's fancy.

264
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
How many years were you in college for?

265
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Four.

266
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I just did-

267
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This was, like, right out of high school?

268
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah, just did the usual, you know, graduate high school, four-year degree,

269
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
bada-bing, bada-boom.

270
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

271
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And, uh, yeah, so I went for physics, got my physics degree,

272
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and then the first job I had out of college was teaching at Astro Camp,

273
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
which is like space camp, but on the west coast, and up in the- up in the mountains of Southern California,

274
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and it was all about taking kids on nature hikes and telling them about constellations and stuff.

275
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So what, like, did they, like, fly you out there for that job?

276
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Because you're from Boston, right, or outside Boston?

277
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Near Boston, yeah.

278
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They- um, yeah, I think they paid for my ticket,

279
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and they flew me out- they flew me out there to this- and drove me up to this mountain,

280
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and we're like, well, you're here for six months, and I said, cool.

281
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then all these classes of kids, every week a new fucking bunch of kids would come,

282
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and I would pretend to like them for however long it took- however long it took to get them to go away.

283
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Had you been living at home, like, in college and everything?

284
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
No, I lived- I lived the dorm life.

285
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I had a rose- I had a rose-colored campus life, did you?

286
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Okay.

287
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So did you and Nate ever, like, go to the same school at the same time or something?

288
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah, he was a- he was like a freshman in high school when I was, um, a junior.

289
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So yeah, we were in the same- for two years of elementary and two years of middle and two years of high school,

290
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
we were in the same school.

291
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

292
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because I've had the impression that you guys had a lot of the same friends,

293
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
like, in college and stuff like that.

294
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I became friends with one or two of his friends, and like, he has met a few of mine.

295
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Like, we- I mean, we had our own distinct friend groups, though.

296
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Cause you know, I've got- yeah.

297
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I've got, you know, Victor and Shade, and me and Victor just have one-

298
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You guys all have, like, a big cadre, is the impression I get.

299
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well, Shade has his own friends, cause he's, you know, much younger.

300
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He has a few friends that we don't really- I mean, his friends know our friends.

301
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They hang out, like, they're right now actually, hanging out, playing board games downstairs.

302
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But like, you know, there's a little bit more of a divide, but yeah,

303
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because our house is the meeting place for everybody,

304
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
then, you know, anyone who knows one of us ends up knowing all three of us.

305
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Cause Shade is six years younger than me, so he's quite my junior.

306
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But yeah, I was always curious about that, cause like, when Nate was talking about the guy who called you

307
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
the king of fives or whatever in college-

308
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
King asshole.

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah, that's one of my friends, but not anymore.

310
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm gonna go tell him that I hate him.

311
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Uh, I will, I will destroy everyone.

312
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But you had a great counter-argument that he himself is the real king of fives.

313
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That guy likes fat chicks.

314
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

315
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I happen to know.

316
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So maybe his entire scale is off.

317
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah, definitely.

318
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So, alright, you taught at Astro Camp, and so what did you do after that?

319
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Well, I learned how to expand marshmallows with a vacuum pump,

320
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and then I moved home.

321
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That was what they taught me.

322
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
For your physics degree.

323
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, but hey kids, look how big this marshmallow gets when I suck all the air out.

324
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Uh-huh.

325
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Um, oh yeah, and then I went back to Boston, and I got a job in like a lab,

326
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and I had this really cool-

327
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Holy shit.

328
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Give him a lab coat?

329
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yes, I wore a lab coat.

330
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, you fucking badass, that's awesome.

331
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I had to get decontaminated when I went into the lab work area.

332
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I operated an electron microscope and shot electrons at the head of a pin

333
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
to determine the radius of its pointiness.

334
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I did lab tests and stuff.

335
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh man, I used some devices that really looked like some high science,

336
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
some super science shit, some weird glowing rings.

337
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh god, that sounds awesome.

338
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It was.

339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, that one was like specially designed so you could see the interior,

340
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
because it was a mirror sputter-coater for like making mirrors and shit,

341
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and what you had to do was you put the silicon disk in

342
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and then you like fucking super heat it to a plasma so that it spits off atoms

343
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and they coat the stuff you put in there,

344
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
but when you open it up and look at it, it's like,

345
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
yeah, it's given off this like weird pink ring of light.

346
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Holy shit.

347
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah, it was pretty sweet.

348
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It was a boring job, honestly.

349
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay, if I asked you to explain what kind of stuff you were doing,

350
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
would I be able to understand?

351
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
No.

352
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean, I mean, I mean, well, I mean the day-to-day things I was doing.

353
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, it was like, like, it just, I just had to like put samples in this thing

354
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and then this thing would like, it would take this pin and like scratch across

355
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
the mirrors we'd made and like the pressure it applied would change

356
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and I would have to record like at what pressure did the mirror coating

357
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
start to like break and peel off.

358
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And this was like, yeah, that was the majority of what I actually did.

359
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So that's actually pretty easy to understand.

360
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like, the fucking-

361
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I just don't know why you were doing it.

362
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The quantum excitement of the atoms that leads to the sputter-coating process

363
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
is like even I don't fully understand it, but yeah.

364
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So you worked in a lab for a while.

365
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, about six months.

366
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
How long would you say it?

367
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay.

368
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I was there for about six months.

369
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It was just like an intern position.

370
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Like it wasn't, I wasn't salaried.

371
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And I guess I didn't do that great a job because after a while they were like,

372
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
well, your internship's over.

373
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And I said, okay, I'm gone then.

374
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm just like, I'm thinking about, all right, history of the PCP, you know.

375
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

376
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Jesse, who I know went to college for a while.

377
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I think he dropped out.

378
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't know if or what jobs he's ever had other than YouTube.

379
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He worked on like a farm, right?

380
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Jesse?

381
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

382
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He told me, or that's like a lumberjack or something.

383
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He told me he worked with like his uncle on a farm.

384
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh, I think he worked for his dad doing something like that.

385
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Maybe he was, I don't know.

386
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah.

387
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
He's never really told me about his-

388
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Surprisingly, I don't know what his previous job was.

389
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He's definitely mentioned that before, but I don't remember the details.

390
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I know that Jeff, I don't know if he had any normal jobs,

391
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
but I know he wrote for a gaming magazine, an internet gaming magazine.

392
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah.

393
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Works for his dad as a window cleaner.

394
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, cleaning windows and gutters and stuff.

395
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And then we've got you who worked in a laboratory doing physics experiments.

396
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah.

397
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm an actual fucking scientist slash engineer.

398
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And I worked at Target.

399
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's my background.

400
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It was real boring.

401
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Like, even though the machines looked really cool, the job was quite dull.

402
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So I wasn't too sad when they fired me.

403
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What did you get fired for?

404
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Just like-

405
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Not being needed?

406
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Just the-

407
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It was just that like the internship period ended and they didn't-

408
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I guess they weren't impressed enough with my performance to keep me on as a full-time dude.

409
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So where'd you go after this?

410
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Let's see, I got some job working as like a document editor for some comp-

411
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I would just fucking go through and like control F and like find typos and stuff in like textbook documents.

412
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And that was really easy.

413
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It was really easy for me to just over-report how long editing any particular document took and then they would pay me more than I actually deserved.

414
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It was great.

415
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
See, this is why I love talking to you because you do-

416
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Like those kind of things seem to come naturally to you that-

417
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Like sneaky fucking shit.

418
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah.

419
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And screwing people over? Absolutely.

420
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I think for-

421
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I don't know.

422
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I doubt this has to do with the age difference because you're not that much older than me.

423
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But like I feel like for a lot of us internet kids, a lot of us are more like goody-to-shoe kids

424
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
who the reason we stayed inside is because we never did anything wrong, you know?

425
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Like we were scared of getting in trouble.

426
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Like that's kind of for me anyways.

427
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Like I grew up you very like not break any rules kind of guy, you know?

428
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I was like that too as a kid.

429
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah.

430
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I ended up through college.

431
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Like I never smoked a cigarette until late in college and stuff.

432
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:43,000
When I got into college, I actually voluntarily signed up the first year to live in the substance-free dorm.

433
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's how much of a fucking idiot I was.

434
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Of course it didn't actually stay substance-free.

435
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But I was like I'm not going to drink at college.

436
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm going to be on the straight and narrow.

437
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes, Suri.

438
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But you know, now I have a more pragmatic way of looking at things.

439
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I just have that deeply ingrained fear of like if I misreport something then what if it does go wrong?

440
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Or just generally I'm just like too honest.

441
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Like I can't bring myself to lie about that kind of thing.

442
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Like even if I think I should, you know?

443
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm not the kind of guy who thinks that you're always morally in the right by not fucking anybody over.

444
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Sometimes maybe they deserved it and you deserved better.

445
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I mean they're a company, right?

446
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I'm a person.

447
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
My moral value is higher than theirs.

448
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So fuck them.

449
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's my opinion about everything basically.

450
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't disagree necessarily.

451
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's kind of like how this is like a real stretch of an example.

452
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But I just did this video about Kanye West's album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.

453
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And I was saying how I can't bring myself to buy it because I know he has so much money.

454
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
His record label has so much money.

455
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's like I want to buy it on vinyl, but it's $35.

456
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And every time I see it, I'll look around the store and I'll see like an artist who I know needs that money a lot more.

457
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And I'm like alright, you know.

458
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'd rather, or with like Patreon, you know.

459
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I only patron people who like make less than me.

460
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yes, same.

461
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's why I unpatroned Nate because he passed me.

462
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But then I went and fucking passed him again.

463
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So I should probably repatron him.

464
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I mean there's some people I'll patron just because I really, really love their work

465
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and I couldn't bring myself not to be a patron, you know.

466
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But like when people, like I'm, as much as I love Red Letter Media and I watch all their stuff,

467
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
like they have enough money, you know, on their Patreon.

468
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
As far as I know anyway.

469
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I don't even, you know, I'm not the biggest fan of Red Letter Media.

470
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Right.

471
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But yeah, I kind of have that, like I'm not necessarily stealing from Kanye

472
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
by not buying his album even though I do, you know, listen to it all the time.

473
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's more of a, like I don't know.

474
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't believe that quote unquote stealing music is stealing anything

475
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
because there's no product that's being lost.

476
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
There's no loss of money for the recipient, you know.

477
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
If I download an album I was never gonna buy, then there's no profit loss.

478
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But yeah, I think it falls into the same kind of mindset that you have

479
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
of like, fuck the bigger guys.

480
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
If someone's rich and you, I mean, this is, even if it was a person,

481
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I mean a company is not even a person, but even if someone has a ton of money

482
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and you take their money, you do way more good for yourself than you do harm to them.

483
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I would agree.

484
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I think everyone should always be punching up all the time.

485
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Everyone should always be trying to tear down the people that are above them.

486
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm coming for you Digi, by the way.

487
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm fucking on your ass.

488
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm gonna destroy you.

489
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Regular Robin Hood over here.

490
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, that's right.

491
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Except you don't give it to anybody, you just give it to them.

492
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah, like Hippo said in the Sly review, he said,

493
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
they rub from the rich and keep for themselves because they're not idiots.

494
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah.

495
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't remember that line, but that's great.

496
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

497
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I love your Hippo voice there.

498
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Cause they're not idiots.

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah.

500
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Alright, so after you did this job.

501
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I only worked as an editor for like, yeah, probably for another like six months.

502
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
My life comes in like very clearly delineated, like six months or one year chunks all the time.

503
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Mine is similar, mine's three months though.

504
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, six months for me. Sometimes they double up though.

505
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh yeah, and then I quit that or got fired or something.

506
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't know.

507
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh yes, and then I answered an ad for a physics teacher in Poland.

508
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So I went to Poland for like a long time.

509
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So that was just for an ad.

510
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, there was just a Craigslist ad that were like,

511
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
hey, we need a physics teacher over in Poland.

512
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I was like, hey, I have a Polish last name.

513
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll probably have like an in.

514
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
They'll probably be like, hey, yeah, let's get this guy.

515
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
We can understand what the fuck his name means.

516
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes, spoiler alert for the audience.

517
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Your last name is not Saint.

518
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
No, no, that's my pen name.

519
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah, Ben Saint is a pen name.

520
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
My real name is a bunch of Polish gobbledygook.

521
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, it's not, neither of you and Nate do not have the most attractive last name.

522
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I would certainly say that pen name was the right way to go.

523
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I wouldn't say it's unattractive, but it's hard to fucking pronounce.

524
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's impossible to spell. It's hard to pronounce.

525
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm not too partial to it, but yeah.

526
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah, so I answered that ad and then I went to Poland and I was a physics teacher

527
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and that was cool for like three months or so.

528
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But I guess the kids, some of the kids liked me,

529
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
but I guess enough of them didn't that when they all got pulled about,

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
you know, how do you like your teachers?

531
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
My ratings were overall negative, so they fired me,

532
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
which honestly, I hate teaching. I hated teaching at Astrakamp.

533
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I hated teaching these fucking Arabs.

534
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
They were all Arabs, by the way.

535
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
They were all bunch of Saudi Arabian kids that were studying in Poland for some reason.

536
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I have no idea. I don't know why it was set up this way, but it was.

537
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Anyway, I hate education. I don't believe in education.

538
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
After having done some of it myself,

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I no longer believe that formal education is even a thing that anyone should do.

540
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's dumb.

541
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm very down on the entire school system.

542
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm not a fan of it. I don't think it works well for most people.

543
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I think everything after middle school is fucking useless.

544
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Even if college was free, I wouldn't necessarily recommend everyone do it.

545
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I think everybody should be in trade schools.

546
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You fucking find a thing you're good at and do that,

547
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
because college is so much general knowledge.

548
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's like people going to college just to get a degree,

549
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
to get a normal ass job.

550
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's raising the hiring standard above what it even needs to be in some cases, I think.

551
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't know. I feel like college and high school do not teach the discipline

552
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that is what people need for regular jobs.

553
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
We get someone who will say,

554
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
hey, we've got an open desk job.

555
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Let's hire the guy with the college degree and not the guy with just a high school diploma.

556
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But I don't think going to college teaches you the things you need for that job.

557
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I think we should have something that's more of teaching you how to have work skills.

558
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
For me, I can't complain too hard,

559
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
because I honestly do believe the old line that everyone says that

560
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
even if you don't go into a field that matches your degree,

561
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
it's like an edifying experience and it's the experience of college

562
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and all this broad learning.

563
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
My school was a very broad liberal arts education.

564
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Do I feel like it culturally enhanced me and edified me and improved my life?

565
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Honestly, yes, but only in a very unpragmatic and lofty and hard to define kind of way.

566
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The sort of way that is really a privilege that I'm able to even find any value in.

567
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's what I mean by, I think instead of college or instead of high school even,

568
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
it should be work training, how to have discipline to do jobs

569
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and how to have the mindset to talk to other people.

570
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because you do learn those things kind of incidentally in high school and college.

571
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's like, yeah, you learn, because people, whenever they say,

572
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
oh, it's the experience of meeting other people and working in groups and stuff.

573
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Then why don't we have school for meeting people and working in groups,

574
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
as opposed to world history class that no one needs to know.

575
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Just teach a class on working in groups.

576
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I don't know if that would work. You have to be doing something.

577
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You can't just work in a group for the sake of working in a group.

578
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You have to do something.

579
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
There has to be some goal.

580
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Make it so instead of the world history class,

581
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
let's say it's a class where we have to build something together as a team.

582
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It has to be finished by the end of the month.

583
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's something fucking practical that we will all need this skill in five years.

584
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
How about we have just a whole class dedicated to building a car.

585
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Everyone has to learn how to work together and build a car.

586
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Now everyone who graduates high school knows how to fix their fucking car forever.

587
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That would be great.

588
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Much better than knowing world history would be knowing how to fix a car.

589
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm one of the rare people who actually did use all that fucking math and science

590
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
that everyone says they'll never need out of high school.

591
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
That's why I picked world history.

592
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I never used my world history, except to not look like an idiot at parties or whatever.

593
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's what it's for, right?

594
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's what knowing history is for.

595
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's so that you'll be culturally up to date and not look like an asshole at parties.

596
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Which you're going to anyways, because there's going to be some dumb shit you don't know.

597
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Eventually you will.

598
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But the more you know, the less likely it is at any given party that you'll go home in tears.

599
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You finished your working in Poland. Where did you go from here?

600
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh, yes. Well, they fired me for bad student reviews. Fuck them. Fuck them all.

601
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And I was like, well, I saved up some money, and here I am in Europe.

602
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So it's time to have an adventure.

603
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And I just like hopped on a train and like traveled across northern Europe.

604
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I went from, I went north to Estonia for New Year's Eve because a dude,

605
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
actually, funnily enough, a dude, a blogger that I followed back when I was into the whole pickup artist thing,

606
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
because I was into that for a while, this guy.

607
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You innate both with that stuff.

608
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I did it first. I bought him the Tucker Max book because at the time I thought,

609
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I mean, I don't think I would like Tucker Max as much if I went back and read his work now.

610
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But at the time, like I was kind of coming out of college and I was like, yeah, fucking bitches and money.

611
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And yeah, I know, I see how the world really is. And Nate was still this fucking goody two-shoes.

612
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Red pill, literally.

613
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, sorta. It's embarrassing now, but that's how it is.

614
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, so I got him. I tried to like gently nudge him in that direction because I was sort of embarrassed to see what a fucking nice boy Nate was at the time.

615
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But anyway, yeah, in Poland, at a total happenstance, that guy, Roush, was there and I met him and was like,

616
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
dude, I follow your blog and he was like, oh, cool.

617
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And he told me that I should go to Estonia for New Years and I did and it was a great fucking party.

618
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And then I just went south and I went west and I went to Germany and France and England and Ireland.

619
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And then I flew back to Poland just in time to catch a flight home to America,

620
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but not before stopping in Sweden where they told me that I overstayed my welcome and I had to pay them 700 euros.

621
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Oh, Jesus.

622
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Yeah, I was fine because I exceeded the legal, you know, how long I was supposed to be abroad.

623
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I just didn't pay attention. Yes, I paid out the ass for that.

624
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I had to do that when I went to the Philippines because, you know, I went there for a month and like,

625
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
this is fucking stupid.

626
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I landed there, I get through, like I'm going through customs and the guy is like asking me how long you're going to be here.

627
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And I'm like, well, for a month, like just what it says on my ticket, right?

628
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And he's like, well, are you going to be like working here or whatever?

629
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm like, no, I'm just here to visit.

630
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And he's like, well, I'm going to mark you for three weeks and you can come back and get an extension later.

631
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And I was like, why?

632
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But the guy was like a total like hard ass.

633
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You know, like one of those like bureaucratic doesn't look you in the eye,

634
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
just fucking writes what he wants to write on your shit.

635
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So he gives me a three week stamp.

636
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And of course I don't go back to get it renewed.

637
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So then like when I'm leaving, like I'm about to fly out of the country and like the lady at the desk,

638
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
like to give me my ticket is like, oh, you overstayed your welcome.

639
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So there's like a $75 fine or something like that.

640
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I was like, what the fuck?

641
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Like why literally why?

642
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And there it was like fucking five in the morning.

643
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And like all I had on me was they were just like just make $75 appear or you're not going home.

644
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Right.

645
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Well, all I had on me was like bank checks.

646
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And like I had a I didn't have enough Filipino money.

647
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I had like a bunch of American money and some Filipino money and they didn't have any open banks there.

648
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And I was like, the bank's not even going to open before my flight.

649
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So like this like police officer like over like really young police officer guy overheard me.

650
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And he's like, yeah, man, I'll just exchange my money for yours.

651
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And like he didn't have like even distributed.

652
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I think I gave him like almost $20 extra just because I didn't have the right bills to break.

653
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And I was just like, I don't fucking care, dude, I need to get out of this.

654
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I need the money so I can leave, you know.

655
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah, dude.

656
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
They were yeah, I said Sweden before, but I meant Switzerland.

657
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, it's like, like I couldn't not pay.

658
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Like I had to fucking get out of this predicament and fly to America.

659
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
700 euros though.

660
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
What was the conversion rate?

661
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Or maybe 500.

662
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I don't know.

663
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
A euro is like a dollar and a half.

664
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So it was, I think it was a lot.

665
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Like it was a, it was kind of a big fucking deal or a big illegal thing.

666
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I was a trader to the America.

667
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They were after my ass.

668
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, yes.

669
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yes.

670
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And I went, oh man, I went to Amsterdam and I smoked weed outside and then someone was like, hey,

671
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
you know, you're not really supposed to smoke weed just like out in the open.

672
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And I was like, ah, shit.

673
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then why am I even here then?

674
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I don't even, I don't even like weed.

675
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I said fucking throwing this giant fat blunt I had just purchased for an outrageous price

676
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:08,000
onto the ground and accidentally burning a prostitute in a red, in a red box door somewhere.

677
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That all happened.

678
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh God.

679
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So then you came back and while I was there, oh yeah, let me tell you about when I was working

680
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
for the, the, the teaching company, they, they paid for my apartment.

681
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
They got me this fucking, all right, for like the, the price for like $500 a month was about what it costs there.

682
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It was 1500 Zlotties a month, but it was like the swankest apartment.

683
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It was like this high rise fucking giant like studio, like beautifully furnished with a big like full balcony.

684
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It was like, it would have been like thousands a month here, but it was just in such a shitty piece of shit.

685
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Eastern European block fucking like racist ass city in Poland with fucking white pride symbols of fucking spray paint

686
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
all over the town.

687
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Oh yeah.

688
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh yeah.

689
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I mean, it was a college town.

690
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It was, it was a little bit metropolitan.

691
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
There were colleges there, but like the Asian kids that went to college there would get hassled all the time.

692
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And like my, my Saudi Arabian students would occasionally get hassled by people who were like, yep, not white.

693
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well, don't care for that.

694
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
No, sir.

695
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Jesus Christ.

696
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But my other teacher guy was like this guy who apparently, I guess he had gone to high school with LeBron James.

697
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And he had been in the NBA for a while.

698
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
He was a giant black man.

699
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
He was like seven feet tall.

700
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
He was enormous.

701
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Nobody hassled him due to the fact that he was physically terrifying.

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
He was, he was an okay guy.

703
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
He was, he was really boring.

704
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Like all he ever talked about was money.

705
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah.

706
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah.

707
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I mean, in fairness, we talk about money a lot, but we do it in a cool way.

708
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah.

709
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah.

710
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's, it's cool when we do it.

711
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's, it's not cool when, when, when basketballers do it.

712
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I don't know.

713
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Maybe I was just intimidated by his, his massiveness.

714
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Oh, that guy, that guy was real popular.

715
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That guy had, that guy had sex with girls.

716
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh, but then you've always been, uh, I've always gotten the impression that you,

717
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
you've been well laid in your life.

718
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Well laid.

719
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I could be better.

720
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Well laid.

721
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh man.

722
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
All right.

723
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Well, like, uh, not in a while.

724
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I mean, I've been, I've been working.

725
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I've been drawing like every day or trying to draw every day all day.

726
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So I haven't had a girl over in a while.

727
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I guess like a couple months ago, I had a few Tinder things.

728
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I would say that compared to, uh, the entire internet, you have more of a, a normal healthy

729
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
sexual, uh, you're well laid.

730
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't know how to phrase it.

731
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like you, you don't, you're not like me who had one girlfriend one time and hasn't had

732
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
sex in two years.

733
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I had at any time before that.

734
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Like, well, let me, well, let me tell you my tragic backstory.

735
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Did you, um, when I, yeah, I was in college and like, I guess, I guess I lucked out because

736
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
like, um, I mean, I never had a girlfriend in high school or anything.

737
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I never even kissed a girl in high school.

738
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Right.

739
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And I got to call.

740
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah.

741
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And I got to college and just, just as luck would have it, I met a girl who would like,

742
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
just, she was another freshman like me and she had just broken up with her boyfriend

743
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
back home or something.

744
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
There was like a little bit of drama where like she wasn't quite broken up with him when

745
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
we first met each other and it, you know, bothered me a lot, but whatever.

746
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
She eventually dumped him and we dated and we dated for like three years, right?

747
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And we were very much in love and stuff and we loved each other a lot and it was beautiful

748
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and it was fucking boring and it sucked.

749
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And I, and I said, that's it.

750
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm done.

751
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
There's, you didn't do anything wrong, but I'm breaking up with you.

752
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Uh, and she was like, oh, that hurts my feelings.

753
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And I said, I, I figured, but goodbye.

754
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Uh, yeah, it was all very sad and emotional at the time, but now I don't care.

755
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah.

756
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And that was, that was the only like real relationship I've ever had ever, ever since

757
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
then it's just been like, well, I met a girl who's cute and maybe I'll have sex and maybe

758
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
even more than once.

759
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Uh, but if not, that's fine.

760
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Um, yes, nothing matters.

761
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Uh, that's the story.

762
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I don't know if I want to, I'm way happier now.

763
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm way happier not caring about anyone.

764
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's awesome.

765
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Well, I don't know if I want to get too specific about it, but I was extremely impressed with

766
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
your performance at Bronycon two years ago.

767
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I did have, I did have sex at Bronycon just because it was like, cause we were all, you

768
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
know, we all went to Bronycon and it, Bronycon is this weird duality where all of us want

769
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
to hang out together, but also everyone really wants to use the opportunity to try to get

770
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
laid.

771
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Nate was very explicit.

772
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Nate, Nate told me before the con, he was like, you know, it's always been, you know,

773
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I really want to get laid at this con.

774
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Like I, it's always been my dream to get laid at a con and I was like, cool man.

775
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And then I didn't, he didn't.

776
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And I mean, I felt a little bad, but mostly it was hilarious.

777
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Believe me, every, every con I've ever gone to, I go into it with the mindset of like hoping

778
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
it's going to happen, but I am just, I don't make things happen.

779
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Like, I, yeah, I used to go to con.

780
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I used to want to do it at cons.

781
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I did not have any expectations of getting laid at Bronycon though.

782
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And maybe that's why it happened because like I really wasn't looking for it or anything.

783
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But you, I think you, like in the time I've spent with you, like, I think I'd said this

784
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
before that I consider you the most personable of the procrastinators.

785
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You did say that.

786
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I, and I find that weird because in the chat, I feel like I'm always, I'm always

787
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
naysaying and criticizing.

788
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Like I feel like I'm very negative, like in the chat, but like not so much on the actual

789
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
podcast.

790
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Right.

791
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, I think in the, I think in the chat, we're all friends.

792
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So us being negative to one another is not like anything special or different, I think.

793
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Like, I don't know.

794
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah.

795
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean, obviously when you call out Jesse, then he goes on a whole fucking tirade because

796
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
that's, it's Jesse.

797
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
If you imply that he's not perfect in any way, then he's going to have a whole fit about

798
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
it, you know.

799
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But, but for me, like, you know, if you were to, I mean, you don't really criticize me

800
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
often ever, but like if you were to, I'd be like, yeah, you're, you're right.

801
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
You know, like I trust your opinion on my work or not to say that I would not to say

802
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
your work is so consistent.

803
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,500
Like there's, it doesn't really tend to veer off in like new directions that like I need

804
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,000
to point out like what are my thoughts on them.

805
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Yeah.

806
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,700
I'm not saying I would change anything if you criticize me, but just that I understand

807
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:16,000
your taste well enough that like when you criticize Jesse's work, it's not at all surprising

808
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,160
to me because I know what you value and I know that you don't necessarily value everything

809
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,500
he's putting out.

810
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,040
So like not to say that there's anything wrong with him continuing to do the work he

811
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:31,240
does because obviously people like me enjoy it, but like a lot of it, just a lot of it

812
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,080
is not to my taste at all.

813
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,580
Some of it is the exact opposite.

814
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,580
Yeah.

815
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,580
So I think that's fine, you know.

816
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,580
Yeah.

817
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:49,380
But when I say personable, I more mean that out of anyone, I think if, if each of us were

818
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:54,580
to walk up to a random person and try to talk to them, I think you'd have the best luck.

819
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:02,020
That's what I mean by you being the most personable where maybe I think I'm not terrible at talking

820
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,020
to people.

821
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,080
Because I won't talk to anybody unless they talk to me first.

822
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,120
I, I don't walk up to people.

823
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,240
I don't initiate conversations, you know, when I'm at cons, I never get any pictures

824
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,520
of the cosplayers I want to unless they're like right in front of my face and I get the

825
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,120
chance to go, Hey, can I take a picture real quick?

826
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,440
You know, but like, I won't walk up to people.

827
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,760
I won't initiate conversations unless there's like a really good strong reason like they're

828
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,100
doing something that, that like I really want to say something about.

829
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:38,340
But you know, when I go to conventions, I'm surrounded by people and I'm not talking to

830
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:44,380
any of them, you know, because for me, like, I don't, I don't ever expect to go into a

831
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:49,220
conversation and it to be like good, you know, I wait for other people to want to talk to

832
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,140
me and then I talk to them, but I don't pursue it.

833
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,460
And so even though there's usually a lot of women that I have the opportunity to talk

834
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:02,240
to at conventions, I don't end up doing it because I'm waiting for them to try to talk

835
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,320
to me, which they're not going to do because they're women and they don't do that like

836
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
most of the time.

837
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:13,040
I mean, I've said it, I've said it, I keep coming back to this, I feel like, but yeah,

838
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,040
the whole pickup thing back when I was into that like part of that was like go up to strangers

839
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,760
and like hit on them.

840
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,640
And like I did a lot of it.

841
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,760
And I think I guess it was good because yeah, I don't, I don't feel a lot of like, I mean,

842
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,660
I, it's, I mean, it's a little nerve wracking to like strike up a conversation with a stranger,

843
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:35,300
but like I've done it enough times that I, I guess I'm kind of good at it.

844
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,500
And I don't, and I don't feel embarrassed.

845
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,340
Like, I don't know, like maybe I'll say something and they, even if they don't care and want

846
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,620
me to go away, I'll just be like, well, you know, I tried, you know, I mean, I don't take

847
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,220
rejection personally.

848
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:55,100
To speak for, for Nate, like, I've observed him because when we go to cons, I observe

849
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,640
you guys a lot and try to like, sure, I, I like to pair people's actions with how they've

850
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,640
described themselves, you know, like figure out where the discrepancy is and things like

851
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,640
that.

852
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,120
Or just like, um, I think a lot of you comes through in your art and with Nate, there's

853
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:17,640
this duality of what he's trying to present himself as and what he actually sees himself

854
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,640
as.

855
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,920
And it comes through a lot in his videos where it's always like the self-aggrandizing persona

856
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:30,100
and then there's always the, the nerd underneath the whole, the character, I mean, he's told

857
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,540
me a bit about some of the future videos he's going to do for best guy ever.

858
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:40,260
And yeah, it hasn't come through quite as much so far, but like in the upcoming ones,

859
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,980
like the whole character of best guy ever is that duality of like a character who presents

860
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:52,540
himself with, in this like a grand eyes way, but is actually this fucking dweeb and kind

861
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,540
of knows it.

862
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:58,760
It's keg standard where with keg's whole review of that, uh, one pony episode was that like

863
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,520
he was originally this, this dumpy nerd and then he decided to become an alpha bro.

864
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,080
You know, he, he, he, she's like, I'm, I'm going to be cool.

865
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,240
I'm going to be cool no matter what it takes.

866
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,840
But I think that the, I think the keg standard more successfully became the alpha bro than

867
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,880
the best guy ever character who's more like still, he just kind of like, he just kind

868
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,120
of like is just sort of barely hiding it.

869
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,120
Right.

870
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,180
But I think that's exactly what Nate is like.

871
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:32,460
And like when I see him in person, like when he tries, cause he always talks the big pickup

872
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,340
game, like he's going to go and talk to all the girls and be the charismatic guy.

873
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,820
But then when we're all sitting around, he's like the one who's like, should I, should

874
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,820
I do it?

875
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,820
Should I go up and talk to that girl?

876
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,140
What if I went up and talk to that girl and you can tell he's really nervous.

877
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:51,140
And I love that his, even his art, when he drew that one, do you remember his scissor

878
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,360
picture in the, the procrastinators, uh, draw cast with, with the heads and what.

879
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,360
Yeah.

880
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,880
Well, the way it was like sweating and looked all nervous and like, yeah, Nate gravitates

881
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,200
towards those kind of pictures a lot.

882
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,400
Like he loves like people looking nervous.

883
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Yeah.

884
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,200
People having that like sweaty, like, like, Oh God, am I about to do something completely

885
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,200
fucked up?

886
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,280
And that's exactly what he looks like to me when he's in social situations is like that,

887
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,820
like, I have to do that.

888
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:23,700
I had like, he knows that he has to be this charismatic character in order to succeed,

889
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,740
but it's all like forced.

890
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,500
He has to make it happen.

891
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:34,500
You know, well, I mean, I think, I think part of it at Brony con, like, yeah, I think he

892
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,180
had more, he has sort of had more writing on it reputation wise.

893
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,700
Like he kind of, yeah, he kind of has this like character of being, you know, this keg

894
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,480
standard best guy ever, like this kind of cool pick up a guy.

895
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,240
But like because he's got that persona, it's like, it's more important that he not fail.

896
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:56,520
You know, I think that is maybe the source of some of it with you.

897
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:01,320
For you, it's more like, I don't feel like you have that same anxiety.

898
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,600
I mean, you walk up to somebody and you just kind of start talking to them, like especially

899
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:11,520
artists because I saw you talk to like everyone who you saw drawing almost felt like you were

900
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:18,100
talking to them at Brony con, you know, yeah, which I mean, for being someone who draws,

901
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:23,540
you can easily have something to start a conversation with, but is that not how you ended up getting

902
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,540
late at Brony con?

903
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:32,660
Because the girl was also an artist and I don't, I don't really remember exactly like

904
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:39,260
how I met her or what we were doing, but yeah, she did end up hanging out with me and Munchy

905
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,080
and we all and we all drew together when we did the the comics jams.

906
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,080
Right.

907
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,080
Uh, yeah.

908
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,480
So yeah, so that probably was part of it or involved in it.

909
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,480
I don't know.

910
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,960
I'm just a wicked cool guy.

911
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,000
Yeah, everyone wants to hang out.

912
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,320
Really fascinated watching how for you, it seemed like talking to other people was kind

913
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,080
of natural and easy.

914
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,960
For Nate, it was like something he had to like force himself to do.

915
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,360
And for me, it was just I gave up before I started and it didn't talk to anybody, you

916
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,820
know, in spite of constantly talking to people who are walking up to me, but I'm not pursuing

917
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,820
anyone.

918
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:19,020
I'm not like going up, you know, like there was all those like when, uh, cause there's

919
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:25,180
these two cosplayers who, one of whom, uh, Jesse is currently dating.

920
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,180
Oh yes.

921
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,180
Yeah.

922
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,180
Oh yes.

923
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,100
And I, and I, I almost had sex with the other one, the hotter one, but I didn't because

924
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:38,080
the other one, because that girl that Jesse knows, uh, she fucking came in and interrupted

925
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,080
us.

926
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,200
Oh, that was the angriest I've ever been.

927
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,920
Cause I thought I was really fascinated that that girl, the, the, the Pinkie Pie cosplayer,

928
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,000
we all agreed that she was super hot and nobody even tried to flirt with her.

929
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,080
I guess you did cause I didn't even, I didn't see that, but I spent so, it was so arduous

930
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:03,340
the process that I went through to try to sleep with that Pinkie Pie cosplayer.

931
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,380
We, I had to walk like blocks and blocks back to her place.

932
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,380
We got lost.

933
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:15,460
I was sweating profusely because I, we were outside in the heat walking around, uh, it

934
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,460
was terrible.

935
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,980
I won't, I don't want to describe the emotional gauntlet I had to go through once we were

936
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,980
actually there.

937
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:25,780
It was a fucking nightmare, but it finally, finally was panning out and then fucking

938
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:30,360
what's her name and their dumb, and their dumb brother or whatever come through the

939
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,760
door and I'm like, oh no.

940
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,760
And I hung out.

941
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,880
I stayed there for like another hour or two hours, uh, like hoping that the opportunity

942
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,400
would re-emerge, but no, it didn't.

943
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,320
I felt like it was some kind of conspiracy.

944
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,920
Like the two of them had agreed ahead of time, like let's, let's, let's make Ben think he's

945
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,400
got a chance here and then just, just fuck with him.

946
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
You know, let's just ruin his day.

947
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,640
That was the second BrodyCon though, right?

948
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,640
That was the second BrodyCon.

949
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,420
And then Jesse and, uh, that other girl were already like, uh, you know, like a thing together.

950
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,900
So, yeah, yeah, they even the, like the first year though, like, cause they were both there

951
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,620
and nobody even tried to flirt with the Pinkie Pie girl.

952
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,620
Cause I think we all just thought she was out of our league.

953
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,620
I kind of tried.

954
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,620
I talked, I talked to her a bunch.

955
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,620
Uh, it didn't go anywhere.

956
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,620
Right.

957
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,820
Um, well anyway, yeah, I don't know how we got onto this topic.

958
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,140
I was still, we haven't finished your life story.

959
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,140
You were coming back to America.

960
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,140
You said I was well laid, did you?

961
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,140
Yeah.

962
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,140
That's how we got onto this topic.

963
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,140
Uh, oh fuck.

964
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:33,760
So you, you came back to the U.S. after your trip around England or, uh, Europe rather.

965
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,760
Yes.

966
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,760
To, to Amsterdam and Belgium and, and Ireland.

967
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,240
And how did you fund all that?

968
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,240
Estonia.

969
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:46,320
Well, it's cause I had, I had had a little bit of savings left from the, the lab job

970
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,920
when I, when I went.

971
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,720
And then, you know, I worked as a teacher.

972
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,080
I, I just saved up money from my teaching to, oh yes.

973
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,980
And then when I got fired, they wouldn't pay for my apartment anymore.

974
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,860
And I was like, well, I, I'll run out of money if I keep living in this 1,500 zloty a month

975
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:01,860
place.

976
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,600
So I went to my landlord and was like, can you give me a cheaper place?

977
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:11,500
And he moved me immediately downstairs into a like comp, into a like two room complex that

978
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:17,420
I shared with a 90 year old woman, uh, there was no like appliances except for a simple

979
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,420
hot plate.

980
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,920
Uh, the heater was a giant column of stone that would occasionally get hot and emit heat

981
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,920
into the, yeah, the bathtub did not hold water.

982
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,880
You had to, you had to pump water into a fucking pan and sponge bath yourself with it.

983
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,360
Um, there was like no furniture, uh, or there was like a mattress on the ground and that

984
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,360
was it.

985
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,360
The walls were concrete.

986
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,920
From heaven to hell and they're right, right above each other.

987
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
That's incredible.

988
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,160
How, did you ever like look up at the ceiling like wistfully?

989
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:56,700
Like God, I was, I was, I was up there, up there, up where the skies are so much blue.

990
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:01,220
I can be there and live without a care.

991
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,220
Yeah.

992
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:08,620
And you know what's funny, um, I had, I had sex with two girls in Poland and the one that

993
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:13,220
I had sex with up in that nice room was way less attractive.

994
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:18,080
The one that I had sex with down in that piece of shit, dingy, 90 year old woman room was

995
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,720
10 out of 10.

996
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
Amazing.

997
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,680
Uh, so that's, you know, fucking, I don't know, believe in yourself or something.

998
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,880
Uh, that's, that's my lesson.

999
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,560
Oh, um, yeah.

1000
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,440
And that place costs 15 Zloty's a day, which is like five bucks a day to live in this piece

1001
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,560
of shit apartment.

1002
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,040
Uh, pretty solid.

1003
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:42,680
I've kind of resolved that like if, if I decide, like, cause I don't think I'm ever

1004
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:48,260
going to get laid just like in my normal every day to day life, cause I don't go anywhere

1005
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,340
or do anything or talk to anybody.

1006
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:57,340
So like, I think if I made the conscious decision that I was going to start dating, I would

1007
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:03,580
have to just completely redesign my room just because there's no way I'm bringing a woman

1008
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,580
in here.

1009
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:08,500
I'm not even necessarily, I'm not saying, I don't think you should worry about that.

1010
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:18,680
Are you aware that there is a bed sheet stapled to my ceiling of a girl touching herself above

1011
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,680
my bed?

1012
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,440
Are you aware of that?

1013
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,120
You know what?

1014
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,280
I think if that's who you are, you should just wear it on your sleeve and women will,

1015
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,400
and women will appreciate that.

1016
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,960
I mean that.

1017
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,040
I think, I think maybe just at least that one should come down.

1018
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,040
Maybe.

1019
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:41,340
And the thing is, cause part of it is that I don't care, like, I don't like, I don't

1020
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,100
have it up there for my own enjoyment.

1021
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,020
It's more for like, I just want to have my room covered in posters.

1022
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,660
Like, I don't even like a lot of the stuff I have up in my room.

1023
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,860
I just want to live the life of someone whose room is covered in posters.

1024
01:06:54,860 --> 01:07:01,180
Like, it's, it's more of a status thing than like a, than like a passion thing.

1025
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,060
Imagine if you were like, I got to make my room girl friendly and like you took down

1026
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:11,000
all your anime posters, like imagine how creepy that would be to go, to be like, to have bare

1027
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
walls.

1028
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't take them all down.

1029
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,560
I'd take down the ones that are like half naked chicks, you know.

1030
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,560
The raunchier ones.

1031
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,560
Yeah.

1032
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,560
I've got plenty of like normal-ish.

1033
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,560
Oh, whatever.

1034
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,720
You're supposed to, you're supposed to like half naked chicks.

1035
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
It's fine.

1036
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,720
Leave up the half naked chicks.

1037
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,720
Leave up all the anime.

1038
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,680
Yeah, but they're like half naked lolly girls and stuff, I don't know.

1039
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,680
It's cool.

1040
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,240
They'll just conversation stars.

1041
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,040
I guess it, it really depends on what kind of like, you know, I mean, you know, it's

1042
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,340
like, assumably by the time a girl was in my room, she would know what I'm about.

1043
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,340
Absolutely.

1044
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:46,220
All I talk about is anime and YouTubeing and being like an internet weirdo, you know.

1045
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:51,420
So, you know, maybe if they're well primed, but if, if I'm dating a girl who's not even

1046
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:55,140
into anime, then that's when I'm like worried, like.

1047
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,220
Oh man.

1048
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:02,460
So I went, I, I went and met up with a patron the other day.

1049
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,060
I think he patrons us both.

1050
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,080
Yeah.

1051
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,200
This, this guy crack.

1052
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,880
I went and I, he invited me out for a beer and I went and I got a beer from him.

1053
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,680
And yes, at the bar, there was a cute girl and we talked and I struck up a conversation

1054
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,400
and fucking, you know, fuck me sideways.

1055
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,320
God help me if I couldn't, if I couldn't prevent the conversation from steering itself

1056
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:29,360
towards anime and, and she said, I don't know, some dumb crap.

1057
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,360
It didn't go anywhere.

1058
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
I was very sad.

1059
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,500
I really liked her glasses.

1060
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,500
That's my story.

1061
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,740
I got a good image.

1062
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,740
Thanks for the beer.

1063
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,740
Crack.

1064
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,740
Yeah.

1065
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,740
Yeah.

1066
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,480
Um, all right.

1067
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,100
So you came back to the U.S. after this tour of Europe.

1068
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,100
What did you do after?

1069
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,100
Oh yeah.

1070
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,100
Uh, yes.

1071
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,100
And I paid for the trip with the money I got as the teacher and then I came home and

1072
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,100
I was totally broke.

1073
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:59,660
Um, uh, what, I came, okay, well, I remember that shortly after I come back from, from

1074
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:05,000
Europe, I was like, I'm going to get serious about drawing because I think it was right

1075
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,120
after I came back, I read Bakuman and I was like, oh my fucking God, art is pretty good.

1076
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:17,320
So I went out and I, oh yeah, like at first I wanted to do it like they do it like traditional,

1077
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,520
like with a G pen and a nib and stuff and ink and paper, but like I have no, I don't

1078
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
know how to do that.

1079
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
Yeah.

1080
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
I can't, I can't do it that way.

1081
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
It's expensive to do it that way.

1082
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,780
So you constantly have to buy materials and shit.

1083
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,860
Yeah, kinda.

1084
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:35,440
I mean, the nibs and the ink are pretty cheap, but like, cause you always want like different

1085
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:40,900
sizes of stuff and you always need, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a nightmare.

1086
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:46,740
Um, yeah, but for a while I was, I was sticking with that like pen and ink aesthetic and I

1087
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,860
made my first website.

1088
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:52,580
It's also ugly.com, which was like a gag strip site.

1089
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:56,480
Uh, a few of the like gag strips I made were sort of funny.

1090
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,720
A lot of them were just really terrible and confusing and like I don't know what I was

1091
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,720
thinking.

1092
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,880
Um, I, I've been posting some of those, but only the ones that I'm not completely embarrassed

1093
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,880
by.

1094
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,100
I've been posting them on my fucking subreddit, which I spent like three days editing the

1095
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:17,240
A, the, the CSS, and it looks amazing, uh, reddit.com slash r slash St. Thomas.

1096
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,200
Sorry, let me take, I want to scale this back a second because you started taking art seriously,

1097
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,060
but weren't you drawing it all before?

1098
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,980
Like had it ever been a career you had thought about?

1099
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:34,100
It had never been a career I'd thought about, but it was something I did for fun, uh, occasionally.

1100
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,100
Like, all right.

1101
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,340
I mean, I mean, I took like, I like to draw as a little kid.

1102
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:45,540
My, I like to draw Pokemon and my mom would take my like Pokemon.

1103
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:49,260
I mean, they were just basically like exact copies of pictures of Pokemon from books

1104
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,260
I had.

1105
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,920
Like copy them onto pages and my mom is a teacher and she would bring my like line art

1106
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:00,440
Pokemon drawings to school and her kids would like color them, which was nifty.

1107
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,040
So yeah, I drew a little bit as a kid.

1108
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,120
I might have done like one like little summer program or like I had like a very basic drawing

1109
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,880
class or something.

1110
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,840
In college, I took one drawing class because it was something I kind of like to do for

1111
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,360
fun and I was a little bit good at it, uh, but I never did it a lot or anything towards

1112
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:24,540
the end of towards the end of college, I started going on to, all right, I started going on

1113
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:31,340
to the 4chan, um, T G board for traditional gaming, which is like D and D and stuff.

1114
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:39,820
And I had a character that I really liked that I was playing at the time and someone,

1115
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:43,820
I like, I posted a description of him with like a little sketch I'd made a terrible little

1116
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:46,500
MS paint drawing because I couldn't draw that well.

1117
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:52,000
And someone drew him like beautifully, like they fucking drew this beautiful image of

1118
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,520
this character that I had made and I was like, wow, how did they do that?

1119
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,880
They did it so fast that like, like it didn't even take them along.

1120
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,640
They just churned out this really amazing piece and it like really, I don't know, struck

1121
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,640
me or something.

1122
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,320
So I stayed on T G and I would, I would do the same thing for other people.

1123
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,320
I would like to describe your character and I'll draw them, but like mine would just be

1124
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:16,440
this little like MS paint, sort of like pixel Chibi, like I tried to keep it really like

1125
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,860
a little simple, like very cartoon-ified thing.

1126
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,860
And I did a lot of those.

1127
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:26,300
I probably did like 20 or 30 of those and that was about the extent of my art.

1128
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,380
It was very like occasional, like I would just do it sometimes if I was bored.

1129
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:36,740
And then I went, you know, I graduated college, I did work, then I went to AstroCamp and then

1130
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:42,660
sometime after AstroCamp, I read Homestuck and reading Homestuck was like, well, it did

1131
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,140
two things for me.

1132
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:53,240
It made me, like no one particular image in Homestuck is like that complicated.

1133
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,580
Like any individual piece of it would be easy to make, you know, because it's pretty like

1134
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:00,200
low fidelity.

1135
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,840
So reading, it made me feel like it was something that a real person could do.

1136
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,240
Like it was something that was, like the level of craftsmanship on display was something

1137
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,960
that was attainable to me, which made me feel really close to it.

1138
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,980
I had the same exact experience after reading Homestuck, actually.

1139
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:16,980
Did you?

1140
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:22,760
I tried to make my own Homestuck-like thing where like a, like a, yeah, like the, choose

1141
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,380
your own adventure, text, well, no, mine was just going to be a web novel, but with the

1142
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:32,340
images at the top, you know, like where each page had a, like a picture and then the text

1143
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,340
under it.

1144
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:38,940
Cause I had been trying to be a novelist up until the point when I started making videos.

1145
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:45,440
So, so I had all these different ideas and one was called Shovel Rock and it was, there

1146
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,920
might, this might be a website up somewhere, shovelrock.wordpress.com probably, I don't

1147
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:59,040
know if I have the poster public, but it was just like a story about this girl who decides

1148
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:04,600
that she's going to dig a hole at the beach because like, you know, as a kid, you always

1149
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,240
dig holes at the beach and then when you grow up, you still want to do it.

1150
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,180
So she decides to like, she's like, I think 11 at the start of the story and she's like,

1151
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,100
I'm going to dig the biggest hole ever.

1152
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,180
And then she and all of her friends start digging this hole and they basically burrow

1153
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:20,740
into like a whole underground society and shit.

1154
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:24,700
I never really planned anything beyond that, but I just thought it would be cool if I like

1155
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:30,500
drew each image and it was like, you know, after Homestuck and what I, what I tried to

1156
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:38,180
do was each picture would be me taking a, like someone else's art and then drawing

1157
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,040
over it in MS paint, but like different enough that it's not the same thing.

1158
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,440
That's, that's such bullshit.

1159
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:51,080
Well, I was a huge fan of that, like you've seen my inverted sweetie bell thing, like

1160
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:55,520
my old, my little pony avatar where it was like, I think the first video years I ever

1161
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,160
saw I had the inverted sweetie bell.

1162
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,160
Yeah.

1163
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,640
Well, that wasn't the one I drew, but like the, the avatar I had was like, I flipped

1164
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,680
the colors on it and then drawn over it in Photoshop.

1165
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:10,900
So it had that wobbly look that my art has and like, I would do, like I was trying to

1166
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:15,980
do a, like something, not quite like Homestuck, but another image based like adventure game

1167
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,220
thing with that character.

1168
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,500
And like, so I would be like, we're going into a cave.

1169
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:27,580
So I'd go onto Google and find a photo of a cave and then draw over it in MS paint.

1170
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:31,020
So it looked all blue be and weird and yeah.

1171
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,940
And that would be the, the like the locations.

1172
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,640
So that was how I tried to do after Homestuck.

1173
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,080
It didn't go anywhere.

1174
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,800
Um, do you still have any of it?

1175
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,960
Yeah, I think so.

1176
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,600
I'm going to, I definitely have the inverted sweetie bell stuff.

1177
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:51,520
I'm going to look up shovel rock and see if the, um, yeah, I felt, I felt really close

1178
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,520
to Homestuck.

1179
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,600
I never, I never tried to like, uh, I'll remind me later.

1180
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
I'll go check it out.

1181
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
Yeah.

1182
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,520
Um, but, um, yeah.

1183
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,380
The other thing that it made me feel was like, I was so into Homestuck, right?

1184
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,020
Like I had read Scott Pilgrim the year before and I had been really into Scott Pilgrim,

1185
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:14,500
but like the level of into that I felt for Homestuck was like almost beyond anything I'd

1186
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,500
ever felt before.

1187
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,100
I thought about Homestuck night and day.

1188
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:22,260
I thought about punch card alchemy and I thought about all the classes and aspects and I thought

1189
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,220
about the whole like weird confusing mythos behind the whole thing.

1190
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,580
And I was like, oh my God, I'm so into Homestuck.

1191
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:35,720
You know, I will never be into anything this much again, unless it's something that I make

1192
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:41,120
myself, something that I'm so interested in that I did, that I designed specifically

1193
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,480
to be a thing that I am into.

1194
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:48,160
So that made me like, that made me really want to like, you know, do my own work and,

1195
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:53,720
and, and start something kind of like Homestuck and not, yeah, would you ever like just generally

1196
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:59,520
artistically inclined, like not just to, not just to drawing, but like, but did you

1197
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,420
grow up thinking you would be an artist or anything like that?

1198
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,260
No, no, I thought I would be a scientist.

1199
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:12,900
Yeah, because like, I know, for instance, Neil, I mean, I did, I did, I did creative

1200
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:17,700
things once in a while, but like, not, not that often.

1201
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,740
And I never really saw it as who I was.

1202
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,220
I just kind of saw it as distractions.

1203
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,580
And I kind of look when I was like college age, I kind of looked down on the arts.

1204
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,520
Like I thought, you know, like science is real.

1205
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,400
Science accomplishes something.

1206
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,720
Art on the other hand is just some bullshit.

1207
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,480
And I mean, now, did my opinion about art?

1208
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
Total flip.

1209
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,480
My, well, no, my opinion about art hasn't changed.

1210
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:42,240
Art is all bullshit, but science is bullshit too.

1211
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,200
They're, they're both, they're equally, they're equally stupid and pointless, but art is more

1212
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,200
fun.

1213
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,240
So I'd rather be doing it.

1214
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,240
That's interesting.

1215
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:54,980
Yeah, it's, it's seen as such a like, you do one of the other kind of thing.

1216
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:59,220
And like, you remembered Neil X, the Elements of Brony.

1217
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,220
Yeah, absolutely.

1218
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,300
He was like, he was a lawyer and he, he had that kind of mindset too of like, you know,

1219
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,900
lawyer, like it makes a difference in the world and like does important things.

1220
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:13,460
And then by the time he finished college was a completely disillusioned to that.

1221
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,340
And like through making Elements of Brony was like, maybe I want to be an art guy, you

1222
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,040
know, and I think it's really fascinating to see people make that transition because

1223
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,080
I never didn't want to be an artist.

1224
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,360
Like my whole life, that's all I've thought I was going to do was creative work.

1225
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,480
Like thinking back, like I think I really liked the idea of being an artist.

1226
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,040
Like I think that concept appealed to me, but not in a way that like I actually ever

1227
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,280
planned to do it or thought that I would.

1228
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,080
It just seemed like a nice idea.

1229
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,080
Yeah.

1230
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:48,140
I'm literally the thought has never crossed my mind to not be an artist unless it was

1231
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,660
like, like not until I was an adult and having to like face the reality of whether or not

1232
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,900
I could be an artist, you know, like that was the only time it was like, oh man, maybe

1233
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:02,180
I can't, maybe I will never be able to do this and I have to get like a normal thing,

1234
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,180
you know?

1235
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,180
Yeah.

1236
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,420
I gotcha, man.

1237
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,900
Was Nate like that too?

1238
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,020
Was he ever like, was he an art boy?

1239
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,380
I think they, no, not at all.

1240
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,520
I think Nate was the same.

1241
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,400
Like Nate said he wanted to be a doctor as a kid.

1242
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,120
You both made such a dramatic flip.

1243
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,120
You're trying to do comic scenes.

1244
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,120
Yeah, I don't know, man.

1245
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,280
Maybe it was, maybe it was just that little, maybe it was just that little taste of fucking

1246
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,120
having an audience that came with TBAP.

1247
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:37,600
I think, I think it kind of, well, I mean, I had actually, no, that's not what did it

1248
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:43,380
for me, because like, yeah, I had made my old comic site, it's also ugly, like that

1249
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:49,540
previous year, like early in that year, and then, so yeah, I was, I was already kind of

1250
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:55,700
making like an art, an art, like a go of being an artist in some sense or fashion.

1251
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:02,900
And then, I don't know, fucking TBAP happened, like at the end of 2013, I want to say.

1252
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:10,280
Yeah, and then my drawing was mostly limited to like doing the poses and the title cards

1253
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,480
and stuff for that was where I put most of my efforts.

1254
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:18,240
I also find it like really fascinating that you were so influenced by Bakumon, because

1255
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,720
like, I wrote about it before that-

1256
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,520
Bakumon was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

1257
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:32,440
Like if there was, like, oh, oh, I want to say I did, the biggest, before I ever decided

1258
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,500
to make like a real go of being an artist.

1259
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:40,020
There was one kind of big project that I did, and that was I ran like a homestuck RP for

1260
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:45,220
some friends, but it was like we would meet every once in a while or like get, I would

1261
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:49,460
talk to them on Skype because I was in Europe for a lot of it, and like I would lay out

1262
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:52,940
the scenario and their character would do something and you know, they eventually discovered

1263
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:56,580
their, their, they went, they eventually went God tier and like, you know, had to solve the

1264
01:20:56,580 --> 01:21:00,780
riddle of their world and stuff, but I would then, we would role play a little bit and

1265
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,320
then I would go and draw like what happened.

1266
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,120
So this still is, yeah, this is still up on a tumbler somewhere.

1267
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,960
I might transfer it to my, to somewhere else at some point, but yeah, so I have these like

1268
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:17,040
sort of illustrated sequences of these like homestuck style fan characters that my friends

1269
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:22,360
made doing, you know, a bunch of, a bunch of like random things that don't really make

1270
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,760
sense to read in context because you had to understand what the role play aspect had,

1271
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:31,660
had happened in the adventure to know what the images mean, but it was a big project

1272
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:36,980
and it took me like a year or like, I think I did it over the course of like two years,

1273
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:41,100
but like, yeah, it was a big fucking project that lasted a really long time.

1274
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,820
That's great though, because I feel like a, I feel like what hangs up like a lot of artists

1275
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:50,980
and stuff is like, they're constantly trying to draw like original ideas or things from

1276
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:56,660
their mind and stuff and like, I think it's better practice to just have something like

1277
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:02,800
that, like I'm going to draw every scene from this, whatever RP, you know, like it's, it's

1278
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,880
a good way to have a lot of ideas to try to translate and like, you know, instead of like

1279
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:14,200
conjuring an image in your head that you then have to draw, it's like the image is already

1280
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,120
there and you just have to like try to translate it, you know?

1281
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:23,320
I guess it was kind of, yeah, it was kind of like a crutch that I could lean on.

1282
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:28,420
It was like, I didn't have to, like if I was ever in doubt, I could just look at the original

1283
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,020
source material and be like, well, make it look like that.

1284
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,020
Right.

1285
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:39,220
Uh, it was, man, it's so weird to think back on, oh, by the way, it was called Sperg.

1286
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,220
It was the name of the, you know, like, like, like Sperg, but you know.

1287
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,220
That's awesome.

1288
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,220
I know.

1289
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:53,420
Yeah, I'm pretty proud of some, I mean, I'm pretty proud of some of the pieces of it.

1290
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:58,320
I'll definitely like, I'm definitely going to post those somewhere because they're pretty

1291
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,320
neat.

1292
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:06,220
Um, yeah, so, so I did that, like, and then I came back, I think I finished that in like

1293
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:12,420
2014, like towards the beginning of 2014, like I finally sat down and drew the final conclusion

1294
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,420
of it.

1295
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,720
So T-Bab was already going by this point.

1296
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,220
Yes.

1297
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,220
Yes, it was, it was.

1298
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,720
So like, all these threads kind of overlap with each other.

1299
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:30,220
Cause I, I'm like, I'm trying to get a sense of like how fast your progress happened because

1300
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:35,220
when you started T-Bab, this was like one of the fastest I've ever seen, like zero to

1301
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:42,220
a hundred on like video quality, where you guys started T-Bab in like late 2013 and the

1302
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:48,720
first couple videos were just a static shot of the two OCs, um, that were not that well

1303
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,720
drawn.

1304
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,720
It's just a still image.

1305
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,720
Um, and.

1306
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:52,720
Hey, come on.

1307
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,720
They looked sort of show accurate.

1308
01:23:54,720 --> 01:24:01,620
They were, they were okay looking OC characters and you had like shitty audio and it was just

1309
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:08,560
a static image and then all of a sudden you like completely revamped the character designs

1310
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,820
and I already was a fan of like your art style by this point.

1311
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:16,900
So like, I would have assumed that you were like a regular artist, like you've been doing

1312
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:21,900
a lot of it and it doesn't seem to be the case.

1313
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:29,620
T-Bab was like, I mean, yeah, I would say that taken in its entirety, T-Bab was like

1314
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,500
the biggest art project I'd ever done.

1315
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,500
I would say that it.

1316
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,500
Yeah.

1317
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:42,600
I would say that it involved more art than Spurg did, uh, yeah, uh, I don't know what,

1318
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,800
I don't know why I designed the characters like that.

1319
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,520
I gave them the big eyes and like the weird pupils and it made them really, I don't know,

1320
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,520
they just look cool to me.

1321
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,880
It was, it was great.

1322
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,880
Like they had the best facial expressions of any OC pony by far and they were the best

1323
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,720
OC ponies of all time.

1324
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,800
Like, I mean, dude, they justified the concept of original characters to me.

1325
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,060
I still, I still love them.

1326
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:06,700
I still love Phantom Horn.

1327
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,700
I'm not even embarrassed.

1328
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:12,100
Like, I'm kind of embarrassed to tell people that I did like my little pony, I don't know,

1329
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,100
it's in the past.

1330
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,100
So I'm not really that embarrassed about it.

1331
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,100
I used to be embarrassed.

1332
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,620
Like when people asked me what I was doing on YouTube.

1333
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:20,260
But now I'm like, I don't feel anything about that about Phantom Horn.

1334
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,700
I think Phantom Horn is a great character.

1335
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,700
He's funny.

1336
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,860
He's just a, I'm a genius.

1337
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:29,300
I'm such a genius is how that is.

1338
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,820
I almost like.

1339
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,820
And keg's not bad either.

1340
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:38,640
I feel so like for me, I, I think I'm in the best position of anybody in the PCP because

1341
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,520
I've already had my career as an anime guy is longer than my pony career and it's all

1342
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,280
my best stuff.

1343
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:51,040
Like the pony stuff was okay, but I've gotten so much better since that like it's, I don't

1344
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,400
even, I would, even if you were a My Little Pony fan, like if someone came up to me and

1345
01:25:55,400 --> 01:26:01,400
was like, I want to watch my little pony analysis, I would hesitate to send them my videos.

1346
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:07,900
Like some of them I would, but like, I, I don't think they're like indicative of my current

1347
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,340
level of skill at all.

1348
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:14,580
The stuff you make does not, no, they're, I don't know.

1349
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:18,220
I mean, I actually rewatched like a whole bunch of your old video.

1350
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:23,020
Like I mean, I'll put on playlists of like, you know, other PCP members or, or Mr. B tongue

1351
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,420
or Matthew Matosis or something and just listen forever and ever.

1352
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:29,140
And I did that with your, with your pony stuff.

1353
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,440
If I put it on the playlist and just let it go for a while, it was pretty, I don't know,

1354
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,440
it's pretty good.

1355
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,520
It is a lot different than what you're doing now.

1356
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,520
It's more, it's less concise.

1357
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:42,520
Like when me and DeVoo were looking back, I would definitely say that it got a lot better

1358
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,520
as it went.

1359
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,880
Like the, the really early videos are like terrible and then they get, you know, there's

1360
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,840
some, definitely some interesting ideas in there and stuff and some well argued points.

1361
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:58,280
But like, the reason I bring it up is that it makes me sad because with someone who goes

1362
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:03,460
to my channel right now, they're going to see my best videos like on the front page.

1363
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:09,580
But then you've got like, uh, Jesse, who's like the best thing he ever did is the horseshoe

1364
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:13,300
saga in terms of like concept and this epic execution.

1365
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,300
The best thing he ever did was butt chugger.

1366
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:20,940
Well, yeah, but that, that, that is well, but like it's, you can't like, unless someone

1367
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:26,820
knows MLP and knows what the culture was at the time, you can't really appreciate it.

1368
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:31,520
And the same goes for TBAP, where it's like outside the context of watching My Little

1369
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,720
Pony every week.

1370
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:35,960
How do you send someone TBAP, you know?

1371
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:40,800
Um, yeah, you can't, I don't, I don't tell people that TBAP anymore.

1372
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,680
There's so much good stuff in it where the characters were so good and the two, the,

1373
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,840
the Phantom reviews and keg reviews were like some of the best videos that ever came out

1374
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:55,320
of the community and all the intro guys, I never, every time I think of TBAP, the first

1375
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,900
thing that comes to mind is the intro gag where you had the live action phantom horn

1376
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:04,820
hands and it was like him doing a live draw and he spills ink all over everything and

1377
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:09,220
like, I remember being like blown away when I saw that.

1378
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:16,420
Dude, the video quality on that was so bad, but like the gag is so great, like I can't

1379
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:21,820
believe, like we went to such incredible lengths to film that bit and like put that bit together

1380
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:24,220
and match it with the audio and make it work.

1381
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:29,960
And the result is so fucking amateurish, but it's still, it's so good enough to like,

1382
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,800
because I, you know, we were, but we were all doing this where we were trying to get

1383
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,660
our videos out like today, the episode happened.

1384
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:42,680
So you would pre-prepare these intro gags and outro gags and stuff after a certain point,

1385
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:43,680
we would do that.

1386
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,680
Yeah.

1387
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:49,400
And so I'm putting out these videos where it's like the episode comes out, I immediately

1388
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,400
write about it.

1389
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:55,380
I immediately, you know, stitch together this shitty haphazard video of a bunch of pony

1390
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,860
expressions and whatever random clips from the episode are there and I fucking throw

1391
01:28:58,860 --> 01:28:59,860
it out.

1392
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:04,620
And then T-Bap would come out and even though most of it is just this podcast with these

1393
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:10,480
two ponies talking, there'd be these intro segments that are of more artistic merit than

1394
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,900
anything either of us were doing, you know, like.

1395
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,900
Yeah.

1396
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:19,340
Like we, like we just recreate the game grumps, but with our own logos, right.

1397
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,640
That was such an intensive process.

1398
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:27,720
It took like, it took like an entire day's work to do that, but it came out looking pretty

1399
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,720
nice and neat.

1400
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,720
Right.

1401
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:37,200
And I just, I feel so bad that like now we're in this like post that era and like when you

1402
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,240
have to try to sell someone on why is Ben St. Cool?

1403
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,760
And it's like, well, we've got a bunch of podcasts and, you know, we have these, these

1404
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:48,100
few comics, but like I have way more content.

1405
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,420
I have all these old T-Bap videos.

1406
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:53,260
I've seen you do all these different creative things that were totally out there and different

1407
01:29:53,260 --> 01:30:01,260
and, you know, yeah, my whole characters, the fucking the episode, the T-Bap video that's

1408
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:08,180
just keg talking to this girl about all the other OCs you guys made up is like legendary

1409
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:11,700
fucking ultimate pumpkin and horse fist.

1410
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:19,160
Wait, oh, oh, the, the animatic, yeah, yeah, the animatic, oh my God, but I always wanted

1411
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:26,520
to do more like story segments with like keg and phantom, but like, I don't, with my current

1412
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,440
skills, I feel like they'd be a little more feasible.

1413
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,640
But like back then I was so new to the whole thing and just so, just so bad and so slow

1414
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:40,440
that like, but again, I think your dynamic poses though, make them like great to watch

1415
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:44,020
and that's, that's like, if I, when I, when you were talking about the sword art online

1416
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:48,860
thing, like why I would choose you, like, I think if people just saw your comic book

1417
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:53,100
art, they might not necessarily understand why I want you to do an animatic because

1418
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:59,420
like I've seen you do those and I loved them, you know, so like the, you're right, you're

1419
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,540
right about, yeah, like T-Bap content is not, it's not relevant anymore.

1420
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:08,820
Like it was a, it was a, it was a, what's the word, it was a time and place thing and

1421
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:13,920
it's not, yeah, it's not what it, it doesn't have the same relevance now.

1422
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:19,800
It's impossible to send somebody an MLP video from that era for any of us because it was

1423
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:25,560
all so contextual where it was like, you know, you'd make a reference to something that,

1424
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,480
that was only relevant that week and then, you know, even for me, like I'll watch some

1425
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,160
pony videos and be like, what the fuck was I talking about there?

1426
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:37,080
Like I don't remember this, you know, I would, like my end cards on a lot of my videos.

1427
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:38,540
Seemed important at the time.

1428
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,580
Yeah, exactly.

1429
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:42,020
And I'd be like, why, why am I bringing this up?

1430
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:47,300
So, yeah, but, but yeah, that, that worries me too about like what I said before, Vapors

1431
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,500
is so, it's so short.

1432
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:53,540
It's like, it took me so long to make it, but you can read it in like 10 minutes.

1433
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:56,220
Oh, I lose sleep over this sometimes.

1434
01:31:56,220 --> 01:32:00,860
And that's like, that's a big part of the incentive of why I wanted to interview you is

1435
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:07,960
like, I want people to understand how like, like have a substantial amount of how cool

1436
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:13,640
you are because like, like when, when Brunswick came out, my first thought was this would

1437
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:19,120
be the absolute perfect Tumblr, uh, like share comic, right?

1438
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,960
Or like something that gets passed around anonymously, like where people don't know

1439
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,360
who the author is, but they just find it because there's so much stuff like that on

1440
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,700
the internet where you go on like 4chan and there'll be those like comics that get

1441
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:35,200
posted all the time, kind of like a Nanna's everyday life where you had never heard of

1442
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,840
clone.manga until I sent you the website.

1443
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,920
Yeah, I had, I had read, I had read Nanna's everyday life, but I did Nanna who made it

1444
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,680
until you told me about clone.

1445
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,600
And then I looked him up and was like, oh, it's, it's a guy.

1446
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,040
And yeah, yeah.

1447
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,760
And I, I have, I do not understand what he does now.

1448
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:58,680
He does like 4chan quest threads about a bunch of like bunny girls, but like, I don't know,

1449
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,200
I don't get it.

1450
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:04,660
Like Nanna's everyday life was sort of independent of him because it was like a 4chan comic

1451
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:09,980
that would just come out of the ether and be there, you know, um, another good recent

1452
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,540
one that I doubt you or anyone else will have read, but there's this comic called take the

1453
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:17,740
iron pill and never heard of it.

1454
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,420
It's just these, like the only way to find it, there's no website for it.

1455
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:26,780
There's just an Imgur, like, like image dump, like the guy literally will just update a

1456
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:32,600
new chapter to this Imgur folder and like no one knows who's writing it or where it

1457
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:37,780
comes from, but it's like really funny and entertaining.

1458
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,160
So like when I read Brunswick, I was like, that's the way I would expect this to get

1459
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:48,360
around because it's this short emotional story that's relevant to a certain fan base.

1460
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:53,840
And yeah, and so it could easily get around because it has that gut punch feel where everyone

1461
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:59,380
who reads it will be like, this is a, like people won't say, this is Ben Saints comic.

1462
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:03,820
They would say it's a emotional Pokemon comic I found, you know.

1463
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,820
Yeah.

1464
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:05,820
Yeah.

1465
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,820
I was, I was prepared for that.

1466
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:07,820
Right.

1467
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:14,100
Um, let me not to go off on a tangent, but I feel like, um, yeah, I don't worry about

1468
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,380
like my art getting passed around anonymously.

1469
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:19,420
I feel like that's just kind of in the nature of what an artist does.

1470
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,840
Like you make your art and you, and you put it out there and like it just kind of goes,

1471
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
you know, it's, it's independent now.

1472
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,000
Uh, I've, so I've never been one to worry about like, you know, we'll like get stolen

1473
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and uncredited.

1474
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,480
Well, like if it does, that's, I don't know, that's just, that's just what happens.

1475
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,480
That's just part of the job.

1476
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:42,880
I actually have a certain degree of like jealousy of people who do like great uncredited work

1477
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,440
because like I want, I always wonder about like what the, because for us, we need the

1478
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,280
credit so we can make money.

1479
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,640
Yeah.

1480
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:55,500
I don't have any attachment to fame and I don't think you really do much either.

1481
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,140
It's, it's like, uh, no, I really want to be popular.

1482
01:34:58,140 --> 01:34:59,140
How do you?

1483
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:04,420
I really, yeah, I really want to be famous like I personally, I mean, I like the fame

1484
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:09,500
for the power it gives me that I can like recommend a show and everyone will go watch

1485
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,500
it.

1486
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,500
Like I love that.

1487
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,140
Um, but for me, it's like the reason for popularity is because without it, you can't

1488
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,140
make money.

1489
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,160
Whereas like, uh, I mean, that's one reason.

1490
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,720
No, I think popularity is an end in itself.

1491
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,480
I just, I want to be relevant so bad.

1492
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,120
Yeah.

1493
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:32,360
What's like the benefit for you of like that, just emotional, like just, it's just, uh,

1494
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:37,880
I don't know if, if people care about me, then that means I have value, you know?

1495
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,720
Uh, yeah, I guess it's some kind of weird, like, like self image thing.

1496
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:44,540
Hmm.

1497
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,540
That's interesting.

1498
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:54,020
Cause I, I kind of get it, like, again, I guess I like, I like the praise, but popularity

1499
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:58,780
mostly comes with like this huge negative caveat of people shitting on me all the time,

1500
01:35:58,780 --> 01:35:59,780
you know?

1501
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:05,540
I don't even really, I mean, not to say that I don't like praise, I do, but like when,

1502
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:10,300
when people praise me and also when people criticize me, it all just, it all just kind

1503
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,120
of rolls off me because like those opinions are not mine.

1504
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,120
Right.

1505
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:20,840
Like unless it's, unless, like, yeah, like I only really care about like what do I think

1506
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,840
about a thing?

1507
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,560
Like other people can have their opinions, but it's not that big a deal, but like, I

1508
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,480
don't know, just, I don't know, just the fact that they have any opinion at all is important

1509
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,480
to me.

1510
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,480
Yeah.

1511
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,480
I want, I want people, I want people to like know me and, and think about me.

1512
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,480
Okay.

1513
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:41,660
At least something so that, so that I can, I don't know, feel like I really exist.

1514
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:49,940
I kind of feel like if, if I could make enough money and like my work wasn't even, like didn't

1515
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:55,820
even have a name on it, I would be okay with that, but, but the thing is that having a

1516
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:59,140
name means you can always make more, like I would, I would never want to settle for

1517
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,140
a baseline.

1518
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:06,300
Like if somebody said you'll make $50,000 a year forever and you just have to like

1519
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,880
make this anonymous work for us, I wouldn't take that because I know that by having a

1520
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:17,120
name, I can get up to $100,000 a year, you know, because I'm working on, like, because

1521
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:22,080
my, like how famous I could get myself is how much money I can make, you know.

1522
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:28,440
Well, I mean, yeah, the most, the most important thing is having enough money so that I can

1523
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:31,120
do what I want, you know, with my time.

1524
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:35,880
That's, that is, that's more important than fame is, is being self-sufficient.

1525
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:40,140
But like if all other, this is kind of what, along with the whole homestuck thing about

1526
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:46,820
how I'll never like anything unless I make it myself, the, the whole reason why I wanted

1527
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,980
to be art was like, you know, they ask you the question in high school, like, you know,

1528
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,460
if you had all the money in the world, what would you do?

1529
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:57,020
And my answer was, you know, I would want to try to make some great work of art that,

1530
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:01,180
you know, got like famous and was like remembered for all of time.

1531
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,180
Right.

1532
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,180
You don't even need money to do that.

1533
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,700
Well, you need money to have your ability to do that.

1534
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:08,000
But yeah, you need, I mean, you need a little bit.

1535
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Right.

1536
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Yeah.

1537
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,480
So like, yeah, the most important thing is having enough money, but that's not that

1538
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,480
hard.

1539
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,720
I don't need very much.

1540
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:20,120
It would all, all of my money goes to funding my life so I can sit here and try to make

1541
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,480
stuff that will get out there and people will remember for it.

1542
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:28,240
I'm always really surprised by this, this interesting dichotomy with you where you're,

1543
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:33,360
you're very into self-promotion and you're promoting your Patreon, but you also seem

1544
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:39,180
to have the least desire to make a lot of money out of, out of anybody I know.

1545
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:45,220
Like I don't know what I would do with more than like, I mean, even as much as you make,

1546
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,900
I don't think I would even know what to do with.

1547
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:50,020
I mean, it would be nice to have it because like there's, there's no such thing as too

1548
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,020
much money.

1549
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:52,020
Right.

1550
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,020
But.

1551
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,020
That's my mentality.

1552
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:58,540
It's like, I'm, for me, it's, it's, it will never be enough because I can always think

1553
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:01,260
of something to do with the next step of money.

1554
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:05,080
Like if I have enough to buy a house in a car, that's great.

1555
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:09,680
Now I want enough to buy my friend a house in a car, you know, I want enough to, to put

1556
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:14,920
up all my, I think if I got to the point where I was making enough money that I could legitimately

1557
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:20,560
move all the procrastinators into a neighborhood where we all had houses near each other and

1558
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:26,280
we had a studio space and I had enough money that I could personally pay for all of that,

1559
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,520
that would be enough money and I wouldn't need any more than that.

1560
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,520
Like, but.

1561
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,420
That's an absurd amount of money.

1562
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,420
But like.

1563
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:34,420
That's, that's, that's high.

1564
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:35,420
Yeah.

1565
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:36,420
But.

1566
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,620
But that's the only way I'd hit a point and be like, all right, there's no reason to go.

1567
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:40,620
And be like, this is enough.

1568
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:41,620
There's no reason.

1569
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:42,620
Now I don't need any more.

1570
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:43,620
Yeah.

1571
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:50,460
Well, I mean, if I had, if I had shit tons of money, you know what I might do is I might

1572
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:56,500
like, I might, I might, I might not, I might switch from comics to doing something else.

1573
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:03,520
I might like hire like an editor to like make my art into like, I might hire someone to

1574
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,280
turn it into like a motion comic or something.

1575
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,520
I might hire a composer to do music for it or something.

1576
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:13,080
I might, I might, yeah, I might make like bigger, bigger budget productions.

1577
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,080
Yeah.

1578
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,080
Yeah.

1579
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,080
Um, but like.

1580
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,080
I wouldn't mind like the stuff I'm doing right now.

1581
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:24,480
I could hire you to like, like, hey, let's just, instead of just editing videos, let's

1582
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:30,660
also just animate all of them because like $2,000 a video, I don't care, you know, like

1583
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,660
if I could do that.

1584
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:33,660
Hot shit.

1585
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:34,660
Yeah.

1586
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,660
I'd love to.

1587
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:41,540
I mean, that reminds me of, of T-Bap, like what you were saying before, uh, like you,

1588
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:44,900
you talking about all the, like the jokes and the gags and stuff in T-Bap, like, I mean,

1589
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,340
I don't think all of them were great.

1590
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,540
Some of them were really stupid.

1591
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:48,540
Yeah.

1592
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,220
Um, but they're, I don't know, there were some really good, like, there were some really

1593
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:56,560
good funny creative bits that me and Nate did together and like, I don't know, I feel

1594
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:04,000
like my, my comics don't come out fast enough for me to like, yeah, be like putting myself

1595
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,320
out there and like being creative in a way that I used to be with like every week we'd

1596
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:14,760
have a new T-Bap out and I'd make jokes and also like, yeah, I liked, I liked making jokes.

1597
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,600
My comics are not like, they're not full of jokes, you know, they're not, they're not

1598
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,600
funny in that way anymore.

1599
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:23,180
Well, that's the thing, like, kind of going back to what I was saying about like, uh,

1600
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:27,500
both with the doing anonymous work and with the thing that you were doing where you were

1601
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:34,500
drawing all those, uh, those scenes from your RP, like, um, I think artists get so hung

1602
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:41,340
up on making a big thing that they forget they can also make like a million small things,

1603
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:47,740
you know, like what if, like if you could afford to in between each comic to just draw

1604
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:54,720
some fun wacky picture that's like a funny thing or to make like a 30 second sketch comedy

1605
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:58,720
thing on YouTube or something, you know, just to like, because I've seen some guys who do

1606
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:03,800
stuff like that, even, uh, Andrew Hussie before he got so into Homestuck where he would do

1607
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:09,840
like those Star Trek edits, like, you know, just to bounce off and he had like all the

1608
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,880
different, uh, blogs and stuff like that, just to bounce around and do all these different

1609
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:19,500
kinds of things. Um, you know, and it like for me, I personally, I would love to do more

1610
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:25,060
of that kind of stuff. And I actually, now that I finally like have so much free time,

1611
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:30,140
I've actually made some anonymous content where like people know I made it. But like

1612
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:36,820
for instance, I have this gigantic anime depth and obscurity chart that I made that like

1613
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:42,100
gets posted on 4chan all the time. Like I just, I just made it for 4chan like here,

1614
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:47,480
there's a chart and throw it around or like a, like a magical girl, um, recommendations

1615
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:54,160
flow chart. Like I've just made that stuff with, there's no monetary gain for me to make

1616
01:42:54,160 --> 01:43:00,760
this thing. And I don't care that it's attached to my name. I just want it to exist. And it's

1617
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:06,680
because like I can make, you know, all I have to do right now to make enough money to live

1618
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:11,480
is I have to write four scripts and pay the divu to make videos out of them. And the rest

1619
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:16,780
of my time doesn't have to be dedicated to making money. You know, I made all those vlogs

1620
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:21,620
last month, I made like 30 vlogs and I did make money off of them, but that was not the

1621
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:26,380
incentive to make them. It was, I felt like turning on a camera and recording something.

1622
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:32,620
And I think it's good that you, it's, it's healthy for your, for your feeling as an artist

1623
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:37,660
to not feel like you have to make a big thing or else no one's going to patron you, you

1624
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:43,440
know, um, yeah, I think that's where Tom's trapped to, you know, where he's like trying

1625
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:48,520
to make this giant monolithic series that he's working towards because he has to like

1626
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:52,920
have a breakout hit, you know, he said, he said one time that he thought the series would

1627
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:59,520
go for like 10 years. It'll take 10 years for him to finish a chapter at the rate he

1628
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:01,420
knows.

1629
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:02,420
Oh God, don't say that.

1630
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:08,380
He literally spent a year drawing six pages, like he, of an action scene.

1631
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:12,580
Listen, I was talking to him through that year and like there were lots of little moments

1632
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:16,020
where he kept changing his mind and being like, no, I'm going to make it a motion comic.

1633
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:20,740
No, I'm going to make it a web comic. No, I'm going to do pages. No, I got to, yeah,

1634
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:24,580
it was, yeah, that's a whole, that's a whole story.

1635
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:25,580
Yeah.

1636
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:31,880
I mean, I can't, I can't do anything right now because right now it's crunch time because

1637
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:37,800
I'm trying to finish up sketches of this first chapter of champion to submit it to Hive

1638
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,680
Works before the 15th, because I would really like to be a part of the Hive Works network.

1639
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,240
I think that would get me a lot of new.

1640
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:49,160
Am I like, by doing this podcast, am I wasting a lot of your time? I just looked at the calendar

1641
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:52,000
and it's the third and that's 12 days.

1642
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:57,220
I tell you, I tell you what, Digi, I mean, I meant today has been a complete fucking

1643
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:02,860
bust for me. I have just completely failed on every level to achieve anything that I

1644
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:07,620
set out to do when I woke up. So I finally was like, Hey, Digi, you want to, you want

1645
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,300
to record this thing? I can't.

1646
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,300
I know the feeling.

1647
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:12,980
I'm too, yeah, I mean, I have to do something.

1648
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:19,380
I, if it makes you feel any better. I, before the month of May started, I got all my work

1649
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:25,960
done and gave it to DeVue under the, like the idea was, I'm going to have a whole month

1650
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,640
that I can do whatever I want. I can make the biggest project imaginable. Like that was

1651
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:36,360
the plan. The ideal was I could take on like a hundred episode show if I want or I could

1652
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:41,280
cover a whole franchise. I could write a novel length video in the span of a month.

1653
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:48,680
And I did literally nothing. I did not write a single video the whole month. All I did

1654
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:54,500
was record vlogs and play Doom. And now it's June. And not only did I not make a giant

1655
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:59,580
video, I don't even have any normal videos for June.

1656
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:06,060
So now I have to from scratch make up a bunch of videos for this month. It's already the

1657
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:10,660
third and I have nothing. So, you know, and I have no ideas.

1658
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:16,300
So it's all like, okay, I fucked up. What did I do wrong?

1659
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:24,880
Um, just, hey, you should review patreon.com. There was a moment too when you messaged me

1660
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:29,160
to do the podcast where I was like, I don't know if I can afford to do that right now,

1661
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:35,080
but I don't have any plans yet. So let's just fucking do it. Because last night, last night

1662
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:42,080
I blew all night on four and a half hours of commentary with DeVue. So, you know, yesterday

1663
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:45,620
I was talking to the chat. I was day drunk. It was great.

1664
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:46,340
That was great.

1665
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:51,300
I woke, I woke, I just like, so that wasn't a productive day. And then I woke up hung

1666
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:57,300
over today and just, you know, God, I lost, I lost two days to that, to the miracle of

1667
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,300
alcohol.

1668
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:03,900
Yeah, it's like Kanye said, the plan was drink till the pain over, but what's worse,

1669
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:08,860
the pain or the hangover gets me every time.

1670
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:14,320
Well, I don't know, maybe I can squeeze out a panel or two before bed and then, and then

1671
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:17,000
I'll have them and then I'll get back a little bit of momentum. I'll have a little bit of

1672
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,160
momentum going and I can wake up tomorrow and be like, gotta keep, gotta keep on the

1673
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:21,680
roll.

1674
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:26,600
So to get back to making this interview like before we wrap it up, I want to know some

1675
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:32,920
stuff about your process because I was fascinated that you tweeted out like you'd sketched

1676
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:37,000
out the entire chapter of champion.

1677
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:40,460
That's like maybe a little more than half of it.

1678
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:41,380
Okay.

1679
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:43,340
Like two, two thirds, maybe.

1680
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:47,740
Because I was just surprised that it's all like, I don't know, I guess in my head, I

1681
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:53,940
was thinking you would like finish each page as you went, but it's like, like a half way

1682
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:57,260
complete the entire thing at once.

1683
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:04,860
Well, well, let me tell you, Digi, all right. Vapors, I sketched, I sketched the pages out

1684
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:11,800
with pencil and then, and then finished them on, on the computer. And then I guess that's

1685
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:18,200
what I'm doing for a champion to only I'm just sketching them digitally because, because

1686
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:23,000
what I, like I said, I'm going to submit it to Hiveworks, but I want to show them the

1687
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,800
entire story thumbnail doubt. So I want to have it all roughed out so they can read it

1688
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,040
even if all the pages aren't finished.

1689
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,040
So that's a good plan.

1690
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:36,820
So that's deliberate. I'm, yeah, I'm not, I think I, I think I finished like, I think

1691
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:41,820
I finished like three pages, but the rest of them are still rough. I got a, oh my God,

1692
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:46,020
I got to finish like, I got to get like at least one page done a day if there's any hope

1693
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,940
for me to get it in on time.

1694
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,940
Yeah.

1695
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:54,340
Um, Brunswick was different. Brunswick, I would fit, I would, I would do a page all

1696
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:58,620
at once. I like, I didn't even sketch except for certain poses that were more tricky and

1697
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:03,840
I needed to like do an underlayer sketch and then trace over it. But like half of the Brunswick

1698
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,480
things, I didn't even sketch ahead of time. I just like went right in and drew them. Um,

1699
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,640
and it was great. And I should probably do more of that.

1700
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:16,000
Yeah, you had said you were going to do that for champion, but I'm guessing you changed

1701
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,800
your mind because of this whole submission thing.

1702
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:25,800
Well, well, yeah, kind of due to the submission thing. Also, I mean, a lot of my sketches

1703
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:31,140
are really good. And I think a lot of the better ones, I might just use the sketch as

1704
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:37,140
the final art. Um, and only like only touch up the things that I think actually need touching

1705
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:43,140
up like, like the backgrounds and stuff. Uh, yeah, like I think if I tried, I have a lot

1706
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:47,140
of really good and expressive faces sketch that I think if I tried to like trace over

1707
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:54,140
and clean up, they would lose that energy. So yeah, I don't know. I'll, uh, just use

1708
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:57,200
what's good and change what's bad.

1709
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,760
So here's another important question that I should have asked like way earlier, but

1710
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:06,260
uh, I was trying to get through your whole like life story to get up to this point. How

1711
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:11,840
are like, first of all, where do you live and how are you funding it? Because you obviously

1712
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,920
aren't making enough on Patreon that it's paying for your life. You're not living off

1713
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:16,920
your art.

1714
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,920
No, because like,

1715
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,600
I made that, I made that little diagram of myself parachuting with Patreon and just

1716
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:28,220
the different trajectories down into the fire of, of, of, of poverty.

1717
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:34,420
Cause like to go through the, the PCP real quick, like I know that me and DeVoo are living

1718
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:40,920
off of my channel, uh, currently, I think Jeff is full Patreon now. I think he kind

1719
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,420
of was from the start. I don't know.

1720
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:43,420
Um,

1721
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:44,420
He makes a bunch.

1722
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:45,420
He makes a bunch.

1723
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:49,940
Jesse's full Patreon hippo still in school. So he's still on his parents dime. We don't

1724
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:53,880
really know where he's going to try to, like, I think he, he wants to be graduated now.

1725
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:54,880
Right. Yeah.

1726
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:55,880
Didn't he like just graduated?

1727
01:50:55,880 --> 01:51:00,720
He just finished school. He has a graduation ceremony. Um, so he's either going to get

1728
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,200
a job or he's going to go full YouTube. I know he wants to do full time YouTube. It's

1729
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:08,520
just a matter of how quickly can he grow, uh, as a channel.

1730
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:15,520
Tom has been in this weird fucked up Patreon slash art limbo for the last two years.

1731
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,960
I think he, I think he got a job.

1732
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:21,700
I think he did too. He mentioned something to that effect because there's no way he's,

1733
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:25,420
yeah, that was another one where I was like, how are you living off of this still? Like

1734
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:27,060
you, cause his Patreon went down a lot.

1735
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:31,300
I mean, he makes it. Yeah, it went down a lot. I mean, he's still, he's still making

1736
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:35,060
more than me on Patreon, but like, I mean that, I don't make anywhere near enough to

1737
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,900
live on. So he's like probably is,

1738
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:41,380
And I think we all know that Nate, he apparently pays out the ass for Nate has like the best

1739
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:47,140
normal job, like, yeah, he's got a real job. He, he doesn't want it, but he's been forced

1740
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,680
into it by circumstance and he's got to do it to like finish his degree.

1741
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:56,400
And he's, he's, he has been seriously contemplating cause he just finished his degree, right?

1742
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,080
Like he's, he's also graduating.

1743
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:02,880
No, he's not, he's not quite done with it yet. I think he's, I think he's got a last

1744
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,240
to December. I think he might get his degree in December.

1745
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:09,000
I was under the impression he was almost done. So

1746
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,360
He is like, I mean, he's been almost done for a long time.

1747
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:15,440
I don't even understand how he's still in college.

1748
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:18,140
He fucked up many times.

1749
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:25,140
But yeah, so he's, he's been contemplating like taking the plunge to go full YouTube,

1750
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:28,780
but it's just a matter of like justifying the fact that he doesn't make nearly enough

1751
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:34,420
money yet. So what are you doing that you can afford to live?

1752
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:40,180
Well, I tell you, I told you before how much I hate teachings.

1753
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:47,780
Well, now I make, all right, so I have this gig on the internet where it's like a service

1754
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:56,780
that you can like basically just log in and tutor kids up on with and yeah, it's, it's

1755
01:52:56,780 --> 01:53:05,280
Chegg. I have, I have an account on Chegg and basically, all right, the last house that

1756
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:11,400
I lived at was I moved in with into their side room hoping to pay, you know, pretty

1757
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:18,400
low rent. But as soon as I moved in, um, there happened to be this kerfuffle between the

1758
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,900
people that live there in the landlord and there was legal action. There was like a court

1759
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:26,160
case going on. And while there was a court case, nobody was paying any rent. So I managed

1760
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:31,200
to live in this place for no rent for like six months, just out of total happenstance.

1761
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:35,000
And then when the court case went through, everyone was evicted. And I was like, so I

1762
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:39,040
went home to my parents place for a couple months. And for a while, let me stay without

1763
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:46,120
paying rent. So then I didn't, and then eventually they made me pay a little bit. Um, but, and

1764
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:50,800
then finally, at the beginning of this year, I found a new place with some friends and

1765
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:58,040
we split the rent. It's like not very expensive. It's like $500 a month or less. Anyway, the

1766
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:02,040
point is all those times that I was living on my expenses being very, very low, I was

1767
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:07,360
tutoring and making money and saving up money. And now I have like a little bit saved up

1768
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:15,520
that and my costs are low. So I'm just trying to like, I just have some time, you know, I'm

1769
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:20,520
in, I'm almost in financial free fall, but I can last it out for a little bit longer. So

1770
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:24,680
I'm just trying to get as much art done during this period, try and get my Patreon up to

1771
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:30,480
try and extend, you know, my extend my financial possibilities here.

1772
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:34,840
So basically you're I'll have to tutor more eventually at some point in the future, but

1773
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:42,880
it's not your only income is from this tutoring. And it has been for a long time. And do you

1774
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,480
like, would you say that the amount that you are capable of making doing that is like at

1775
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:54,040
all comfortable or like, is it really like this art needs to fucking pay off soon before

1776
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:54,920
I'm in trouble?

1777
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:02,920
I have managed to get by on tutoring money before. I mean, right now it's summer. So there's

1778
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:07,840
very little of that kind of work to do. So like right now, if I needed that, I would be in

1779
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:13,080
trouble. But once the school year starts, if I put my mind to it, I can use it. I mean, I

1780
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:19,680
don't make a good living on it, but I can make like, I can, I can keep myself afloat with it.

1781
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:24,720
So like, yeah, when, when the shit hits the fan and I completely run out of money, that's

1782
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,200
going to be what I fall back on.

1783
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:30,120
But you're hoping that if the art takes off, you won't have to do that anymore.

1784
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:36,040
I mean, if, yeah, what kind of Patreon numbers would you need to have before you could like

1785
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:40,880
scale back your tutoring to like only for pocket, like, like that's the secondary job,

1786
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,840
like the pocket change job?

1787
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:52,080
This should be, say maybe five or 600, that should be your Patreon goal, by the way, like, put it

1788
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:59,640
up there of, like, if we reach this, yeah, right, right now, my, my, my Patreon now, it's the goals

1789
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:05,080
are structured with like $1,000 a month being the goal of like, at this level, I can sustain

1790
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:12,680
myself. That's, that's a little high, like, that's, that's, I mean, that would be how much I need to

1791
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:17,600
make like a comfortable living, which I mean, is still really low, like $12,000 a year is not

1792
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:23,200
very much money, but, but like, that's what I, that's what I feel I would need to get to like be

1793
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:26,600
comfortable and not have any like concern about my money.

1794
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:34,040
At 500 a month, I would be like, basically breaking even and like, I could make it on that much

1795
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,720
unless there were some crisis or unless my situation changed somehow.

1796
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:44,840
Personally, I want everybody in the PCP to be making a lot of money to make the whole moving into an

1797
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:51,440
area possible, you know, like, because we've talked a lot about either, because like, right now, I think

1798
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:56,560
we're at the level where a lot of us could move into a place together and afford it. But I don't

1799
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:02,360
consider that the most ideal scenario, like to me, the most ideal scenario is we all live close to

1800
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:03,560
each other, you know,

1801
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:08,520
I've, yeah, I've heard, I heard you talked about this on a doozy brothers lately, and I totally agree.

1802
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:18,240
Like, I mean, I don't, I don't know, I don't know how good of roommates, all the PCP would be. I'm sure

1803
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:24,320
it would be fine. But like, I mean, I think probably I would get annoyed at Jesse. I just, I think he

1804
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:28,160
would probably get up to shit that would piss me off once in a while. And like, no matter how good a

1805
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:33,960
roommate someone is, I mean, living in close proximity always makes you hate people. So I wouldn't, I

1806
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,760
wouldn't want that.

1807
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:40,400
Yeah, I don't think I'll have like, I think you, DeVue and Nate would all be really easy for me to live

1808
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:48,200
with. So I don't, I mean, maybe DeVue, I'm not 100%. I think Nate would be a pretty easy roommate. I

1809
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:54,360
think DeVue is, I mean, I think DeVue will be an easy roommate because and this is this, this word, I'm

1810
01:57:54,400 --> 01:58:01,520
not using it to the extreme that it'll sound like, but he's sort of obedient in the sense that if, if there

1811
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:07,440
were DeVue, if there were rules, DeVue loves you, DeVue is, DeVue is so on board with everything you say.

1812
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:13,240
Well, like if, if there were rules that everyone had to follow in a household, DeVue would hold himself to

1813
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:19,360
those rules very strongly. Like if, if I was like, yeah, I could see that if I was like, this is how much

1814
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:24,480
we're paying every month, these are the boundaries, like socially and what we need to do, DeVue would be

1815
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:29,680
like, and also you, you're sleeping in the closet. He'd be down for all of that. You know, he said it

1816
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:32,120
himself, like that he would live in a closet.

1817
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:36,200
Would you say he's a very, he's like a very rules abiding person?

1818
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:43,760
To get what he wants. Yes. Like, because the benefit of living together would be so strong, he would be

1819
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:50,160
willing to make as many sacrifices as possible to make it so that it worked well. You know, like he

1820
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:55,080
would be oriented around, how do I make this experience good for everybody so that they will keep me

1821
01:58:55,080 --> 01:59:03,480
around? You know? Yeah. Whereas I used to be, yeah, go on. No, just whereas Jesse does not follow rules

1822
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:10,480
unless it aligns with his interests, you know, I think Jesse might, I don't know, it might not be as bad as

1823
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:16,320
I'm imagining, but I could see it being really tough to live with Jesse. I mean, he'd always be fucking shouting

1824
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:19,400
in his room, but he's doing his recordings and whatever.

1825
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,920
Yeah. Well, depending on the size of the house, it might not matter. Like if we all lived in my house, it would, you

1826
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:28,440
would never notice that was happening, because everything's so spaced out.

1827
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:37,520
The, um, I used to be a terrible roommate. I used to be, I used to try to be real sneaky, like I'm like, I'm a

1828
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:45,760
sneaky guy. And I, and I, and I fuck over people that I think don't need, that I, that I think won't be hurt too

1829
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:52,600
bad by like fucking companies and stuff. And like employers, I'm totally happy overrepresenting my hours worked,

1830
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:59,880
because I don't care about their welfare. I used to be like that for people too. And for like my, my roommates and

1831
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:05,040
stuff, like I would try to like sneakily like not pay rent or like pay it late or like, you know, see how much I

1832
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:11,160
could get away with. But like, I don't know, the last couple places I've been at, like, I learned eventually that

1833
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:16,800
that stuff is no good. And like, when you, when you're an asshole like that, like, it hurts you in the long run. So

1834
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:22,400
now I'm very, now I'm like very like up on my shit has mentioned that I'm always, I always pay on time.

1835
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:30,720
You know, it's funny, Nate mentioned that you apparently don't do dishes. And Nate was like, man, that never

1836
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:39,840
does the dishes. And then DeVue, DeVue apparently just as of this month, has struck up a deal with his family, that

1837
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,560
if he does all the dishes, he doesn't have to pay any rent.

1838
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:52,560
That's fucking awesome. What a sweet deal. And he said, he actually enjoys doing the dishes. So

1839
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:58,680
yeah, I can see it. And I was just like, it's not a terrible job. I was thinking like, Nate's telling me Ben never

1840
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:03,440
does dishes. And I'm like, well, that's a problem. But then I've got DeVue over here to cancel out that

1841
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:12,200
problem. If it got too bad, do you know, but, but did Nate mention why I never do dishes? No, he did not. I

1842
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:20,520
mean, well, the place I'm living at now, um, like the guy who found the house, he eventually like, he tried to

1843
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:25,880
borrow money from other people living here, and like tried to fuck, he had this big web of debts, and it

1844
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:32,640
eventually became too much. And we kicked him out. But his dad, who is technically homeless, still comes to our

1845
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:39,200
house, like every morning to do his laundry. And when he does his laundry, he does our dishes for us. So we

1846
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:45,240
have, we have a homeless man doing our dishes for us every day. That's, that's why I don't have to do

1847
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:45,760
dishes.

1848
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:47,600
Whoa, that is a mind blowing story.

1849
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,480
It's, it's, it's convenient.

1850
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:59,840
See, I have all these weird, like, pragmatist ideas about what I will be like if I live, like my whole idea is if I am no

1851
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:07,560
longer dependent on my parents in any way, I will have two plates, period.

1852
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:11,480
Two plates, I will only have two plates, because

1853
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,240
Lamau two plate, do you even lift, bro?

1854
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:22,520
That's just like the idea is I can only, I need to just because sometimes your food takes up two plates, if it's like, you

1855
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:28,040
know, soup and grilled cheese or something like that. But like, the idea is that you don't put soup on a plate. But

1856
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:36,040
anyway, I would have to just wash the dish to use it. So instead of having dishes that can pile up, I just have one

1857
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:42,640
dish, I eat off of it, and you just wash it when you need it. I eat off of it, and then I clean it, and then I pick it up and

1858
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:48,880
eat off of it again. And it's, it always gets cleaned, because I don't have another dish to, you know, to cycle through.

1859
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:56,200
So like, if I was in like that kind of living situation, I would just have like my one, like I would have my one plate, I

1860
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:02,160
would put food on it, eat it, take it out, wash it off and keep it in my room, you know, so it would never be, no one else

1861
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:09,320
would ever assume it was their dish. It's just mine, you know, I've kind of done the same. I have a mug like that. I

1862
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:15,520
kind of do the same thing with like groceries where like, when I started buying my own groceries, I leave them all in the

1863
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:22,320
bags. And I just put the grocery in the so everyone knows it's mine. And like, and they also can't see what it is and get

1864
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:31,200
tempted to eat it. So yeah, I have lots of those little salute. I like the idea of we all live in one place, but we're all

1865
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:38,480
doing our own thing. It's like we don't live together, you know, so it doesn't feel like a family where I don't, I

1866
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:46,280
wouldn't want to run the risk of there being like, you know, disagreements and confrontations and us like coming to hate

1867
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:54,160
each other, I would be really sad if that's why like my ideal is that I could pay for like most of it. Because like the

1868
02:03:54,160 --> 02:04:01,480
only thing I really see being a problem is like debts and rent. Like it's always money, money is what fucks up

1869
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:08,200
friendships. When people all move in together as soon as one guy can't keep a job, can't keep you know, paying the

1870
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:14,200
rent. That's the guy who becomes the problem. That's what that's what happened to our friend with the with the dad who

1871
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:19,560
does the dishes. He just like, it wasn't even that he didn't pay it was that he like wasn't honest about it and kept

1872
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:27,480
promising that he could pay right up until the rent was late and he didn't have it. Oh man, I'm so I'm really used to like

1873
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:34,480
living with because my family we've taken in like countless relatives like almost up until a couple years ago, we had

1874
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:41,880
like a constant revolving door of people living with us. And so finally, like, like, like my grandma lived us for a while

1875
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:47,400
and then my dad would just like, you know, buy her a car and get a place that was cheap for her and like here now you're

1876
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:54,000
somewhere, you know, and like, we constantly had like people around and they would always be fuck ups, you know, they would

1877
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:00,200
never get their shit together. Nobody ever gets a job fast enough. They don't save enough money. And so like, I'm used to all

1878
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:06,320
the reasons that this would happen. There was one time I had both my cousin and one of my friends both shared my room with

1879
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:16,000
me, you know, like no walls or anything, we were all in the same room for like years. And, and then like, you know, they just

1880
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,680
couldn't seem to get a handle on their cash well enough until finally my dad was like, you guys got to go, you know, like you

1881
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:29,160
have to make enough money and get out of here. So I mean, my my dad's had to do that to me a bunch of

1882
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:35,800
right. So over the years, I'm used to seeing that happen. And but like the reason that we've been able to put up people

1883
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:42,360
so much is that my dad just makes so much money that he can afford to take care of an extra person, you know, but it was

1884
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:47,200
finally just at the point where like, my parents are getting older, and they just don't want to have to deal with that

1885
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:53,360
anymore. You know, they're like, we're done with this whole putting up people randomly thing. But on the other side of the

1886
02:05:53,360 --> 02:06:00,320
coin, my dad really wants to move him and my mom out and get their own place and just leave this house to me and my

1887
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:08,400
brothers. And like, dude, and he wants that's like, that's a huge value. That's like, that's a really valuable thing.

1888
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:15,600
Right. But I mean, he wants us to be paying for it, you know, but he's also because like the thing is he kept offering me

1889
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:24,880
like, Alright, the house costs about $2,500 a month to run. Can you move in enough people that we can all afford it?

1890
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:33,800
You know, and I was like, how many, how many bedrooms are there? There's like four clear bedrooms and three rooms that can

1891
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:43,100
be made into bedrooms. So the place I live now, the rent is 3200 and we have six people living right, which is pretty

1892
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:50,740
good. Like I it's pretty here's the thing. So he changed that though recently because he kept saying like, you know, like he was

1893
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:57,780
saying 2,500 is like the amount it's going to cost a month. But what because what he was talking about at the time was him and my

1894
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:04,660
mom and shade moving out into their own, you know, into a difficult shade still completely dependent on him, then moving

1895
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:10,380
into a place and leaving the house to me and whoever I can move in. And they were also kind of in the mindset that Victor

1896
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:16,700
might be moving in with his girlfriend at some point. But right now, Victor doesn't have a job. And he's probably not going

1897
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:23,460
to move with it with her anytime soon. And shade, they don't really need to take him with them because he's an adult now.

1898
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:33,460
So they're like, What if we moved and got our own place? And I my dad puts up $1,000 towards the house to cover shade and Victor.

1899
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:44,140
And I just move in enough people to pay $1,500 a month. So for me, I'm like, Well, I've already got me in DeVue. And I can easily afford

1900
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:51,140
500 a piece for us. So if I can just get one more guy who's willing to pay $500 a month, we're set, you know,

1901
02:07:52,020 --> 02:08:01,420
I, I want one thing that I want Jesse to move out of his house. He's his situation seems so right. Seems so rough, you

1902
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:07,260
know, he's always talking about like his mom and his family. And like, it doesn't sound very good. I really want him to get a new

1903
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:14,980
place. But he seems so he seems like he's kind of got inertia, you know, like he's pretty like he's pretty set up where he is.

1904
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:24,540
Yeah, it's like that his his room and his house is so big a part of who he is. And like his mentality, it is his, his basement is

1905
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:29,500
like, like, imagine, imagine a fucking Jesse would video in a different room.

1906
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:31,860
Yeah, it's it's hard like a set or something.

1907
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:38,300
Like, that's my like, I honestly, like, when I was talking about like moving people in, I was like, What can we possibly

1908
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:45,700
what room could we put Jesse in that would be like, enough to cat like to have his personality in there?

1909
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:48,180
You know, I hope to God, you have a furnace room.

1910
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:58,980
Sadly, no. Well, we have, we have a stairs, a little, like, barely you can even fit in their room that that cold Corona could

1911
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:04,620
be it. It's next to the furnace. Well, not a furnace, but I want to I want to live with cold Corona.

1912
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:12,420
But yeah, I, I, again, I think the ideal situation is everyone makes enough money that we can all afford houses close to

1913
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:18,900
each other. And like, I really want the red letter media lifestyle. Like, that's been my personal dream, because they

1914
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:25,860
all just kind of are a bunch of guys who live in Wisconsin and have a studio and they hang out and they make stuff, you

1915
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:32,660
know, like, or Game Grumps is essentially the same. But a lot of them like live together and stuff like that, or have

1916
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:34,900
been in like arranged living situations.

1917
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:41,580
You know, I would I would love to I would love that just for what I was talking about before about, you know, my

1918
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:46,820
comics take so long. I would I would love to work on like little smaller things with people. I think I think that

1919
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:53,980
because if I literally had anyone, I could I would use I would use you constantly. Like if you were around here.

1920
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:56,820
Yeah, use me, digi. Use me.

1921
02:09:57,180 --> 02:10:04,620
Well, I would put you in I'm yours for the taking you in everything because like if I had people that I like, like my

1922
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:13,060
biggest problem is I don't have anyone around who's like interested and talented in the kind of work I do or like or

1923
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:21,340
can do, you know, like, because if I had you guys around, I wouldn't stick to just this kind of rigid analysis video

1924
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:26,540
type thing that I do, like how me and Jesse have always wanted to do the plebe and the weeb where if we live

1925
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:33,460
together, we can easily do this like talk show about anime where we play these like eccentric characters. And, you

1926
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:39,700
know, like the reason that analysis videos are the only thing I could really do is because that's the only thing I can do by

1927
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:48,060
myself, you know, or just hiring someone who lives a fucking all the way across the country, you know, to help with like if I

1928
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:55,020
had someone sitting right next to me and I say, let's film a thing where I'm a character and I'm running around doing

1929
02:10:55,020 --> 02:11:05,020
something weird in this video, then just having someone who can hold a camera is like a huge opening of doors, you know, kind of

1930
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:09,660
like when Nate bought that like nice camera and I was like, you know, you're going to have someone who you're going to need someone

1931
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:16,020
who could just adjust the focus. Because like, you can't adjust the focus on a camera pointed at yourself if it's a nice

1932
02:11:16,020 --> 02:11:24,260
camera. And that's such a huge limitation that just having someone there who can move the little focus bar, you know, is like

1933
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:31,340
such a huge advancement. So that that's why I want people around so bad, because like all my friends are totally

1934
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:40,340
uninterested, totally unambitious, none of them want to do anything, not at all interested in YouTube. Victor is starting to

1935
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:47,380
get interested because he can't find work. And he's kind of getting desperate, which is why he wants to do stuff like he's

1936
02:11:47,380 --> 02:11:52,500
trying to get that that thing he wants to do with you off the ground. The only problem is he has no money to pay you.

1937
02:11:52,620 --> 02:12:01,020
So I want I want to do that. Like I liked the script. But I can't I can't do it for free. I can't do it pro bono.

1938
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:08,140
That's just not a viable life with the time it would take, although it is only like a two minute thing. But I mean, I told

1939
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:15,980
him it would take me a couple days. And it's true. I wouldn't do it for free. I mean, I can't I just can't you just can't do

1940
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:23,300
stuff. I mean, I mean, I'm trying to be a I don't know how much you would charge him. How much do you think you

1941
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:34,900
would charge maybe like I don't know. I mean, I don't know exactly how much work it'll be. Let's say like 250 bucks.

1942
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:42,660
Yeah, he doesn't have the money. Is that high? I don't think it's high for the for what the job is. It's just that he

1943
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:50,100
wouldn't be able to afford it. I could pay. I mean, I'm trying to be reasonable. I don't know. I do more than that to edit my

1944
02:12:50,100 --> 02:13:01,300
videos. So like I don't know. I think if I was con that sounds like I'm thinking about it. And I'm like if I was confident

1945
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:09,020
there was going to be a return on that video, I would just pay you and have Victor pay me back through ad revenue. I don't

1946
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:16,900
know. There's no guarantee. There's no guarantee of that. 200 views for all I know, you know, although I would promote it if I'm, you

1947
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:25,780
know, a producer on it. Naturally, but the producing. Yeah, I guess that's what I guess that is what you would be pretty

1948
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:35,340
literally funded his creation. Man, talking about cameras, though, before reminded me that me and Nate filmed scenes for like two

1949
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:45,420
of his upcoming best guy ever is like six and 10 months ago. I know I know about that. And like, oh my god, they were he was

1950
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:52,340
describing the videos to me back then and they sounded so good. And then he spent six months on fucking Undertale, which like

1951
02:13:52,340 --> 02:14:00,180
came out fine. Don't get me wrong. And then and then he did one punch man kind of released. He said he was working on it like

1952
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:08,820
basically the same time. But they did. I wanted those other two. He's still working on it. I wanted the he's I know but I want

1953
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:14,260
that like he has like a pecking order of when each video is going to come out and like they're all set up.

1954
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:23,700
So long ago, like, like we got one of my friends, we wrote one of my friends in to like help us film it. And we

1955
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:30,260
promised him that it would come out. And like, I mean, I'm sure he's forgotten about it. But I just I want to be able to tell

1956
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:38,460
him like, Hey, Conrad, this is also guys also named I see. Yeah, he's like, Hey, Conrad, remember that film you made a year ago?

1957
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:43,380
Well, here's the YouTube video. I just I want that for myself.

1958
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:45,380
I can't believe you know two Conrad's.

1959
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:50,820
Um, it's weird. I don't know any. I've never met another Conrad.

1960
02:14:52,180 --> 02:15:00,260
Yeah, I he's more of a friend of a friend. Like, I don't know, he's he's alright. He's he's bipolar as fuck.

1961
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:05,260
He's he's he's cool though. He's got a red beard.

1962
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:13,660
But yeah, all those things I was just saying is also like why I wanted to talk because like I've always wanted to do a project

1963
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:21,100
with you. And like, I don't know, I feel really strongly about the artistic abilities of everyone in the procrastinators,

1964
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:29,620
we're like, I desperately want us all to collaborate. But it has to be the right thing. Like I'm not going to force a fucking

1965
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:39,020
that guy with the glasses collab and like, Oh, Ben's in my video because Ben's in my video. It's like, if I'm going to do

1966
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:45,140
something with you, I want it to be something that uses your like that will impress people and make them want to go seek you

1967
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:52,380
out. You know, like, whoa, who drew this? You know, I want I want that to be the reaction. Like if we did the sort of online

1968
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:58,700
one, I want people to be like, who did the art for this? They're great. And I can say here's his Patreon, you know,

1969
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:07,020
doing doing the thumbnails and the faces for TBAP was very satisfying. And I would really like I would really like to do that

1970
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:16,260
kind of thing again. I mean, it wasn't that hard, like the actual like, I mean, the editing, honestly, editing the faces in was way

1971
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:26,100
harder than drawing them, like 10 times harder. Yeah, I'd like to I'd like to be providing. I'd like to provide art to

1972
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:32,660
things. And I know you said Victor would use me as an actor. I mean, I don't consider myself to have much acting

1973
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:40,100
experience. Well, it's that he likes writing around you, because the first time we got out, it was like, because the way you

1974
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:50,740
and Nate communicate is like so character like, like, you have this very fast, like almost, just we didn't ask like back and

1975
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,300
forth thing going on.

1976
02:16:53,380 --> 02:17:01,380
I was thinking about this lately. Like, like, yeah, everyone who likes who liked TBAP said that like me and Nate's dynamic was

1977
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:09,420
like a huge part of it and made it and it's like, it's a I think it's a waste that me and Nate don't like aren't making

1978
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:15,260
anything like that anymore. I think so too. I was under the impression that was entirely because you just didn't want to be on

1979
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:16,140
YouTube, though.

1980
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:28,420
I don't know. I mean, we tried to keep it going with TBAP plays. But that was like, that was such a slog. And we don't I mean, we

1981
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:35,740
don't want to do TBAP anymore. So like, what else? I mean, I guess we're on the PCP together, but like, it's

1982
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:46,180
usually anime reaction videos, every every week, every every new anime come out, you talk about them like, I mean, me and me

1983
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:53,260
and Nate and Jeff have been trying to launch like more anime podcasts, like ourselves and just are having such a hard

1984
02:17:53,260 --> 02:18:00,900
time with like, having something we all want to do because like when it comes to like what made TBAP work and what made

1985
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:10,020
like podcasting about MLP, like make any sense is that it came out every week. And so everyone was on the same page. And like

1986
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:18,100
for me, I hate watching current anime, like I never watch stuff while it's coming out. So like, you know, me and Nate and

1987
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:24,540
Jeff, like every new season, there's like this big great excuse to talk about all the new shows because they all just

1988
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:30,740
started and we'll watch all the first episodes and we can talk about them. But then I don't keep up with any of them. So

1989
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:35,860
like, we're always like, Oh, what if we did one like six weeks later, like how did they all turn out? And I'm like, but

1990
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:44,660
then I'd have to watch them all. I don't want to do that. But I do think that there's like room in the world for that to be

1991
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:54,220
a thing like people doing a episodic podcast about shit. It's just there's not enough like good people. That's what makes the

1992
02:18:54,220 --> 02:19:01,820
TPC so great is like, I feel like I've gathered all the best people here, you know, like we are all here. Who else would we

1993
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:04,580
possibly want around, you know?

1994
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:13,980
I like, I like, I like our group. I like our little TPC. And yeah, it's, it's I mean, me and Nate, and like any other

1995
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:20,140
pairing you could think of, I think, I think if the if two of us collabed on the right thing, it could be really

1996
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:29,900
great. But like, yeah, man, that's why I love getting Jesse into my raps so much. Because like, I've, I have this

1997
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:38,300
Rodin was really good, dude. Rodin was glad you liked it. Um, yeah, I don't. Jesse probably doesn't know this. But he is

1998
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:43,740
listening to us right now. But I, what? Yeah, they Jesse and DeVue are both listening to us right now.

1999
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:49,500
Ew, they came in about like 10 minutes ago, I want to say.

2000
02:19:50,540 --> 02:20:01,340
I hate those fuckers so much. But anyways, um, I at one point, like Jesse made, I think it was when he made asshole boy

2001
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:09,020
where I made like this weird random thing and sent it to him. And he like wrapped over it and made a video out of it and

2002
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:17,540
patron did. And I was like, wait a minute, shouldn't I be getting some of that money? I couldn't help but think that. And I've

2003
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:22,380
done a few things for Jesse where I've given him like random stuff and he's made videos out of it. And I was like,

2004
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:29,500
well, it's fine because I'm gonna eventually get him to do stuff for me too. Like I want to have, you know, Jesse

2005
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:37,660
parts in my videos. And so far, the only time I've ever done it was with the My Little Pony leap of faith video where I got him

2006
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:45,740
to do all these cancer jokes, which was fantastic. But like all these years, I've just been like waiting for the day that I

2007
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:56,700
have a good Jesse Woods spot to put in my video to mark on Patreon and not give him any of the money just so I can have payback.

2008
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:06,420
Your videos don't really lend themselves to like celebrity or, you know, cameos. That's exactly why, like I said, I want like if we all

2009
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:13,380
live together, I could do different kinds of videos that like would because there's plenty of ways that like, again, with red

2010
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:19,300
letter media, like it makes perfect sense that there's five guys in some of those videos, because that's just the type of video

2011
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:25,580
it is. But like the stuff I do, like, you know, if you watch the stuff that the collabs I did do back in the pony days, like with

2012
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:32,500
me and Tom, it was always just kind of two reviews smushed together. You know, like, I talked for a little while, Tom talks for a

2013
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:39,220
little while, we both make our points. And that's it. Like with the leap of faith video, what made it a good collab because I had

2014
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:46,460
Jesse and Gibb and take both in there. And it was like, I had this whole segment where I said, this video is too dark, quick.

2015
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:54,140
Jesse, make some jokes. And then Jesse comes out and makes these like really dark jokes that were, you know, like not at all

2016
02:21:54,140 --> 02:22:02,180
lightening up. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember that one. I wasn't I forgot. But I just it's all coming back. But that's like the only

2017
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:10,700
context I've ever had where throwing some random comedy bit into the video like flowed well and was a good idea. But I mean, I

2018
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:17,660
could have like if if I was making a video about like commercialism or something, and I wanted to throw in random

2019
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:23,860
advertisements, I'd get everybody to do that. Or like with Nate with the Monster Musume one, like that was genius to have each

2020
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:31,740
of us act out like a weird monster creature. And then they're it just like cuts to those scenes. Like that was great.

2021
02:22:32,060 --> 02:22:39,980
I liked I liked that part of the video. I don't think it was a great video. It was kind of halfway. I think he made some good

2022
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:47,500
points. But I think the the audio made that hard to listen to because it was the audio was too loud. Mostly I just don't

2023
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:51,900
care about Monster Musume. I mean, that's really what does it for me.

2024
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:56,340
Right. But I do love the I think the monster parts are like fucking hilarious.

2025
02:22:57,380 --> 02:23:04,900
I like my little thing where I'm in the bathtub and I just pour a little that part. I think that's my favorite part. I

2026
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:12,020
maybe I'm biased, but I think I just I need more of that. I need more of the procrastinators in things together. And like,

2027
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:19,380
I, you know, when you say it like that, I really agree. I'd like I missed I missed being in things. I think I said this

2028
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:26,180
the other day. Yeah, I miss being like, I missed having appearances. I mean, the PC, the PCP is my only outlet for it.

2029
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:26,820
And it's good.

2030
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:36,540
Well, I love the PCP because it's given like people are starting to understand why we all hang out and like why we're all

2031
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:42,780
friends. And like that we're all friends. Because like back in the day, when we were calling ourselves the horseshoe

2032
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:49,020
crew, and we did a few podcasts together. But like, I felt like not a lot of people were connecting the dots and like

2033
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:56,020
putting us together, which led to that hilarious scenario. I'll put a link to this fan art that you drew for me in the

2034
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:57,540
description of

2035
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:59,580
Oh, the best friends party?

2036
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:06,540
Because I was talking about how people who draw my OC character with like all these other famous brony analyst people who

2037
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:13,020
like I wasn't friends with at all. And a lot of them I couldn't stand. And they draw us and these same people had no idea

2038
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:15,420
who Jesse was, even though he was your best friend.

2039
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:22,180
Because there would be tons of art of like, OC characters hanging out and it'd be like me and KP and like maybe Tom would

2040
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:27,900
be there because people knew me and Tom were friends from way back. But like, Jesse is like my best friend and he would

2041
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:33,060
never get drawn in anybody's fan art. Like he was always left out of group shots and stuff. And it would like it would kind of

2042
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:38,980
piss me off because I'm like, I don't I don't like that I'm being represented this way as like friends with all these people I

2043
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:43,420
can't stand. And you know, the people who I love aren't even in the pictures, you know.

2044
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:52,300
The I really like that I really like that the PCP has sort of developed its own little community. I mean, it's not a big

2045
02:24:52,300 --> 02:25:00,180
community, but there is definitely a PCP like PCP fan club, apparently, which is a little weird.

2046
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:05,580
Oh, yeah. I make that I'm curious about that. Like, I want to know what the heck's going on in there. What are they

2047
02:25:05,580 --> 02:25:11,860
scheming? Are they plotting against us? Are they plotting to take our places? I play like double agent for us because I

2048
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:16,140
think he's been there. We can have him feed us the download and what's going on.

2049
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:24,700
I've considered like secretly joining and like pretending to be I don't just show up and be like, Hey, fellow PCP listeners,

2050
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:31,980
just you're at run of the mill fan here. What's going on? Oh, shit. But now I can't because I'll know it's me if I do

2051
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:39,900
that. I'll have to change. I have to change my approach. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, I like that it's got its own little

2052
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:46,500
thing. And I mean, people really like people really like Jesse, like some of the most positive comments videos ever got

2053
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:54,420
were about the editing on the one that just come around so much because like when we started PCP, like we got a lot of

2054
02:25:54,420 --> 02:26:00,780
like comments that were like kick Jesse off and stuff like that. And then we like, wait, we did. Yeah, no, at first

2055
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:06,220
people were like, like, like Jesse was the one who people were having like the most negative reaction to until the first

2056
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:12,740
time he edited one. And then everyone like completely flipped like was like Jesse's the best guy on the podcast. Like it

2057
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:20,380
totally changed the perception of him. And like now people love him. And which is all I've ever wanted is that people will

2058
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:27,460
look at our whole group and appreciate that we all think each other are great. Like because that's the basis of this

2059
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:35,620
group is that we were all like, we all like each other's content. And like, I think, to me, that's the glue that holds it

2060
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:43,580
together is like enjoying one another stuff. And the fact that we're all very brutal towards each other about like how we

2061
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:53,340
feel about each other's work. And like, you know, show like, I can show up and like Nate wants to like knows he has to

2062
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:59,180
work faster because he looks at me and he's like, how am I not making as much money or getting as much views as Digi?

2063
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:05,300
And it makes him mad, you know, and then he works faster. And I look at Jesse, and I'm like, my videos don't have enough

2064
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:12,980
personality, I don't have enough character. And so then I get mad and make 1000 vlogs, you know, and like, so I think we have

2065
02:27:12,980 --> 02:27:20,460
that feeding off of each other, because we all look at each other's work and think I need to be as successful or I need to

2066
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:32,060
be as good as him, you know. So like it puts us in combat to like in combat, but none of us hates the other guy, none of us is

2067
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:39,820
like, Oh, God, like, it would be different if someone was in here who like, you know, was making shit tons of money, and we all

2068
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:44,620
thought that their content was garbage, then we would be like, Okay, get the fuck out of here, you know,

2069
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:52,780
I, I wish I wish that I felt more of a hot blooded rivalry with either Tom or Mage. Unfortunately, I really don't.

2070
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:55,300
I think Tom started to feel it towards you.

2071
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,340
I need a hot blooded rival of my own God damn it.

2072
02:27:57,340 --> 02:28:06,620
Tom's jealousy over your skill has started to make him like more like really he sent me this really long message yesterday, like,

2073
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:14,180
basically asking about like for advice on whether he should be trying to quit YouTube or not and like where he should be going.

2074
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:22,780
On the basis of realizing that he's just know you, like he's like, I'm no Ben, I'll never be as fast as Ben and as cool as Ben.

2075
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:24,660
So how do I, what do I have to do?

2076
02:28:26,020 --> 02:28:34,060
I feel so, I feel so slow, you know, like I look, I got, I look at the like that post I made the other day of all the pages I did this

2077
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:39,540
month. I mean, it looks like a lot when you put them all together, but like it's less than a page a day and they're only rough.

2078
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:40,460
They're not even finished.

2079
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:41,860
I feel like I'm not

2080
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:51,020
you're comparing yourself to fucking Bakuman and to the Japanese where like, I do, I compare myself to the Japanese all the time,

2081
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:53,540
like, which is not, I don't understand.

2082
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:58,500
I don't understand why like Western creators just, they just don't produce at this prodigious rate.

2083
02:28:58,620 --> 02:29:00,900
Like if it's possible, why aren't they doing it?

2084
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:10,300
It's just that I don't Japanese are like have a very different mindset about work like in their in, I think, I think that in Japan work is seen

2085
02:29:10,300 --> 02:29:12,620
as like a duty that you must do.

2086
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:17,500
And in America, I think work is seen as something that you force yourself to do.

2087
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:23,660
You know, like, I think the general cultural idea of work is that it's not fun.

2088
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:32,380
And that's why so many people want to be artists and like to do something that, you know, or to be famous, more less artists, more famous.

2089
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:40,100
People want to be famous because they see it as like a fun, easy version of work, you know, getting paid to do nothing, which is not

2090
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:43,020
what it is, but that's how people see it.

2091
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:45,620
And that's why we idolize fame in our culture so much.

2092
02:29:45,620 --> 02:29:48,540
Whereas in Japan, they really don't idolize fame.

2093
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:51,020
They idolize hard work, you know.

2094
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:59,020
But like, but like, like Brian Leo Malley is a world class, you know, comic maker.

2095
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:03,060
And he makes, he took him, you know, he made six books in like six years.

2096
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:06,380
That's like, you know, maybe a page every day or every other day or something.

2097
02:30:07,540 --> 02:30:08,620
Yeah, I guess every other day.

2098
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:12,060
H-ero. Yeah, like, I mean, less than a page a day.

2099
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:14,860
H-ero Oda makes fucking like 30 pages a week.

2100
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:20,500
Well, Oda makes 20 pages a week and I'm sure he has a team of assistants.

2101
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:29,140
He does. I mean, I mean, Brian had assistants, but like he, yeah, Oda probably made more extensive use of his like team of assistants.

2102
02:30:30,020 --> 02:30:33,340
I don't know. I want to, I've been in a rut lately.

2103
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:38,340
I'm trying to get to a place where like the next panel, like I have the

2104
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:42,820
next page and the next panel, just like, I know it in my mind.

2105
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:45,700
And I just like, I can just like, like slam it out.

2106
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:47,980
Like, I know what it's supposed to look like and I just do it.

2107
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:53,780
But like these past couple of days, I've sort of been in a rut because like I'm sort of on a bit of like exposition-y bit.

2108
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:57,740
That's like, it's not really the point, but it's necessary to set up the point.

2109
02:30:57,740 --> 02:31:02,700
And it's, it's not, I'm just not as invested in it as I am in like the beginning and the end.

2110
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:07,220
I don't know. Hopefully that won't mean that it's going to be boring when it comes out.

2111
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:09,100
But I'm trying my best.

2112
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:12,900
Yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been a little, it's got a little art block,

2113
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:14,940
got a little bit of an artist block going right now.

2114
02:31:16,060 --> 02:31:19,660
That's, and that's why I'm here doing this instead of, instead of drawing.

2115
02:31:19,660 --> 02:31:24,220
I mean, obviously I'm in a fairly similar position.

2116
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:30,180
I'm, I have a lot of ideas of things that could be the June month videos,

2117
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:35,100
but none that I'm like jumping on right now, you know, they all kind of feel.

2118
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:41,660
They all kind of feel like, maybe that one, but it's hard to force yourself.

2119
02:31:41,660 --> 02:31:42,780
How do you feel about that?

2120
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:47,780
Do you have a hard time like forcing yourself to do something that you're like,

2121
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:53,500
for me, I have to be like enthusiastic about the video, you know, in order to write it.

2122
02:31:53,780 --> 02:32:01,380
Like if I, I have like a long list of like video ideas that are great ideas that like,

2123
02:32:01,460 --> 02:32:03,900
like I'm just not up for writing yet.

2124
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:10,380
And like the idea of like making myself write one just because I know it's a good idea is so unattractive.

2125
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:13,020
Do you have that?

2126
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:21,460
Yeah, the, I mean, I, yeah, I, I'm no good at, I'm no good at getting myself to draw.

2127
02:32:21,460 --> 02:32:26,980
Like, like the best days I ever have are the days where I wake up and start drawing immediately,

2128
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:28,340
but I can never do that.

2129
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:31,100
Like my motivation is, is low in the mornings.

2130
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:34,420
Like my motivation increases as the day goes on always.

2131
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:38,860
Cause like the less time I have left in the day, the more urgently I feel like I need to get something done.

2132
02:32:40,220 --> 02:32:47,660
But yeah, like, like, um, I can't, I'm really terrible at forcing myself.

2133
02:32:47,660 --> 02:32:48,660
I have no discipline.

2134
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:55,380
I pretty much just have to like wait, I pretty much just have to wait for some bit of like enthusiasm

2135
02:32:55,380 --> 02:33:00,940
or at the very least a bit of like less having like less lethargy than usual.

2136
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:05,540
I kind of have to like wait for, for the time and then I can feel it's like now I feel

2137
02:33:05,540 --> 02:33:09,540
like drawing might be bearable now, I have to do it now or else I'll miss this golden

2138
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:10,540
opportunity.

2139
02:33:10,540 --> 02:33:15,060
Do you ever have like, uh, do you have any traps that you set for yourself or techniques

2140
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:21,460
for psyching yourself up like, uh, like DeVu, I know is pretty good at this where he'll

2141
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:22,460
set weird alarms.

2142
02:33:22,460 --> 02:33:25,340
DeVu told me one the other day.

2143
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:29,700
The other day DeVu mentioned that he like puts up a timer and like every time he accomplishes

2144
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:33,340
something he resets the timer, like a certain, every time he does a certain and I actually

2145
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:37,660
started that like yesterday, I opened up a little timer app and I've just had it going.

2146
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:46,300
Um, oh God, what's it at now, uh, 22 hours, oh fuck, uh, 22 and a half hours, no, no,

2147
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:50,500
fuck you DeVu, you fucked me, you fucked me.

2148
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:55,820
For me, there's like a lot of, um, I would say I'm, I'm relatively bad at, at like those

2149
02:33:55,820 --> 02:34:01,140
kind of things because they're self-imposed and it's so easy for me to go, yeah, but fuck

2150
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:06,300
it, you know, like I'm the, I'm the type of guy who will set myself an alarm and then

2151
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:11,020
like when the alarm goes off, I'll turn it off and go back to bed or go back to whatever

2152
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:15,300
I was doing before because I'm just like, yeah, I have the control here and tomorrow's

2153
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:22,100
another day, you know, but I'm, I'm the same about alarms, but I like this timer thing

2154
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:27,780
because it's passive and like all it does is like add an additional stressor, remind

2155
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:28,780
you how shitty you are.

2156
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:36,460
Kind of passive urgency, yeah, uh, so it's, uh, I mean, I think it might be helping a

2157
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:37,460
little bit.

2158
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:39,580
It sounds kind of just started using it, but I like it.

2159
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:43,460
Maybe I should try it for this fucking, uh, videos I'm trying to do this month.

2160
02:34:43,460 --> 02:34:48,020
I'm a lot more into like weird superstitions.

2161
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:57,540
For me, because, uh, I like the whole like, um, June is going to be the month, you know,

2162
02:34:57,540 --> 02:35:03,860
and so it's like leading up to June starting, I made sure to get anything, like any unfinished

2163
02:35:03,860 --> 02:35:07,580
work I had had to be done by then, like the biggest one was Digi Bros.

2164
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:13,540
Like I forced Victor for us to finish the Dark Souls 3 Let's Play so that it would be done

2165
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:17,500
and then the entire month of June, I'd be, I wouldn't have to worry about Let's Plays,

2166
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:18,500
you know.

2167
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:24,180
Ironically, I've then recorded a commentary and a podcast immediately, but, uh, like,

2168
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:30,020
I like that, um, like clean my plate and now here's the set time and like, let's do it.

2169
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:34,300
Let's put all everything into this one thing we're about to do, you know, do you ever have

2170
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:41,980
those kind of almost superstitious feelings, like, I have to get it done on Friday because

2171
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:45,900
if it's before the weekend, then I know I did it, you know.

2172
02:35:46,860 --> 02:35:53,500
Uh, I have been weirdly, I have, I mean, not like the last day or two, but for the last

2173
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:58,580
couple of weeks, I have been weirdly good about getting a page done a day, like, just

2174
02:35:58,580 --> 02:36:03,060
like not, like, no matter how long it takes, just, I just don't go to bed until I get something

2175
02:36:03,060 --> 02:36:08,220
done, I get a page sketch that day, which is why I have like, you know, 20 something

2176
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:15,140
done for the month, uh, and like, like, it's not an optimal workflow, like, I'm basically

2177
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:19,100
just slacking off all day and then rushing it done at the very end, but like, hey, I

2178
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:21,180
mean, at least it's getting done, right?

2179
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:26,660
Um, so yeah, kinda, it's not exactly a superstition.

2180
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:28,660
I've got a system to propose for you.

2181
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:33,460
This is how I finished my nano-remo novel back in 2010.

2182
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:35,420
You know about nano-remo, right?

2183
02:36:35,420 --> 02:36:36,420
Oh my god.

2184
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:39,500
I'm aware of nano-remo.

2185
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:41,060
National write a novel month?

2186
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:42,060
Novel writing.

2187
02:36:42,060 --> 02:36:43,060
Yeah.

2188
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:47,820
Month of November every year, and the goal is to write a 50,000 word novel within the

2189
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:56,020
month of November, and in order to do that, you have to write 1,667 words a day, which

2190
02:36:56,020 --> 02:37:01,140
for some people sounds way high, for people like me, doesn't sound very high, I can crank

2191
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:05,060
that out pretty easily, but it's a lot harder with fiction, and...

2192
02:37:05,060 --> 02:37:07,620
I think I would have a really hard time doing that.

2193
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:13,780
The website, um, like, because there's a lot of like participatory tools on the website.

2194
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:17,540
There's like, you know, an extensive forum, lots of little things it'll give you to like,

2195
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:22,420
try to motivate yourself, but the biggest one is that you plug in your word count at

2196
02:37:22,420 --> 02:37:26,900
the end of each day, and you know, it keeps like a graph of how you're doing, and like,

2197
02:37:26,900 --> 02:37:31,820
it tells you how many words you have to do to catch up, or like, you know, keeps track

2198
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:33,380
of how you're doing and stuff like that.

2199
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:41,820
So, um, when I did it in 2010, I was like, the first two days, I think I wrote like 5,000

2200
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:47,660
words a day, so I was like way ahead of schedule, and then I didn't write, like, I think I had

2201
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:56,340
about, I had 26,000 words at the end, like, within two weeks, and then I just stopped

2202
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:00,740
writing for the entire rest of the month, and then on the very last day, I was like,

2203
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:06,580
I'm going to try to do this, I have 24,000 words, so the goal is write 1,000 words an

2204
02:38:06,580 --> 02:38:07,580
hour.

2205
02:38:07,580 --> 02:38:09,540
How long did it take you to write 24,000 words?

2206
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:15,300
Like the first two weeks of the month, I wrote the first 24,000, and then the last day of

2207
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:18,580
the month, I wrote the entire rest of it.

2208
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:25,700
So what I did was I said, I said there's 24 hours in the day, so I have to write 1,000

2209
02:38:25,700 --> 02:38:27,660
words per hour.

2210
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:35,140
Any time I have, like, if I finish before the hour is over, then I get to do something

2211
02:38:35,140 --> 02:38:38,740
other than write for the rest of the hour, but then once the next hour starts, I have

2212
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:40,300
to get back to writing.

2213
02:38:40,300 --> 02:38:46,620
If I write 2,000 words within before the hour is over, then I get the next hour off.

2214
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:53,100
So starting from midnight, I wrote 1,000 words each hour for like 6 hours, and then I wrote

2215
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:57,260
like 2,000, and then went and ate lunch during the next hour.

2216
02:38:57,260 --> 02:39:02,620
And then I, you know, I think at one point I had 20 minutes left in an hour, and I took

2217
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:07,780
a nap for those 20 minutes, set an alarm to wake me up as soon as the next hour started,

2218
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:11,100
and I wrote 24,000 words in a day.

2219
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:12,220
It was a fucking nightmare.

2220
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:14,060
That's fucked up, man.

2221
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:21,020
That sounds like, alright, here's, I know I wouldn't be able to do nanoremo, because like

2222
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:22,900
here's been my process lately.

2223
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:30,060
I visualized what's going to happen on the next page, and I can draw it, and sometimes

2224
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:34,220
there's a little bit of struggle, but like it's usually relatively easy, especially

2225
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:37,340
if it's just like characters talking or something.

2226
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:42,540
Like I can draw the page in like an hour, but then I'll spend hours thinking about what

2227
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:47,980
they're saying, like the words, like choosing the words is so much harder.

2228
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:51,580
I hope I get better at it, because it's been a real, it's been a real training, honestly.

2229
02:39:51,580 --> 02:39:56,780
I feel like that's the opposite problem Tom has, like he seems to be really naturally

2230
02:39:56,780 --> 02:39:59,620
good at writing, and then like he second guesses-

2231
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:01,500
He considers himself more of a writer, I think.

2232
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:06,500
Yeah, and he second guesses everything he does as an artist, like.

2233
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:15,500
Yeah, his, I was talking to Nate the other day, and we both agreed like, his stuff is,

2234
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:18,660
his art is professional looking, like the stuff he's put out on Sorceress Lost, like

2235
02:40:18,660 --> 02:40:22,820
it looks as good as it needs to, like he knows what looks good.

2236
02:40:22,820 --> 02:40:26,540
It's only that he's not getting it out fast enough, that is the killer.

2237
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:31,660
Maybe you had the same reaction I did, but like when he, when you guys did the draw cast,

2238
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:37,020
like everything he drew looked fine, like it looked perfectly fine, and I was like,

2239
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:41,820
you drew that in 15 minutes, some of them he had colored, you know, and I was like,

2240
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:48,580
clearly you can draw fast, it's just that you want it to be perfect, you know.

2241
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:56,300
He's got, it's doing, doing Brunswick really helped me, because like I didn't care that

2242
02:40:56,300 --> 02:41:01,180
much about how it looked, I just wanted to get it done, I just want, and like it was

2243
02:41:01,180 --> 02:41:05,780
going to look how it was going to look, so like I wouldn't sketch ahead of time, I would

2244
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:12,180
just draw like a face, and just like there it is, that's, that's how it looks, no correction,

2245
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:16,940
and like it came out fine, so like I'm trying, I'm trying not to worry about like planning

2246
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:22,100
it out in my head, like I'll just like, I'll draw a face, and like that's how it looks,

2247
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:25,620
and if it's totally wrong, I'll do it again, but like I just, I just do it.

2248
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:27,820
I think for me, I've been trying to do that more.

2249
02:41:27,820 --> 02:41:32,420
Like what appeals to me is like all in the composition really, like it's kind of like

2250
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:38,060
a Kill La Kill, when people say that that show like is like badly animated or something

2251
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:40,340
like that, or like that it doesn't look good.

2252
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:44,900
Assholes, fucking assholes that think that it doesn't look good, I'll kill them.

2253
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:49,220
You know, I watch like a, I'll watch something like Snow White, or like an old Disney movie

2254
02:41:49,220 --> 02:41:54,220
or something, and like everything's moving constantly, but none of it is memorable, like

2255
02:41:54,220 --> 02:42:01,260
no one image is memorable, whereas like in Kill La Kill, sometimes it'll just be like

2256
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:06,620
a sliding still shot, but the composition is so strong that it like really sticks with

2257
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:07,620
you.

2258
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:12,540
But like, it's funny, and it's like funny, and it's good, like yeah, it's like, it was,

2259
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:16,540
it wasn't hard to do, but it looks good the way they did it.

2260
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:20,420
I hate it when people complain about those shots, and I remember there was one guy who

2261
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:21,420
made a video where he talked about-

2262
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:22,420
It was a demo.

2263
02:42:22,420 --> 02:42:23,420
That fucking idiot.

2264
02:42:23,420 --> 02:42:24,420
Yeah.

2265
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:25,420
A demo.

2266
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:26,420
We did it, the demo?

2267
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:27,420
Say that about Kill La Kill?

2268
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:32,500
I hate about the scene where the guy flies back off the podium and like, yes, and he

2269
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:33,500
was so fucking wrong.

2270
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:35,180
Right, that scene is hilarious.

2271
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:37,780
No one's ever been, no one's ever been more wrong.

2272
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:38,780
I am with you.

2273
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:39,780
God damn it.

2274
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:40,780
I told him that too.

2275
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:41,780
I hate him.

2276
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:42,780
Conversation.

2277
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:43,780
Good.

2278
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:44,780
I'm, I'm glad.

2279
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:45,780
Ugh.

2280
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:53,900
Um, wait, I was gonna say, um, uh, oh, uh, Prince on the Popper, you ever seen that movie?

2281
02:42:53,900 --> 02:42:54,900
It was like unfinished.

2282
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:55,900
Yeah, I've seen parts of it.

2283
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:56,900
I haven't seen the whole thing.

2284
02:42:56,900 --> 02:42:57,900
Yeah.

2285
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:58,900
I mean, the whole thing doesn't exist.

2286
02:42:58,900 --> 02:43:02,700
Yeah, it was all, and it was hand-animated at 60 frames per second, and it's all big

2287
02:43:02,700 --> 02:43:03,700
and fancy.

2288
02:43:03,700 --> 02:43:04,700
It looks terrible.

2289
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,700
Parts of it look-

2290
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:06,700
Like, it's creepy looking.

2291
02:43:06,700 --> 02:43:08,700
I think parts of it look really cool, but like-

2292
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:09,700
Okay, there are, there are impressive parts, but like-

2293
02:43:09,700 --> 02:43:11,500
I actually think some of the best-looking parts-

2294
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:15,340
The visual direction is not attractive in much of the, in much of the film.

2295
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:19,060
I actually think some of the best-looking parts are the unfinished parts, when it's

2296
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:23,420
just like black and white compositions and stuff, and like some of that looks, uh, cooler

2297
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:24,820
than the actual finished stuff.

2298
02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:29,460
The part where, the part where he's running around in like a big tile maze, and like there's

2299
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:35,500
weird like visual, um, illusions going on, that part's pretty cool, but like, it just

2300
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:37,820
looks gr- it just looks gross half the time.

2301
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:38,820
Yeah.

2302
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:43,620
Um, all, all this is to say that, yeah, like, being technically advanced and like having

2303
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:46,740
a high frame count and stuff is so not the point.

2304
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:47,740
Right.

2305
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:53,660
And like, Scott, Scott Pilgrim looks so much, Scott Pilgrim looks way better than like,

2306
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:54,660
you know-

2307
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:55,660
You're typical, like-

2308
02:43:55,660 --> 02:44:02,300
The ending of Brunswick, like what made it so work was just simply the amount of black

2309
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:03,940
on the page.

2310
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:09,180
That was like all it took to make that ending like, look, like feel so dark and dramatic

2311
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:13,940
just because it was like, suddenly the whole page is black and you've just got like little

2312
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:18,700
flames on there and I was like, oh man, this feels fucking intense, you know.

2313
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:22,340
Oh, you mean like when it's in Claire's cave?

2314
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:23,340
Yeah, in that area.

2315
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:24,340
Like.

2316
02:44:24,340 --> 02:44:28,900
Like I did, I did go heavier on the detail at the end because I wanted it to feel really

2317
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:30,980
like, I don't know, dramatic or whatever.

2318
02:44:30,980 --> 02:44:31,980
I just mean like-

2319
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:32,980
I really like-

2320
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:35,660
I don't mean that the detail made it like more dramatic, just the fact that it was so

2321
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:42,100
dark, like it, you know, that made it like, it wasn't that you had to draw-

2322
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:43,500
That was, I mean, that was intentional.

2323
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:48,860
I meant like, that scene is supposed to be darker in tone and also like, just, I mean,

2324
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:49,860
it's a cave.

2325
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:50,860
It's just like that-

2326
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:51,860
I don't know.

2327
02:44:51,860 --> 02:44:56,500
It's much more creative than trying to like, like you said with the guy who drew the super

2328
02:44:56,500 --> 02:45:01,940
photorealistic like monkey screaming or whatever, like, if you want to make an intense picture

2329
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:06,340
of a monkey screaming, it could be fucking scribbles as long as the composition makes

2330
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:08,900
it look intense, you know.

2331
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:14,900
Yeah, it's like high fidelity renderings or not.

2332
02:45:14,900 --> 02:45:17,780
I feel like, I mean, it's the 80-20 rule, right?

2333
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:21,740
Like you get 80% of the benefit out of the first 20% of the effort.

2334
02:45:21,740 --> 02:45:26,340
So like, just draw a simple thing and get that 20, get that 80 out of the 20 and move

2335
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:27,340
on.

2336
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:32,700
Uh, that's, I mean, that's what I want to do with my work, um, yeah, like the early

2337
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:36,740
part of Brunswick, it's all outside, so it's all like white and light and the backgrounds

2338
02:45:36,740 --> 02:45:37,740
are pretty simple.

2339
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:41,620
And then he goes into the cave and then he's in the Claire place and it's all very dark

2340
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:42,620
and fiery.

2341
02:45:42,620 --> 02:45:48,860
It has this like, descendants feeling to it, which is effective for the narrative of it.

2342
02:45:48,860 --> 02:45:51,220
The emotional stakes growing.

2343
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:54,860
Yeah, I guess that was, I guess that was semi-intentional.

2344
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:59,980
Um, that's, that scene of the two dragonaires coming out of the lava is like the best thing

2345
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:00,980
I've ever made.

2346
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:01,980
Yeah, that's fucking awesome.

2347
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:03,980
I love that panel.

2348
02:46:03,980 --> 02:46:05,980
Yeah, yeah.

2349
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:15,740
Um, someone, um, someone messaged, I'm going, going back to Tom, I don't know why, but it's

2350
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:16,740
interesting.

2351
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:23,020
He messaged Tom about me and like he re, he retweeted the post and he said, like, this

2352
02:46:23,020 --> 02:46:25,300
is not how you encourage an artist.

2353
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:29,900
I guess he, he didn't approve of the tone of the, of the tweet.

2354
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:35,060
And um, I feel bad calling out this guy because he's obviously a big fan of mine.

2355
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:38,980
But yeah, this guy was, he made a really dumb comment and he was like, you know, I know

2356
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:44,460
you're no, I know you're no Ben Sainter or anything, but you know, you're still okay.

2357
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:49,060
You might even be better than me talking about himself.

2358
02:46:49,060 --> 02:46:52,460
And like, I went and looked at, I went, I went and looked at this guy's deviant art

2359
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:57,380
and like this guy is, he's, he's a fucking amateur, you know, his stuff's not great.

2360
02:46:57,380 --> 02:47:00,780
Like yeah, obviously Tom is way better than this guy.

2361
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:04,740
Um, but yeah, I was, I was taken aback.

2362
02:47:04,740 --> 02:47:09,380
I mean, obviously this guy was like a big, this guy's commented on my other tweets.

2363
02:47:09,380 --> 02:47:13,580
I mean, this guy really thinks I'm, I'm hot shit and like he's obviously correct about

2364
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:14,580
that.

2365
02:47:14,580 --> 02:47:16,860
But like in particular, this guy is a fan of me.

2366
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:21,460
So that the guy said that I'm like that this guy thought I was, that Tom wasn't as good

2367
02:47:21,460 --> 02:47:22,460
as me.

2368
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:24,740
I mean, I mean that that's this guy's opinion.

2369
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:26,980
Uh, I don't know.

2370
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:30,660
Like when you said that Tom messaged you about that, like, I wonder if it was brought about

2371
02:47:30,660 --> 02:47:35,580
by this one commenter because like, I don't know, I felt like he's got under his skin

2372
02:47:35,580 --> 02:47:43,260
because he tweeted down on his own art and I do think that because your stuff is so like

2373
02:47:43,260 --> 02:47:48,900
emotionally strong so quickly that it, you know, has more strength to it.

2374
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:49,900
Like I don't know.

2375
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:52,180
I'm a big fan of your art style in particular.

2376
02:47:52,180 --> 02:47:58,140
Like I really appreciate Tom's art and I feel like if someone was a fan of his art style,

2377
02:47:58,140 --> 02:48:03,180
then it would be like great, but I personally am not as big a fan of just like the way he

2378
02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:04,300
draws things.

2379
02:48:04,300 --> 02:48:09,020
Like he has that very like everything's about those variable line widths and everything

2380
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:13,540
and like these very, uh, I don't know how to describe his character.

2381
02:48:13,540 --> 02:48:14,540
Yeah.

2382
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:17,740
Tom has like, he has like a, they're very different.

2383
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:24,340
They're very, they're, yours is more of that anime dynamism one piece.

2384
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:28,460
Everything just looks cool and slick kind of feel, you know?

2385
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:30,140
I, yeah, I don't know.

2386
02:48:30,140 --> 02:48:33,220
I don't know how I do that, but I'm just so good.

2387
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:34,220
I'm just such a genius.

2388
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:37,180
I definitely think you got some touch and just can't help it.

2389
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:41,940
You seem to be too good for the amount of effort you've put in.

2390
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:42,940
I agree.

2391
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:43,940
I agree.

2392
02:48:43,940 --> 02:48:44,940
No, that's true.

2393
02:48:44,940 --> 02:48:46,340
I am too good for the amount of effort.

2394
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:52,060
I mean, I've been drawing seriously for like three years and I feel like, I feel like my

2395
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:54,220
stuff is like way above the level.

2396
02:48:54,220 --> 02:48:59,100
I feel like my stuff is near, is near the professional level.

2397
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:05,300
I think that the vapors like, I think in, in terms of everything to do with the art,

2398
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:10,140
the craft of it, I think it, it would, it should be professional, considered professional.

2399
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:12,500
Like, I can understand why.

2400
02:49:12,500 --> 02:49:14,220
I don't know about that.

2401
02:49:14,220 --> 02:49:17,660
Some, I feel like some of the pages are a little cramped and crowded and I feel like

2402
02:49:17,660 --> 02:49:21,580
some of my layouts are not perfect.

2403
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:26,980
Have you ever read any original English, English language manga like that Tokyo Pop

2404
02:49:26,980 --> 02:49:32,860
used to publish?

2405
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:33,860
Maybe like a little bit.

2406
02:49:34,300 --> 02:49:35,580
If so, I don't really remember.

2407
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:37,620
Most of those.

2408
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:43,700
Like there used to be, there was a sort of wave in the late 2000s of like English language

2409
02:49:43,700 --> 02:49:49,100
manga, which is interesting because like it, like you can, it's so annoying that you can

2410
02:49:49,100 --> 02:49:51,100
tell it's not Japanese.

2411
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:56,540
Like it, it, it, it, not just any in particular, it annoys me that it is possible to look at

2412
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:59,740
like a manga and be like, clearly this is not Japanese.

2413
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:03,020
How do you get, it, it bothers me that that is the reality.

2414
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:04,020
Well, here's the thing.

2415
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:08,740
But there's a guy called Ogui Maniacs who wrote a fantastic post about this way back

2416
02:50:08,740 --> 02:50:10,500
in the day.

2417
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,020
I think I have read it.

2418
02:50:12,020 --> 02:50:16,980
Is it about the use of tone and about how Western manga overused tone?

2419
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:22,900
They all use tones because they make it look like anime as opposed to like manga, whereas

2420
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:29,020
manga is usually very simple shading and stuff and not using tones much at all.

2421
02:50:30,020 --> 02:50:32,620
I think I somewhat overused tone.

2422
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:36,740
I mean, I had read that article before I did the vapors and I tried to keep it in mind

2423
02:50:36,740 --> 02:50:38,660
and not overuse them that much.

2424
02:50:38,660 --> 02:50:41,540
I think I did go overboard with them in certain places.

2425
02:50:41,540 --> 02:50:42,540
I don't know.

2426
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:47,540
Like I, looking at the vapors, I would immediately know that it's not Japanese, but I would not

2427
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:48,540
consider that a problem.

2428
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:49,540
Yeah.

2429
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:50,540
And like, this is speaking personally.

2430
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:52,380
I mean, I wasn't going for Japanese looking.

2431
02:50:52,380 --> 02:50:58,060
Like speaking personally, I am disgusted with the OEL look, the like, the overtoned like

2432
02:50:58,100 --> 02:50:59,100
shit.

2433
02:50:59,100 --> 02:51:03,780
When I see like American comics that are trying to look Japanese and failing, I have like

2434
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:08,420
a visceral like want to vomit reaction kind of thing.

2435
02:51:08,420 --> 02:51:10,620
Like it just looks wrong to me.

2436
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:15,540
And so the fact that your art doesn't look that way, where like you clearly had Japanese

2437
02:51:15,540 --> 02:51:20,140
influence and yet it's felt like a good comic in like a distinct art style.

2438
02:51:20,140 --> 02:51:25,420
I was like, yeah, you know, kind of like Scott Pilgrim, like I said, where I definitely

2439
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:28,340
was not trying to make it look like manga.

2440
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:30,180
I wasn't like going for manga.

2441
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:31,740
I was, I don't know.

2442
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:36,020
I was, I was just, I just drew it however seemed right to me and I didn't worry about

2443
02:51:36,020 --> 02:51:37,020
it.

2444
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:43,020
And I think, I think my style as I've come to understand it emerged in the vapors, like

2445
02:51:43,020 --> 02:51:44,900
withdrawing the vapors.

2446
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:47,420
Like my style didn't exist before that, but now it does.

2447
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:49,420
And it looks like that.

2448
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:51,020
It's yeah.

2449
02:51:51,020 --> 02:51:53,020
It's a miracle.

2450
02:51:54,020 --> 02:51:59,460
Well, I definitely hope to see as much more shit from you as possible.

2451
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:04,340
Like on the one hand, I know you feel like you work slow and the first chapter of the

2452
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:05,820
vapors did take forever.

2453
02:52:05,820 --> 02:52:11,420
Like I forget, I often forget how long you got that because it was pretty much from the

2454
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:17,220
time Tbap ended until the day it came out, like was the amount of time you worked on

2455
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:18,220
it, right?

2456
02:52:18,220 --> 02:52:22,020
Or yeah, it took me like, like I started doing it.

2457
02:52:22,020 --> 02:52:26,020
And I mean, I mean, I was thinking about doing it for a long time.

2458
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:31,220
I think I kind of started actually drawing it in like May or June.

2459
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:36,020
So like from when I first put pen to paper, it took me about six months, which is stupid.

2460
02:52:36,020 --> 02:52:40,420
But like what's great about it is that even though I know you feel like you, you work

2461
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:45,180
slow and like your, your, your stories feel small, now that you've kind of gotten up to

2462
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:49,540
like this, I think you're going to get a chapter probably once every month or two.

2463
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,620
Like Brunswick took like a month.

2464
02:52:51,620 --> 02:52:57,220
I feel like I could do, yeah, Brunswick, Brunswick took me a month, but as I say, I really deliberately

2465
02:52:57,220 --> 02:53:01,420
rushed it even though I think it came out good and, and also the pages were only half

2466
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:02,420
size.

2467
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:03,420
Uh, yeah.

2468
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:04,420
I'm, I'm excited.

2469
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:09,860
I mean, I've gotten 20 something pages sketched in a month.

2470
02:53:09,860 --> 02:53:15,820
I think I'm excited at the idea that like, even though it feels slow and small now, like

2471
02:53:15,820 --> 02:53:20,580
if you were making a chapter every two months, then at the end of the year, you'll have six

2472
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:26,460
chapters and it will feel way more substantial to look at all of them at once, you know?

2473
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:30,820
So like, you know, I think it won't be too long before you have more of a catalog and

2474
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:36,700
I'd like to see personal, personal request, make more even smaller stuff.

2475
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:43,020
Cause like, like I said, like Brunswick small or even like, even if it's just like two pages,

2476
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:48,220
you know, like just fun little random shit that like will more flesh out the idea of

2477
02:53:48,220 --> 02:53:52,660
like Ben St. has all this stuff he does, you know?

2478
02:53:52,660 --> 02:53:58,220
I was thinking about making autobiocomics, not like the stupid fucking like gag, like

2479
02:53:58,220 --> 02:53:59,220
here's my life.

2480
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:00,220
I'm so quick.

2481
02:54:00,220 --> 02:54:05,060
I kind of hate autobiocomics like on principle, but I was thinking about making some kind of

2482
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:08,780
because like I was saying much like hours ago in this podcast, like I feel like people

2483
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:11,060
don't really know me except through my comics.

2484
02:54:11,060 --> 02:54:15,740
So I was thinking of making some that like, you know, actually try and show a little bit

2485
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:19,660
about who, who I am.

2486
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:22,940
I think I could make some, some okay ones and they would probably only be like, like

2487
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:26,340
fucking white lion, white lion is an autobiocomic.

2488
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:28,020
It's, I mean, it's only sort of about me.

2489
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:33,460
I'm more of an observer to just, it was great though, because the situation is so fucking

2490
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:34,460
weird.

2491
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:35,460
It's weird.

2492
02:54:35,460 --> 02:54:45,260
Like to make sure I understand, he asked you if you were gay and you said no, no, no,

2493
02:54:45,260 --> 02:54:46,620
he didn't ask me if I was gay.

2494
02:54:46,620 --> 02:54:51,380
He invited me to a club and I asked him if he was gay and hitting on me and he said,

2495
02:54:51,380 --> 02:54:56,260
and he said, I'm bi, but I have a girlfriend, don't worry, and I was like, cool.

2496
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:57,260
In the end.

2497
02:54:57,260 --> 02:55:03,980
It's, I don't know if it was a gay bar, but it was entirely filled with men.

2498
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:06,620
There were a lot of, of men there.

2499
02:55:06,620 --> 02:55:10,260
It didn't really look like I depicted in the comic, but like the idea is the same.

2500
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:12,660
Was his tattoo actually a one piece thing?

2501
02:55:12,660 --> 02:55:16,700
Like, he did not have a tattoo.

2502
02:55:16,700 --> 02:55:23,180
He had, or he might have, but like I didn't include that.

2503
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:29,020
He was just wearing like a canvas jacket and like this weird mesh shirt and the white

2504
02:55:29,020 --> 02:55:35,700
lion thing, wait, I forget, does he say in the, in the comic that he wants to be the

2505
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:36,700
white lion pirates?

2506
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:37,860
Yeah, that's what he says.

2507
02:55:37,860 --> 02:55:38,860
Like.

2508
02:55:38,860 --> 02:55:39,860
Yeah.

2509
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:43,580
Cause like, cause like we talked about, like in, I mean, the real conversation was longer

2510
02:55:43,580 --> 02:55:47,460
than what's depicted in the comic and like we talked about one piece and like he did

2511
02:55:47,460 --> 02:55:51,060
at some, I did ask him if he liked one piece and he did basically tell me that he's a huge

2512
02:55:51,060 --> 02:55:55,180
one piece fan and you know, obviously that's where his like thing about making a family

2513
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:57,140
and sailing the seas came from.

2514
02:55:57,140 --> 02:56:04,100
I think in the comic you gave him a tattoo though of a white lion thing.

2515
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:05,820
I, no.

2516
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:06,820
I don't think so.

2517
02:56:06,820 --> 02:56:11,780
At the end I show like a flag that like is like, this is what the flag might have looked

2518
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:12,780
like.

2519
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:13,780
Hold on.

2520
02:56:13,780 --> 02:56:20,580
I have to go look now cause I'm wondering why I, if I remember that wrong, it's StComics.

2521
02:56:20,580 --> 02:56:21,580
StComics.com.

2522
02:56:21,580 --> 02:56:22,580
Patreon.com.

2523
02:56:22,580 --> 02:56:29,140
Anybody who wasn't clear on what you need to do, you need to type StComics with an X

2524
02:56:29,140 --> 02:56:31,140
C-O-M-I-X.

2525
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:33,820
You can type it with a C-S and it will correct itself.

2526
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:34,820
Oh, wow.

2527
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:35,820
That's cool.

2528
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:36,940
Fancy, right?

2529
02:56:36,940 --> 02:56:40,660
Yeah, he's got a one piece tattoo on his leg.

2530
02:56:40,660 --> 02:56:42,460
It's like the Jolly Roger.

2531
02:56:42,460 --> 02:56:45,140
Oh, you're right.

2532
02:56:45,140 --> 02:56:46,140
I forgot.

2533
02:56:46,140 --> 02:56:48,980
And I don't think he, I don't think he really had one.

2534
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:49,980
Oh, yes.

2535
02:56:49,980 --> 02:56:50,980
I remember.

2536
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:54,740
Yeah, he didn't really have that, but I didn't want to go and like have us have like a whole

2537
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:56,300
conversation about it.

2538
02:56:56,300 --> 02:56:59,460
So I thought I would just give him that one piece tattoo to make it really obvious that

2539
02:56:59,460 --> 02:57:00,820
he's a one piece fan.

2540
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:05,900
Which is a great idea, but I gave me pause to be like, wait, you really met a random

2541
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:11,660
guy who had a one piece tattoo, you know, like I was surprised to learn that.

2542
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:17,100
I mean, it's still surprising even the true story that he wanted to fucking live the pirate

2543
02:57:17,100 --> 02:57:18,100
life.

2544
02:57:18,100 --> 02:57:21,900
Like that's still fucking amazing to me.

2545
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:26,340
Well he was a big fan and he had tattoos, so I don't think I didn't stretch the reality

2546
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:29,580
too much when I did that.

2547
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:31,500
It's still basically the same idea.

2548
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:37,300
Oh man, this scene of us walking up the stairs out of the subway just looks fucking great.

2549
02:57:37,300 --> 02:57:38,300
So dingy.

2550
02:57:38,300 --> 02:57:43,580
Yeah, I love how like the art style for that is very different from your current stuff,

2551
02:57:43,580 --> 02:57:45,300
but I also really like it too.

2552
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:54,220
Like I like that well, like this was, this was when I was in the grip of my of Bakuman

2553
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:58,140
and was like determined that I should be a traditional manga guy and draw everything

2554
02:57:58,140 --> 02:58:01,140
traditionally with, you know, pens.

2555
02:58:01,140 --> 02:58:06,500
So yeah, I did these with, I don't think I used a nib pen because I was like too terrified

2556
02:58:06,500 --> 02:58:11,900
of like dripping ink because it had happened many times before and I can't control it.

2557
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:16,820
So yeah, this, I did these with micron pens, which are like, I don't know, stupid.

2558
02:58:16,820 --> 02:58:20,940
I can't remember if I said this to you at the time that this came out, but like it actually

2559
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:25,980
reminded me of a style that like when there was a brief period that I wanted to try to

2560
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:32,740
draw comics, like I was just because I always draw in just pens, like not like artist pens,

2561
02:58:32,740 --> 02:58:35,140
just regular pens.

2562
02:58:35,140 --> 02:58:37,380
And I had like like fountain pens and stuff.

2563
02:58:37,380 --> 02:58:42,340
And I just wanted to like draw a story about like someone going underground and like exploiting

2564
02:58:42,340 --> 02:58:43,500
this underground society.

2565
02:58:43,500 --> 02:58:49,500
So almost everything was just like blackened pen ink, like just whole pages of just black

2566
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:53,820
with like barely any white space, you know.

2567
02:58:53,820 --> 02:58:54,820
Is that the same as show?

2568
02:58:54,820 --> 02:58:56,540
No, totally different.

2569
02:58:56,540 --> 02:58:58,260
This was like way before.

2570
02:58:58,260 --> 02:59:02,460
Totally different story about digging into the ground and finding an underground civilization.

2571
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:03,460
This one wasn't about digging down.

2572
02:59:03,460 --> 02:59:07,620
This one was just like, I think actually the main character went down into like a pond

2573
02:59:07,620 --> 02:59:12,620
and like he kept going deeper underwater and then eventually was in an underground city

2574
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:13,620
kind of thing.

2575
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:14,620
Like, I don't know.

2576
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:17,460
I'm really fascinated with the idea of underground cities.

2577
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:23,740
So like, I'm a big fan of the concept, but I don't think I've ever heard you talk about

2578
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:25,660
underground cities before.

2579
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:27,660
I mean, I've heard you talk about like sci-fi dystopias.

2580
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:28,660
I don't talk much.

2581
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:33,300
I've only got into sci-fi in the last three years, like, or four years after playing Mass

2582
02:59:33,300 --> 02:59:34,300
Effect.

2583
02:59:34,300 --> 02:59:40,860
Like, back when I was trying to write my own stuff, like the style that I was into was

2584
02:59:40,860 --> 02:59:42,340
totally different.

2585
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:50,020
And like, I'm really into like, I'm really into like dense urban cities and like any

2586
02:59:50,020 --> 02:59:53,260
kind of weird hidden like village place.

2587
02:59:53,780 --> 02:59:57,860
Like if there was like a village in the trees or a village underground, like those kind

2588
02:59:57,860 --> 03:00:03,540
of things where it's like, I like the idea of stumbling into something much bigger because

2589
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:08,300
I like to think that the world is super, super dense with shit.

2590
03:00:08,300 --> 03:00:14,700
Like, this is kind of, I know this is supposed to be an interview with you, but to get into

2591
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:21,820
a little story of when I was like 18 or 17, I graduated high school and my uncle like

2592
03:00:21,860 --> 03:00:28,140
sent me, he sent me a book on bicycling and like this, this whole note, like this letter

2593
03:00:28,140 --> 03:00:33,860
he wrote about how like, I should go out and like bike around the country and see the world

2594
03:00:33,860 --> 03:00:39,100
and not be cooped up in my room and all this stuff, you know, like, essentially projecting

2595
03:00:39,100 --> 03:00:43,980
his own regrets about when he was my age, odd to be kind of thing, you know, but the

2596
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:49,180
guy, this uncle doesn't really know me that well, like he hadn't been spoken a lot.

2597
03:00:49,220 --> 03:00:50,420
So it's kind of out of nowhere.

2598
03:00:51,220 --> 03:00:58,060
And the way I thought about it at the time is I'm not like discontent to, to have not

2599
03:00:58,060 --> 03:00:59,820
seen a whole lot of the world.

2600
03:00:59,860 --> 03:01:04,220
Like, I think a lot of people feel like they have this really limited perspective because

2601
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:05,340
they've been in one place.

2602
03:01:05,540 --> 03:01:09,860
But for me, I'm like, I'm interested in like the little details of places.

2603
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:16,580
Like I can go to like some like random place in town that I haven't been to before.

2604
03:01:16,580 --> 03:01:20,460
And like the fact that there's a dumpster I didn't know about will like blow my mind,

2605
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:26,980
you know, so I, I've always imagined like writing stories about like a version of

2606
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:31,980
Virginia Beach where there's way more going on than what seems to be the case, you know,

2607
03:01:31,980 --> 03:01:38,620
so like, like that, like this random, like, yeah, I mean, that was a huge influence on

2608
03:01:38,620 --> 03:01:44,500
me was like, and all the stories of that nature, like all the early light novels were

2609
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:45,940
huge influence on me.

2610
03:01:45,980 --> 03:01:51,180
But like, um, it would, it would be partly like do not at all where it's like, you're

2611
03:01:51,180 --> 03:01:58,900
in the city and, um, I wanted to present both the idea that the stuff we do know about is

2612
03:01:58,900 --> 03:02:01,460
more interesting than people realize like that.

2613
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:07,580
I feel like, like this, people have told me that I should talk more about my life.

2614
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:10,780
And like, I, I don't find it interesting at all.

2615
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:14,740
But like, I know that other, other people can find my stories interesting because they

2616
03:02:14,740 --> 03:02:15,260
don't know them.

2617
03:02:15,260 --> 03:02:16,580
Like to them, it's not old news.

2618
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:19,260
To me, it's all old news, which is why I, I don't know.

2619
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:22,860
I'm not usually inclined to, to bring it up, but I don't know.

2620
03:02:23,860 --> 03:02:33,260
Um, but yeah, I, I just, uh, I, I don't remember why, what I was talking about or why

2621
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:35,020
you, that was a weird interruption.

2622
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:40,460
You were talking about throughout what I was, yeah, it was, I have to, I really got to

2623
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:42,180
apologize for that bullshit.

2624
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:48,060
Um, you were talking about Dara Dara and the, and the idea of a Virginia beach that's

2625
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:54,580
more, the idea that like, you could turn over a rock and fall down a hole and it turns

2626
03:02:54,580 --> 03:02:57,580
out that there's this whole other thing going on.

2627
03:02:57,580 --> 03:03:02,740
That's like as deep and dense as what you thought your society was.

2628
03:03:03,140 --> 03:03:08,260
Um, but you didn't even know it was there, you know, but then at the same time to, cause

2629
03:03:08,260 --> 03:03:12,980
I feel like there's a lot of stories where it's like, uh, this town is boring and then

2630
03:03:12,980 --> 03:03:15,060
you find out there's a secret society.

2631
03:03:15,100 --> 03:03:16,620
Oh, it turns out this town's interesting.

2632
03:03:16,660 --> 03:03:19,860
I wanted to present it like this town is already interesting.

2633
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:23,260
And then also there's this whole other big thing going on.

2634
03:03:23,260 --> 03:03:25,340
Like, like there's just so much.

2635
03:03:25,340 --> 03:03:29,740
Like I wanted it to be as much stuff going on in one small area as possible.

2636
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:32,380
And so like a lot of my older stories are like that.

2637
03:03:32,380 --> 03:03:37,220
They're always like about a city or about like a place where there's just so much

2638
03:03:37,220 --> 03:03:38,140
shit going on.

2639
03:03:40,420 --> 03:03:44,500
I wrote some, uh, I wrote some erotic Pokemon fanfiction one time.

2640
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:52,580
Yeah, I, um, I think we were, we were talking about this in the chat and I

2641
03:03:52,580 --> 03:03:56,420
remembered that I had written this thing like in high school and I went and I

2642
03:03:56,420 --> 03:04:00,300
looked it up and like it's still floating around there, getting, getting

2643
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:03,180
reviews every now and then on, it's on like a couple of different sites.

2644
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:06,540
I wish that was still true of my old Tales of Symphonia erotica.

2645
03:04:07,420 --> 03:04:09,780
But it's, it's all lost to the fucking void.

2646
03:04:11,700 --> 03:04:17,460
Yeah, it's, uh, I would say no more about that.

2647
03:04:20,060 --> 03:04:20,540
All right.

2648
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:23,020
We've been doing this podcast for over three hours.

2649
03:04:23,260 --> 03:04:24,500
I think we should wrap it up.

2650
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:25,340
Oh fuck.

2651
03:04:26,500 --> 03:04:28,380
Um, oh God.

2652
03:04:28,380 --> 03:04:29,900
No, there's so much more to say.

2653
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:36,940
Uh, well, let me just make the note on the subject of getting faster, that

2654
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:43,340
these five pages of, of White Lion took me like a month, uh, back when I, yeah,

2655
03:04:43,340 --> 03:04:47,340
they, they took me so, I mean, it was a combination of not having an audience and

2656
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:52,100
therefore not having any motivation combined with having no confidence,

2657
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:57,300
especially in like the tools I was using because these fucking pens are a piece

2658
03:04:57,300 --> 03:05:00,420
of shit, fucking ink, physical media.

2659
03:05:00,700 --> 03:05:01,260
I hate it.

2660
03:05:02,380 --> 03:05:04,060
I'm totally, I'm totally digital now.

2661
03:05:04,060 --> 03:05:05,860
I'm so much better, I'm so much better with digital.

2662
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:06,460
It's insane.

2663
03:05:06,460 --> 03:05:09,260
Like I tried to sketch something with a pencil and it's garbage.

2664
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:12,580
Uh, my tablet is where it's at.

2665
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:13,860
Yes.

2666
03:05:13,860 --> 03:05:15,540
I just wanted to make a note of that.

2667
03:05:15,860 --> 03:05:18,300
Was there any other notes you wanted to make before we wrap up?

2668
03:05:20,020 --> 03:05:21,340
And if people should know.

2669
03:05:21,700 --> 03:05:24,980
Patreon, patreon.com slash Ben St.

2670
03:05:26,020 --> 03:05:26,380
All right.

2671
03:05:26,380 --> 03:05:32,700
Well, now, uh, you know, you have a solid little, uh, artist bio podcast out there

2672
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:36,940
that if anybody wants to know more about Ben St's art or like who he is as a

2673
03:05:36,940 --> 03:05:40,380
person, you can link them this, maybe get a little insight.

2674
03:05:40,580 --> 03:05:40,900
Yes.

2675
03:05:40,900 --> 03:05:46,420
Finally, I'll probably, I'll probably link this on as a patron, as a Patreon

2676
03:05:46,420 --> 03:05:48,940
post, but like a public one that everyone can see.

2677
03:05:48,940 --> 03:05:49,620
You know, it's funny.

2678
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:53,940
I think most people love interviews with their favorite artists.

2679
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:58,540
I doubt almost anybody gets one this fucking long because I'm the only guy who

2680
03:05:58,540 --> 03:06:01,180
would do a three hour interview with somebody.

2681
03:06:02,100 --> 03:06:05,500
This is, this is, this is a very didgy thing to do.

2682
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:09,980
Just like, Hey, here's someone that doesn't, hasn't said very much.

2683
03:06:09,980 --> 03:06:13,260
Let's just delve as deep into them as possible.

2684
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:14,220
But I appreciate it.

2685
03:06:14,220 --> 03:06:18,540
I've been looking for a whole, um, back when I was trying to do a magazine, this

2686
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:21,020
is related to what I was just describing about Virginia Beach.

2687
03:06:21,020 --> 03:06:24,660
I had a magazine I was trying to write called the Virginia Beach Hermit Society

2688
03:06:24,940 --> 03:06:29,060
where it was basically a magazine about the town and like half the stories

2689
03:06:29,060 --> 03:06:31,420
would be real and half would be fictional kind of thing.

2690
03:06:31,980 --> 03:06:36,260
Um, and I had a section called interviews with friends where it was literally

2691
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:40,700
just me interviewing my friends who are not creative or anything or doing anything.

2692
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:42,620
It's just like, what are you up to?

2693
03:06:42,620 --> 03:06:45,900
And like, what are you up to?

2694
03:06:46,180 --> 03:06:52,180
John, pretty much an interview with an interview with Steve, an afternoon.

2695
03:06:52,180 --> 03:06:55,220
And Steve, this is like the far extreme version of that.

2696
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:59,420
Uh, all right, thanks for listening, everybody.

2697
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:01,540
Go, uh, give Ben St.

2698
03:07:01,540 --> 03:07:06,500
Money on Patreon so that he can make comics faster and better.

2699
03:07:06,780 --> 03:07:09,620
I'm in, I'm in financial free fall.

2700
03:07:09,620 --> 03:07:11,780
Woo. Save his, save his life.

2701
03:07:11,780 --> 03:07:17,780
And if you have money to spare, save my life and that's it.

2702
03:07:18,860 --> 03:07:22,780
I'm like, I'm like, just picture me like, picture me like a shield night

2703
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:24,900
and you're, and you're like Shovel Knight.

2704
03:07:24,940 --> 03:07:28,340
Like by, by giving me, by patroning me, you're like Shovel Knight.

2705
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:31,020
Just like leaving catch to grasp me.

2706
03:07:32,420 --> 03:07:34,820
Catch him, please.

2707
03:07:34,820 --> 03:07:37,820
All right, that's all.

2708
03:07:37,820 --> 03:07:39,140
Good night, everybody.
