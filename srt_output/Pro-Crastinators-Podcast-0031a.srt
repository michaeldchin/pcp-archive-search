1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm this far from the mic, and I'm this far from the mic.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm very close to my mic.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And I'm this far from the mic.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm here.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And we are...

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
These far as from the mic.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I actually said that the way Mumkey does at the end of all his let's plays, he always says,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we're...

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yay!

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I didn't hear it.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to a new Pro Crastinators Podcast.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This one's at 360 degrees.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I guess we should all look at the thing, right?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's the audience in a while.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see that my zoom is right in front of my face here.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, I'll try to adjust it a little bit.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, let's see what we can do here.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Ben, despite what he may say, Ben doesn't enjoy a ride in his face every once in a while.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Alright, maybe like this.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't know what to do. What do you want from me?

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, Ben, you're visible. Yeah, you're good.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, but now it's completely mitigated the benefits of it being on a switch.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Benefits.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Look, audience, you've never seen a 360 video before.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Click the screen with the mouse dragging around or use the lesson key.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And look around and watch us like you're really there.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why don't you just hand them some fucking training wheels while you're at it?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
These fucking simpletons.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We can't figure out what the giant fucking arrows on both sides of the screen mean.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Alright, we don't have a topic, but we have a 360 degree video.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's what it's really meant.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We've got visuals instead of a topic, which is even better.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, it's a splash over substance. Everyone knows it's the best way to go.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's what I'm known for, I think.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, something like that.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We've got Victor playing Bloodborne.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
To represent what the audience should be doing when watching the CBC.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That is an impressive shot.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you move the camera, you can look at what we're talking about hopefully.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is a podcast and a list.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We all decided Victor's game was more interesting than each other.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The idea here was to have the ideal viewer being demonstrated for the audience to observe.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is what you should be doing when listening to PCP.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You should be on a game playing Bloodborne specifically.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Two questions. One, should this just be a multi-topic general PCP

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
where we go through whatever we feel like talking about?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're trying to decide on a topic for like an hour now.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We can't do it, so we should give up.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Should this become a...

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Jesse gets up with that microphone and cuts an epic promo on all the things making him mad in 360.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, maybe.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Jesse is no more. You can call me microphone Jones.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have no true identity.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No one can see my true visage.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I thought for sure you were going to say you were broken.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Broken Jesse, yeah.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I like microphone Jones better anyway.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Microphone Jones.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Microphone Jones has put one facet of the vessel that is now called broken Jesse.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's very great that he's wrapped up in a winged approved blanket.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's very interesting.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know which fucking knot it is on that thing.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I've seen it somewhere.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, Jesse's closer. He should do it.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But his nose is like an all-new level if I do say so myself.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That is...

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, God.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It looks okay from the front, but that doesn't look okay at all.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know, 360 videos are cool because they're like turning videos into video games, basically.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's crazy to watch them.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I use this point extensively in my video thoughts on 360 videos.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The first time I watched a 360 video, I'm like, I'm in a Valve game, you know?

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, we complain about that. Well, I complain about that.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is now the time to hear our grievances about Portal 2?

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Long last? No.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Whoa, we never did that one.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We have grievances about Portal 2?

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We never did the Portal 2.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Some, yes.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I mean, there was a heated debate over whether Portal 2 was as good as Portal 1.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Portal 2 is better than Portal 2.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, my friend.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I say Portal 1 and Portal 2 are like completely just as good.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Not even close.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Portal 1, Portal 2 has more stuff and if the Portal 1 is more pure because it was the original.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And all about pure.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let me air my long-standing grievance that I've never resolved that all of you don't

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
think that being original is worth more than being good, but it absolutely is.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, that's a good topic.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're already kind of resolved that one.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think we kind of agree, you and I, a bit on that.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, I'm the only one.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, because like...

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm the only one who's pure.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, okay.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, wait, maybe we did.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I mean, we did argue about that, things we can't get into.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How is Portal 2 not original?

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
She turns into a fucking potato, you dolt.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's because it's Portal 2.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You know what?

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Think about it, think about it.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm too aggressive of a note.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We're not adults.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, how about this?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I take it back.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Originality has more value than...

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He's like a good gentleman.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He's a nice guy.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right, let's check it out.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Originality has more value per pound than references and callbacks and like cultural appropriation.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's say that.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wow, I could totally agree with that.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, but I think that appropriation references, remixes are like more easy to come by.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And therefore they comprise more of a diet.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I felt like last time this came up, no one even acknowledged to me that originality had inherent value in that.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No, we did.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I said that.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's not how I remember it.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I said it has inherent value, but also that like if the next thing that comes along iterates on it and makes it a better version.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, and it's a better product.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you stipulate that it's better, then sure, it's better.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, yeah.

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you build on it and that makes your argument better.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's now better.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I guess because...

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can agree that if it's better.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I just made a video recently that like has a lot of references to other things.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Some references are like really specific and I'm really glad about that.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Then some references are like kind of a general, like I'm referencing it through.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wait, you talk about the one, the 20 minute one about action scenes.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, no, I'm talking about...

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We tried to watch it through that.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You don't understand what the fuck you were talking about.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Couldn't make it.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Couldn't make it.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It was very confusing.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My side channel is not really for consumption at all.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're just going to walk around your own room now and you do Davugos to sound?

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyway, like I was...

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm talking about the Radcon trailer I made.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's got some references to like specific things and it's got some references to like general tropes.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And it's got like one or two jokes in the night thing or like a regional that like don't come into place.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So they can just pay us to our conversations.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The audio is not going to work like that.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know what you mean, dude.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a 360 video.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They turn it towards us.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, unfortunately, I would love that.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wouldn't it work that way?

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That would be pretty cool.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you only heard which direction.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I really wanted to become like a choose your own adventure style thing.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But the only problem is you can't do audio that way.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But like I want it to be that whichever direction you look in, it'll like continue the video.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wait, wait, wait.

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What were you saying?

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Speaking of choose your own adventure, I want to give everyone a game to play.

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Can you spot the hippo in the room?

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's around here somewhere.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, not you people.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You guys know.

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm talking about him.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, don't look.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He's ruining it.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's around.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's like a touch of the corner.

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know which way the camera starts.

174
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The camera's in every direction.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, their view field does not see every direction.

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It sees one direction until they change it.

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's my point.

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I only see one direction.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
One direction is the grand final.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We're talking about how Action Giraffe is the greatest original character of all time.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is Hamony's my best friend and he has AIDS in that order before.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait, and here's another best friend, Hippocrite.

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All of a sudden your sunglasses look is freaking me out.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Suddenly.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well you're going to have to deal with it.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're suddenly a creature to me and it feels real and it's like fucking me.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do I remind anyone else of the channelers from Dark Souls?

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because that's what I'm going for.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What the fuck, no.

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They have three sets of eyes, like you know.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well you have a fourth.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have like a fifth now I think.

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
One, two, three, four.

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There's five here somewhere.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I really think there's another one.

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh wow, there's another one layered behind the blue one.

197
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, that's right.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I really think that Hippo and Action Giraffe need to meet and befriend TJ Henry Yoshi.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh my god.

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, well can anyone really befriend a man of that low caliber?

201
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There are also animals that wear sunglasses.

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well Hippo doesn't usually wear sunglasses.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Guys, watch on your 3D camera.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Watch the perfect spiral you can make with Hippo when you throw them.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Here he goes.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Some depictions show him with the shutter shades,

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
but others give him the visor that that character from Ace Attorney has.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Right, yeah.

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Some theorize that that's what's meant to be going on there.

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's the greatest meme of our generation.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
TJ Henry Yoshi.

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's cool that we have all this stuff set up and then it's potentially recording properly.

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, well said.

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Isn't that neat?

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We could only pray.

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, we could only pray and have like a thing to talk about.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well let me resolve what I was saying a minute ago.

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The point is, I think I was slightly more proud of the mostly original jokes

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that kind of are like their own thing.

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Slightly more than the references.

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Absolutely.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Any reasonable person would be.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, but the references were more voluminous.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you talking about?

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What references?

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The trailer.

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The newest trailer for Radcon.

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, I thought we were still talking about Portal.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No.

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now we get back into Portal, right?

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
With the fact that Portal 1 has this portaling.

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And it's like, oh my gosh, why did I never...

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Portal 1 is a fucking tech demo.

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For the Masterpiece Game 2 budget.

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Objectively false.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Objectively true.

237
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's perfect.

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Here's my impression of Portal 1.

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, I'm a bunch of white rooms.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The end.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Wow.

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What a fucking...

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Portal 2 is a fucking case study in how to add extra bullshit that wastes your time

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
into a game.

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Like levels?

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Extra bullshit.

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It is not all great.

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like a story.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Like the backstory to how GLaDOS got her voice was really a wonderful addition.

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, it's not.

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's cool.

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why is it not cool?

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because it's not cool.

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You have to tell me why it is cool.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It doesn't work the other way around.

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Your people are really...

257
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You're getting on microphone Jones' bad side.

258
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't want to know what kind of a temper microphone Jones has and you really need

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
him to go in.

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When I first watched the Matthew Matosis video where he complained about that, I'm like,

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
okay, yeah, that's...

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't pretend like I hold the thing that's...

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the original opinion.

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Shit.

265
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, it's like...

266
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's one of those things where if you look at all the things that you've classified that

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
constitutes good storytelling, it's like, I guess it doesn't do them.

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But when I was playing the game, I didn't mind.

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It was just sort of like...

270
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's literally turning your brain off.

271
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mr. Jones, I want to defend Matthew Matosis, but he hasn't released a video in like a year,

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
so it's whatever.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You throw him out with a bath water.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, put him in the fucking garbage.

275
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I have a defense, so by the way.

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, it doesn't.

278
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
One of the two things he said, which is that...

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh yeah, sing it.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can't.

281
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No one can sing it.

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My fucking defense!

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You deserve to hear me sing it.

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He said, GLaDOS was a real character.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Now he's a real character.

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, thank you.

287
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You've got feet, eyes, no ears, buddy.

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's the worst opinion I've ever heard.

289
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What's the worst opinion?

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
GLaDOS was a meme character to begin with.

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's not true.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What was the depth of GLaDOS' character in the first game?

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
First of all, she's an AI.

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She doesn't need a complex or deep motivation.

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
GLaDOS in the first game is very funny and very unique the first time you see it,

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
but then after you play the game once and you play it again, all the jokes are old.

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh yeah, so what we needed was Portal 2 where they shove her in your face more.

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, that was so much better.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now she has some emotional depth.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Now she's got a tragic backstory that we can all relate to.

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It wasn't even tragic.

302
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Her backstory has nothing to do with the person that she was made by.

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, you guys are just being a bunch of fucking snobs and cynics.

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Of course it's better that she had a tragic dog.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's not a real criticism.

306
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're just saying shit because it sounds cool.

307
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
She's way less compelling this way than she was as just a rogue AI.

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

309
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Who's really compelling about a fucking AI?

310
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There is some kind of wicked compelling because I was fucking compelled when I played Portal 2.

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I was born with Portal 2 which is better than the greatest game of all time.

312
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wow.

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I've never played any of the Portal games.

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not joking.

315
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Get out of here Donnie bro.

316
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Half-Life 3 is my favorite Portal game.

317
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now, to stop talking about superficial elements like story, I have a level design.

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I hope that doesn't mean.

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There's more levels in Portal 2.

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The levels are more intricate in Portal 2.

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And they have more depth.

322
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There's more depth.

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The levels are bigger and there's more going on.

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's more depth.

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Bigger doesn't mean better.

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
In Portal 1.

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But deeper does mean better.

328
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And it's not deeper.

329
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Here's what it is.

330
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Some of them are deeper.

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The first time I played Portal 1, I was like, this, I was like, I can't believe it.

332
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All my life I've seen cartoons where people go through portals but it's just a bunch of blue swirls.

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This has the idea that you can see what's going through the portal when you're seeing it.

334
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's so revolutionary.

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Every show that has Portal is now sucked in comparison.

336
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But you only got that traditional revelation.

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Here's what it is.

338
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When I first played Portal 1, I thought this game is genius.

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But then when I played Portal 2, I thought I am a genius for beating these incredible levels.

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The puzzles were literally harder in Portal 1.

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The puzzles were so deep and had so much to do and they were so multi-layered that I really got a lot of satisfaction.

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There was so much easier in Portal 2.

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I didn't get as much out of that aspect of it.

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

346
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
When watching other people play it, there were like many puzzles.

347
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The first one I was super stuck on.

348
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
When you see someone else play a game that you've played or you see Person A and you see Person B play it,

349
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and you see how they're better or worse at different parts, Portal 2 for me was the ultimate experience of that.

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Because I played it and I saw like two different or three different people play it.

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
When I first played Portal 1, I really felt like it was not good and it didn't get good until Portal 2.

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're lying.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're telling me lies.

354
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What the fuck?

355
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't believe you.

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's all you really want to say.

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Portal 1 is a boring two-hour piece of shit.

358
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
All you do is solve the same puzzle over and over again in the same room over and over again.

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Portal 2 has a story, it has levels, it has better everything.

360
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're out of line, Microphone Jones.

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I can't take you seriously anymore, Microphone Jones.

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Microphone Jones is unleashed and out of control.

363
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know what? I think, you know, I said that I thought you were both the same.

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The only argument you really need is that Portal 2 is objectively deeper.

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's literally more mechanics.

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You literally go deeper into the game.

367
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Right, okay, but that's the thing though.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It less thoroughly explores each of those mechanics than Portal 1 does.

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Therefore, it is a less perfect version of the video games.

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I played through Portal 2 in the...

371
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I played through Portal 2 Co-op and Portal 2 Co-op.

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Portal 2 Co-op's great.

373
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Portal 2 Co-op has an entirely new dimension which is that there's four active portals at once

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and they've got all the new mechanics with all the different kinds of goods.

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's amazing.

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, and by the way, custom levels.

377
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yo, I made a custom level.

378
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I love the one custom level I made in Portal 2.

379
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I was back when we started...

380
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Did you see this earlier?

381
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, I know.

382
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, how the heck else am I supposed to get everyone's attention?

383
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They're back when we started talking.

384
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You just go, hey!

385
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Boom.

386
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And then you start talking.

387
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay.

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, here's the thing.

389
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Portal...

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I know, this is bad.

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The central mechanic of Portal is the portals which is thoroughly...

392
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
In Portal 1, in Portal 2, they do all these extra additions around the portals which are

393
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
not as good.

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, like a super good game of story.

395
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And GLaDOS being way cooler.

396
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh my god.

397
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, Bentley is so cool.

398
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He's got the voice of characters that have heard of a million other places.

399
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He doesn't even sound like a robot.

400
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What a great idea for a character.

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
My point, he sounds like a human not a robot.

403
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Can you, can you, Wheely?

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Whatever, yeah.

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What did I say?

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Bentley Bear?

407
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Bentley Farm for Bentley.

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's what I'm talking about.

409
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's what I'm talking about.

410
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, that's right.

411
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
In Portal 1, the thing that makes GLaDOS great is that like, is the, is the, is just the

412
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
fact that she comes off like a, like a robot at first and you slowly realize how many like

413
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
weird personality traits she has.

414
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's what makes her funny and awesome.

415
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I guess so.

416
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She's pretty consistent though.

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, let's agree to disagree on Portal 1.

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Talk about how shitty Bloodborne is because I genuinely hate this game and it's high times

419
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
when I'm not going to play this game.

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No, man.

421
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bloodborne's a good shame.

422
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We'll possibly say negatively about this game.

423
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then he can't beat the final boss.

424
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That would be a big problem with the game, right?

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, and that color palette is too consistent.

426
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's my biggest complaint.

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You've fought Garmin like four times anyway.

428
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I fought him twice and I fucking got tired.

429
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Well, whose problem is that?

430
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That sounds like a personal issue.

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No, you know why this game is fucking annoying?

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why?

433
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Okay, it's designed to be hard, which is fine.

434
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
All the Souls games are designed to be hard.

435
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But in all the Souls games, you don't have to fucking grind for 20 minutes every time you

436
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
die.

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You get more fucking Bloodborne.

438
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You actually do have to do that.

439
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This game is a piece of shit.

440
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Remember when you were a promising young man and you made a Demon Souls review, which

441
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
has the exact same need to grind in it, but you beat that game.

442
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You don't need to grind in Demon Souls.

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You fucking ruined it.

444
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You have to grind in your fucking world on one.

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You have to do it.

446
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're a supering child.

447
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You peasant.

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You fucking brother.

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You are only mule.

450
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, you are absolutely mule.

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Absolute mule.

452
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Absolute.

453
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm going to delete you, Jesse.

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What I did was I just grinded it up like 150 vials at the beginning and then never had

456
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to do it again.

457
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I really am surprised by that because I had to farm many times.

458
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What's the problem with grinding when just playing the game normally is awesome.

459
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You could just be running around in a circle, killing the same enemy over and over again,

460
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
having the time of your life.

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's an amazing game.

462
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
How can you look at this game and not think it's amazing?

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's like shit to the game.

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's like a game like an arc, like a Final Fantasy.

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Grinding is fun because you level up in your stat scope and you're always dealing slightly

466
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
more damage.

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's not how it is in Bloodborne where you do literally the same thing over and over

468
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
again.

469
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So the grinding is less fun in Bloodborne for me?

470
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Completely.

471
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I'm a grinding connoisseur.

472
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because pressing the R button is the most fun thing in the entire world of gaming in

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Bloodborne.

474
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And you know, I got to say, if I had to name, if you asked me like top 10 moments in all

475
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
video gaming, I would say pressing the R2 button to completion in Bloodborne.

476
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Dude, we should do completion.

477
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I hear you laugh.

478
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Two-handed.

479
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Two-handed.

480
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hold R2 all the way.

481
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh yeah, that's how you call it.

482
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then ka-ching!

483
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But blam!

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Most satisfying moment in video gaming history.

485
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah, that's how you, you call it two-handing.

486
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And me and my brother always call it double fisting.

487
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's the only term I use for fisting.

488
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, I'm still, I'm still thinking about it.

489
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's like, okay.

490
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, I don't know.

491
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't want to talk about video games.

492
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I hate all of them.

493
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't care about Portal.

494
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Man, no.

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's talk about the video games.

496
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's talk about the video games.

497
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Nobody likes us because we're a bunch of gamer boys.

498
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They like us because we're a bunch of psychotic, imbecilic, idiot assholes

499
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
who scream at each other about fucking how big our wings are.

500
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's true.

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
My ween.

502
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Are you guys seeing my ween?

503
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh wait, wait, guys.

504
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Check out my new shoes.

505
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Check out these new shoes, dawg.

506
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Look at these suede shoes.

507
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Brown sand shoes.

508
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
From every angle.

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is just the everybody attempts at another topic

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and gets shut down by everyone else's podcast.

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Let's talk about shoes and how cool they are.

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
They are cool.

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They are cool.

514
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They are cool.

515
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
All right.

516
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We can agree on that.

517
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ask Nate about his shoes and he'll tuck your dick too.

518
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll tell you.

519
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll suck your dick.

520
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I wore these flip-flops sitting in the Philippines.

521
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Wow.

522
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They're all really issues.

523
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They are falling apart.

524
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You should be the main man in a bed like that.

525
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I thought you shared fun all the time.

526
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But life doesn't always work out the way it should.

527
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I need to be conscious of the fact that whoever's listening to this

528
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
is only listening to one audio track.

529
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Because Jesse certainly won't.

530
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Neither will I.

531
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't listen to any of our podcasts.

532
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I unsubscribed from the Procrastination the other day.

533
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can't blame you.

534
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I've had any secure with all of these goons.

535
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Time to move on.

536
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But unfortunately I moved on in the direction of his house.

537
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wait.

538
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I take back that.

539
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why would anyone be subscribed?

540
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Because I hate that shitty meme.

541
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And nobody should say shit.

542
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hey, wait.

543
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Let's talk about the sweet PCP trailers that have been coming out.

544
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah.

545
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's talk about...

546
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
First there was the Kaon opening.

547
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, yeah.

548
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And then there was the Davoo...

549
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It was the Davoo PCP...

550
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The Red Count Trailer.

551
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The Red Count Trailer.

552
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They...

553
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know.

554
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They bloomed large in my personal consciousness.

555
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Do you remember the person who made the Kaon ones?

556
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So we can shout them out and tell them how cool they are?

557
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I forget their name.

558
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
His name was Endless Jack.

559
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It was the coming YouTube hero.

560
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey, it's the Gibbo.

561
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Gibbo, while you've been walking around, have you been saying anything?

562
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Uh...

563
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Your audio is still going on in our audio, right?

565
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't know what you mean.

566
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Also, your laptop...

567
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Is it recording even?

568
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Disconcerted.

569
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay, well, whatever.

570
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's going to be God's word.

571
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We have no idea what moments might have just...

572
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You know what's been captured, budget?

573
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ha ha ha ha.

574
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Like, in the background of the audio.

575
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Not in the background of the audio.

576
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Overpowering the rest of us.

577
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's probably the way it should be.

578
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's probably for the best.

579
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's a secret.

580
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
To everybody.

581
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I have a suggestion to give to all the camera-designing people.

582
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because I was thinking, the next level after this is a podcast where you hit arrow keys

583
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
to move the camera angle around.

584
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But how could that be filmed?

585
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Drums?

586
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What?

587
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
360 Drums.

588
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But that would only work with live footage.

589
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Here's how you do it.

590
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know, strip lights in a theater that line the...

591
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Imagine instead of a little light that you have on the steps.

592
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Every light instead of being a light, it's a little lens.

593
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's how they film the matrix, the 3D scenes.

594
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, something like that.

595
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But it's like a stringy.

596
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And you can tape it up along the wall and record your whole house simultaneously.

597
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And use the lassoed here.

598
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You say simultaneously really fucking weird.

599
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's like the 10th time I've noticed that.

600
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Microphone!

601
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You know that's a reference to the time cube, right?

602
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The what in the whole thing?

603
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, that's right.

604
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The time cube guy.

605
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah.

606
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How can a box have six sides when it's the front, the back, the left, and the right?

607
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Those are the sides.

608
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
How can you get off the bottom on the sides?

609
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Is this one of those memes that you guys have?

610
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You said before, the first stage is fewer than a quarter of a minute video.

611
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, time cube is fewer.

612
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Also, time cube...

613
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Also, this proves God, because God, you know, in some places he's just one guy.

614
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But in some times he's three.

615
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He's three in one.

616
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's not four.

617
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You know, it's only three.

618
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The time cube is this old psychopath who was on G4 in like 2005, and he was explaining

619
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,500
the time cube that the Earth is broken up into four quadrants, and each one is actually

620
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,000
experiencing the same time, but it's a difference.

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

622
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But it all happened simultaneously.

623
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And he's got these shiny white fake teeth.

624
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Are you talking straight guys?

625
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No.

626
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You guys actually watch this right now, and it would totally show up on the 360 video,

627
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and they'd be able to watch the video.

628
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's give it a try.

629
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's experiment and do it.

630
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We're going to progress the media.

631
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh my God, is this going to become like a mystery science thing with us watching shit,

632
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and that's a great idea.

633
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I want that.

634
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That would be so bad.

635
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
By the way, the K-On! opening was by Doon Coon.

636
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Doon Coon.

637
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Thanks, Doon.

638
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thanks for coming out.

639
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This is going to be a podcast.

640
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm going to get a reaction video all at once, because you can look around on it.

641
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And it's a secret time cube.

642
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Just start time cube, and it'll be the amount of time you give and take, I guess.

643
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
People, I apologize for this.

644
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I apologize for me and for my friends.

645
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We're all horrible.

646
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But now we're going to watch better videos, and you can watch them with us, as opposed

647
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
to just watching us.

648
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't watch them on your own computer.

649
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
No.

650
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's going to explode.

651
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Simultaneously.

652
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's back on now.

653
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
All right.

654
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So, watch the red lights.

655
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Tell the mystery as to how much just got cut out, or how much you had to...

656
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Some of that.

657
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Do you think it filmed the time cube at all?

658
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I hope so.

659
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Who knows?

660
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That would be the worst place to have not had the video.

661
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.

662
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Maybe we'll have to do another.

663
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
We'll have to do another like it.

664
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Perhaps.

665
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, we'll certainly have plenty of times.

666
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm all for just filming, like, a million mystery science theater videos of us shitting

667
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
YouTube videos.

668
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That's actually a great idea.

669
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

670
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That's actually a better idea than the PCP.

671
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We should get rid of the PCP.

672
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And you're pleased with that.

673
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Do you guys want to discuss anything?

674
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I do want to hear the airplane.

675
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah, me too.

676
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yesterday, I was so fucking angry that I could have cut the greatest throw-mobile time,

677
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
but I was also too tired.

678
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I didn't give a shit.

679
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I didn't want to tell anyone anything.

680
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Now, I have to like go back in time and try to reignite that spark.

681
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It might help if you came out kind of in a security blanket.

682
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You didn't see me for who I truly am.

683
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm a sexy boy.

684
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You should show off your fucking body and strut around this place with that fucking mic

685
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that you can walk with.

686
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's true.

687
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And this is the ultimate promo.

688
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
They can follow you.

689
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Do it.

690
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Do it.

691
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Do it.

692
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Although the mic port is not very long.

693
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You're putting me under a lot of pressure right now.

694
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I wish to know what happened at the fucking airport.

695
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
All it takes for me to get mad, to get re-mad, is to just start reciting what happened in

696
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
my mind, even if it was 10 years ago.

697
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I want to know what the deal is with the guy who was stealing the fucking bananas.

698
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I need to know what that guy did to cause this problem.

699
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No, no, no.

700
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I feel like he told us.

701
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
No, no, he didn't go into detail.

702
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No, he refused to tell us so that he could tell us on camera.

703
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He's had a total like a restaurant list going right now.

704
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Let's do it.

705
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
People of the world, if you thought 9-11 was bad, you don't know about 9-12 yet.

706
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
September 12th, 2016, a day that shall live in infamy, a day that shall live on in the

707
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
nightmares of everyone in the world for the rest of time once I tell the story.

708
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't actually feel like telling the story.

709
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You know what?

710
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, come on.

711
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Come on.

712
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Now you got a solid answer for it.

713
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't even remember what happened.

714
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I fucking want to know.

715
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You know.

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You know.

717
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I built this up so much.

718
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The story is just going to be, I went to the airport and I got to miss my flight.

719
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It was pretty poopy.

720
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, but why'd you miss it though?

721
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It was only like a 10 minute, the first flight was like a 10 minute flight, right?

722
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, cause I couldn't find a bus.

723
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What was it called?

724
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Gun.

725
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Car.

726
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Plane.

727
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Plane.

728
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I give up.

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I couldn't find a plane.

730
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well, okay.

731
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
One time I missed a flight because, so I get to the desk at CVG in, in Ohio or Kentucky

732
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
or whatever.

733
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And the guy at the desk says, sir, your flight leaves in 50 minutes.

734
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You have to be here an hour before your flight leaves or you can't go.

735
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I said, what?

736
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And he's, no, he's like, this is policy.

737
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And as I berated him for the next, about, it took 10 minutes of yelling at this man to

738
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
go.

739
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I can make it.

740
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's right there.

741
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I need to go now.

742
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He said, he eventually like called people and they were like, okay, fine.

743
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And they let me run.

744
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Automatons.

745
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And when I got there, they had just finished the boarding process and I was not allowed

746
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
on that flight costing me 24 hours of waiting time.

747
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Worthless.

748
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So that guy cost me that fucking flight.

749
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Dragon their fear.

750
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

751
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Coming up your date.

752
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Whatever they can to be a fucking nuisance.

753
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,600
You know, everyone who knows me, everyone who knows me in my real life, they know that

754
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,300
I have like a psychotic physical aversion to bureaucracy or process of any kind.

755
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,600
I do everything I can to avoid it.

756
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,000
You know, anytime I get on a plane, I try not to pack too much.

757
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,800
I try to pack life specifically because I don't want to deal with like baggage claim

758
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,500
and all that ridiculous bullshit.

759
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,600
My dream in life, my one goal, my one aspiration is to someday get on a plane with no baggage.

760
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,840
To just travel with nothing but the clothes on my back and the sweat on my balls and no

761
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
other bullshit.

762
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,080
That's the dream.

763
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,120
So I packed my suitcase the other day before I go to this fucking airport.

764
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,520
I got a fucking flight to Chicago and then from Chicago flight to here because you can't

765
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
just come here.

766
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
They can't just do what I want.

767
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,400
No one can just do what I want.

768
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,600
Everyone has to get in my fucking way deliberately.

769
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
It's a conspiracy.

770
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,080
A global worldwide like driven conspiracy to make me miserable specifically.

771
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,120
So I packed my bag, the same bag that I've gone on a plane with like four other times.

772
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,280
I know for a fact it's a carry on bag.

773
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,400
I've carried it on multiple planes.

774
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,240
I've never had to go through baggage claim ever before.

775
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,400
So I get to the fucking airport place and I say, I'm here for my plane, cunt.

776
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:22,800
She says, oh thank God, Lord Jess has arrived to sample our automobiles of the sky and go

777
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,200
where we may.

778
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,960
So I take my little bag, she says little bag, she says little bag, take my little bag to

779
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
the plane.

780
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,600
I go through the fucking plane corridor and when I go to the plane, some fucking broad

781
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
takes my bag.

782
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,560
She just like jumps out of the woodwork like a monster in an haunted house and grabs my

783
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,080
bag and slaps the red sticker on it and takes it away.

784
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,840
And apparently this was like a valet thing because the plane was so fucking rinky dink

785
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,720
and small that there was no baggage spots in the, I've never fucking done the valet thing

786
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
before.

787
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
I've never even heard of it.

788
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
So she didn't explain it to me.

789
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,600
She just took my bag and I'm like, um, that you can't take that as a carry on.

790
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
What are you taking me to?

791
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
She's like, no, I'm taking it.

792
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,920
I'm like, okay, come on, just fucking taking it.

793
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,840
You can't fuck with these people.

794
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,600
So I just like, okay, I just have to allow these maniacs to take my fucking stuff.

795
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,080
And this is precious cargo.

796
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,120
You want to know what's in this bag, the precious cargo that I'm transporting.

797
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
More than anything.

798
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,240
First of all, I've got like four or five of my favorite shirts in there, which if any

799
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,800
one of them were to be lost, it would be a mass shooting by me.

800
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,320
It would be, it would be like 10, 9, 11s at once.

801
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
A lot of bullets.

802
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Yeah.

803
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
A lot of bullets.

804
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
A lot of bullets.

805
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Like in the World Trade Center.

806
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,240
I World War II by plane.

807
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:48,920
But um, so I have a bunch of shirts, my favorite shirts.

808
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,600
Shirts that I specifically picked out because like, you know, when I'm on camera at Casa

809
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,800
de Conran, I'm going to want the perfect wardrobe.

810
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,520
I got my Kelly Bundy shirt.

811
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,440
I got my Misado shirt.

812
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,840
All the best shirts.

813
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,240
And not only, not all my shirts, I got my laptop, which has my entire life on it.

814
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,040
All my stuff that I've read over like the last eight years, if that were to get lost.

815
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Delete.

816
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Delete.

817
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Delete.

818
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Delete.

819
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Delete.

820
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,160
So I've got a bunch of my favorite shirts.

821
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,920
I got my fucking laptop.

822
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,200
And oh yeah, my best friend, Colt Corona, is in that fucking shirt case.

823
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,320
He, you know, he begged me to bring him along to let, to allow him to tag along in this

824
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
journey.

825
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,320
And I said, I said, brother Corona, I knew you'd come.

826
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,160
So I threw him in there.

827
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,760
So I've got basically the most precious cargo imaginable.

828
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,840
This fucking lady just jumps out of the bushes and takes my suitcase and tosses it into some

829
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
fucking plane.

830
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Oh, I don't know.

831
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
The purest creature that ever lived.

832
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Colt Corona.

833
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
Yeah.

834
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,440
The only one of us who deserves to be here.

835
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,600
So I get on this tiny fucking plane.

836
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,840
And of course my ticket has a seat number on it because God forbid anyone have any autonomy

837
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,800
in picking their own fucking seat.

838
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
We have to be treated like a bunch of kindergartners.

839
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,160
I think, in fact, I think even kindergartners would be allowed to pick their own seat and

840
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
clap.

841
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Treat it like an obsolete mule.

842
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Treat it like an obsolete mule.

843
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Yeah, that's right.

844
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Exactly.

845
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,640
Well, let me tell you about the obsolete mule that I met on the plane because that's exactly

846
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
what came up to me.

847
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,000
You know, I'm fucking looking at, I'm trying to decipher this fucking number because it

848
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,240
can't just be a seat number.

849
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,560
It's got to be like a letter and then a number.

850
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,200
And every seat has like three letters on it and four numbers and you've got to decipher

851
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
them.

852
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,360
So I go into the back of this cramped fucking rinky-dink, tiny-ass, ball sack plane and

853
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,440
I get into the back of it and I pick my seat and I'm like, okay, I fucking see it, I guess.

854
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,800
They're gonna fucking, they have to micromanage where we sit like a bunch of fucking sardines

855
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,960
in a can full of sardines.

856
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,960
So I'm sitting in my seat and this fucking guy comes up and he's like, I'm just eating

857
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
and I hate to bother you.

858
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,960
But is that a C-A-12?

859
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I am, you're in my seat, you're in the good seat by this little smelly bitch over here.

860
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,760
You know, I hate to bother you like, shut up, you know, you love to bother me.

861
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
He's loving it, dude.

862
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
He's fucking fucked.

863
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
You goat Jesus.

864
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
You slut.

865
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,760
You aged slut from hell.

866
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,760
You know, he's fucking, he's taking so much joy in just being a smug guy and saying,

867
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,760
hey, believe you made an error in deciphering your ticket seat.

868
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,760
So, you know, he makes me get up and cross the aisle because it's so important to him

869
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
that he's sit where they tell him to sit.

870
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,760
You know, if only our politicians would take a leaf out of his book and encourage

871
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
cross the aisle.

872
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
You know what I'm saying, folks?

873
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
What the fuck are you?

874
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
That's a political expression.

875
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm sorry.

876
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
I have no idea what that means.

877
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
It's a real thing.

878
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Watch your madness.

879
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Delete.

880
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Delete.

881
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Delete.

882
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Delete.

883
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Delete.

884
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Delete.

885
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Delete.

886
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
Yeah, delete.

887
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Delete.

888
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Delete.

889
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
That is a whole different meaning.

890
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,760
It's just as if it's mind-blowing that people care so much about the rules.

891
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,260
Like, I believe that if nobody gets hurt by you breaking a rule, you have a moral obligation

892
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
to break the rule.

893
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:21,360
You have a responsibility as a member of the free human race to break every rule that

894
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,760
won't hurt someone.

895
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,760
If you can get the same result by breaking a rule or not breaking it, you should definitely

896
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
break it because everyone else would not break it and that's lame.

897
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
It is lame.

898
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
That's true.

899
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
I think it's about, like, judicial precedent.

900
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Like, well, the last guy broke the rule all the time.

901
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Yeah, but you have to stop breaking the rule because now it's causing a problem.

902
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
You've got to be out there setting a new precedent.

903
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
That is true.

904
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Yeah.

905
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Then what happened?

906
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm still on that fucking guy who gave me a guy on the seat.

907
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,460
It's not like there's some fucking, it's not like there's a bunch of knights patrolling

908
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,760
the plane, making sure everyone's in the right seat.

909
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
No one's going to give a shit.

910
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Just let me fucking sit here.

911
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Let me have the fucking window seat, you monster.

912
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,760
That's an evil fucking animal who would take me out of a window seat and put me in an aisle

913
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
seat.

914
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
I'll seats are the most miserable fucking thing.

915
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Well, that's what I didn't want.

916
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Well, I sat in it first.

917
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
That's all that should matter.

918
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,760
On my flight over here, I just, like, I just half the time, my face was pressed right

919
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
up against the glass.

920
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
That's the best part.

921
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,760
That's the only thing that matters in life.

922
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,760
The only good part of the entire airport experience is that brief moment when the plane takes

923
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,760
off and you get to look out the window and see this horrifying world get smaller.

924
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,760
It's the only thing I look forward to about the whole miserable experience.

925
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,760
And now I'm stuck in this aisle seat next to this smelly old broad who's like 60, but

926
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
like 160.

927
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Yeah.

928
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
That's her age.

929
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,760
160 year olds on top of each other as one person.

930
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,760
And she's pulling out a fucking sandwich from a brown paper bag, like a fucking rube,

931
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
like some kind of kid in school.

932
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,760
And, you know, you can't even look out the window at all when you're in the aisle seat

933
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
because then you're also looking at the person.

934
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Yeah.

935
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,760
So if she looks back and sees me looking at her, looking out the window, she's going to

936
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
think I'm in the aisle seat.
