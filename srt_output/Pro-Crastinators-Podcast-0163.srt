00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever and today we've got

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,600
Hippo Gibbontake. What's up?

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:18,400
Hey, the the punk plushie Kickstarter is still ongoing. If you don't know what that is, here's a link to it.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,480
It's it's a thing. We talked about it last episode if you in case you didn't watch.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,840
If you want to pump plush, go invest now.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
We've got Tom Oliver.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,960
Hey, a pump plush is good and I backed it and you should back it too. Go check out the link that was just thrown down.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,200
It'd go well within a zoomie plush if one existed, which it does not currently.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,480
Oh, it's happening. Oh, it's it's in the works. It will happen. I swear it on my soul.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Ben Saint is here.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
Are any of us really here though?

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,000
When you think it right down to it. I have a philosophy degree.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:04,240
Impressive and here's Digi bro. Just your friendly neighborhood boomer with a beer gut.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,880
Tearing through your mom's cunt.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Happy as always to have that happening.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,280
Welcome everybody. Time for another week of the podcast. Hope you've been doing well.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,720
Let's just jump into it. Well, who's got things? I got things. Yeah, let's just jump into it and

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,040
hope someone else has something. All right, I've got something. Sun and moon, Pokemon. Okay, no.

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Sun and moon. Let's talk about. Wait, I meant shield and sword. Let's talk about Zamazenta and Zashian and how they're bad.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,800
I think they're kind of cool personally. I think Zamaz. I think Zashian's. You dog lover.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,480
I do love dog. Just me. Zashian is okay. I don't think Zashian is worse than like the musketeers.

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,800
Which one's the sword? Which one's the sword and which one's the shield? Zashian. Zashian. Okay, that's the sword.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
I think Sif is okay. I think shield dog is fucking hideous.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Agreed. He is very silly and it doesn't make a lot of, like, what if I attack him from behind?

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
But worst of all is just the fact that they look too much alike and have the same fucking color palette.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,720
Are they literally the same Pokemon? Is that a thing? Like, but one got a sword and one got

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,800
shield in the different versions of the games? I heard that was a thing. Maybe. Maybe the third

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,080
Pokemon, like there's always a third. It's going to be a third. Dog gun. No, no, no. Not a gun.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,720
It'll be like the guy's master. Like, it's a human Pokemon who rears these two dogs.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
It's just like a dude with like a leash. He puts them on a leash.

31
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,440
Pokemon trainer Artorias challenges you back. Here's the thing about the third Pokemon. So,

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360
Zashian and Zamazenta, they are cyan and magenta. So the third one will be yellow.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
Do they actually look that way though? Do the colors match that? Not at all.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,160
Yeah, well, they kind of do because Zashian is more blue and Zamazenta is more red pinkish.

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
That makes some sense out of the color palette to me, but like, they could not have made it look

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,880
shittier. Like, they could have definitely. Oh, it sucks. Oh, it sucks for sure. I heard one other

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,480
theory, which was that. I mean, the logos for Sword and Shield are basically cyan and magenta or

38
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,360
pretty close. That is true. Why didn't they make games of Pokemon cyan and Pokemon magenta, you

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,320
know? Maybe that's a little too gay for people. I don't think they're allowed. Well, they got away

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,800
from colors at some point. I don't think they're ever going back. I think, yeah, probably not.

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,480
I did hear one theory that like, that it's this, I was just watching a bunch of speculation shit.

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
I think it was that guy, what's his name? Noggin and Lockestein. Lockestein and Noggin,

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
that guy, she's all right. Well, it's two guys. I only see, I thought it was just one guy who was

44
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,720
like an avatar. I only see the one chubby guy. Yeah. Actually, he lost some weight, though. He's

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,360
looking good these days. Good job, dude. I just see that one guy and I don't know if he's Noggin

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,920
or Lockestein. He has the most, I watched some old videos. He has the most ridiculous hair I've

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,480
ever seen on a human being. It's got this weird, spiky wave, but he's fixing it. I hate what he

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,520
represents, which is humans that use like a like really like deliciously rendered cartoon avatar.

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,040
And that's their identity. They paid like a couple, maybe a couple hundred bucks to a really

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,480
good artist to draw some really fucking lush, to draw a really, really handsome avatar,

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,280
really handsome in cartoon form and with like five different expressions and that's the whole

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
fucking- And we all know that's an alt-right dog whistle if there ever was one. Absolutely.

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,040
Okay, but the theory was that these two are like Odin's sword and shield and the third one will

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,400
be a spear. But like- You know, I was thinking spear. I was thinking spear. There's some connection

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
there. How does Odin have to do it? Is this like a Norse? There's like Norse shit going on. Odin

56
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,560
has two pet wolves. God, what about Frecky and Gary and Frecky, I think? I think that's right.

57
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,000
Do these two things even look like wolves? They're just like dogs, right? They're wolves. No, they're

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
wolves. They're definitely supposed to be wolves. They're absolutely wolves. I can't tell the difference.

59
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
Yeah, I mean, not at all. They're looking at a husky with the difference between a wolf.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,520
There is none. It's the same. You're delusional people. Anyway, I don't know. I got really

61
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,360
not much to say. Oh, we could talk about- What do you guys think about Dynamaxing? You're gonna

62
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,600
Dynamax your voice? It sucks. It's bad. I can tell that the game is going to suck because-

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
It's desperate. Because obviously the fucking priorities are totally wrong.

64
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Well, okay. The fact that they would even think to introduce something like Dynamaxing just

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
demonstrates that they've failed from the get-go to understand what makes a Pokemon game good.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,640
I thought the mega evolutions were retarded and I thought the other thing from the last gen was

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,400
retarded as well. You're right. I kind of agree, but I could sort of defend them as like an experiment,

68
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
but the fact that they- But they're still here. They're not going anywhere.

69
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,920
They did it again. They do it every time now. They did it again, but they're doing it with so much

70
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,720
less art direction to it. They're just bigger. I mean, that's just the most obvious thing to

71
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,640
make fun of, but it's the biggest problem with it. There's nothing to it. I think that the one cool

72
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,920
thing about it though is the idea of the raids, like that you fight a giant Pokemon. It's like a

73
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,000
group, it's like an online raid party thing. I think that's neat. I look forward to Dynamaxing

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
my Wailord and creating a black hole that consumes the entire planet. That'll be fun.

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,200
That'll be fun. No, no, because he's lighter than air. He's the float whale.

76
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Wait, does he actually float? It's debatable, but his weight is like- I think I saw someone

77
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,440
calculated it and he only weighs like 800 pounds or something, even though he's like 40 feet long.

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,760
But he's huge. Yeah. I think he might technically be lighter than air and his type is the float-

79
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,120
he's the float whale Pokemon, so he might literally just float.

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
What about the Alolan Exeggutor? Would he hit the Skybox?

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Oh yeah, he goes into the atmosphere for sure. Oh my God, Dynamaxing an Alolan Exeggutor would be

82
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,800
so sick. Well, now you're officially sold on it. Okay, some of these gimmick ideas are good.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,320
It's a good idea in that I would like to see a gif of it. I don't want to buy a video game

84
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,840
because of it, you know? I mean, I like the Z moves for the sole one reason that it had that

85
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,440
really funny clip of Snorlax when he wakes up and does his funny charge attack with his sparkling

86
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,640
eyes of death. I don't inherently hate mega evolutions. I don't inherently hate Z moves,

87
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,240
but it's enough. Stop, stop. It's a weird- It's over. This is what's happening now.

88
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,200
I just hope that- The only thing that pissed me off about this fucking game, on the one hand,

89
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,160
console RPG Pokémon is something I've dreamed of since I was a child. X and Y already gave me

90
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,240
the taste of it, where seeing it in 3D finally was like, oh my God, this is what I always wanted it

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,320
to be. Sun and Moon made it better by opening up the environments and stuff. Except fucking Colosseum

92
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,960
had way better animations than any of the fucking new 3D actual mainline Pokémon games.

93
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,680
Does Colosseum use the same- Yeah. Okay, it's not that the models are better. It's the animations

94
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,040
are infinitely better. It's not used for Pokémon Stadium. Okay, well, yeah, and that's the same

95
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,200
ones from Pokémon XD, right? Yeah. Because the Pokémon and XD look fucking ridiculous. I know,

96
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
that's why they're great. They're sick. Sometimes they're great. There's personality. They look

97
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,840
ridiculous because the models from Pokémon XD are all ripped from Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon

98
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,640
Stadium too. They are just N64. Yeah, okay. It's all right. I mean, have you seen Pokémon Stadium?

99
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,840
I mean, Golbat's really funny. Have you seen Golbat? Yes, and he's awesome. He stands with

100
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,960
his wings wrapped around him, just like rocking back and forth, like waddling. I love that guy.

101
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,240
It's great. It's great. But it's terrible, but I love it. All the Nintendo 64 animations

102
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,040
had, obviously, since they were less Pokémon, they had more personality in each of the

103
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,120
animations. It's literally Soul vs. Soul. Me and Munchy recently finished our

104
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,840
Nightmarishly long Pokémon XD Nuzlocke on the RFCK channel, and link in the description.

105
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,120
Kangaskhan is like a fucking seizure nightmare. Really? Yeah, I don't remember. I haven't seen

106
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,760
that one. Kangaskhan is just like a mess of constantly flailing, and a lot of them are like

107
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,760
that. They're really weird. Whoever designed some of them. Fair enough. As much as I'd love to go

108
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
into the bones of every technical thing wrong with these children's games, the thing that bothered me

109
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:49,760
the most is that it's on the Switch, and the Switch is a $300 console, and there's two of the games

110
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,800
still. So it used to be, hey, me and my brother would each get the two different versions on our

111
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,320
Gameboys. It's perfectly reasonable for you and your sibling to both have a Gameboy. For you and

112
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,400
someone else sharing your house to both own a $300 console is just a lot more, and it's like,

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,160
I was really looking forward to getting to play this with Mei. Both of us get the two different

114
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,200
games, play together, but it's on the fucking Switch. So now I just finally bought a Switch.

115
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Now she would have to also buy a Switch for us to play simultaneously, and if they fucking make

116
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,480
this game still only one save file per game, I'm gonna fucking throw fit. Yeah, they will. That's

117
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,400
a whole like fucking grandfathered in bullshit that Pokemon's always done. That should not be

118
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,000
excusable. Just one save file per game. It initially was a fucking memory issue, and there's no reason

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,040
they couldn't change that in the future. Maybe they like the idea of it's kind of Animal Crossing

120
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
where Animal Crossing intentionally says this is your world. You have one world.

121
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,840
You can play as multiple characters in that world. It's like Dark Souls. It's like Dark Souls.

122
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Even Dark Souls lets you have multiple save files now. Wait, it does? Okay, never mind.

123
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Yeah, you can have as many characters as that game as you want. The thing about Pokemon is they

124
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,120
obviously do it just to push system sales. There's no other reason other than it forces your friends

125
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,920
or siblings or whoever you would be sharing this game with to also own a copy. Actually,

126
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
the good news about the Switch is like, you know how you can have different profiles? I think

127
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,960
even with a game like Pokemon or Animal Crossing, every profile on your Switch account does have

128
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,200
like its own save file of every single game. If that's true, then it will, then it'll be fine,

129
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,280
but like it still is annoying to know that like I can't just pass, you know, like the idea of a

130
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,160
$300 console to play two fucking of the same game is just infuriating. I hear you. I hear you.

131
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,200
What can you do? What can you do? To move the conversation from Pokemon to, you got something

132
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,920
to say, Nate? Wait, wait, I have one final thing to say on the subject and it's just that. So,

133
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,000
gyms are the best thing about Pokemon. They were always the most fun and the most interesting

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,520
and the most cool and they were great, like, I don't know, like progression meter of how you're

135
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,320
doing. And we saw like in the new trailer, like, uh, it's just that in the new trailer, it's like

136
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
you're in like a stadium, you're going to get like super popular or something. Like that's all

137
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,120
fine. But it looks like Dynamaxing is going to be like a main component of gym battles is what it

138
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,880
looked like. And I'm just saying, oh, great. Now instead of like my Pokemon skill at the game,

139
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm just going to have to deal with this fucking Dynamaxing stuff. I mean, it's like the Dynamaxing

140
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920
thing is like a thing. I mean, it's like a Z move. It's like a thing you have to use strategically.

141
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,480
I don't think Dynamaxing in and of itself is bad. They said only last like three turns.

142
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,120
Yeah, you guys are all fucking gay. This looks cool. I like Dynamaxing.

143
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,920
Oh, you just like it because you're Godzilla shit. Yeah, yeah, I do. Tell me how it looks cool.

144
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
How does it look cool at all? Because they're big and it's fucking cool. I like the idea. I think

145
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,760
everyone's always dogging on Pokemon. You're all gay. You know what? You know what? I think

146
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
one Pokemon can do it for three turns in a battle. It's not going to overtake anything. It's just

147
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,040
another extra layer. It's fine. It's not going to be a huge deal. You know what I think would be

148
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,920
cooler? You know what I think would be cooler is if Dynamax battles were like a different mode of

149
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,600
battling, like you can have triple battles and double battles and rotation battles. What if just

150
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,560
there were some Dynamax battles where it was like maybe you only get sort of how would you balance

151
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,560
that though? It'd be a whole different game. Well, I mean, yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's just each

152
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,600
one is like one monster versus one monster. Maybe they each have like everybody's giant. What's the

153
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,200
point then? You know, because if everybody's giant, then they know what he is. Just looks cool. I don't

154
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,120
know. That was the problem I was having with it was like it seemed to be every gym or like you

155
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,240
have this power and you can activate it potentially in every battle if you wanted to, I guess.

156
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,680
I like the idea of like a final boss sort of like, oh, you know, the evil villain has like a power.

157
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,120
Like when a hot blonde lady fused with that one Ultra Beast in Sun and Moon or whatever. That was

158
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,560
you know, that was okay. Yeah, right, right. Like if the villain team of this game is like

159
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,880
getting technology to turn Pokemon big and then you have to fight the leader and he has a big

160
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,800
Pokemon and you have like your whole party, but like you don't get like that until after that.

161
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Maybe, I mean, maybe that's what it is, but it feels like it's like a thing at the start of the

162
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,840
game. You can just become big and then you get big through the game and it just loses its appeal.

163
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I doubt it'll be at the very start of the game. Because like the Z moves were such a

164
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,200
fucking pain in the ass to even acquire in the last game that I never used. Well,

165
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,360
we know it'll happen at the first gym at the latest because we saw it in the first gym.

166
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,560
Yeah, you're right. You're right. So, you know, the Milo, it's, it kind of looks to me like maybe

167
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,280
you can only Dynamax in certain places. Like maybe you can only do it in gyms and raids and maybe

168
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,680
certain other specific times. Hey, Ben. Ben, did you notice that they made a new

169
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,920
killer Pokemon? Oh, the, um, the bird, the fucking bird. That was the most killer ass thing I have

170
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,240
ever seen. That thing is so killer. That thing is my new favorite Pokemon. He is. Is that what it's

171
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,760
called? Corviknight? Corviknight. That's right. That's right. I, I do like it, although it's like,

172
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,800
it's, I mean, it certainly looks flying. No, wait, it's flying steel, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah,

173
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,760
okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, how do you know? Because they told us. They told us. Did they?

174
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they released info. I'll take your word for it. Shot. Everyone was saying like

175
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,800
Skamori finally has a friend. Yeah. Yeah, there's a new Skarmory. Well, cool. Yeah, it was pretty good.

176
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,160
Very killer. Very gothic. I can't wait to have a team of six. Ben, is your favorite Pokemon still

177
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,280
Gothelita, Gothetella, whatever? Gothetell, Gothetell. She's, I mean, she's never been my favorite,

178
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,040
but I do like her. I like her a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. I was going to say,

179
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,320
because she sucks. Is there a fucking Pokemon called Gothelita? What? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well,

180
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,920
she's my Pokemon waifu for sure. Okay, great. Let's talk about Pokemon again. Hippo, what did

181
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,600
you want to talk about? Oh yeah, I was going to change the topic from Pokemon to Pokemon the anime,

182
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:30,000
because, because last, last episode, I had a, I had a moment where I was like, whoa,

183
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,120
Pokemon's free. I mean, I could pirate it easily. It's fine. But like on the Pokemon website,

184
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
they have every episode of all Pokemon just in all of it all the way up through the current.

185
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:50,240
Yeah, like, well, that's what I'm going to do from now on. So I've been going, I, as a youngster,

186
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,080
I got up to like the first league, and Ash last, and that's what I remember. And then I watched the

187
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,040
movie, and I don't think I watched the anime properly after that. So I've been picking it up from

188
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,720
the Orange Island saga, and it sucks. No, I'm really enjoying it because yeah, okay, okay,

189
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,600
the anime is good. All right, we gotta talk about this. It's really colorful and really nice,

190
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,480
and the music's great. And some of the animation is like surprisingly really good. I've looked

191
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,760
around for Sakuga Meisters to find out who animated like certain episodes. Team Rocket

192
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,960
is the best thing to happen in the Pokemon franchise as a whole. Yeah, they have the most

193
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,800
personality for sure. Pokemon has always been enjoyable and fun, except for maybe advanced

194
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:46,480
generation. But the, the Orange Islands, like as a kid, I think that I and a lot of other people

195
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
lost interest in the series at that point, just because it wasn't the games. Like we had all played

196
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,640
the games. And what are those fucking weird, like abstract, like post-modern looking badges you're

197
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,760
getting, Ash? Like, yeah. Well, and, and like, Golden Silver had already been out. So like, we had

198
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,960
played those games, we're expecting Johto, and then we get this weird other thing, and it was like,

199
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
it felt like kind of a slap in the face just because it was like, I haven't gotten to experience

200
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,160
these gyms. Like, I don't know who these, these gym leaders are, but like, I actually think that

201
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,920
section of the anime was probably one of the more conceptually interesting parts, because,

202
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,520
you know, since they weren't going on source material, they were just able to make up their own

203
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,840
stuff. Hey, this is a very high bar, though. Yeah, dude, Pokemon anime is good. It is very good.

204
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,400
I can still return to it. And I just watched an episode the other day that was fucking hilarious.

205
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,240
The dub is fun. Like, I honestly enjoy the Pokemon dub because they, they clearly intended to make

206
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,360
it a comedy series. Like, they were trying to be funny, and like, the acting's stupid as fuck,

207
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,160
but like, the dialogue works with that. So it's, it's almost like a parody dub.

208
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
The frying pan is the drying pan. Yeah.

209
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,960
That is funny. That is good. Who am I? I am Brock. Slimes like that.

210
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,040
By the way, uh, yeah, Brock leaves in the Orange Islands, which I had never, I had never knew

211
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,440
and known. Tracy, don't you love Tracy? Tracy is like really boring, but there's one thing that I

212
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,320
like about this new dynamic is that without Brock, um, Tracy is like not as much of a pervert,

213
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,960
but he does notice that Ash and Misty like each other and he's pointing it out like every

214
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,280
episode and they're all blushing and it's like this whole romance thing is coming to the forefront.

215
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,320
I know, I know that it doesn't go anywhere because, yeah, Misty gets cut and, and like,

216
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,000
she leaves and I'm, I'm, I'm waiting for that moment in the anime where I can be like,

217
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,120
ah, it sucks now and I can stop because I don't actually want to watch like 700,000 episodes.

218
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,240
Dude, but it gets, but it'll never happen. You're gonna watch them all. You're true.

219
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,520
I mean, Pokemon like, it gets, there's a shitty part because if you get to Advanced

220
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,240
Generation when they introduce May and Max, May and Max suck. The episodes get really formulaic.

221
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,600
That part of the anime is not that good. Uh, the next season after that with, uh, with Dawn is,

222
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,160
is whatever, but like, it picks up again as of Best Wishes or Black and White. Like, the show

223
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,640
gets great again and, uh, is definitely worth watching. Although the dub is no longer as good

224
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,040
and funny and iconic because they replaced all the actors in like Advanced and all the new ones

225
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,280
are fucking terrible, but, um, but fucking Pokemon Sun and Moon and brought in Keeper Sutherland

226
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,440
for Ash. Pokemon Sun and Moon is the best one. It's super fucking, it's colorful and adorable

227
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,360
and it's, it's not actually an adventure show. It's like, uh, it just takes place in one city

228
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,720
and the action comes to them and like Ash doesn't have like companions. He's just kind of at this

229
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,480
Pokemon school with like all the gym leaders from the game in it or like most of them and, uh,

230
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,800
the girls are super fucking hot and it's like the most interesting animation.

231
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,440
Is it like still getting badges or something or whatever they fucking do?

232
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
Uh, I don't know because I haven't watched that much of it, but like in what I've seen,

233
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,960
it was mostly just like a slice of life show in Alola, but with like really amazing animation

234
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,520
and, uh, an art style. It looks fucking awesome and it's, that's cool. Very pleasing.

235
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,520
And, uh, one thing, uh, is that I found like, I'd never really had a Pokemon waifu. Misty was

236
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,800
the closest, but I think I found one, uh, in Professor Ivy because look at how

237
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,160
right, uh, look at that, look at that wreck. Look at how big she is.

238
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,280
I'm pretty sure Tracy ends up fucking cooing their shit.

239
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,520
Oh, okay. I guess she's, so she's the Orange Islands lady.

240
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Yeah, she's, she's, that is quite a wreck. Jesus Christ.

241
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,280
Wait, wait, wait, where'd you post it? Where, where is this?

242
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,040
I posted it in the thing, you know, gross discussing audio links.

243
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
That is girth. That's serious girth right there.

244
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,240
The wreck is fucking intense.

245
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
Could, could, could be bigger, could be bigger, but I'll take it.

246
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
She is the reason Brooke left, uh, because he wanted to stay and help her because she's a

247
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,040
star. Oh my God. Yeah, he makes sense.

248
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
Doesn't she kind of talk like she has to downs?

249
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,480
She's always like, oh yeah, she's like, uh, yes, I, I said that we, no, she's not,

250
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,520
she's not the island time, man. So she's name is, is Brock like you? Did he go full retard?

251
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Why, am I like getting GF and then going for retard? No, no, by dated, by fucking retarded girl.

252
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,400
Oh, right. It's really trading up to the value brand, in my opinion.

253
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
Classic meme. Hi, Michelle. Get fucked.

254
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,080
Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, well, good Pokemon's good.

255
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Oh, one, one, one more thing about like Pokemon, uh, the anime, I've noticed that a lot of the

256
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,520
times when they're introducing or like talking about like this, this new islands where they

257
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,560
grow grapefruits and, um, or this new island where they blow glass and stuff, it's just like

258
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:03,840
they, they come up with a thing and the animation of like, you know, the backstory of like what this

259
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,800
island does and what these people do is actually quite like lovingly crafted and, um, the, you know,

260
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,560
attention to detail for a lot of things, a lot of parts of the episode, um, uh, like for no real

261
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,680
reason, uh, made to explain what these things are. And I feel like, uh, it's like half trying to be

262
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,920
educational, but it really comes across natural and not forced. And I like that. I really appreciate,

263
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,080
like the, in the glass thing, they have like a few scenes showing how the glass is made.

264
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,480
And it looks like, like documentaries I've seen of like glass blowing factories and stuff and

265
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
traditional methods and they just have a few background characters doing that and with a

266
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,200
Pokemon helping them with the fire and stuff. And it's, I feel like that sort of thing. I don't

267
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,200
know whether they had it in the Indigo League as much. Um, but I feel like that sort of like real

268
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,800
world, um, aspect to the Pokemon anime is supposed to ground it in reality so that a kid who has seen

269
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,360
those things in real life can sort of be like, ah, Pokemon could be real. I'll go outside and find one

270
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,800
like the, the Pokemon are just sort of living in amongst this realistic world that could exist.

271
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,400
And it's, uh, it's really cool. You know, that all does sound very cool. And, but I think it was

272
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,520
kind of that same thing. I think that like as a hot-blooded, like my biggest problem with Pokemon,

273
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,000
watching it from the start was like, Ash, just get a new fucking badge, you pussy, catch every

274
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,240
Pokemon. Cause that's how I played the game. And it's like annoying when Ash isn't playing it the

275
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,120
way that I want to play it in my video game world. And sounds like, like these are all good things

276
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,360
about the, the show, but like, it sounds like more of the stuff that frustrated me. Ash's whole

277
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,040
character arc is about the fact that he is not a good trainer. He slowly gives up his dreams of

278
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,640
actually being like a good trainer or a champion or anything. No, no, it's just that the anime

279
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,280
resets basically after Johto and then constantly resets. But like up through the Johto League,

280
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,480
there's an arc about the fact that like Ash has his heart in the right place. And that's why

281
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,640
everybody respect, like, you know, wants to like him, but he's just ignorant and doesn't really try

282
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,600
to learn how to be better. And that's why he loses in the Indigo League is that he just straight up

283
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
doesn't know what he's doing. And like, he's never,

284
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
cause he's never trained it well. When he loses to Richie, right?

285
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,880
Yeah. And then in the Orange Islands, there's a whole episode about him finally like,

286
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,880
you know, training Charizard properly and getting his respect.

287
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,760
And then he becomes his like fucking pitch hitter for like a million seasons or something.

288
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,480
Well, no, because then he gets rid of him in like early Johto.

289
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
Yeah, Ash gets rid of all his good Pokemon.

290
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
Yeah, because they always end up, because Charizard goes to live in like the Valley of

291
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,200
the Charizards or whatever the fuck. Right, to get good and swole and huge, which is sick.

292
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,440
Goes to the Valley of Drakes, hangs out with his friends.

293
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,880
Yeah, but he gives up his, I mean, whatever, we all know that Ash gives up.

294
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
Tom over here with all the fucking Dark Souls references all of a sudden.

295
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,320
I just played it. All right, it's all there.

296
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,680
You hate Dark Souls, Tom. Yeah, that's your whole personality, Tom.

297
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,240
He's hating Dark Souls. Without that, there'll be nothing left.

298
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,200
What's your status on Dark Souls these days, Tom?

299
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,200
I'm like, I haven't touched video games like the last two weeks.

300
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,800
I've been so busy working on stuff, but I beat Dark Souls.

301
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,920
One, I got, I started playing it again just for shits and giggles.

302
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,880
I got the sense fortress this time, like, I don't want to deal with this, so I stopped.

303
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm playing Dark Souls 3. I'm at, I'm like halfway done, I think.

304
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,840
Fighting the guy who like, he's the two brothers, whatever, in the fucking...

305
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,520
Ornstein and Smough. It's just cool, two brothers.

306
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,680
Yeah, those guys, no. It's like the guy who like crawls around on his knees with a big sword.

307
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, the Lothric princes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

308
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,280
And I'm getting destroyed. Wait, that's like at the end of the game.

309
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,040
Yeah, it's pretty far. It's pretty far.

310
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,200
That's like one of the last bosses. Well, I guess I'm almost done then.

311
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,320
I mean, he might not have, have you gotten all the other Souls of Cinder yet?

312
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,360
I haven't gotten, I've gotten three out of four, I believe.

313
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,240
Wait, are you talking about Dark Souls 3?

314
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
Oh fuck, okay. I'm confused. Never played it.

316
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,720
So, I'm just...

317
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,960
Okay, but basically you've changed. You seem to be liking Dark Souls in general. Is that fair?

318
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,840
Sure. I think Bloodborne's the best one out of all of them by far.

319
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,720
Yeah, okay. That's fair.

320
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,800
So, I take, I take a Bloodborne 2 before anything else.

321
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,040
Maybe one day. Maybe one day.

322
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,400
So, Breath of the Wild.

323
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,840
Now, Breath of the Wild seems like the kind of game that I would really like,

324
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,400
but I still don't want to play it. And I don't know why.

325
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,320
I don't know why you think you would like it that much, Ben. What about it appeals to you?

326
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,040
The openness and the freedom and the robustness of the systems and the like the ability,

327
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,520
like the item transformation and cooking and shit, that all seems really cool.

328
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,560
The only problem with all that is that the game is

329
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,960
I mean, I don't know, maybe you'd enjoy it on like the higher difficulty that I think you can unlock,

330
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,600
but like as a baseline, you don't need to do any of that shit.

331
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,480
Like the game really is not hard enough to require you to do that stuff.

332
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,520
But I do think you'd enjoy it.

333
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
Some things I think you do need that for.

334
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,560
Like for, I remember being plagued by lightning, like many times on my like first playthrough,

335
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,320
and like, if you play like lightning is a bitch.

336
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,040
Yeah, you just have to un-equip your metal stuff and it's fine.

337
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,400
Is that the only thing you have to do?

338
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,880
Because I was still getting struck even after unequipping it though.

339
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,920
You shouldn't get struck by lightning.

340
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,720
There might have been something you still had equipped that was metal.

341
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,800
Huh. Okay. But see, that's the sort of thing.

342
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Maybe I just missed that because I thought I, ah, whatever.

343
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,160
Fuck it.

344
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,640
Point is there's lots of little things like that that you got to know.

345
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,920
I don't, don't you equip the rubber suit specifically?

346
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,080
No.

347
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
And like that's how you avoid lightning?

348
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,560
No. If you're not wearing any metal, you shouldn't get hit by lightning.

349
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,320
Yeah. I mean, if you're wearing your rubber armor, it reduces lightning damage.

350
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,160
I didn't even know there was rubber armor and I haven't as well gotten hit by lightning once.

351
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,480
Well, okay. Like the climbing, right? The climbing is kind of,

352
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
you really do need to level up your climbing to like get to some places.

353
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,680
I've literally gotten everywhere in the game on only two extensions of the,

354
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
of the stamina wheel.

355
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,200
I can literally climb anything in the game on two extensions of the stamina wheel,

356
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,280
except for making the like-

357
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,600
Are there like some towers you straight up won't be able to climb if you don't level up your fucking-

358
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,040
Like the main towers? No.

359
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,880
Yeah. Like the main towers you got to use to unlock.

360
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
You just got to be smart about how you climb them.

361
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,120
Like the game, because what I like about the game is that they put a lot of thought

362
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,960
into the topography of the game.

363
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,600
And if you, you know, just look at your environment carefully enough,

364
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,520
you can find an alternate route.

365
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,800
There's always like a path.

366
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,200
Like there's an intended path through all most of these things.

367
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,720
And sometimes you need a special thing.

368
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,320
As long as you're paying attention to like the slopes and the angles of the slopes,

369
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
like you can figure out where you can stand and recharge.

370
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,880
So like, I don't know, I managed to climb the whole fucking big,

371
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,280
the biggest mountain area without having to upgrade very much.

372
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,680
Like-

373
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,560
Well, she-

374
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,480
I mean, even if you don't want to upgrade your stamina,

375
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,120
you can always brute force it because if you make good recipes-

376
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
Oh, you can make items and use them.

377
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,520
And yeah, that's true.

378
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,360
Yeah, I've done none of that.

379
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,160
I have not cooked once at the end of the game.

380
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,680
There's like a really cool moment in the beginning.

381
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,560
Like one of the coolest things for me about Breath of the Wild in the beginning

382
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,840
was when you're like talking with the old guy who's like teaching you how to do shit.

383
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,920
And one of the little many things you can do is like,

384
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,160
you have to go to this like ice place,

385
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,240
like this cold like roof top thing, like mountain top.

386
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,840
And you can like cook a bunch of things to like kind of like

387
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,680
temporarily make it so you can go in cold environments and be okay.

388
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,280
Or you can optionally like go and like read his diary

389
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,600
and he's like trying to find a recipe that he forgot about.

390
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
And if you do that, he'll give you a warm coat and then you can just go there.

391
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,280
And it just felt cool.

392
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,760
I just carried a torch.

393
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,880
That's a lot of fun.

394
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,760
That's a lot of fun.

395
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Or oh.

396
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,360
Yeah.

397
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,520
And I didn't learn how to cook until more than halfway through the game.

398
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
God damn it, dude.

399
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
I was just like, where's the tutorial?

400
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,440
Like how the fuck do you cook?

401
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,280
I don't understand because there's nowhere to go and click on something and it says cook.

402
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,440
I got so into cooking because there was a there's a point in the game where you have to-

403
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,280
I think I would get really into cooking.

404
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,320
I think you would, Ben.

405
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
I think it would stop you from doing anything else.

406
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
I think you would just be cooking all the time.

407
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,720
Yeah, I'd just be like, oh my god, I gotta find some fucking black lines and sour potatoes

408
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
and dire apples to make a stew.

409
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
It is definitely absurdly real.

410
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
There are quests all about making recipes in the game.

411
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,920
And the great thing about that is because it's such an impetus to explore the whole

412
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,520
world because certain ingredients only exist in certain places, so you've got to explore.

413
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,840
Which is why I replayed it recently.

414
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,880
But the thing is, I found a bunch of new shrines that I hadn't done before and that was cool.

415
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,280
But the second, I found every tower and it's so satisfying to unlock a tower.

416
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,520
But the second I unlocked my final tower, I had only beaten one of the main beast dungeons.

417
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,040
I hadn't beaten Ganon.

418
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
As soon as I got that last tower, I was like, I'm done.

419
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,840
I'm literally done.

420
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,640
I don't care anymore.

421
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,000
I kind of felt that way as well because getting the towers was the main incentive drive force.

422
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,560
It's so much fun.

423
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,280
That's what I loved.

424
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,400
I want to play again and just do it again because it's so much fun.

425
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,960
But I think that the biggest problem I have with Breath of the Wild is that it needed quest lines.

426
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,560
Not just quests, but quest lines that would force you to do a bunch of things.

427
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,760
Because just playing through the game normally, it's so easy to just go to the...

428
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,200
You need a big gore on sword quest, motherfuckers.

429
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,360
I was going to say a big gore on sword.

430
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,520
Yeah, well, I'm sure there's stuff like that.

431
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,760
But it should have been a lot of the game because it's formatted like in MMO,

432
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,920
like when you go to different regions and stuff.

433
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,960
There should have been quest lines that take you through the whole region.

434
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,280
That you have to do everything because as it stands, the game is basically just

435
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,800
run to a place and do a thing.

436
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,280
So it's like you can just run straight to the towers.

437
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,440
You can just go straight to the villages of each of the four races and just do the...

438
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Fight the ancient guy or whatever.

439
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,240
Like most of the side quests are just go to a place and do a thing.

440
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,680
So it's like there's a lot.

441
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,440
There's a ton of shit to do.

442
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,040
There's a ton of secrets.

443
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,080
Fuckloads of shrines, fuckloads of Korak seeds, all that stuff.

444
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,760
But all of it is just go somewhere and do something.

445
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
It's just a lot of it's really basic.

446
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,560
And then the story on top of it isn't very captivating.

447
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,400
Well, and nothing drives you to go do it.

448
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,600
Like there's no...

449
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
Like why would I choose this thing over that thing?

450
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
Like why would I pick these?

451
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,720
Breath of the Wild is super great.

452
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,640
What it needs, it needs like a...

453
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,200
Just for example, like a Final Fantasy VII,

454
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,400
like story and quest lines just overlaid on top of it with the existing characters.

455
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,080
And then it'd be like the greatest game ever made.

456
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,760
I think another thing that is difficult for me to get into the game is that...

457
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah.

458
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,800
Like in RPGs mainly, like your rewards for doing quest lines is gear,

459
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,720
but like the gear in Breath of the Wild by its very nature doesn't really matter

460
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
because like you're never going to get a cool weapon.

461
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,800
Well, some gear, like like at the very beginning quest,

462
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,080
getting that cold weather gear makes a huge difference to your actual game.

463
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,040
Your armor, like that's really satisfying.

464
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,560
The coolest thing for me was finding the fairies and being able to upgrade your armor

465
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,200
because your armor doesn't break.

466
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes, that's a lot of fun.

467
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,520
For some reason in Breath of the Wild, the cloth is more durable than steel.

468
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,080
Don't ask me how, but that's just how it works.

469
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,240
But like that was cool to be able to like find...

470
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,760
You gotta go find certain ingredients and items and stuff to give to the fairies

471
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,960
so they'll upgrade your gear so it will be better.

472
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,160
I mean, it's like in Dark Souls, doing a quest line can result in you just like

473
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,800
getting an armor set that you can't get anywhere else.

474
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,920
Like I'd be pretty happy with that, even if it's just for fashion souls or you know,

475
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,200
fashion zeldas.

476
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
That can be pretty satisfying, I think.

477
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,160
Yeah, it's like there's not enough...

478
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,920
If the game had some kind of experience system,

479
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,560
it would be...

480
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,280
It would one, instantly change everything for me.

481
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,720
If there was leveling up, I would...

482
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,960
That goes a big way because I just avoid mobs.

483
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,480
I hate fighting mobs in that game.

484
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:32,960
Right.

485
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
Fighting sucks because...

486
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,640
Why do it?

487
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,360
Literally, why?

488
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,200
It just puts you in a worse position in the dungeon.

489
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,640
For that chest of like 30 rupees, is that why I'm gonna expend like 30 explosive arrows and shit?

490
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,200
There is a lot of stuff to buy, so it's not like having lots of rupees isn't good, but like...

491
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,880
But once you unlock the snowball game, that's just the fastest way to get rupees.

492
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,960
And so I just do that end game and I ignore buying anything up to that point.

493
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,560
For me, the problem is like...

494
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,600
There's a lot of areas where it's impossible to gauge whether you should go there yet.

495
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,640
Like you see an enemy.

496
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,280
Yeah.

497
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,680
You know what?

498
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm talking too much about this because I'm planning to talk about it in another place anyway,

499
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,120
and I don't want to spoil my whole goddamn review of the game, but...

500
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,440
All right, fair enough.

501
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,080
So, um...

502
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,360
Hmm?

503
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
I don't want to cut you off.

504
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
All I was gonna say is the thing that like...

505
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,720
The funniest thing that I did in Breath of the Wild is there's a quest early on where you have to like

506
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,880
stealth around a Lionel and like collect arrows or something for the boss battle.

507
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,480
I didn't know that was a stealth section and brute force it and killed it.

508
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,200
And over like 15 tries and it was the coolest thing ever because I told my friend...

509
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
Did you fight that guy?

510
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
I fought him and I beat him.

511
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,080
It took like 15 attempts.

512
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,360
You fucking beat...

513
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
I've never beaten a Lionel to this day.

514
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,600
What?

515
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,320
I just ignore them because I'm scared.

516
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,040
Dude, I fucking could've stopped Lionel now.

517
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,680
No, you know what?

518
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,160
End game, I might have fought one or two, but uh...

519
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,520
I go out and hunt them for fun.

520
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Jesus Christ, you're more of a man than I ever will be, Tom.

521
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,120
That's the best part about the game.

522
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
Okay, literally I'm just...

523
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,160
How did you...

524
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,080
Because I ran out of weapons several times early on while fighting Lionels.

525
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,720
How'd you beat him?

526
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,360
What'd you do?

527
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
Oh god, it was just like...

528
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,280
That's why I got so into cooking because I was like...

529
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,720
Only had like five hearts at the start.

530
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,440
Durability and stopping.

531
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,000
And I just like...

532
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,120
I must really suck at this game if it expects me to beat this Lionel

533
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,720
because I didn't know it was a stealth section.

534
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,400
So I was like, okay, I guess I'm just gonna have to go get really good recipes

535
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,280
and figure out shit so I can like get bonus hearts

536
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,320
and just stack all the best weapons I can.

537
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,880
I got...

538
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,520
The thing is...

539
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,200
The reason I was able to beat it is because I learned the pattern so well

540
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,080
I just was automatically able to counter everything it was doing

541
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,160
because like there's like a parry system.

542
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,320
So I got so good I just parried all of his hits

543
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,160
and like the whole fight happened in slow-mo

544
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,680
and it was fucking sick.

545
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,600
And it was the best part of the entire game.

546
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,120
The game speaks to a problem with me as a gamer

547
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:47,200
which is that I will always choose to engage with as few systems as necessary to beat a game.

548
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,320
Right, right.

549
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Like I get some sick pleasure out of seeing how badly I can play and still win.

550
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,360
Like how little I can contribute.

551
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Like a game like Dark Souls, there's so many different things you could do

552
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,960
but you could just put your points into strength and stamina and just overpower everything.

553
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
Ever since you told me about that, all I do in a Dark Souls,

554
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,680
I just pump up my HP to insane heights and right now I'm playing a dex character

555
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,480
so it's all dex.

556
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,560
It's like there's so many different things you could do

557
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,360
and I understand why other people do it just as a way to find fun in the game.

558
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,080
But I'm not somebody who's gonna play the same game over and over again

559
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,600
just to fuck around and experiment.

560
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,960
So it's like I'm always just gonna try to get it over with as fast as possible.

561
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,280
So it's like there are games that force you to engage with all the systems in order to win

562
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,800
and I think that that's the only way I'll get to really have that mind expansion moment of like,

563
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,960
oh shit there's so much you can do in this game.

564
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,880
That's why I love, I like when games let you ease and casually,

565
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
low skill floor, high skill ceiling.

566
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,480
And like Kingdom Hearts 2, I think does a great job,

567
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
eases you in casually, but then like critical mode or whatever,

568
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,680
final mix stuff, it's got like all these super bosses that you need to learn how to fight.

569
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,720
And that's for me that's why I like that.

570
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,520
That's why I do, if I ever play Breath of the Wild again,

571
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,520
I'll definitely do it in a higher difficulty just because I was expecting to be forced to

572
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,080
learn things.

573
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,560
Like I was expecting to hit a wall at some point and like when I first,

574
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,400
cause I did Zora's domain first, then I went to Death Mountain and it was like,

575
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,960
the enemies seemed too strong for me.

576
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,760
So I was like, okay, the way that the map looks,

577
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
it looks like this is where you're supposed to go second.

578
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,680
So like maybe I really need to go grind and like learn how to play.

579
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,600
And then I just went to the Ruto domain, Rito?

580
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,160
The birds.

581
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,880
So the birds?

582
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,320
I went and did the birds and that was easier than the Zora plays.

583
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,480
And then like by the end of that, I had kind of gotten to a strong enough that I could go

584
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,920
do Death Mountain pretty easily.

585
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,120
And it was just like, oh, okay.

586
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,800
You know, as long as you just do all the easy stuff first,

587
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,480
then the other stuff's not that hard.

588
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,680
I don't know.

589
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
I just felt like I was waiting for that moment where it would be like,

590
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
you can't progress until you get good.

591
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,200
And it never really comes.

592
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah.

593
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,880
So, uh, so I'm reading, uh, reading Brave New World, uh, it sucks.

594
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,120
Is it verbose and boring?

595
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,200
No, it's not that it's verbose and boring.

596
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,120
It's fun and it's a rollicking thrill ride and it's fun and hilarious and good.

597
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,760
I like it a lot.

598
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm, I'm reading it slowly.

599
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,120
It's very short book, but I'm only like a quarter of the way through it.

600
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:24,000
But I, I gotta say, it is so fucking corny and unsubtle and like cartoonish.

601
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,640
It is, it is a fucking.

602
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,280
Tell me about it.

603
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,600
How so?

604
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,680
It is like, it is like a caricature.

605
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,000
It is like a caricature of dystopian fiction.

606
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,880
That's the idea.

607
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,200
Yeah.

608
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,040
It's meant to be kind of parody of America.

609
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,760
Okay.

610
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,400
I should read that.

611
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
Well, no, no, it's like, okay.

612
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,360
Well, like I read 1984 when I was maybe like 23 or something.

613
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,160
You know, so an adult, a young adult, but an adult.

614
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
And I thought it was great.

615
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,640
And I loved it.

616
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,680
And, um, is it a little ridiculous?

617
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,400
Oh, maybe.

618
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,080
But, uh, it was compelling.

619
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,800
I loved it.

620
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm reading Brave New World and Brave New World.

621
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,120
Was it ridiculous when it's our modern day?

622
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,120
It's like, it's like, they'll have like big scenes of like they're going,

623
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,200
they're going through like the human like embryo hatchery.

624
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,320
And they're like, yes, yes.

625
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,360
We breed all the embryos.

626
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,600
Yeah.

627
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:09,840
Yeah.

628
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,720
And here we sort them out.

629
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:10,880
Yep.

630
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
We have like a perfect system.

631
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,760
Ah, and here's where we introduce alcohol into the blood streams of the lower classes.

632
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,360
So they'll come out retarded and be incapable of doing anything.

633
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,680
Yes.

634
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,920
Society truly is wonderful.

635
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,440
Maybe there's some utility to that.

636
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,520
Like it's important to have a lower class like.

637
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:27,840
No, yeah.

638
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
That is the point.

639
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,800
That's the point in the book is that they make the lower class retarded.

640
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
So that they will not strive for more.

641
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,960
Like they don't understand the concept of wanting more.

642
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,440
So they just do stupid menial jobs and they literally are are like like bread and like

643
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,040
psychologically conditioned to think nothing and just straight up like be catatonic until

644
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,000
someone of a higher caste barks an order at them to do the one thing they've been conditioned

645
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,160
to derive pleasure from doing such as operating an elevator or whatever to you in concept.

646
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,760
I think that's great.

647
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,560
It's a fucking.

648
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,400
Well, I mean, it's a horrible fucking nightmarish thing to do to a person.

649
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,880
Well, yeah.

650
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,600
I mean, that's the.

651
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,560
You can make an argument for that.

652
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:12,800
Sure.

653
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,400
The idea though is that like this is how you would craft a society in a way where nobody's

654
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,440
nobody within the society is going to think it's bad because they are literally conditioned

655
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,800
from embryonic states to participate in it.

656
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,160
Like it's the ultimate authoritative state where nobody questions it at all because they

657
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,280
literally are controlled from birth to not question anything.

658
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,600
Right.

659
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,640
It's just built up on the back of like a baseline of like a like atrocity.

660
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:40,960
Right.

661
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,400
Like just the society itself to call that atrocity.

662
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,520
Yes, it fucking is.

663
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,840
All right.

664
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,480
Here's why that feels wrong.

665
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,720
Even though basically what that's what is happening is that they're rearing cattle to

666
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,400
do like a thing like cattle would rather not be eaten for me, but they don't know any better.

667
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,280
But like the thing that makes it gross and weird is that they're humans just like the

668
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,720
people at the highest state.

669
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,920
And it's it's, you know, a human is controlled getting to decide who gets to live on the lower

670
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,320
classes and who gets to live on the higher classes.

671
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,480
And that just feels unfair and uncontrollable.

672
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,440
Right.

673
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,960
I mean, I just got for sure.

674
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,560
It's only inhumane from your perspective as a as a human who values his personal freedom.

675
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:26,880
Sure.

676
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,240
I guess if I guess if you asked that guy, I guess if you asked one of these

677
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,160
semi morons as they're literally called in the text, I guess if you asked one of them,

678
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,440
they'd be like, yeah, it's great.

679
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,400
That's what makes it good.

680
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,280
That's why I like the book.

681
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,080
It's horrible.

682
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,280
It's horrible.

683
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,560
It but it's so cartoonishly.

684
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,160
It's so cartoonishly evil.

685
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,440
It's like, well, that's a fun of it.

686
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,680
It's like taking it to the farthest flung possible extreme because like, I mean, I don't

687
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,200
But it's so cartoonish that I can't I can't even take it seriously.

688
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,600
It doesn't feel like a meaningful satire.

689
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,120
Is there other things going on like that?

690
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,320
I mean, are there like, yeah, they're like, they're like, ah, here's the chamber.

691
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,080
You're like, they get some like, not like that low class, but like the sort of low class.

692
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,960
So like, oh, yep.

693
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,760
Here we go.

694
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,520
Some newly decanted babies.

695
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,200
Let's watch as we condition them.

696
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,320
And then they send the these newly decanted babies in and like they crawl in and they put

697
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,760
like books and flowers around and they're like, yep, here we go.

698
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,240
Yep.

699
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,840
Take find those books and flowers.

700
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,320
All right.

701
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,240
Turn on the fucking electric floor and then they like send like shock with shocks through

702
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,760
these babies and like, oh, yeah, we'll do this several thousand times.

703
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,520
And then these infant babies will learn not to read books or like nature.

704
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,840
Yeah.

705
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,520
Society truly is wonderful.

706
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,480
Hail our Ford.

707
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,400
I was like, they literally worship Henry Ford.

708
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,200
It's hilarious.

709
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,840
Yeah.

710
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,480
That's fine.

711
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,200
That's fine.

712
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,520
This sounds like the level of like cartoonish like hell scape that you would find in

713
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
some like doge and whether breeding.

714
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,240
The funny thing about it is that Brave New World was created by a British author who

715
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,800
like came to America and just saw the way Americans act and wanted to write a book that

716
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,680
was like his like extreme like parody version of what he thought they already were like.

717
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,920
Yeah, dude, hard to agree.

718
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,080
Like just the sheer consumerism of America and like the way that people acted.

719
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,360
He was like, this is this is a hedonistic nightmare world.

720
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,800
I'm going to write a book about it.

721
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,240
What's what's bugging what's bugging me about it is that like some of the things

722
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,480
in it are things that I think are cool.

723
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,440
Like I think that I think that everyone being hatched in an embryo hatchery would be sick.

724
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,560
But then he's got to throw in the thing about like turning some people into like more on mutants.

725
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,000
You know, I get your point on that.

726
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,600
So, you know, like this is a dystopia.

727
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,280
I just got through a part where they're like, okay, I don't really understand this part.

728
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,640
They have this slogan that's like everyone belongs to everyone else.

729
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,840
And the idea is like monogamy is considered like a sin.

730
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,000
It's like monogamy is bad and deviant.

731
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Everybody posts everybody all the time.

732
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
Well, you're supposed to fuck everyone.

733
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,840
But it's not like you're made to do it.

734
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,800
Like because like some people are like more attractive.

735
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,920
Like you like people still get to choose who they fuck.

736
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,800
So it's like, I don't know.

737
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,280
So I don't know if it like it's presented.

738
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,120
And I think you're supposed to recoil and be like,

739
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,800
everyone's fucking so many people.

740
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
They don't think they don't believe in monogamy.

741
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,320
That's like, what a nightmare.

742
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,960
Am I right?

743
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,960
A world where monogamy isn't seen as like this holy to be held up in the world.

744
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,760
Again, written by a guy in like the what, the 50s or 60s who came to America in LA

745
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,120
and saw everybody fucking it was like, put his mom,

746
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,720
twitched his monocle at his head.

747
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,000
This is this is filth.

748
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,280
These Americans, well, that's what, well, that's what annoys me about it.

749
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,040
Is that this idea is presented as like, like this is so look how

750
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,800
horrible a society like this is.

751
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,760
And I'm like, well, I mean,

752
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,200
do we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater on all it?

753
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,360
Just give me my embryo hatcheries and I'll be happy.

754
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,600
Keep out the deliberate retardation stuff.

755
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,360
And you know, what's so interesting about that sort of thing is

756
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,480
that we see that that particular complaint as very dated and old fashioned.

757
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,560
And like, well, it's not even that bad.

758
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
But I don't think it's that old fashioned.

759
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,760
I mean, I think, I mean, I think people feel like that now.

760
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,040
I think Zoomer Zoomers love monogamy fucking perverts.

761
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Well, it's it's just sort of like in the future.

762
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:26,160
If this was PCP episode 8000 and we like a new like N U Ben was reading the same book.

763
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,520
And he was like, you know, like having no problems with anything because that

764
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,600
there is no problem with anything.

765
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,120
Like like the cultural the culture has shifted to the point where

766
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,320
things that used to be very upsetting are no longer upsetting,

767
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,480
which is something that happens through history a lot.

768
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:47,600
Yeah.

769
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,960
It was like, hmm.

770
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,560
Well, that's why we have so many.

771
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,800
Oh, the world is exactly like 1984 articles because, well, yeah.

772
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,200
Yeah.

773
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,000
The stuff he was writing about is stuff that became real.

774
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,600
And like it was it was like, yeah, this this would happen.

775
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,680
And it did.

776
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,720
So here we are.

777
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,120
Well, there's a distinction to be made there.

778
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,640
I mean, at least kind of.

779
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,240
Like was the idea behind the book.

780
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,960
I don't I haven't read it.

781
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,800
I don't know the guy who read it who wrote it or anything.

782
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,720
1984 of Raveneworld.

783
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,680
I guess really both.

784
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,760
Because like are they simply.

785
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,160
I mean, I would think if I was going to sit down and be like, okay, the future,

786
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,680
I'm seeing things that could be bad.

787
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,880
So here's what I'm going to do.

788
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,240
I'm going to write a book about what I expect.

789
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,000
Like I'm seeing bad things in society.

790
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,760
I'm writing a book about the like how things could progress along that way.

791
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,120
And my goal will be to represent the future that I see

792
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,960
realistically from my perspective, but to illustrate how specifically those things

793
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,080
could be bad, which is very different from simply like imposing that and also saying

794
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,600
also people like will be evil at the same time as these things.

795
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,520
Well, it's basically it's not that it's evil.

796
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,920
It's that it's they're raised in a society with like twisted morals that makes them that way.

797
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,240
It's that the it's basically both books are slippery slope arguments.

798
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,960
It's like if we keep following the trend of thought that is carrying us in the direction

799
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,200
we're going, this is where that ends up.

800
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:16,000
If we, you know, if we allow that, like if we allow ourselves to be in a surveillance state

801
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,120
and constantly, you know, having the state monitor us and we become more and more comfortable

802
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,360
with it and more and more okay with it, then they will be able to impose, you know,

803
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,560
crazier and crazier shit until just a hundred years down the line.

804
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,400
It's fucking a totally different society where, you know, individual thought and freedom is

805
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,120
totally not even considered a thing you want to have, you know.

806
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,320
Right, right. Yeah, no, fair enough, fair enough.

807
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,920
I don't know. I guess I just want people to, I mean, like, for example, like on the monogamy point,

808
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,000
like I would say that I think monogamy thus far in human history has been a relatively useful

809
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,080
concept. Now, I could doubt like, I don't think that there's any moral imperative for anyone to

810
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,120
engage in it specifically. However, I would say that as society has progressed, it seems like it

811
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,000
has been relatively useful. And so like in like a Brave New World thing, I could write a book

812
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,440
about how like maybe everything else is the same, but monogamy goes away and I could potentially see

813
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,600
like how that could cause problems for society if that kept going. Well, yet to remember in Brave

814
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,600
New World, people do know the idea of family doesn't exist. All babies are born in test tubes,

815
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,760
they're all raised by the state. So like they're the only reason you fuck is just to keep your

816
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,800
stress levels down, basically. Like it's just like the reason everybody's encouraged to fuck

817
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,200
all the time is just to keep them in a good mood, essentially. Like everybody fucks all the time,

818
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,720
everybody does tons of drugs, they all fly around in private helicopters.

819
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,760
What you need is a gram of soma. Yeah, all like clothes are built to only last for like two

820
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,680
weeks so that you're constantly buying new stuff. Like it's fun about like the having to fuck all

821
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,480
the time because like if the guy right in the book didn't want to have that as a point,

822
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,040
it would make more sense for them in the test tubes to like get rid of the sex drive so that they

823
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,240
they don't need to get distracted. Maybe he thought that wasn't possible. I mean,

824
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,000
I don't know what he thought was like intrinsic to human beings and what like could be you know,

825
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
removed or whatever, because it sounds like he does like conditioning more than like genetic

826
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,600
manipulation. Like they give alcohol, which is like a physical substance, you know, when they're

827
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,440
young or whatever to fuck them up and then they shock them or something. I think the overall

828
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:35,120
like thought behind the book is basically if we had a society whose purpose first and foremost was

829
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:41,760
to perpetuate itself, like the only purpose of society was continued growth and continued,

830
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:49,200
you know, just being bigger and bigger and more and more of itself, then this is the best way,

831
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,960
like, you know, this is the most expedient way to go about that. Like this method would work

832
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,360
in theory, like the way this world is structured. It just is so repulsive to us because we look at

833
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,600
it and we go, well, this is antithetical to what we actually want out of life. So clearly,

834
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,760
you know, the, I think the reflection you're supposed to take out of that is, okay, well,

835
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,680
then maybe a society built to perpetuate itself isn't inherently a good thing and we shouldn't

836
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,200
look at our advances in the world through that lens. Maybe we should not think about, you know,

837
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,480
only how to make things more efficient, more, you know, more and more factory. What's the

838
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,240
word I'm looking for? Industrialized. Like, you know, we should take a step back and weave that

839
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,880
into our lives more carefully as opposed to plunging into it, especially in, again, the era

840
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,840
it was written where we're still in the industrial age, you know, which has kind of given way to the

841
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,800
digital age now. We, you know, we don't, we're not trying to make more and more people. We're not

842
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,080
trying, you know, the era of the baby boomer is over, but it would have been like this book would

843
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:58,160
have come out like when the baby boom had just happened, you know. So I think that's why like

844
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,280
the culture of America at the time did more closely resemble this. And like, you know, we always

845
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,560
talk about things like, oh, like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting as like a creepy thing,

846
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,120
you know, we look at something like Pleasantville or, or whatever, like all those fifties sitcom

847
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:18,960
ideas. And that stuff is creepy to us now because it is so conformist, it's so non,

848
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,800
you know, individual. No, no, people talk about Norman, when they say, oh, it's like out of a

849
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,440
Norman Rockwell painting, it's like, it's like, oh, it's like a wholesome pure. Some people say it

850
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,040
that way. Justice in the American way. Some people say it as in it's a nightmare. Like, I mean, have

851
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,120
you ever seen the movie Pleasantville? Yeah, no, but I'm familiar. It's basically about like a guy

852
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,280
who's obsessed with this fifties sitcom that's like that, you know, white picket fence traditional

853
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,720
nuclear family kind of setup. But like once they they get sucked into the show, and like once they're

854
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,080
there, they realize how that society, like all the problems with a society that functions that way.

855
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,080
Sounds like a Twilight Zone episode. I mean, not to get too into it, but like, I mean, I remember

856
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,000
reading Not to Kill a Mockingbird, what's that book with Holden Caulfield and the

857
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,480
Catcher of the Rye, I think was written specifically to show that like this Leave it to Beaver facade

858
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,040
of fifties culture was actually belying like an underlying darkness that was like more of the

859
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,880
reality. That's also what all of David Lynch's movies are about as well. Oh, yeah. But I mean,

860
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,480
doesn't Catcher of the Rye more about just like young people being like hypocrites and like it's

861
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,160
about many things like teen angst and stuff about many things. I think that that is one of the

862
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,880
things that comes along with. Yeah, okay. In any case, yeah, I think that Brave New World reflected

863
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,000
this idea of like, you know, what where the industrialization and the sort of brainwashing

864
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,960
because very much so we were being brainwashed back then like the boomer generation is a brainwash

865
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,520
generation. They were told what to buy, how to live, you know, I mean, we still are. Yeah,

866
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,760
but I think that since the sixties that like when they, you know, the hippie movement and

867
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,640
everything was about breaking away from that conditioning and like that's where alternative

868
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,640
lifestyle became a thing. And now like alternative lifestyle is, I mean, it's not even really

869
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,280
alternative anymore. It's like there's basically just multiple lifestyles you can have that are

870
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,840
all like alternative lifestyles are were just they were maybe they were a thing at some point,

871
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,480
but then they were just commodified in and of themselves and turned into that's that's good

872
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,080
to me. Like I think that that's fine because no nightmare nightmare. Well, it speaks to the fact

873
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:34,480
that society is a better place to live that you are not if you have an alternative lifestyle

874
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:41,280
instead of being killed, they just sell you shit. You know, like, I think that's a better situation

875
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:48,880
to be in. I mean, better than being killed. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I don't want my

876
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,840
everything is bad once it's commodified once once it's being sold to you. I mean,

877
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,200
you got to always try to find, you know, a new way to be even more alternative. But like,

878
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:07,920
I think at some point, you know, if we have enough acceptance that literally no matter

879
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,480
how alternative your viewpoint is, you're being catered to, it just means that we've basically

880
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:21,840
achieved world peace. You are a neoliberal capitalist shill and a stooge. And how could you

881
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,480
be a neoliberal and a capitalist? Isn't that aren't they like that's the same? That's that's

882
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,000
that's what linear like neoliberalism is capitalism focused. Okay, well, what's all the

883
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,840
what's all the fucking commie shit then that's going on?

884
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:43,040
Oh, no, neoliberalism is like centrist liberalism. That is leftist is leftist is like,

885
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,000
like, liberal is basically like milk toast, like like everyone. Okay, I think it's used

886
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,320
differently in America. Like in America, there's like, you see the dichotomy of liberal versus

887
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:58,480
conservative. I think globally, liberalism is a philosophy is a basically a mostly

888
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,760
universally accepted philosophy that is pretty much just the default. And like,

889
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,880
okay, but what do we call all communism are left of that all these kids leftism all the

890
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,280
so those are just leftists. That's the only word for it. You I think you basically have to be at

891
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,240
least a socialist to be a true lefty. Okay, if you're if you're just a if you're just a garden

892
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,720
variety, but neoliberal is not the same. I just thought it meant the new left.

893
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:31,040
Uh, neoliberalism is well, it's the new it's the it's the new it's the mainstream. It's what

894
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:37,680
the mainstream left has become in in in late stage terminal capitalism. It seems to me like the

895
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,000
mainstream. Well, I don't know. I don't even know what these are just definition terms. This is

896
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,640
really boring. But I got really fucking boring. You're just talking about a definition. That's

897
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,800
all it is. Yeah, a definition. Well, it's an important definition. And we can't fuck like,

898
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,400
I'll bet there's people that don't know this. I'll bet there's people that are misused if they

899
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,720
know what a word means or not. Shut the fuck up. Did you did you didn't know what the word meant?

900
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,720
So now we can hear and argue about this all day. Or we can we can I'm not arguing. I'm giving facts

901
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,680
that were previously unknown or we can we can we can bring it back. We can go to urban dictionary

902
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,320
and we can find out for what neoliberalism is. Yeah, okay. Do you have that pulled up? I don't.

903
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,000
Let's get no and none of us do and I don't care anymore. So if anybody has anything else to

904
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,440
talk about, I've got another another concept that I just learned this last week, at least it became

905
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,400
fully clear to me that I think is real cool. And it puts a point on things. Urban dictionary,

906
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,680
neoliberalism, the belief that allowing the wealthy to extract more money from the labor of other

907
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:45,520
people will lead to better conditions for those people. Example, neoliberalism. This is

908
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,080
retarded. That's literally what capital. Well, it really depends on what you mean by the word

909
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,840
extract there, but I don't want to get into it. Example, neoliberalism doesn't work,

910
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,880
semi colon. The proof is all around you. Okay, so so what I learned from this is that I had

911
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,320
thought neoliberal was a buzzword that the right made up, but now I realize it's a buzzword that

912
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,400
the left made up. So either way, it's retarded. But now I know which side it comes from.

913
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:16,080
Well, whatever. I think we can all agree the buzzing is really annoying and I hate insects.

914
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,240
Hey, listen to this word, this phrase that I just learned a couple of days ago. It's okay,

915
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,920
it's like it's a it's from a specific field of journalism. And it's the journalistic principle

916
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,320
of minimizing harm. And I just learned what this meant. And I think you'll all agree,

917
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,520
it's a valuable thing that people who make YouTube videos and whatnot should be should be on

918
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,800
board with and I tweeted about it the other day. But basically what it is is it's well,

919
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,360
it's just not including information. Okay, when you're being a journalist, and I would argue

920
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,880
anyone who like makes a tweet is kind of being a journalist because you're making like a public

921
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,120
post about stuff. It's like, including information that is not specifically like serving the benefit

922
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,640
of the public, or like, you know, in your journalistic capacity, such as it is, doing good,

923
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,800
like for the world by publishing, like just for example, if you write a story about like,

924
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,600
this is an extreme example, or you make a tweet about like, I hate this guy so and so,

925
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,880
and you include just for a crazy example, like his name, social security number, address, phone

926
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,440
number, etc. It's like, okay, you're letting people know the information about this person who

927
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,520
maybe you hate or you think he maybe he put fucking pushed your milk at lunch or something.

928
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:32,160
But like, is that necessary to include? No, you're definitely doing it as a way to like,

929
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,840
give the guy harassment, or, you know, it's just not necessary. And so you're what you're not doing

930
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,960
is adhering to the principle of minimizing harm when reporting on stories like this.

931
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,120
And like, like a lot of attack videos, and like takedown and call out culture, like all the stuff

932
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:55,280
with like, James Charles lately, it just included like tons of and you see this on like every call

933
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:01,920
out video ever, there's so much information that is simply put in there to humiliate and like insults

934
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,880
and deride the person, which does not serve like what one might think of as the thesis of,

935
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,000
I don't know, so and so is a hypocrite on these specific principles for XYZ reason.

936
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,720
I agree. And I think that's a good thing to do. But in those videos, you're talking about specifically,

937
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,240
those are trying to maximize harm. Like, I mean, absolutely. Right.

938
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,840
You're absolutely right. I mean, let's not let's not pretend that YouTube is journalism.

939
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,120
Well, I mean, it's trying to say is that we need to, if we see people deliberately trying to

940
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:35,280
maximize harm to be not okay with that, yeah, to call out the people doing the call outs,

941
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,280
if they're being, if they're like, you know, to make it something that we bash people on

942
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,120
Twitter for, just be like, Hey, I want to put a word to it because I see people doing it and

943
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,920
it makes me upset and mad. And I didn't really know how to phrase it. But now I know, like,

944
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,160
you're trying to maximize harm to the law, like the way that the law works and how we punish people

945
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,040
is based on a principle of minimizing harm. Like, we don't like, let's say somebody murdered

946
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,480
somebody else, we don't just jump and kill that guy. We like put them through a system to figure

947
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:11,600
out like, okay, like, what is the minimum amount we can do to this person that is still going to,

948
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:17,040
you know, allow retribution, allow everybody to be sort of comfortable with the result of it,

949
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,080
you know, like, yeah, you know, maybe, maybe we could say, okay, well, you're going to present

950
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,920
professionals doing it at least, you'll go to prison for 25 years to life, you know, we'll

951
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,720
make a determination over the course of those 25 years, if you have reformed as a person and we

952
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,640
didn't have to kill you and you can continue to contribute to society, maybe you will, maybe you

953
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,160
won't. But like, that is minimizing harm in a way, it's like, it's like, we've got and it doesn't

954
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,320
do any good for the world to just hurt people over this and it drives people apart. And it's a

955
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:49,120
large part of like, call out cultures, cause and it's like, you got people who commit murder,

956
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,120
get like murder, like first degree intentional murder, or let's say second degree, whatever,

957
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,560
they get out of jail. And those people oftentimes are like less hated publicly than like, like,

958
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:05,120
you know, just James Charles for what exactly, I don't know, being slightly sexually forward with

959
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,680
some people who were not even opposed to it. And then, you know, it got debunked. I don't know,

960
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,400
I don't know who James Charles is, but can you give me like a concrete example of a violation

961
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,680
of this principle of minimizing harm? Well, I was trying to avoid it, the name. Okay. But like,

962
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:25,280
the one that's in mind right now is what Mr Meat Man made his video about monkey lately. And I like,

963
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,600
monkey himself even said like, I accept this is true. But when I like, I don't care what monkey

964
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:39,120
thinks, I think that video was so overly cruel and took the absolute worst possible interpretation

965
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,440
of every point. And I think monkey has kind of painted himself into a corner where he feels

966
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,560
like he has to just say, this is fine, because he has done things like this in the past, which I

967
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:54,080
whatever, not interested in discussing. But it's like, but I on the sidelines say, this is wrong.

968
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,480
I think you're going too far. This doesn't seem fair. It's overly cruel. And you're, you know,

969
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,560
not even the points are wrong, but it's the most insulting interpretation. And when you get to

970
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,200
the end of the video, and it's because he's like personally mad at monkey, it's like, well, Jesus,

971
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,120
is this really an appropriate, you know, backlash for that stuff? I don't even think it's going to

972
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:21,520
stick that long. But I just think it's fucked up. Well, I mean, what's the, I mean, that's not

973
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:26,320
journalism. That's gossip. Like the point of that video is that it's gossip. It's juicy gossip.

974
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,920
But the problem is weird. That's what it sets out to be. And that's what it does. True. But I

975
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,520
think that like gossip deserves to be mocked, not taken seriously, condemned, insulted, you know,

976
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,640
on its merits, which are none. And then like, we just be like, oh, well, yeah, this is trash.

977
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,840
But it's not treated as trash. It's treated as, wow, Mr. Medeker 2, I love this guy. Can't

978
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,800
I just subscribe for more? I mean, it's interesting because it's human drama that's actually real.

979
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,000
And we learn even more from it than watching like a show about it, you know, like that's why

980
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,560
gossip has, it has some intellectual content to it. Like, you know, there's a reason to consume it

981
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,760
as a human for, you know, self-preservational purposes. Right. But we can't just ignore like

982
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,760
all the math. And now I just have a word for what I'm seeing. Like you could make that video

983
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,680
in a way that's totally reasonable. But like what I'm seeing is a man. How could you,

984
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:23,120
how could you make that video in a way that's, I mean, just for example, if you would be,

985
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,920
there would be nothing to it. Maybe there shouldn't be, you know, a little baggage

986
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,080
saddled to it. A story about, I think your problem, because I think it's my problem as well,

987
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:38,800
is that if it was just a video where it's just like, I'm mad at X person and I'm going to fucking

988
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:44,320
dunk on them for 20 minutes, like not, not great, not my cup of tea, like does feel uncomfortable,

989
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,040
but understandable. The problem is a lot of these takedown videos are presented in a way that I'm

990
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:53,280
doing this for the greater good. Like this is a good thing I'm doing. And then they proceed to

991
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,960
like very personally attack somebody. So it's like that's trying, they're trying to make a documentary

992
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,280
about. And for the love of God, people, I'm not saying go shit on Mr. Meat Man. Could I be any

993
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,560
more fucked? I'm, that's not the point. It's a, it's a global phenomenon. I'm criticizing the

994
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,040
concept of this stuff. Jesus Christ, don't get me involved in some beef with Mr. Meat Man. I don't

995
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,920
give a fuck. But you know, you know, I'm just saying, I oppose the idea. Let me tell you,

996
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,240
this is something, something's kind of related. So I, so I'm in, I'm in sheep overs discord and

997
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,920
some people were talking about, uh, you guys remember, uh, FNGR? Of course. Yeah. That's that

998
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:37,440
fucking moron. Uh, well, he, he somehow. I think he still listens to the PCP. So. Hey, FNGR, you're

999
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:45,440
a fucking loser. Um, so he, he somehow managed to finagle. He got them, uh, the girl, uh, Lou,

1000
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,880
Lou, Lou the kitty. Yes. The one, the one that, uh, the, the monkey shit. Uh, you know, uh,

1001
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:56,160
and she got her on, he got her on stream with a bunch of people and I listened to some of it and

1002
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:04,720
like they get her to call the cops on herself and tell, yes, and tell them, and tell them that, hey,

1003
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:11,120
I had sex with a minor. Are you, what the fuck is that about? What kind of human being are we dealing

1004
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:17,520
with here? Well, the thing is, uh, wait, who, FNGR? No, I'm just like, how weak willed and like,

1005
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,280
weirdly. Yeah. Okay. But whatever. Go on. Go on. She seems like she's not very smart at all, but

1006
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,160
also she's maybe on a bunch of medication. Well, the thing is she says that she already told like

1007
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,960
her therapists and other policemen on other occasions about it. So it's, I don't, I don't get the feeling

1008
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,960
that anything's actually going to happen. I mean, look, on subjects like this, do you think any of

1009
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:44,240
those guys like give a fuck about like protecting the kids in her community? No, not at all. They

1010
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,040
just want to start shit. That's, that's what I was going to say. Yeah. Yeah. They, they, they do this.

1011
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:53,440
And then even while she's still in the call waiting for the cop to show up at the door,

1012
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,600
they're like patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves like this person is

1013
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,200
a danger to the community. We did another pedo locked up. Ladies and gentlemen, we did it.

1014
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,680
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him. We've saved the fucking community. We've made the world a better

1015
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,720
place. All this hand wringing and stuff. And like, they're not fucking, they don't fucking care.

1016
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,880
They want to feel better than someone. They want to, they want, literally it's virtue signaling.

1017
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,600
Yeah. Like, okay, okay. If this person committed a crime, they should be tried, you know, as a

1018
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:25,280
criminal. Absolutely. But that's not what they're doing. This is where I plug my other podcast,

1019
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:31,280
Artso Farto's Whirling Dervish episode three, where I talk about all this, the gay, gay ops of

1020
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,960
thrones as I call it. Oh yes. So yeah. So anyway, this, this, this was all, this was all a bunch of

1021
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,840
virtue signaling, self-congratulatory horseshit, FNGR, you and your friends are fucking stupid.

1022
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,480
You should die. I take no personal positions on any of this, but I mean, yeah, I mean,

1023
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,520
it's, it's retarded. It's fucking, there's so much of this shit, man. I, it really, like,

1024
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:56,240
I will never in my fucking life get involved with any of this shit. And it's such a lucrative

1025
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,960
mark. And I'm not saying that like I'm tempted to, I have no desire and I never will. But like,

1026
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,040
I just see the reality on the ground that all you do is you make a X person exposed video,

1027
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,520
you find like the most basic, like non substantial evidence you possibly can,

1028
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,760
boom, you got yourself 50,000 subs. You got a burgeoning career now. Let's go baby.

1029
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,720
Well, that's the thing. Okay. This is my thing. It's, I mean, okay. Yeah. You watch the Meat Man

1030
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:28,160
video and you come away with a sense like boy, that was some juicy gossip, but also Meat Man

1031
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,200
kind of seems like a fucking loser. Like, why is he so obsessed with this?

1032
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,200
Gee, you think Meat Man's a fucking loser?

1033
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,200
Yeah. I mean, I think he would agree because he says he does it for like a $10 thing. It's

1034
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:42,240
kind of silly. So I mean, I mean, he's so invested. Like he's, he like, I don't know,

1035
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,480
you can tell from his voice that he's just like, he's like savoring it. He like can't

1036
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:51,200
fucking wait to share this like delicious. He like, he can't wait to take this guy down.

1037
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,960
Right. He doesn't come off very well.

1038
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,520
If anybody is surprised that Mr. Meat Man is a piece of shit, you have not been paying

1039
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:04,080
attention. Okay. Okay. So that's all fine. However, I don't know if I can blame him

1040
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,760
in a, if, for like, for making the video, because you know that like he, like, you know

1041
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,960
his channel grew because of it, you know, new people heard about him that never would have

1042
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,960
heard about him otherwise. Like he was sitting on like this information that he made the video

1043
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,520
on, he was literally sitting on a gold mine. And like, how could you expect him for like,

1044
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,760
of attention, right? In the attention economy and how he would be shooting himself in the foot

1045
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,960
not to make this video. So how could you expect him to do otherwise?

1046
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:35,280
Well, I mean, I, but, I mean, in the same way I kind of expect myself not to because I didn't.

1047
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,520
I mean, I've got plenty of insider. What do you mean you didn't?

1048
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,200
I mean, look, I've obviously not like been friends with mum for that long, but like,

1049
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,600
I have plenty of insider information. I could make some sort of exposed video,

1050
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,200
but then I think to myself, oh wait, I'm not a fucking asshole scumbag. On who? On who?

1051
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,680
On, look, I mean, look, theoretically on like anyone in our chat, I could like go,

1052
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,920
like I'm just saying, like the possibility exists. Any of us could make exposed videos

1053
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,960
on any other of us. And you know, it'd be great. If you play the gay ox of thrones,

1054
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,000
you are a piece of shit. You have to accept that about yourself. And everybody needs to look at

1055
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,200
it that way. Be entertained, have fun, watch people shit on each other, but know that the

1056
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,760
people doing it are shit. And you are shit for participating.

1057
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,200
And you're making the world a worse place. If you accept all that, I can understand that.

1058
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:24,400
You know what? Yeah, I can agree. Like you like, like, if you're going to get in there and throw

1059
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,000
shit, right? If you're if you're one of the people in there throwing shit, that's fine. Maybe

1060
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,800
it's an entertaining spectacle, right? You are covered in shit. Yes. And you are remind you,

1061
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,440
monkey was playing the gay ops of thrones the whole fucking time. So I don't really feel any

1062
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,760
sympathy for him in this regard. Well, I mean, I feel sympathy for anyone in this situation.

1063
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,880
I don't feel sympathy for anyone for basically anything. I didn't feel it about anyone involved

1064
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,720
in the projared thing. I don't feel it in anything involved in this thing. Yeah, I mean,

1065
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:56,720
he that's why he says like, he said he said in his no, he said in his response to it, like, you

1066
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,600
know, if if this like, if this video were about anyone else, I would think it was funny. Yeah,

1067
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,880
yeah, this this kind of thing is not exactly, but it's not okay. It's not too far away from the

1068
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:12,080
sort of thing that monkey traffics in. But me strapped on my white knight armor. I feel like

1069
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,560
yes, like there there's many people who are in the shit, they can't defend themselves because

1070
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,680
they've done too much shit. We need outside heroes outside white knight, such as myself to come in

1071
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,560
and police. I mean, we kind of need content cops to be like, this is fucked up, people shouldn't

1072
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,240
be celebrating that this is being done. And like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean?

1073
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,920
We need content cops back up a second. What are you talking about? I'm saying I'm not saying like,

1074
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,160
we need YouTube to enforce what's okay. I'm saying like, I think that what I dubs did, I'm not saying

1075
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:42,560
I dubs like a hero or anything. Wait, what did I dubs do? Well, he made a series called content

1076
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,800
cop, where like, specifically what he did was he, he made videos, you know, they're just there,

1077
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,960
you could call them drama videos too. But like the point of them was, and you could say he went

1078
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,400
too far, so like personal stuff was included, he did not minimize harm across the board,

1079
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,920
fair enough. But like, the conceit of them was to push back against practices, like Leafy did,

1080
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,640
that was kind of bullying in many ways against, I don't like, you know, like Jake Paul or something,

1081
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:10,320
I think, or no rice gum, rice gum. And again, I don't know any of the specifics. I just, I see

1082
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,360
a utility of like us as a community, even age three did this like a bunch, you could say he

1083
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,000
doesn't do it as much anymore. I see a, and I am not going to be the man to do it. It's not happening

1084
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,280
for me, no interest. I'm not involved at all. I'm going to make funny anime videos. But like,

1085
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,480
I just like it, I don't think we should just like all be like, yep, this is fine. No one's

1086
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,480
being punished for this. Everything's great. It just seems, yeah, I mean, that's it, you know,

1087
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:40,160
I feel like content was the genesis of this entire subgenre on you, you can make an argument,

1088
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,840
it's propagating the cycle or is kind of a problem itself. But I don't know, like, you don't, you

1089
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,960
don't have to like, epically dunk on people the way that content cop does, you can like, I don't

1090
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,720
know, be a little more nuanced. I think it's what Ben is saying, though, like the more you dunk on

1091
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:59,520
someone, the better your video is going to do. One needs to become an aesthetic and absolve

1092
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:05,040
oneself of the pleasure of dunking on anyone and simply point out like, look, it is, it is wrong

1093
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:12,000
to do XYZ. I'm just saying we live, listen, okay, let me, let me, let me finish this thought, just

1094
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,800
give me like one minute to kind of, could kind of work this out. Like we live, you know, we're on

1095
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:23,360
YouTube, we're in an economy where attention is the currency and like anything you can do to get

1096
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,960
attention like will get you ahead, like almost like, you know, there are maybe certain kinds of

1097
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,280
negative attention that might backfire on you, but like 99% of the time, there's no such thing as

1098
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,840
bad publicity, anything you can get to do to do eyes on you. That's what you, that's what you

1099
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:44,240
logically should do to get ahead and succeed. I just kind of, I feel with Nate's whole point here,

1100
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:51,840
like on like a logical level, like an emotional moral level, I feel similarly to you, but I also

1101
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:59,440
feel like acting on morals is no, first of all, no one's doing that at all ever. And second of all,

1102
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:08,000
I'm not going to really hold anybody to it. Like, I mean, Nate, you, you pirate everything you consume.

1103
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:15,520
And it's fair to criticize me on that one point. Right. And so you know that like,

1104
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,440
nothing is going to compel you to even operate within your own sense of morals. Like,

1105
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,720
rather than us saying like, oh, we should be looking down on people who make this type of

1106
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,720
content. Yeah, we should. But like, that's who gives a fuck. Like I look down on myself for a lot

1107
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:37,280
of things that I do, but it's not going to stop me from doing it. You know, I'm going to do what I

1108
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:43,360
like and what, what, what favors me. So rather than that, like, you know, yeah, we could start a moral

1109
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,000
crusade about it, but it's not going to, we just got to accept that we live in this fucked society.

1110
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,680
Like we live in a society where this happens and this is what's going to happen because it's in the

1111
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:59,440
nature of how people are. I just want to be clear. I mean, I don't want to get into a thing where it's

1112
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:05,600
like, I'm not allowed, like I have identified what I think what I'm making a case for a problem with

1113
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,800
our kind of ecosystem or are the people or whatever. And like, okay, there are many ways to deal it.

1114
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,480
But I wouldn't want to just say like, okay, because like, I personally do other bad things,

1115
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,680
like I'm not allowed to like point out or it's not valid. And I think you should, I think it's

1116
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,120
fine that you're pointing it out. I think it's fine that you're trying to affect the way people

1117
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,200
think about it. And maybe like, if enough people thought that this shit was not good, you know,

1118
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,240
if enough people were offended at this type of content, then it wouldn't be able to,

1119
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:44,080
you know, propagate. But like, I think that you are very much fighting the ocean on a case like

1120
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:50,560
this. And like, on the one hand, I can say I find it immoral, but like, I also can say that I find

1121
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,920
eating meat immoral, but I do it and everybody does it and I don't hold anything against anybody.

1122
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,960
Like, I can think of, you know, like if you want to claim that it is moral, you'd have to do it

1123
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,480
from purely like a humanist perspective, like you have to be thinking about like drawing lines

1124
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,240
in the sand about whose rights matter and all that kind of stuff. And it's like, anytime we get

1125
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:16,240
into a moral question like this, you could tunnel down forever. And like, you know, we like having

1126
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,920
things like, oh, journalistic principle of minimizing harm. That's great. It sounds great.

1127
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,840
But it's just something people came up with as a line in the sand. Society as a whole is always

1128
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,440
going to be deciding where it wants its lines drawn. We might enter a society where people think,

1129
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:39,360
like, if you listen to the tactics of like, you know, SJWs and stuff, I think they would be

1130
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:45,680
very against that principle. They would be like, oh, it's all about like, if somebody does something

1131
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:50,080
bad, then we need to, we should destroy them or, you know, right, that person needs to be excised,

1132
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:57,600
that person needs to be punished for their behavior. And like, I think that you always fall on the

1133
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:04,480
side of something that is more bureaucratic, something that's more stable, more logically

1134
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:12,480
based. And the problem is that pop media is never going to operate that way. Pop media is always

1135
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,760
going to operate on eyeballs. It's always going to operate on, you know, on just what gets attention.

1136
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:24,080
And that's always going to prey on human nature and the way that we, you know, the way that we

1137
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:31,040
socially think. And I think that this kind of drama is just so core to the way that we operate,

1138
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,080
because historically, we need to know this kind of stuff. Like, at a time when we were in smaller

1139
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,240
communities, if someone in your community was a piece of shit, it really mattered. It really

1140
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:46,080
affected you. And I think people still think that way. I think we still want to know if somebody's

1141
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:53,040
doing bad behavior, we want to know enough about them that we can, you know, first of all, make

1142
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,120
it publicly known that it's not okay to be this type of person. And second of all, to avoid that

1143
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:03,600
person in themselves. And like, I do think that, you know, epically dunking on people, yeah, it's

1144
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,240
like, if we're thinking of it in terms of like, being judge, jury and executioner, it would be

1145
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,080
unfair. And it certainly is. And again, there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. Just, you

1146
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,720
know, one specific example that I've noticed, I've really thought about this one example is,

1147
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,480
since we brought up the monkey thing, it's just that I've noticed that for a long time, we all

1148
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:24,000
knew that monkey, like he actually, he told it, I mean, I don't mind going into a little bit of

1149
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,600
detail, it's just that he told us in the past that his name was Jimmy. And now, and you know what,

1150
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm not even going to say it because I don't want to maximize harm. Jimmy is not his real name.

1151
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,120
And in Meat Man's video, he goes several times, it's almost like a point where he specifically

1152
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:43,280
states monkey's real name. And the thing about that is we know monkey doesn't want his real name

1153
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,240
out there. But like Mr. Meat Man in his own way, and again, I don't care, don't involve me with him,

1154
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,520
don't shit on the guy, it's just what it is. I understand the motivation behind it and whatnot.

1155
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,000
I mean, do shit on the guy, but you know. Well, I mean, whatever. Just don't involve me,

1156
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,360
people. I don't give a fuck. But it's like, we know he doesn't want that information out there.

1157
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:07,360
And because sources exist on the internet, where one can find out monkey's real name,

1158
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:12,640
like, oh, that makes it okay to make a big dunking video where we expose this information

1159
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,920
that we know the person doesn't want exposed because they have been labeled bad person now

1160
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,680
for X, Y, Z reasons. And this is exactly the sort of like creeping like information that that

1161
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:28,640
person wouldn't want. And I would call it creeping like bad person behavior, where we're just like

1162
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,200
we're dismissing their personhood and their desires with culture in general right now is just that

1163
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,680
as soon as you make one slip up, you lose all moral consideration. And like if he comes a moral

1164
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,920
imperative to destroy you in any way possible on the one specific example, like again, I follow

1165
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,800
the logic, I understand why someone would feel comfortable exposing that information. But we

1166
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,120
know that monkey doesn't want that. So you're making a choice to say that you're going to include

1167
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:57,520
that. I mean, I agree that like, yeah, the way that his real name is like stated over and over

1168
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:02,880
and over again is like seems like a deliberate sort of like attack, almost like a dehumanization

1169
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,920
tactic. Here's the thing, we have like dead, like to dead name him or something. We have to ask

1170
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,560
ourselves a question though. Like, because, okay, but I just, I just want to ask where is, where is

1171
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:16,240
the line? Like, okay, like, yeah, I think that's probably passed a certain threshold. But like,

1172
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:21,280
I don't know if you can draw like a clear threshold of like what information is acceptable

1173
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,360
to share and does not cause harm and what, and what is beyond the pill, like this is

1174
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,360
maximized, this is not minimizing. I would like people to at least consider that though, which

1175
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,040
has not seemed to have been done in many videos. I think considering it would be great. But I do

1176
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:37,120
think that like, the problem with this argument is that you can just tell so much of this is just

1177
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:43,200
spite. So on the one hand, you use, you want to say like, okay, the person's right to their

1178
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:48,720
privacy, we want to respect that. But then on the other hand, there's the people's right to public

1179
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:55,280
dissemination of information. Like, do we not have the right to know as much as we can about the

1180
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,840
world we're in and make decisions? Like, if people- Well, this is exactly what minimizing harm is about.

1181
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,960
Does it serve a public good to know monkey's real name? No. I mean, I would say no, but that doesn't,

1182
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,840
just because I think so doesn't mean it's true, because like, let's say that other people legitimately

1183
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:17,040
think that he is a monster on some level. Like, they might think that they need to know this

1184
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,360
information or that like, it needs to be out there so that something can be done about him.

1185
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,040
Well, this is exactly why I want people to be thinking about this concept so that they can

1186
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,920
forth like, you're right, every person will disagree on exactly which points are, you know,

1187
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,040
on that or against that. But I would like the public to consider like, did he really like, was

1188
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,360
that name really relevant? And every single person can decide whether they agree or disagree.

1189
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,200
But like what I would, I mean, again, what I hope, I'll just put my position out there,

1190
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,640
I would hope most people think like, you know, that really didn't need to be in there. That's

1191
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,440
kind of fucked up and I'm not really supportive. I don't think that the average person who watches

1192
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:57,120
that video is going to come away from it thinking that Mr. Meat Man was justified. I think that most

1193
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:03,040
people watching it think this is a huge shit show and the entertainment value is in that everyone

1194
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:09,120
involved is such a piece of shit that like, that everybody fucked up on so many levels that-

1195
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,120
I just don't want a situation where we end up with an eye for the eye and, you know, just

1196
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,040
everyone's fucked. Because like- Okay, okay. I just really don't think that people are coming

1197
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,840
away from that video thinking that it was like a morally just thing that like, oh, we're all on

1198
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,920
Mr. Meat Man's side. Even if so, the information's still out there. Well, did you, I think, I

1199
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,200
disagree, unfortunately, and I don't think this is a good thing by any means, but I think a lot

1200
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,240
of people probably watched that video and came away with the idea that some, that they had,

1201
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,800
they had learned like a truth, like a hidden truth and that like Meat Man had done some great

1202
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:46,400
service. Like, oh, you've opened my eyes. Like now I see the truth of the matter. Like now I can enact

1203
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,160
the justice. I mean, there's always- Now I can enact the justice that is required. That's the thing.

1204
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,640
Anytime we create any piece of media, a significant amount of the audience is going to be

1205
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,760
fucking morons who take the wrong thing out of it. Even if it's, I mean, in this case, he wants you

1206
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:07,200
to take something bad out of it, you know, but, but like, I don't think even the majority of people

1207
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:07,840
watching are going to feel that way. And by the way, to anyone who's going to say that like,

1208
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,120
Monkey and Meat Man are like a bond, like they're going to like do a live stream. I do not care

1209
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:18,240
what Monkey's position is on this. I have my own moral that I'm judging by. So I'm just saying,

1210
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,880
I do not find that a valid critique. Because I mean, obviously, I don't agree with Monkey's

1211
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,760
stance on any of this in the first place, because that's the whole reason he got kicked out of

1212
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,440
the fucking PCP. I could talk about the exact same principles on any video Monkey's ever made,

1213
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,600
but that's not what we're talking about right now. So, and I don't believe in just an eye for an

1214
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,160
eye. I think that's silly. I still, I still don't think we, I still don't think he did. I still

1215
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,560
don't think he did anything that deserved a kick. Well, he did. That's it. What he did is exactly

1216
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,760
this. What he did is that he thinks he, he didn't, he embraced this. Guys, listen, the Monkey

1217
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,400
kicking thing is ancient history. Who cares? Well, I mean, we're talking about the guy anyway.

1218
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:00,000
I mean, sure. But I'm, I'm trying to talk about the principle of, of not including unnecessary

1219
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,640
detail in these dunk posts that are just designed to hurt people because I just don't think it's

1220
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:09,760
right. And I just want people to think about this concept when they watch their exposed videos and

1221
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,480
be thinking like, is this like, frankly, I want them to think, should I actually be watching this?

1222
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,640
Because that's what I was thinking the whole time while I watched it.

1223
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:22,160
The video was made. I mean, let's be honest, the video was made to cause harm.

1224
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:26,320
Of course, obviously. If, if, if Meat Man had considered for even a second the principle of

1225
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,400
minimizing harm, he wouldn't have made the video at all. And like, basically you couldn't make it,

1226
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,120
you couldn't make it. Yeah. But I don't think, right? Like, yeah, I think, I don't think Meat Man

1227
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,520
comes off well. I think he seems like a piece of shit. But I wouldn't say like, oh no, no one

1228
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:44,560
should make a video like that. Like that's wrong. But you shouldn't. I mean, it's a, well, the, I'm

1229
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,200
saying is you shouldn't be a piece of shit. But like, the fact of the matter is people, people

1230
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:54,880
are going to be a piece of shit. And like, we as an audience member can, we can watch and even

1231
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:00,000
enjoy the content and still think the guy is a piece of shit for doing. I mean, I, I just think,

1232
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,960
I mean, I'm, my point is basically like, I think it's wrong, the harm that's being done

1233
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,520
with the extra information that we know is not wanted to be out there. And like, you could

1234
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,080
argue, I mean, it's fair to say, you know, it's human, like again, I didn't stop watching. I kept

1235
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:20,880
watching. But like the person who has the agency in the situation, I think it's pretty clear to say

1236
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:25,840
is the video maker. So it's just that that's where my focus goes. And I get Ben's point that it's

1237
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:34,320
a structural thing. And you're such a, you're such a, you just, you want to come so close,

1238
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:38,160
like you want to come so close to saying he shouldn't make the video. But then at the last

1239
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,680
second you pull, oh, but I'm not saying he shouldn't have made the video, but Ben, I'll be super

1240
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,920
clear. No, he should look, he should not have made it as is, because it had a lot of

1241
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,880
and unnecessary information. Like I'm not going to like say, I will physically stop it was unnecessary

1242
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,680
information. All of it was none of it had to be. Yeah, look, there's a version of the video that's

1243
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,240
just like, like literally reporting the facts of the case as they were like, people allege this

1244
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:05,680
and that video too, and that video too is made to cause harm because it's just gossip. I mean,

1245
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:09,840
yeah, I mean, what am I doing wrong here? I don't think I've done anything wrong. I don't, I don't

1246
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,760
think you're, I don't think you, your principle, whatever you're trying to say, like whatever

1247
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,160
guideline you're trying to lay down that people should follow doesn't make any sense. It, whatever,

1248
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:24,080
I, I think it's well, I think that basically, I think what needs to mostly arguing for is that we

1249
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:30,560
consider it. And I think that's very fair. Like to say we should be like, if you're going to write

1250
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,520
something like this, think about it. And if you're consuming something like this, think about it as

1251
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,680
well. Like if you're consuming it and you see a guy who is not holding up the principle of

1252
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:47,280
minimizing harm, criticize that, consider it to be a lesser form of journalism.

1253
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,920
Like, like just, here's an example. When you got like, when you got like an angry ex-wife,

1254
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,600
and let's just, or you know, let's say a guy dumps a girl, and I don't know, he, let's say he's a

1255
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,760
YouTuber or something. And the girl, let's, let's say in this example, he's done nothing wrong,

1256
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,320
but the girl like finds some things he's done. And I don't know, maybe she literally makes it

1257
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,320
up. Let's say it's all fabricated a hundred percent, because she's decided she's an addictive,

1258
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,080
so she's going to make a video about like how he dumped her, he was abusive, he's fucked up,

1259
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:17,680
et cetera, et cetera. Things that are hard to disprove. Like really what I want is people to,

1260
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:23,360
when that video, you know, of course gets billion million views, I want people to think about,

1261
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:28,400
like, what are the motivations? What is the evidence here? Is it like, why was this made?

1262
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:33,360
Should I trust this source? And blah, blah, blah, things like that. Because I'm aware of human

1263
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:38,160
nature. That's my only point. Of course I agree with all that. Of course you should be critical

1264
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,400
about the media you consume and about what people tell you. I also want to add in here that like

1265
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,680
when I keep pointing out that like, monkey, you know, had this coming for doing this type of thing,

1266
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,720
it's not that I'm saying an eye for an eye makes it okay. I just want to make sure we are addressing

1267
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:58,240
the fact that monkey too should be held accountable for this, that like, this didn't just become a

1268
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:05,520
problem when Mr. Meat Man did it to him. Monkey did this to people. He definitely did not

1269
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,720
try to minimize harm about people he would talk about. He would even go so far as to,

1270
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:18,160
you know, deliberately, like, you know, kind of give his audience an avenue whereby they could

1271
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,880
fuck with somebody, you know, not necessarily urging them to do it, but making it clear how

1272
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,680
they could. So I guess a lot of it's on the borderline, which is where he operated a lot of

1273
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:32,720
the time and still does. And that's exactly why I wanted to disassociate with him at the time,

1274
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:39,120
because I saw him as somebody who was willing to play this game, The Gay Ops of Thrones, and I

1275
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:44,800
think that as soon as anybody is doing that, your best interest is to disassociate with that person.

1276
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,560
Because, I mean, if you don't want to ride the wave and try to make it out on type, like your

1277
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,840
Keemstar, you're always, you win or you die, but the game goes on forever. So if you play it long

1278
01:28:53,840 --> 01:29:00,560
enough, you know, I mean, just doing Gay Ops is in itself something that you could be like, like,

1279
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:06,560
you might, if you get into this game thinking, oh, I haven't done anything fucked, so people aren't

1280
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,640
going to find, you know, I'm not going to be uncovered. Well, the fact that you're playing

1281
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,160
the game is fucked in itself. So you have already given up that moral ground. This is what I said.

1282
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,960
I said, you know, yeah, you live, you live by YouTube drama, you die. On that point, as soon as

1283
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,200
as meat man, again, I'm not saying to talk shit, I'm not saying to do anything to the guy for the

1284
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:30,960
love of God, but like the second he made that video, and he's getting notoriety, like the countdown

1285
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:36,320
on when the exposed video about him began, and it's only a matter of time, you think Mr. Meat Man

1286
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:40,240
hasn't said fucked up things in his private chats that like, I don't know, I'm not saying monkey

1287
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:46,320
will do anything, but that like people will have. But somebody will, because now he's a juicy target

1288
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,800
for someone else to make a name for themselves. And I just think it's toxic. I don't even want

1289
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,400
anything bad to happen to Meat Man. I just don't think anything should, people shouldn't do this.

1290
01:29:54,400 --> 01:30:00,000
Nate, that's all. The thing about these people, and this is also true of Mumki,

1291
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,080
is that I think that a lot of them are in a very bad place in their life. They're people who have

1292
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:12,160
low self-esteem, think that they essentially are worthless, and that the best way they can put

1293
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,720
themselves up is by shitting on other people and being a piece of shit, because they think,

1294
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:21,200
well I'm already a piece of shit, I have no worth, so I'm just going to continue to be a piece of

1295
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:27,120
shit, right? But the thing is that that will come back to bite you one day, because unless you do

1296
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:32,800
kill yourself, then if you ever have a peak, if you ever have a moment where you start to gain

1297
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,320
something, that can now be taken from you. And for someone like Mumki, who for so long was portraying

1298
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:44,000
himself as like, oh, I'm a piece of shit, and I don't care what happens to me. I will harm my

1299
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,160
friendships, because it doesn't matter, because I'm suicidal anyways. None of this shit matters,

1300
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:55,200
but then things started to matter, and that caught up. It's like once you've gotten to a position

1301
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:59,280
where, oh shit, turns out I'm not horribly depressed, turns out I'm making money, turns out I'm

1302
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,920
getting popular, well the seeds that you sow- But you have many enemies that you created along the

1303
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:10,160
way, or whatever. Exactly. And so again, with someone like Mr. Meat Man, he has been continually

1304
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:15,520
a low-level nobody, and now that he's got some attention on him- He's got like 70,000 subs,

1305
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,880
but I mean- He now has a huge target on his back, you know? Now that he has-

1306
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:26,320
I think so. Now that he's someone who's bigger than anybody who's smaller than him, who's in the

1307
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:32,240
same position he once was, sees him as the stepping stone they can use, and it's dead easy to do,

1308
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:36,560
and he will go from being somebody who had nothing to lose, to being somebody who has

1309
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:42,000
something to lose, now that he has that popularity, and he can lose it. And that's why you can't

1310
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,160
involve yourself in this game, because it will- This is how it happens. What goes around comes around.

1311
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:55,600
That's true, and you know, it just reminds me of like, well a couple of- I mean on the one point,

1312
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,680
I'd like to all this point, I guess people could point out fairly, like what about like the video

1313
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:04,640
I just made recently about Zack Rittner? But I would say, I mean again, you can go into instances

1314
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,120
of this shit. I would argue that I actually did think about minimizing harm as I was making that

1315
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:15,520
video, but that guy was a absolute spammer commenter, and I think one video that is simply making fun of

1316
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:21,520
him and telling the audience not to do anything to him is more than fair, and it was all for fun

1317
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:27,760
anyway, and was not a big deal. But like- Okay, so I'm gonna bring this up, Ben.

1318
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:28,960
Ben.

1319
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,680
Huh.

1320
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:34,080
How do you think that monkeys shouldn't have- didn't do anything worth of being kicked?

1321
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,920
Um...

1322
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,960
Oh lord.

1323
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,560
I just don't think he did anything.

1324
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:46,320
You don't think that him, after- after he was promoting and collaborating with Mr.

1325
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,960
Meat Man and Cream Man when they were harassing Jesse, that wasn't grounds to be kicked?

1326
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:58,320
Um, none of the harassment I saw, none of the- I didn't- I didn't see anything that seemed like that.

1327
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,760
You didn't see it, but it happened, so if you would go and do the research or maybe come away with that-

1328
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,800
Look, I've heard all the arguments, and I'm just not convinced by any of it, that any of it was-

1329
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:13,360
that any of it was so bad that not only should a person who did- we're not even arguing that a

1330
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:16,400
person who did this should be- but that someone who was friends with someone who did this-

1331
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,160
It's not that he was friends with them, it's that he promoted them and collaborated with them,

1332
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,880
and celebrated the behavior they were displaying.

1333
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,600
Guys, we literally talked about this dozens of times.

1334
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,520
I just- I just never saw it.

1335
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,280
I just- I don't know, I've heard you-

1336
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,560
We're not gonna move on our positions.

1337
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,120
Jesse and everyone talk about this, and I've heard all the arguments, and none of them convinced me.

1338
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,640
Well, there's really nothing more to say.

1339
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,560
We've been over this so many times, you know.

1340
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,800
I just don't feel bad for anyone.

1341
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,280
That's all.

1342
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,560
Nobody.

1343
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,200
Nobody ever.

1344
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,320
I mean, whatever, man.

1345
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,880
For me, it is now what it always was.

1346
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:54,400
The fact that people in this organization had major issues with Momke leaves me feeling,

1347
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,760
you know, I don't feel bad that I made a business decision personally

1348
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,520
to vote him out to protect the business.

1349
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,400
That's what I did.

1350
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,600
I bear no ill will towards anyone feeling any way.

1351
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,840
Sure would be coming down on us right now if he was still around.

1352
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,800
I mean, I think it'd be funny.

1353
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,360
Why would it be coming down on us?

1354
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,600
Because we'd be embroiled in all this.

1355
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,960
Well, we didn't do anything.

1356
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,600
Okay.

1357
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,760
I just want to say that what Momke did, I think, was really fucking funny,

1358
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,240
and I really enjoyed the video.

1359
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,280
I feel like that's a position.

1360
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,880
You mean like get down with the sickness as it were with the, you know?

1361
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:38,720
Yeah, like Mr. Meat Man's video was like a horrible takedown of a horrible set of things

1362
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,600
that a guy did.

1363
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:40,880
Horrible guy.

1364
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,680
Really funny.

1365
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:47,040
I laughed the whole time and I don't feel bad about it.

1366
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,360
I mean.

1367
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,040
And that's my pain.

1368
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,800
I mean, the problem for me is that I don't feel we got the unadulterated facts.

1369
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,480
I think we got the facts as presented by the man who's currently the most mad at Momke.

1370
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,320
I'll tell you right now that a few facts here or there that are not correct.

1371
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,760
I mean, I, Momke did tweet and say, yes, basically.

1372
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,560
I don't trust Momke.

1373
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,920
I think Momke is overly protective of his reputation by going out of his way to say it's all okay.

1374
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,280
I haven't watched the video, but I'll say that all of this happening has been

1375
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,160
a source of many yucks for me as well.

1376
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,360
And it's not that I don't.

1377
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,160
Like not from a position of like, ah, ha, ha, fuck you, Momke.

1378
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:26,080
Like, you know, I don't really, I don't have like a lot of ill will towards him or anything

1379
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:26,720
at this point.

1380
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:30,800
Like he's had nothing to do with me for like a year and a half, almost two years.

1381
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,760
There, it is, it is, it is Juicy Goss.

1382
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,280
Juicy Goss is always great.

1383
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,360
And especially when it's about people, you know, people who have been like, you know,

1384
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:45,200
for me, the sheer surrealness of watching things like this happen is an endless source of joy

1385
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:45,600
for me.

1386
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:51,360
Like it makes me feel like this was the point of becoming famous is that I can be surrounded

1387
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:57,200
with so much weird shit all the time that like people who've been to my house now have

1388
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,920
like a fucking, you know, news articles written about them and they're in discretions.

1389
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,320
Like, you know, all these weird historical anecdotes that all feed into each other.

1390
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,800
And I'm in the middle of this whirlwind looking at all the stuff and going,

1391
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,840
this is fucking insane.

1392
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,240
This is awesome.

1393
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:14,880
Maybe the difference for me is purely that this all makes me extremely uncomfortable to

1394
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,960
be anywhere near me and I want nothing more than to be as far away from it as possible.

1395
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,440
Like I feel uncomfortable talking about it because I don't know, like I,

1396
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,440
a lot of the time I have like half opinions about certain things and half about other things.

1397
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,760
And I don't want to be like seen or heard saying something that I'll later say,

1398
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,840
actually, I don't know about that thought.

1399
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,160
But then you saying you're like, you brought this whole thing up or like you went into it

1400
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:38,640
quite a lot.

1401
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,680
Well, I mean, I didn't want to talk about it.

1402
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,480
I mean, I accept responsibility of broaching the topic at all.

1403
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,920
But it was not my goal to get into any specific.

1404
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,560
I like talking about all this stuff because you can't run away from this.

1405
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,840
This is the world we live in.

1406
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,600
These are the people we're surrounded with.

1407
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,440
Well, I'm trying to be proactive and just get people to absorb this in a way that I

1408
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,240
think is more healthy.

1409
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:58,880
That's all.

1410
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,760
I think that's good.

1411
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:00,240
I like that you do that.

1412
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,520
I think it'd be weird.

1413
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,280
I think it'd be weird if we didn't talk about it.

1414
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,320
It'd be like John and Aaron not talking about why the Game Grumps broke up.

1415
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:10,320
I mean, that's how I felt because inevitably people are asking me about

1416
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,880
monkey and it's like, I don't have such strong opinions that I'm going to like go

1417
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,080
and make a video about it.

1418
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,600
And I also don't want to individually respond to everybody on Twitter about it.

1419
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,840
But it's like, if I have thoughts about it as I have on this podcast, like, yeah,

1420
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,800
I think it would be weirder of me to just keep my mouth shut.

1421
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,080
And it's like, whatever.

1422
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:35,760
I used to think that I think that the era of trying to keep things private is just gone.

1423
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,640
And that's for better or worse.

1424
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,440
There's problems with it.

1425
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,360
There's ups and downs.

1426
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:47,920
But I've accepted the idea that we're just not in a private society anymore.

1427
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,120
It's not the way that enough people want to operate for it to be the case.

1428
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,480
And that's always the way.

1429
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,600
Well, not if you're online, right?

1430
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,160
Right.

1431
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:54,720
Like, not if you're online.

1432
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,000
But everybody's online at this point.

1433
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,080
Even if you're not online, people could just come to your house.

1434
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,800
I mean, not your house, but like, I don't know, take a picture of you in public,

1435
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,280
tweet it, get it going if they want to.

1436
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:09,440
It's like there was a brief period where I was kind of trying to run away a little bit from it

1437
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:14,720
because it was like, and I don't want to always be like a public figure who says

1438
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,280
absolutely everything going on in my life because it's unnecessary.

1439
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,040
But it's like, if people are going to know things about me, that's going to happen.

1440
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,600
There's too much information going around at all times.

1441
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,560
Too much surveillance happening.

1442
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,760
You're right, Digi.

1443
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,920
I understand this idea that like privacy is dead.

1444
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,120
It's just that, OK, when I look at this thing, what I see

1445
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:37,440
is a gossip to me is a chain with a series of links.

1446
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,040
And it's like infinitely long.

1447
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,320
And it actually branches out.

1448
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,760
The links connect to different.

1449
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,400
It's like a net.

1450
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,120
That's what makes it so interesting.

1451
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,240
It starts at one point.

1452
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,680
That's why it's so fun to watch.

1453
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,080
I mean, that's fair.

1454
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:48,400
That's fair.

1455
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,960
But what I perceive is that at every single link, every one of us is an individual link

1456
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,040
in that chain that can branch out infinitely.

1457
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,240
And like, I think at every one of those junctures,

1458
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:03,040
it's reasonable to just say like every person bears some responsibility when it comes to like

1459
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,080
propagating misinformation or, you know, if anybody who is watching this content,

1460
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,000
anybody who's participating in any way, you are a part of it now.

1461
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,400
And your decisions are going to matter and you're going to be held accountable.

1462
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,760
Including just watching it.

1463
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,080
And you are not a private person.

1464
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,560
You are no more so a private.

1465
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,720
Like people always say, oh, well, he's a he's a public person, so it's different.

1466
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,120
Motherfucker, you are all public people.

1467
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:31,440
If you have an account on the internet and you're tweeting anything,

1468
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:35,360
if you're posting comments on YouTube threads, you are creating content.

1469
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,360
You are putting yourself in the public eye.

1470
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,120
That just reinforces my my thing.

1471
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:43,200
I started this whole thing off with like every tweet is a little journalistic activity,

1472
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,720
which is why I feel comfortable bringing up the standard as, you know, related to it.

1473
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,600
And like, look, if you want to be private, like, first of all,

1474
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:54,160
the government system is not currently really protecting your privacy.

1475
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,160
If anything, they're breaching it even harder than we are because they're getting their

1476
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:01,280
tendrils into things you aren't even trying to publicly state.

1477
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,200
So probably don't have the state on your side.

1478
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,840
If you want to protect your privacy, it's on you.

1479
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,840
If you don't want people to know about you, you don't tweet.

1480
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,200
You don't go online.

1481
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:15,120
You don't post your information because at this point, nobody,

1482
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,280
no part of the social structure is trying to protect your privacy.

1483
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,840
So the second you start participating in the game, just know you are a participant.

1484
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,920
Expect to be held accountable for your actions.

1485
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,280
I guess so.

1486
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:27,840
I guess so.

1487
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,800
Just remember, people, you can make choices.

1488
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,320
You don't have to share that video.

1489
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,680
If you think it's kind of fucked up what somebody did, you don't have to watch it.

1490
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:36,960
And I'm aware we're humans.

1491
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:37,680
We're going to be weak.

1492
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,400
I watched it too.

1493
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,160
So I'm part of the problem, 100% true.

1494
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:46,240
You know, you don't have to bring it up on this podcast and make it a big deal among all your friends.

1495
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:51,360
I did not watch it because I didn't want to have to hear that sniveling retard's voice for 45 minutes.

1496
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
Oh, Mr. Meat Man.

1497
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:54,800
I like it.

1498
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,000
I do like his delivery.

1499
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,320
Lol.

1500
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,480
I laugh whenever he says his own name.

1501
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,040
I laugh.

1502
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,600
I clap.

1503
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,080
I am a chimp.

1504
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,760
I am a chimp with a lizard brain.

1505
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:05,680
Yep.

1506
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,680
He's got some serious branding going on.

1507
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,800
We should go to voicemails because it's an hour.

1508
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,960
It's going to be the Microsoft press conference.

1509
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,720
And I got to watch the Halo Infinite reveal.

1510
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,760
Oh, I see.

1511
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,360
But were you going to say something first?

1512
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:23,200
I had one more small thing to mention, which may or not branch off into a topic.

1513
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:30,720
But I've got this app called Duolingo, which is a language learning app.

1514
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,560
And I'm learning Hebrew for no reason.

1515
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:34,960
Huh.

1516
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,440
Whoa.

1517
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:36,000
Why?

1518
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,280
Why Hebrew?

1519
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:40,160
I mean, I know you said for no reason, but why?

1520
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:44,000
Well, the reason was I wanted to learn Arabic, but they didn't have it.

1521
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,120
And that was the closest thing.

1522
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:46,800
Hmm.

1523
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,240
Because I'm thinking like...

1524
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:49,840
Yeah.

1525
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,400
Well, yeah.

1526
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,200
I mean, that's the thing.

1527
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:57,200
That's the thing I've been thinking is that culturally, in the West,

1528
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,360
the whole Middle East is seen as the enemy.

1529
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:05,600
Just in general, for your basic Joe Shmo who's like,

1530
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:10,080
duh, he'll say, fuck those Muslim people.

1531
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:10,800
I guess.

1532
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,960
Yeah, it's true.

1533
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,400
I do say that all the time.

1534
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:19,760
Yeah, and it's like, there's this sort of demonization of that whole area of the world.

1535
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,200
I kind of like the things over there.

1536
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,320
And it's kind of a shame.

1537
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,520
Like, if I, as a white man...

1538
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,240
Why not Arabic?

1539
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,200
I'd get shifty eyes.

1540
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,880
There's a lot more Arabic speakers.

1541
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,040
They said there was no Arabic on Duolingo.

1542
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,240
Oh, okay, sorry.

1543
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:32,880
I see, I get.

1544
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,280
Yeah, there's no Arabic on Duolingo.

1545
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,080
I don't know why.

1546
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,480
Because of racism, god damn it, they hate them.

1547
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,040
Yeah.

1548
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,160
I mean, I would look for a thing, but learning Hebrew is good enough.

1549
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:42,720
Yeah.

1550
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,000
There's a Hebrew guy.

1551
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
There's a guy who lives in the Israeli army in my Discord who talks about stuff.

1552
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,480
That's cool.

1553
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,000
And so, I'll be able to say, hello, I have the bread.

1554
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,200
Like, I'll be able to say that soon.

1555
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,760
You'll need a new keyboard.

1556
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,280
Oh, I will.

1557
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,960
Well, there's a Hebrew keyboard.

1558
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,680
Duolingo is such a gamified version of learning.

1559
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,320
That sounds good.

1560
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:12,400
Basically, it doesn't give you a course that you have to memorize in a test.

1561
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,800
They just give you questions.

1562
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:20,400
Some of them are like, a guy speaks and you have to put the right letters in the right words

1563
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:21,520
from a choice.

1564
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,880
Sometimes there's like a word in a sentence that you have to do.

1565
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,520
Sometimes there's a sentence you have to translate into English.

1566
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:34,320
And a lot of it is like, you can infer based on what ones you've seen.

1567
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,440
Like, there are different categories.

1568
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,480
Like, the first three sections are like just words, simple words.

1569
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:44,000
Like, mother, father, love, and stuff.

1570
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,680
And then you go further down.

1571
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:53,200
Once you've unlocked more complex systems like adjectives and concepts and greetings and stuff,

1572
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,200
you click on one of those.

1573
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,000
You do a lesson.

1574
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,840
And it's basically like a 10 minute, like you're given like 10 to 20 questions.

1575
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,480
And if you get it right, it's a little ding.

1576
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,840
And if you get it wrong, there's a like, and then it comes back around.

1577
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,120
And you can't complete the thing until you've got all of them right.

1578
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,640
So if you're stuck on one, it's not like you will never learn it.

1579
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:19,760
It will, you'll eventually like understand, like it'll show you what the answer is.

1580
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,960
So you get it wrong.

1581
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,840
And then you're like, oh, wait, that one, it means that.

1582
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:31,760
So you through like trial and error, and how like language is more fun to learn, I find,

1583
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:37,600
is that you come up with your own associations with the words and the symbols.

1584
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,440
Of the other language.

1585
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,000
So I'm recognizing without even really trying

1586
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:49,280
words that, you know, in Hebrew and like the male and female versions of certain words,

1587
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,800
I'm like, oh, that squeaky line means that I don't know what any of the letters are,

1588
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:58,080
but I do know how to read certain sentences with, you know, like I've only been doing it

1589
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:02,080
for a week and I can, I can recognize quite a few and it's, it's pretty cool.

1590
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:02,720
That's interesting.

1591
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,240
The way it's, the way it's structured.

1592
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:04,880
That's cool.

1593
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,600
I use something called.

1594
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,720
It's also a free app.

1595
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,720
So you may as well, if you, if you ever felt like learning a thing, it could be,

1596
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,920
it could be a good like starting point, at least for reading.

1597
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,040
I've used something called memorize for the last while, which sounds very similar.

1598
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,840
It's sort of a gamified and obviously I use it for Japanese.

1599
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:24,800
And I've been pretty lazy the last while, but I actually, I have been taking more steps

1600
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,680
to just expose myself to more Japanese on a daily basis.

1601
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,560
I actually, for multiple reasons, because I didn't want to deal with just like news

1602
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,280
on Twitter and shit.

1603
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,520
I just wanted the people I subscribed to and that's it.

1604
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:37,360
So I, I set my Twitter feed to just be as if I was in Japan.

1605
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:41,120
So I just get like all these updates that are just like pure Japanese shit.

1606
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:44,000
And mostly it's in, it's in kanji a lot, so I can't really understand it,

1607
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,960
but it just like from my recent dabblings into learning Japanese, everyone's been telling me

1608
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:54,080
exposure on a daily basis, total exposure is the best way to go, but the more the better.

1609
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,040
Well, that's how, well that's how Bart, well that's how Bart Simpson learned to speak French.

1610
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:57,520
Indeed.

1611
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,320
Indeed.

1612
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,800
Yeah, the thing that encourages you.

1613
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,440
Oh, that's actually a good thing people do.

1614
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,680
They read Shonen manga because it's very simple.

1615
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,440
It's for elementary school kids.

1616
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,560
The people read that raw.

1617
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,640
So eventually I will do that for sure.

1618
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:15,200
Yeah, the Duolingo app has a lot of bells and whistles and jingling, jangling things,

1619
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:20,960
dangling in front of your, in front of your face, such as streaks and getting bonus.

1620
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,080
Yeah, same with memorize.

1621
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,960
That you can, you can spend on customizing the owl.

1622
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,800
Mine actually does cost money though, I think.

1623
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,360
So yours is probably much smarter to use.

1624
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,840
The only thing is like after you complete a lesson, there's like a little ad and you say

1625
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:34,320
no thanks.

1626
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,040
Oh yeah.

1627
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:39,600
I don't want to subscribe, but it really hasn't become a problem and I just do it every night

1628
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,320
before I go to bed.

1629
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,000
Like, oh yeah, I want to keep my streak going.

1630
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,960
Smart, that's very smart.

1631
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,040
For no real reason, because the current, the virtual currency is pointless and I don't care

1632
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,720
about spending on anything, but I do like having gems and numbers going up.

1633
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:54,560
So like every night, every night before I go to bed, instead of, instead of watching another

1634
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,600
45 minute YouTube video, I do some Hebrew learning and then I go to bed.

1635
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,000
And I feel like, I feel like that's actually quite a good way to get the knowledge.

1636
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,520
I don't think I'll ever use Hebrew, but it's just nice.

1637
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,520
Oh, you're going to use it when they take over my dude.

1638
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:12,800
It's going to be exclusive, but we're all using one of these days.

1639
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,520
All right, let's hear some voicemails.

1640
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,400
But yeah.

1641
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,120
Yeah, all right.

1642
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,600
That's cool.

1643
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,720
Let's go to voicemails.

1644
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,280
I'm ready.

1645
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,880
Oh, hey, first of all, we got a little PCP theme.

1646
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,200
So let's ramp it up while I play this PCP theme.

1647
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:25,680
Go.

1648
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,240
It's coming.

1649
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,200
It's coming.

1650
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:34,320
I know the theme contest is months gone, but I just want to do this rendition of the

1651
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,280
original theme and then you guys will be like, yeah, that's cool.

1652
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,480
We'll see about that.

1653
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,240
Cool.

1654
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:50,640
Hey, it's cool.

1655
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,680
Yeah, I like it.

1656
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,880
Okay, so next one while he's playing us in.

1657
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,480
Okay.

1658
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,240
I mean, I'm just letting, that's just background noise.

1659
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,280
Yeah, let them do his thing.

1660
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:04,400
So our first voicemail is from Dynamax Tortera Detective Pikachu.

1661
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,280
I wish he recorded that.

1662
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,080
All right, I'm just going to play it and I hope it stops the one that's playing now.

1663
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:08,800
Okay, here we go.

1664
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,040
Go.

1665
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,920
I would just like to point out something real fucking quick.

1666
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:12,320
All right.

1667
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,520
You know, this is Dynamax.

1668
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,400
It's the same guy.

1669
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,280
Maybe.

1670
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,120
And you know, Detective Pikachu, the movie.

1671
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,040
Well, the fucking, the torteras.

1672
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,640
Oh shit, you're right.

1673
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:25,200
They were giant and no one's talking about it.

1674
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:25,760
What?

1675
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,800
They totally teased that shit.

1676
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,400
The torteras are really big in the movie.

1677
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,520
That's all I got to say.

1678
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,680
Okay, so in Detective Pikachu, they had really big torteras.

1679
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:32,400
I didn't see it.

1680
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:37,680
Okay, does that mean that in Gen 1, with the anime, when we saw that giant

1681
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:44,000
dragonite, well the giant dragonite or tentacle, was that Dynamaxed to my dude?

1682
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,880
Makes sense to me.

1683
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,080
Do you remember that episode with the giant Gengar and the giant Alakazam?

1684
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:48,560
Yes.

1685
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,440
Yes, I do.

1686
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,560
The ancient Pokemon.

1687
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:56,720
I remember the giant, I remember the giant Haunter from Electric Tale of Pikachu.

1688
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,840
Yeah, was it giant?

1689
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,080
The good series, the good manga series.

1690
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:00,880
True, true.

1691
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,160
Okay, anyway, shit voicemail.

1692
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,280
Thanks for nothing.

1693
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,760
I remember the Dynamaxed human beings from One Piece.

1694
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:13,200
Oh yeah, remember that time that in one, in a filler anime of One Piece.

1695
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:17,760
How do I end up with Nate, who is the one who screens the voicemail, playing a voicemail

1696
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,760
going, wow, that was a shit voicemail.

1697
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,520
Didn't you screen the voicemails?

1698
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,080
Me shitting on it is part of the joke, did you?

1699
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,840
This is high level stuff.

1700
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:26,640
Nate's criteria is...

1701
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:31,280
So Nate deliberately includes shitty voicemails, so he can shit on them.

1702
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,480
I included that one so I could make the rebuttal about the huge dragonite.

1703
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,120
That was my sole desire, that's why I included that.

1704
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,400
By the way, okay, we gotta put out a message to our boy RiddlemyassBatman.

1705
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:46,560
Okay, which is just that, he's been calling in, leaving a bunch of like,

1706
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,440
I'm Batman, why aren't you playing my voicemail?

1707
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,680
Listen, buddy, you gotta get it together.

1708
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:56,560
We can't just be playing this stuff that's like, why aren't I on the voicemails?

1709
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,880
And there's a surprisingly large number of people

1710
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,360
who are calling in with this exact same complaint.

1711
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:05,360
So people, every time you call in, it's judged on merit and nothing else.

1712
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:09,120
Just be funny, if you don't get in, that means it was not funny enough,

1713
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,680
and there's nothing else to be said.

1714
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,720
So just be funny.

1715
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,280
Unless Nate needs to make a point about dragonite, in which case...

1716
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,400
That's correct, that's the one time that you'll get in.

1717
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:22,800
Think about what opportunities can I give Nate to say things

1718
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,080
and build your voicemail around that.

1719
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,280
Pretty much, pretty much.

1720
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,320
That's the key, yeah.

1721
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,000
But also, don't make it too much about me,

1722
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,640
because I deliberately avoid some that are like, this is for Nate.

1723
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,640
I'm like, that's too many of those, we're out of here.

1724
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,520
So it's a delicate balance, good luck.

1725
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,520
Okay, let's move on.

1726
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,640
Next one's from Garrett, the microbiology student.

1727
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,520
Okay, good, good.

1728
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,720
Oh wait, go, yes, here we go.

1729
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:53,600
This voicemail is in regards to Nate's poopy autism question about his poopy autism.

1730
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,400
It's not really about me though.

1731
01:50:54,400 --> 01:51:00,080
And why he has to eat the shit from normies to care his autism.

1732
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,440
Eat shit, right.

1733
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:09,360
And the reason why you have to eat the shit is because the bacteria in your gut is anaerobic,

1734
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:16,000
so it won't survive in an atmosphere with oxygen, which basically means you can't grow

1735
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:21,600
any of that bacteria on a petri dish without like a fuck ton of work.

1736
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:27,680
So it ends up being a ton cheaper and easier to just wash out the shit a bit

1737
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,920
and then put it in a pill that you can eat.

1738
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,120
Hell yeah.

1739
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,360
That's a pretty reasonable point, I just thought that was an interesting.

1740
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,640
Small follow up on that.

1741
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:42,960
There's been an article written on the Aspergian website about autism, I guess.

1742
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,920
Where basically they called into question.

1743
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,120
Really, that's what it's called?

1744
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:49,040
They called into question the study.

1745
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:53,360
Apparently the study is just, while it is interesting what findings it has,

1746
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,440
it had like no control group.

1747
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:01,360
They didn't really factor in a lot of different elements of what could have caused the change

1748
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,000
other than the shit pills.

1749
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,120
Shockingly, it wasn't the most professional study ever done.

1750
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:10,880
It wasn't a great study, but there could be more studies done to eventually get more info on.

1751
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:15,360
On the one hand, of course, but on the other hand, am I really going to trust a website

1752
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:20,160
called the Aspergian on it to report accurately on how they're about to destroy their business?

1753
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:25,440
I mean, I think we're all winners here for just having heard a story about children being fed.

1754
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,960
Oh yeah, it's very true.

1755
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,440
I didn't share all this because I legitimately thought.

1756
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,120
Shit and die is real now.

1757
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,840
Yeah, all right, that's enough.

1758
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,120
Okay, all right, let's go on to the next one.

1759
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:37,440
That's the new tagline, autism, eat shit and die.

1760
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:42,400
All right, this is from your average passive listener.

1761
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,440
Okay, go.

1762
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,840
You guys were talking about having kids last week,

1763
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,400
and it was basically talking about symbolic immortality,

1764
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,680
a psychological term coined by Robert J. Lifton.

1765
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:54,560
We all naturally strive for it because we're fear of death.

1766
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:59,920
There's four categories, biological, children, afterlife, religion, natural,

1767
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,760
trees, and the good shit, creative immortality.

1768
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:06,400
I think all artists have that little comfort inside them

1769
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,680
that at least something will still be there after they're dead.

1770
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:11,360
Like this voicemail, for example.

1771
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,480
I think I need a question.

1772
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,720
So is anyone religious in the PCP?

1773
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,880
And no matter the answer, how does religion influence religion?

1774
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,840
Is anyone religious?

1775
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,960
First of all, you don't necessarily need a question if your point is just good.

1776
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,560
I mean, I'll be interested to hear it.

1777
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:25,280
Yeah, it's a voicemail.

1778
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,880
It's an order of voice question.

1779
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,440
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

1780
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,280
I don't think any of us are religious.

1781
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,400
I think literally none of us have any religious inclination whatsoever.

1782
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,640
Well, no, he asked how his religion affected your child.

1783
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,200
Oh, true.

1784
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,440
I was raised hardcore Catholic, so.

1785
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1786
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,720
Like church every week until I was 16.

1787
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:47,600
Wasn't there like a hardcore anti-religion PCP or Let's Play?

1788
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,120
I don't know if it ever got released, though.

1789
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,920
What?

1790
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,000
No, well, we did a religion cast,

1791
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,480
which I think was a lot of dunking on religion in general.

1792
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,200
Yeah, but like at that point too, I think you and Davoo

1793
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:02,400
and somebody else did like a long Let's Play

1794
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,200
where you were just like talking about your upbringings with religion.

1795
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,840
But I don't think it got released.

1796
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:08,880
I think it was.

1797
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:11,040
I think like the files were corrupted or something.

1798
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:11,600
Yeah, I don't know.

1799
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,240
I don't remember.

1800
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,760
God, God wasn't having that one.

1801
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,560
I'll say that I don't think personally for me,

1802
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,640
I was raised generally religious.

1803
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:21,120
We went to church every Sunday for a long while.

1804
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:25,360
I don't think it had any particular like exceptionally bad effects on me

1805
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,240
because I actually, despite, I'm going to say anti-theist,

1806
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,520
I think it is bad for the world that people believe in religion.

1807
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:36,160
I'm not saying that I necessarily know like the solution, but.

1808
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
We went to church.

1809
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,720
It was fine.

1810
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,280
Nothing interesting to say on this topic.

1811
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,480
Let's play the next question.

1812
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,480
Okay, but that was only his final question, which was shit.

1813
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:48,320
His main point about, oh, living forever.

1814
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,680
Now on that, I want to say something.

1815
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:51,120
Simbolic immortality.

1816
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,240
Simbolic immortality.

1817
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:54,720
I think if you're making videos,

1818
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,800
then that's like one of the most volatile

1819
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,800
and will probably dissolve quickly.

1820
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,400
Yeah. I mean, how long until the server farms

1821
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,160
are all destroyed by aliens or something?

1822
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,240
I mean, they're not going to last that long.

1823
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,440
I don't know. People need to keep up.

1824
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,760
Actually, is anything digital is the same?

1825
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,080
Kind of.

1826
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,840
So it just depends on how long the internet survives.

1827
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,000
I mean, anything material is the same, right?

1828
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,080
Yeah.

1829
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,880
There's no material that doesn't erode.

1830
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,680
Yeah, but a bronze statue lasts longer than a bronze vinyl record.

1831
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,160
I mean, true.

1832
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,320
To this guy's point, though,

1833
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,400
he said like artists are comforted

1834
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,960
by the thought that their works will outweigh them.

1835
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,160
But like, I mean, to an extent, share.

1836
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,960
That's true for me. That's absolutely, I'm in this category.

1837
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,840
Well, I mean, I get consumed by the long-term thought of,

1838
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,960
I mean, I guess as Gabe was saying,

1839
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,480
it's like, I'm thinking long-term,

1840
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:41,680
like nothing of me will exist in a thousand years.

1841
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,840
And that makes me kind of upset that like,

1842
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,920
oh, I'm going to be completely forgotten.

1843
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,440
100% chance.

1844
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,680
Like people like Elon Musk might be remembered

1845
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,080
if they colonize Mars successfully or something,

1846
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,680
even if they just get it started.

1847
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,600
But like, you guys are all, you're all,

1848
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,120
you're all worried about nothing.

1849
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:58,320
Look, it's the year is 2019.

1850
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,280
Transhumanism.

1851
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,800
The night, it's 2019.

1852
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,920
So we have, we have eight years before 2027 hits

1853
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,920
and Deus Ex happens, canon.

1854
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,400
And we're all.

1855
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,760
Oh yeah, it's canon.

1856
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,800
Oh, I hope you're right.

1857
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:08,880
That's true.

1858
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,000
Oh, I hope you're right.

1859
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:10,960
Oh, I'm praying for it.

1860
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,640
I'm praying to the digital God.

1861
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:16,720
I think that, you know, on Krypton in Superman lore,

1862
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,120
incidentally, I think that those people had obtained

1863
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:21,440
like scientific functional immortality.

1864
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,440
And like the reason that Krypton went to shit

1865
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,920
was because everyone was immortal, nothing changed.

1866
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,920
And I'm just saying, if we get a more immortality,

1867
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,440
I can see that happening in humanity.

1868
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,640
And we all just eventually like just die out.

1869
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,160
Well, all of a sudden we get firmware updates,

1870
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,240
you know, we'll be on human OS 13.

1871
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:34,320
I guess so.

1872
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,440
And we'll finally get dark mode

1873
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:36,560
and the black people will come back.

1874
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,800
Okay, all right, let's go to the next one.

1875
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,680
How many of these do we have?

1876
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,480
I have to piss again.

1877
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,920
I think there's three more.

1878
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:44,640
No, four more, four more.

1879
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:46,320
I can stand that, I guess.

1880
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,440
This is I'll Die Bought on porn and dark souls.

1881
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,360
So let's see what they have to say for us.

1882
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:51,600
Go.

1883
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,840
Hey, hooting up.

1884
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,840
I'll die corporation voicemail bot.

1885
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,040
The landscape of one sexuality

1886
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,440
has better nonlinear level design than dark souls.

1887
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,120
You start going down whatever avenues

1888
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:06,160
are immediately apparent

1889
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,600
until they suddenly interconnect

1890
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,960
in ways you never expected,

1891
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,640
eventually elucidating that it is all

1892
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:12,160
a manifestation of something else

1893
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:14,160
deep inside you wanting to be expressed

1894
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:16,000
in the same way that the kiln of the first flame

1895
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,360
was deep below the same fire

1896
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,120
like shrine you always called home.

1897
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,000
In other words,

1898
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,520
there's no reason to beat your meat

1899
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,560
when beating dark souls

1900
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,400
has already given you all the same pleasures.

1901
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,000
Shutting down, I'll die corporation voicemail bot.

1902
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,800
That was incredible.

1903
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:31,920
Thank you, I'll die corporation bot.

1904
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,200
I love it and I want more.

1905
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,640
Yeah, keep it going.

1906
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:36,000
He's been doing it for a while or she,

1907
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:36,640
I don't know.

1908
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,280
Yeah, those are great.

1909
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,120
Whatever algorithm is producing these voicemails.

1910
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,720
Indeed, pretty advanced.

1911
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,400
Okay, we've got white,

1912
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,880
I think it's from Wike, W-E-I-C-H.

1913
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,040
White, the professional furry.

1914
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,320
Okay, and here we go.

1915
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,120
Go.

1916
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,840
Okay, now as a real furry,

1917
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,840
let me lay down the law on who is

1918
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,200
and is not a furry,

1919
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,480
because I have authority.

1920
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:59,920
Oh, we definitely got a furry voice.

1921
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,360
Super furry voice.

1922
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,640
And you just are a furry,

1923
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,680
there's no denying it.

1924
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,920
If anyone disagrees, shut up.

1925
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,520
Now, the interesting thing is people

1926
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,040
who may not say they are,

1927
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,600
but have varying degrees of deniability

1928
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:12,640
in that claim.

1929
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,400
If you just kind of look at furry art,

1930
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,800
but have no real participation in the community,

1931
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,800
even if you have some inclinations

1932
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,640
with your art consumption,

1933
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,720
then you're not really a furry unless you say so.

1934
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:25,520
But if you participate in furry communities,

1935
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:26,880
like if you make furry art

1936
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,200
or you talk to other furry community members as in equal,

1937
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,520
now you kind of are a furry,

1938
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,680
even if you don't have a fursona, pretty much.

1939
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,280
You're maybe like diet furry.

1940
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,000
But if you have a fursona,

1941
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,640
pretty much in any capacity whatsoever,

1942
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:45,680
especially if you call it a fursona,

1943
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,440
then you just are a furry.

1944
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,480
And if you say you aren't,

1945
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,160
then you are not only a furry,

1946
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:53,200
but you're also a liar, liar, liar, fur on fire.

1947
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,240
I want to make an addendum to this.

1948
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:01,280
It's unrelated about furry as an art style.

1949
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,720
If you say furry is an art style,

1950
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,960
that is literally the exact same thing

1951
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,520
as saying anime is an art style.

1952
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,400
Which is not that unfair.

1953
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,640
Make that statement what you will, digi bro.

1954
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,760
Yeah, I mean, it's not like anime

1955
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,320
is overwhelmingly pretty similar.

1956
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:20,800
If somebody said that as if it were objectively true,

1957
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,040
I'd be like, no, there's a lot of exceptions.

1958
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,200
But as a generalization, yeah,

1959
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,520
anime tends to look a certain way.

1960
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:29,280
It's very easy to identify.

1961
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,360
Furry is the same way.

1962
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:32,480
What about avatar?

1963
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,920
I'm so confused.

1964
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,440
They're a sort of a cut.

1965
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,800
You could probably break down,

1966
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,240
and maybe someone should.

1967
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,800
There are probably schools of furry art.

1968
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,680
Sure, at least.

1969
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:44,000
There are a couple of different looks that it can add.

1970
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,520
Just like there are schools of furry voices.

1971
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,720
There's like a more anime-ish look.

1972
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,560
There's like a more Disney-ish look.

1973
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,600
There's probably others.

1974
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,200
I mean, I feel like the reason

1975
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,520
the furry art style rubs me the wrong way

1976
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,160
is because I think of that as like,

1977
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:02,080
oh, it's an animal, but as a human,

1978
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,400
which is just like a type of thing.

1979
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,960
It's like saying there's a boat art style.

1980
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,040
Like there's an art style for drawing a boat.

1981
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:12,080
All boat art style is the same, generally.

1982
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,640
And I'm like, yeah, but you can paint a picture of a boat

1983
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:15,920
and you can cray on a boat,

1984
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:17,440
and you can draw a difference.

1985
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,480
You do a 3D boat.

1986
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,040
Abstract.

1987
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:19,600
Well, yeah.

1988
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,880
There's so many different ways to do it.

1989
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,440
But what if culturally...

1990
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:22,880
Calling it an art style is...

1991
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,080
Well, hold on.

1992
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:27,040
Yeah, I know that boats is not culturally similar.

1993
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,360
No, no, but what if culturally,

1994
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,040
people tended to draw boats

1995
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,520
in a couple of broadly similar ways,

1996
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,440
which is kind of how it is with furry art?

1997
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:38,640
It's kind of like with the masculine and feminine.

1998
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:39,680
I would argue that, sure,

1999
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,760
there's a binary of people who fall in the spectrum,

2000
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,240
but I think we can identify two focal points

2001
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,880
of femininity generally exists

2002
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,720
and masculinity generally exists.

2003
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,480
And I think that the substantive arguments

2004
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,600
are like, does that justify calling it there

2005
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,960
because there's so much gray area?

2006
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,480
I would argue, yes, in the same way

2007
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,400
I would argue there is a furry art style,

2008
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,840
but I get why people say no.

2009
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,640
I don't think there's one furry art style.

2010
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:04,960
I think there are furry art style.

2011
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,480
It just calls on me to...

2012
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:10,720
It feels like a challenge to draw an anthropomorphized animal

2013
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:14,400
in a way that is in no way similar to any furry art style

2014
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,440
and then have someone say,

2015
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:20,400
oh, it's a furry art style when it's like some strange Picasso thing.

2016
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:24,000
It feels like reductive of what art style is.

2017
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:28,400
I definitely think it's possible to draw anthroanimals

2018
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:29,840
and not have a furry art style,

2019
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:33,840
but when I see furry art, I feel like I know it immediately.

2020
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,920
Just like the voice, which is now...

2021
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,200
That's now what I'm going on.

2022
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:39,680
Like, fuck any other data.

2023
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,840
If I hear the voice, I know you're a furry.

2024
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,160
That's now my entire basis.

2025
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:45,520
I guess we're talking about the art though.

2026
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:46,640
Look at salazzle.

2027
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:49,680
Like, okay, I feel like through the eyes of a furry,

2028
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:53,920
salazzle is like a hot milk, just exactly the same drawing.

2029
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,680
But like through the eyes of just a normal...

2030
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:56,880
Like, I'm not even saying they're abnormal,

2031
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,320
but like through a non-furry,

2032
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:01,680
salazzle is simply like a slightly feminine lizard creature.

2033
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:03,680
So it's really the eye of the beholder

2034
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:05,120
that I think decides a lot of it.

2035
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,280
I don't know, that's what I got.

2036
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,560
Okay, let's move on.

2037
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:09,920
Because this is a hot one, boys.

2038
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:12,640
We got Gnoggin the Genome is calling in.

2039
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:15,040
Oh, from lock stock in Gnoggin?

2040
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,360
Indeed. Let's hear what he has to say for us.

2041
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:17,680
Go.

2042
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,280
Hello, my old chums.

2043
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,200
Gnoggin the Genome here.

2044
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:27,520
A huge fan of the gontas.

2045
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,240
I've been listening since episode one.

2046
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:33,120
I have a question for Mr. Bestman.

2047
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:37,040
I understand that you're a huge fan of the Gnoblin Slayer.

2048
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,480
And I am too.

2049
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:42,160
A very important Gnome called Gnadoch Gnitler

2050
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:45,760
once said 14 very famous words.

2051
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,720
You must secure the existence of our people

2052
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:51,520
and a future for all Gnome children.

2053
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:56,480
Right, now then, if a Gnoblin came into your hovel,

2054
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,360
what do you invite him inside for cream cakes

2055
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,960
and chocolate going to drink?

2056
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,560
Or what do you call Gnoggin the Stapho and Mr. Godwin say?

2057
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,720
Gnoggin the Gnoblin Slayer.

2058
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:09,760
This is Gnoggin the Gnome, sign him off.

2059
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:10,320
Cheerio!

2060
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,600
Boy, I'd be on that phone to the Gn-

2061
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:15,600
G-G-G-Gnostapo like that.

2062
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:19,920
I'd be fucking absolutely fucking Gnoblins.

2063
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:25,120
Better safe than sorry with Gnoblin than sorry with say.

2064
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:28,080
Well, you know, one of the untold stories of our age

2065
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:31,280
that history will look back at us unfavorably for not reporting on

2066
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:34,240
is the deep racial tension between the Gnoblins and the Gnomes

2067
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:37,120
and they will understand that we just turned a blind eye

2068
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,640
to the genocide and the massacre,

2069
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:41,280
but hopefully we can spread awareness here.

2070
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,600
If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it.

2071
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:44,240
Exactly.

2072
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,960
Oh, I love you, Gnoggin.

2073
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,760
You're my hero.

2074
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,280
Okay, let's move on.

2075
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:50,320
Oh, wait.

2076
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:51,600
Okay.

2077
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,240
Charming.

2078
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,720
I was going to play this one from Chilling Chocolate

2079
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,320
that was about the Teen CP,

2080
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:59,440
but Munchy isn't here and also it was a shit message.

2081
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,440
There was another like, oh, please pay attention to me.

2082
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,720
I'm the Teen CP.

2083
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,800
Please play me on your podcast.

2084
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,400
Listen, guys, you got to get organized.

2085
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:09,040
Classic Teen, classic Teen CP tactics.

2086
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:09,760
Munchy was here.

2087
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:10,720
It's just a phase.

2088
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,120
It's just a phase.

2089
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:11,760
It's just a phase.

2090
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,760
If Munchy was here, I'd at least tell them like...

2091
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:14,800
Dude, that should be their slogan.

2092
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:15,120
That should be their slogan.

2093
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:16,480
It's just a phase.

2094
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,760
Teen CP.

2095
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:18,560
It's just a phase.

2096
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,520
That's a good one.

2097
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:23,280
Yeah, some sons, you're gonna have to try better than that.

2098
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,400
You're gonna have to try better than that

2099
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,120
to earn your fatherly boomer father pride.

2100
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:28,240
Indeed, indeed.

2101
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,600
Episode one is out though.

2102
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:31,120
We'll let you ride the lawn mower.

2103
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,720
Episode one and maybe episode two will be out

2104
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:34,560
when you hear this on Munchy's YouTube channel.

2105
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:35,920
So go check it out if you want to.

2106
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:38,080
But I'm just saying, like, okay,

2107
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:40,000
there's a problem with the Teen CP,

2108
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,800
which is that there's no discord or anything

2109
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,840
for people to be on.

2110
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:47,200
So they come to the PCP one or like RFCK

2111
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:48,480
because they don't know...

2112
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,480
Like, Chilling Chocolate wants to be on,

2113
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:51,760
I think is the idea,

2114
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:54,080
but he doesn't know where to go to talk to you guys.

2115
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:56,080
So for the love of God, get organized.

2116
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:57,840
They're directionless and aimless,

2117
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,880
but they don't know what to do.

2118
02:04:58,880 --> 02:04:59,280
Indeed.

2119
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,840
Munchy, here's the solution.

2120
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:02,720
Make a discord server.

2121
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,520
It doesn't have to be Munchy.

2122
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:04,800
Anyone in the Teen CP,

2123
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,640
make a discord server and post the link

2124
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,560
in the fucking comments or something

2125
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:12,080
so we can not have to hear your shitty comments anymore,

2126
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,520
complaining and whining and shit.

2127
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:13,920
Okay.

2128
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:14,960
No kids allowed.

2129
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,760
No kids allowed.

2130
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,200
Okay, final message.

2131
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:20,720
It is Game Board Gaylord Final.

2132
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,440
Thank God.

2133
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:23,040
Okay, let's see what he's got for us today.

2134
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:23,520
Go.

2135
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:25,440
It is me, the Game Board Gaylord,

2136
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:28,240
and I am here to inform you that I won.

2137
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:28,720
I did it.

2138
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,360
What?

2139
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:29,760
I told you so.

2140
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:30,400
No, come on.

2141
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:30,720
All right.

2142
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:32,080
Now, let's play another game.

2143
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,480
Just kidding.

2144
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,800
I just want to know what your favorite board game is.

2145
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:37,280
That's all.

2146
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,280
All right, thank God.

2147
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,280
It was all a long time to get us to say

2148
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:44,640
what our favorite board game is.

2149
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,240
I like Monopoly a lot.

2150
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:46,640
Oh, that's disgusting.

2151
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:47,440
As I would.

2152
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,000
Nate, everyone hates Monopoly.

2153
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,680
I don't think you've played Monopoly recently,

2154
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:52,480
or you wouldn't say.

2155
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:53,120
Probably not in the last five years.

2156
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:55,200
One person in the world that would love Monopoly.

2157
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:56,560
No, I really like Monopoly.

2158
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,040
When I was like 13 to never play Monopoly again,

2159
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,960
and I've held strong to it.

2160
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,280
So she gave me.

2161
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,200
I win Monopoly most of the time.

2162
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:03,840
I'm just saying.

2163
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:04,240
I'm just saying.

2164
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:04,880
That's why I like it.

2165
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:06,560
The person that wins Monopoly

2166
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,280
is just the person who lands on a good space first.

2167
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,640
That's not crazy.

2168
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:13,520
I once played like the legendary,

2169
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,040
into the wee hours of the morning,

2170
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:21,040
family Monopoly at a Christmas family gathering,

2171
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,840
where it was me and some of my cousins and uncles.

2172
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:25,680
Everyone else had gone to bed,

2173
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:28,640
but I was like the last young boy there.

2174
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:30,240
I was like seven or something.

2175
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:32,000
And I won.

2176
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,040
I beat everyone.

2177
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:33,600
Wait, what was the game?

2178
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,640
Family at Monopoly.

2179
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,760
Oh, I see.

2180
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:35,920
I see.

2181
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:38,160
Because it went on for like seven hours,

2182
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,080
and it was the first time in my life

2183
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,360
that I had stayed up so late without getting tired.

2184
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:44,560
I felt like a god.

2185
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:47,120
But after that, I realized that I don't want to do that again.

2186
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:47,920
So I never played again.

2187
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:49,040
You're going to go on the high note, you know?

2188
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:50,800
Shoots and ladders is fun.

2189
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:52,320
Oh, my God.

2190
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:55,760
You guys have the worst fucking board game ever.

2191
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,040
Here is a great board game.

2192
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,800
Fucking Buccaneer.

2193
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:01,360
It is a pirate sailing board game

2194
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:05,440
involving stealing things from treasures

2195
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,920
from certain islands on squares on the map.

2196
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:10,560
It's a game my dad played when he was young,

2197
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,520
and he bought a version of eBay,

2198
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:14,720
and we played it a few times.

2199
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:18,720
And it's got these tiny plastic pirate ships,

2200
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:21,680
and it's this four harbors,

2201
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:23,360
and you can go and raid someone else's harbor

2202
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,200
if you have a higher number of crew.

2203
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,760
And the crew is like, you get them from cards,

2204
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:29,840
and you can trade crew for treasures and stuff.

2205
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:33,600
Really strategic, really fun, great.

2206
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,160
Great game.

2207
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,200
Doesn't last for hours.

2208
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:35,600
That's good.

2209
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:36,480
That's important.

2210
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,040
It feels like very balanced.

2211
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:41,440
Now, here comes Big Dick Tom.

2212
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,880
He's going to be like, Katan.

2213
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:45,840
I like Katan in the merely indifferent board games

2214
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,680
that boomers play these days.

2215
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:49,840
It's probably a toss-up either between

2216
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,920
Betrayalight House on the Hill or Mansions of Madness.

2217
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:52,960
They're both really fun.

2218
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,000
I played one of those.

2219
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,120
It's fun.

2220
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:56,800
I think I played the first one with you at the time.

2221
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:59,280
Yeah, we played when you guys came over that one time,

2222
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,640
and it was a great time.

2223
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:01,440
Wait, was Nate there, too?

2224
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:02,560
Nate was there.

2225
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,840
Yeah.

2226
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,160
Huh.

2227
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:06,240
Oh, the furtive Nate, so easily forgotten.

2228
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,640
That was the trip when Nate,

2229
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:10,080
they were playing board games, and he's like,

2230
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:12,720
wait, I got to go talk about the analysis anarchy

2231
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,480
and just hijack my computer.

2232
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:15,120
And wait.

2233
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:15,600
Wait, what?

2234
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,400
Well, I don't remember this.

2235
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:19,600
Wait, Tom, please explain that.

2236
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:20,960
I don't remember what you're talking about.

2237
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,520
Oh, god.

2238
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,800
I remember, okay, I remember I went to your house

2239
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:25,520
a couple times.

2240
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:27,040
I forgot that Nate was there one time.

2241
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:27,120
Yeah, Nate was there one time.

2242
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:28,320
Did you?

2243
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,200
Uh-huh.

2244
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:29,440
Yeah.

2245
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,720
Was this when an analysis anarchy

2246
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,080
had just come out or something?

2247
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,280
Yeah, this was a while ago.

2248
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,600
It was like years ago.

2249
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:34,720
Oh, it was like the first time,

2250
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:36,880
and I think we were just being like, wow, what the fuck.

2251
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:40,480
And you were like, you took my computer.

2252
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,600
Like, I need to get on a Skype call

2253
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,720
and figure out what is going on.

2254
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,560
And we're all just like, gay.

2255
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:45,760
Wait a minute.

2256
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:46,000
Wait a minute.

2257
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,240
Was the Skype call, was that when I was deciding

2258
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:50,320
whether I was going to be on the show or not?

2259
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:51,120
I believe so.

2260
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:51,520
I believe that is what it happened.

2261
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,040
Yeah, I think that's right.

2262
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,640
That's when the fateful decision was made

2263
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,560
and the timeline split between me and Ben.

2264
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:58,720
Me on the light path, Ben on the dark path.

2265
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:00,320
I was going, no, that's when we split

2266
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,320
into the worst timeline when you decided

2267
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:06,240
not to follow me on my journey into whatever the fuck that was.

2268
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:07,680
An analysis anarchy.

2269
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,680
Yeah, that was when it all started to go wrong.

2270
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:10,160
Indeed.

2271
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:10,880
And only for you.

2272
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:13,600
I'm pretty good at boggle.

2273
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:14,640
Boggle.

2274
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,240
Okay, not bad.

2275
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:18,160
I think I'm pretty dang good at boggle.

2276
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:20,160
Yep.

2277
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,120
You know, I try to-

2278
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:22,800
Oh, wait, wait, fridge scrabble.

2279
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,560
Fridge scrabble, fridge magnets,

2280
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,560
where you'd write something on the fridge

2281
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,200
and it's really funny and then someone writes a response

2282
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:30,800
with the remaining letters

2283
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,800
and then you change your thing to a different thing.

2284
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:34,400
That's my favorite board game.

2285
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,840
It's played vertically.

2286
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:40,080
And there's, yeah, vertical fridge scrabble.

2287
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:41,200
Vertical integration.

2288
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:42,000
It doesn't matter.

2289
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,040
It's just really funny.

2290
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,480
Excellent.

2291
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,160
All right, I think we're done here, folks.

2292
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:47,680
That's all the board games that exist.

2293
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,960
I have, yeah.

2294
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,320
Hey, I wanna, before the show ends,

2295
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,160
I wanna, I have two things to plug.

2296
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,480
One, this week, when you hear this,

2297
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:58,240
once again, another vaporette will be posted

2298
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:00,560
on my website, stcomics.com.

2299
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,600
Ben, I don't know who did that.

2300
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,680
I loved that last, I was like,

2301
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:05,760
wow, Ben's art really improved for this one.

2302
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,040
And then I was like, oh, shit.

2303
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,840
Oh, you mean Lauren Colt?

2304
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,400
I believe so.

2305
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,320
It was the newest one, the fluffy animation.

2306
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:13,040
I mean, it looked great.

2307
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,480
Yeah, that one, that one.

2308
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,920
Lauren Colt is so...

2309
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,640
Why did she agree to work on your lowly project?

2310
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,120
Oh, sorry.

2311
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,040
He, well, we did it, well, we did an art.

2312
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:23,040
So I did two pages for his webcomic

2313
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:23,520
and he did two pages for mine.

2314
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,120
Why did he downgrade so savagely as Michael?

2315
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:28,960
All right, all right, I get it.

2316
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:30,400
Yes, I get it, yes.

2317
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,320
Lauren Colt's art is lush

2318
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,640
and you should all check him out on Twitter and whatever.

2319
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,680
Well, that was the one where,

2320
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:37,840
where What's Your Face Came Home and saw,

2321
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:38,880
oh, maybe I shouldn't spoil it,

2322
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:39,920
but the shower was involved, right?

2323
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:41,040
Yeah, I don't spoil it.

2324
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:42,400
No.

2325
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,480
Oh no, it was right, it was just the room.

2326
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:44,720
Okay.

2327
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:45,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, your spoilers?

2328
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:47,920
I'm sorry, I just want to say the art was fantastic

2329
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:48,560
and I loved it.

2330
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:50,560
It is, it puts me to shame.

2331
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:51,200
Yeah, fair.

2332
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:52,560
It's, I'm disgraced.

2333
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:55,520
But don't worry, no worries about that this week

2334
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,760
because this week's one is drawn by Munchie.

2335
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,560
Oh, how exciting.

2336
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,080
So no, so no, but it's like 11 pages long.

2337
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:04,320
He didn't, he just made it 11 pages long for some reason,

2338
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,120
so it's like way longer.

2339
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:05,360
There's like two, right?

2340
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:06,400
So that'll be up on the website.

2341
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,400
Yeah, the others are two pages.

2342
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:09,360
Well, I don't know why.

2343
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:09,440
I don't know why.

2344
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,360
He just decided to make his fucking long as hell.

2345
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:15,120
Also, me and my friend John recorded a podcast.

2346
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:16,160
It's called Grimp.

2347
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,920
Episode one is out now.

2348
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:18,720
What's the subject of description?

2349
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:19,760
What do you talk about?

2350
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,360
We talk about art anxiety.

2351
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:24,000
It's a title, a reference to Gimp

2352
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,400
and how it's better than Photoshop.

2353
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,000
And for free.

2354
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:28,720
Maybe.

2355
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:33,200
The podcast was almost called the official Dijornos podcast.

2356
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:34,080
That would have been good too.

2357
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,320
But we chickened out.

2358
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,280
Didn't want to get that C, so this is this letter.

2359
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:41,440
You feared the long, yeah, the long-term game

2360
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:42,240
had to play it safe.

2361
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:43,440
My plug.

2362
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:44,640
But there's chill jams.

2363
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:46,240
There's chill jams in it too, so.

2364
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:48,800
My plug is going to be if you're listening to the PCP,

2365
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,960
you should also be listening to Artso Farto's

2366
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,800
Whirling Dervish podcast.

2367
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,760
It's the podcast that I am the most proud of,

2368
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,520
of any podcast I've ever been involved with.

2369
02:11:59,520 --> 02:11:59,840
Wow.

2370
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:00,560
It's pretty good.

2371
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:02,240
Frankly, I don't know how you sit down.

2372
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,680
I don't know how you sit down to nobody else involved but you.

2373
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,080
How fit for this?

2374
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:05,600
I was going to say, wait, who do you do it with?

2375
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:06,000
It's a loan.

2376
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:06,480
It's just me.

2377
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:07,040
It's a loan.

2378
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,000
Well, it's not even me.

2379
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,040
It's Artso Farto.

2380
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,640
I'm not even a part of it.

2381
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:13,040
There is Tard Wrangler May in the back though.

2382
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:14,240
You're just the producer.

2383
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,440
Oh yeah, that's true.

2384
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:18,640
May is in the background as the Tard Wrangler.

2385
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,160
She doesn't really say anything.

2386
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:22,400
She's just there to make sure that.

2387
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,080
I've been wondering, what do you think is,

2388
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:29,840
like what are the stakes here that May is here to like prevent happening?

2389
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:30,960
What could happen?

2390
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,800
Maybe it's happening and you cut it out, I don't know.

2391
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:33,760
Who knows?

2392
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:34,480
If you go to.

2393
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:37,040
I mean, I do record the, well,

2394
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:41,280
Artso records the podcast standing up in his underwear.

2395
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:43,840
So the whole thing is done as a standing rant,

2396
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:46,480
make it in my room, in the office.

2397
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:51,840
So I guess just to make sure that it doesn't become like some kind of bath salts rampage.

2398
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,280
Okay, that's fair.

2399
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:00,480
You made the analogy in, I think the second one about how the whirling dervish is like your

2400
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:02,880
CPU fan trying to keep you cool so you don't.

2401
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:07,280
Yeah, May is like when you just have to pull the power plug out of the wall.

2402
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:07,840
Exactly.

2403
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:09,040
It's too bad.

2404
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,120
I've had to do that to computers before.

2405
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:12,480
I haven't really enjoyed them incidentally.

2406
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,600
Big fan, big fan.

2407
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,080
Thank you.

2408
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:14,960
We'll go on, Gabe.

2409
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,760
I want to plug again, the the the punk plush Kickstarter.

2410
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:22,320
It started off real, real strong, but it's slowing down.

2411
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:23,440
Needs it needs another bump.

2412
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:24,160
It needs, it needs you.

2413
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:29,760
I'm personally invested because I pledge and if you people don't fucking make this happen,

2414
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:33,520
I don't get my pump plush, fuck all of you, make it real.

2415
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:37,280
Yeah, you got to, you got to share it and you got to, you got to make people become fans.

2416
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:44,720
But also if you're not like willing to throw down like a big, you know, cash settle.

2417
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:51,200
I will be doing like art commissions if you like my art style, if you just like want to help.

2418
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,680
That is like a lower tier reward.

2419
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:57,280
If you want to do that instead, that's a thing.

2420
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:59,840
Hopefully this, this will work.

2421
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:06,640
But if it doesn't, I, I'm, you know, I'm not going to be like crying, but it will be like,

2422
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:11,760
you'll have like a lot of angry people who wanted the plush and they will kill you instead.

2423
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:13,120
They will be the ones killing you.

2424
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,200
You will become a target of that.

2425
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:17,600
You know, you know, Gabe, I'm such a cheap asshole.

2426
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,920
I was thinking to myself like, I've got it.

2427
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,520
I do, I would like the plush if it was just supporting something abstract, I wouldn't do it.

2428
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,640
But since there's a plush on the line, I was like, that's interesting.

2429
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:27,200
You know what I'll do?

2430
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:28,480
I'll split it with Michelle.

2431
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,560
And then we can both like enjoy having the plush.

2432
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,840
The problem was she had already given money.

2433
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,680
And so she didn't want to split with me again.

2434
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:38,320
And I'm not willing to go all the way myself.

2435
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,480
So what I want, what I want to give.

2436
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:41,200
Unforgivable.

2437
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:42,000
I want you.

2438
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,680
So she, so she already got one.

2439
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:45,120
No, well, she didn't pledge that much.

2440
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:48,080
She pledged like a lower tier thing or something, like 10 or 20 bucks or something.

2441
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:52,480
Yeah, no, she, she, I think she didn't ask for a, for a reward at all.

2442
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:53,040
I think, I think that's true.

2443
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:54,880
Well, she just pledged, well, she just pledged like,

2444
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:59,120
if she just pledged like five more bucks or whatever, then you could go half.

2445
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:02,000
All you got to do, all you got to do, you just go and edit her pledge,

2446
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
and then you pay the rest of it and get up to the.

2447
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,480
Oh, okay.

2448
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,720
See, I was going to ask if that's something that we could do.

2449
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:07,840
That's what I was going to ask.

2450
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:08,720
Yeah, you can edit your pledge at any time.

2451
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:09,520
You can do that.

2452
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:12,640
If you have, if you have a pledge currently, you can, you can double it.

2453
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,440
You can triple it.

2454
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,760
I won't send you more plushies unless you ask for it.

2455
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:16,480
Okay.

2456
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:20,560
But like, like, I mean, that's, that's still a thing that can, can be.

2457
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:21,440
You remember that guy?

2458
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:26,320
If you say, if you say like in the comments, so like, I'm pledging double the amount,

2459
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:31,360
can I have two, I will say yes, because as long as the money is, you know, is there,

2460
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,360
I will be able to get the product.

2461
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:34,640
Okay, I got you.

2462
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:36,720
I was going to, I was going to say, if that wasn't a possibility,

2463
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:39,760
I was going to ask you to be like, remember that guy in the undead church,

2464
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:42,800
when you ring the bell, who like absolves ones of sin, I was like,

2465
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,200
can you please absolve Michelle of the guilt of unpledging, like personally,

2466
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:50,400
so that we can repledge together and then pay for it.

2467
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:51,040
But okay.

2468
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,280
Okay.

2469
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:51,520
Good.

2470
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:54,960
We will edit her pledge and I'll be, I'll chip in on half of that or whatever.

2471
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:55,760
Okay.

2472
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:56,320
Sick.

2473
02:15:56,320 --> 02:16:00,640
I, I forgot to mention, yeah, this week when you hear this, uh,

2474
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:02,400
vaporette is munchies vaporette.

2475
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,800
And then next week, vapor's three drop.

2476
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:05,920
Oh my God.

2477
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:06,560
How exciting.

2478
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:06,720
Yeah.

2479
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,440
I can't wait.

2480
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:09,440
I, I know, like, right.

2481
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,360
I, it's so forever.

2482
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,480
It's been fucking forever.

2483
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,520
I'm incredibly stoked.

2484
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,440
Uh, will it be worth it?

2485
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:15,680
Yes.

2486
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,320
Of course not.

2487
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,480
No, nothing will be worth, nothing will be,

2488
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:21,520
nothing will be worth the time it has taken, but perhaps it will be some

2489
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:25,760
consolation to you and me that it finally exists.

2490
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,000
If only then, we can all take sucker.

2491
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,000
If only I could, I could unmute you on Twitter to get those updates,

2492
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,240
except that I would see you just being mean to Boogie and instantly turn it off again

2493
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:37,120
and not want to be anywhere near.

2494
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,240
What the fuck?

2495
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:39,200
What the fuck?

2496
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:39,920
Fuck you.

2497
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,120
Fuck Boogie.

2498
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,320
Boogie is a fucking coward.

2499
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:44,400
I'm just saying, I don't like meanness, but okay.

2500
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:45,040
Anyway, anyway.

2501
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:46,720
Boogie is a fucking, oh my God.

2502
02:16:46,720 --> 02:16:48,240
Let's fucking go on and think about Boogie.

2503
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:49,440
Let's talk about Boogie.

2504
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:50,480
No, no, I gotta wait.

2505
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:51,360
Wait, no, no, no.

2506
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:52,640
Fade out, fade out, fade out.

2507
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:53,760
I gotta include my pit.

2508
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,600
Centrist, fensitize.

2509
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:56,640
All right, all right, great.

2510
02:16:56,640 --> 02:16:57,200
Okay, cool.

2511
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:59,920
But, but let me just get my pledge, which is just that, hey everybody,

2512
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,560
MiaMath of a 2, uh, I was late, it's not done yet,

2513
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:04,000
but it's going to be done like a day or two.

2514
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,960
So that's exciting.

2515
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,520
But right now, uh, well actually it'll be like a week ago for you.

2516
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:09,840
You can go listen to the MiaMath of a 2 theme,

2517
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,320
which is available on Spotify and Bandcamp.

2518
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:15,280
And I think people might enjoy listening to it because it's really cool.

2519
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:16,960
And Hylio did a great job.

2520
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:20,400
And, uh, you can give me money for it on Bandcamp if you want to pay to download the track,

2521
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:21,440
but it's also free.

2522
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:23,280
So, you know, do whatever the fuck you want.

2523
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,080
And that's real nice.

2524
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:25,120
And I think it's real good.

2525
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,560
And I'm super happy it's out.

2526
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:29,040
Thanks again, Munchy for making the logo, which is beautiful.

2527
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,880
And thanks to Hylio for making the song.

2528
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,920
Couldn't be happier with it.

2529
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,400
And definitive edition coming soon.

2530
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:35,680
Get ready for it.

2531
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,360
My plug is the Zoom game.

2532
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,320
It's on Twitter.

2533
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:43,920
It is the second best voted, voted the second best game of May on Newgrounds official.

2534
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,960
I was beaten out by a shitty game that just had a girl with big tits on it.

2535
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:47,600
Titties, right?

2536
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:48,640
Yeah, yeah, of course.

2537
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:49,360
You can't compete.

2538
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:49,840
You can't compete.

2539
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:51,200
You got to give a Zoomie big tits.

2540
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,320
That's what everyone said.

2541
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:55,040
I said no flat hashtag flat lives matter.

2542
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:55,840
Representing.

2543
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:56,800
No, no.

2544
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:57,920
This is my fucking thing.

2545
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,200
This is my new crusade.

2546
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,080
Fucking big titty.

2547
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:01,520
Hey, oblivion fall in the comments.

2548
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:02,640
Oblivion fall in the comments.

2549
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:03,040
What do you say?

2550
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:08,240
He was like, he was like, I can't believe all these quote unquote cowards and quote unquote

2551
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,040
straight man.

2552
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:10,640
You are all about the huge titties.

2553
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:11,200
That's right.

2554
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:11,680
That's right.

2555
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:12,400
Yeah, all you gotta do.

2556
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:13,600
Oblivion fall, you're my boy.

2557
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:17,840
I don't even mind that you called me a conch.

2558
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:21,920
All you got to do, Tom, new character, just be the big tit character.

2559
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:22,960
I'm going to have to do that.

2560
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,040
You just have to have a nice little flat.

2561
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:25,520
Also a furry.

2562
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:26,720
There's a term for it that I forget.

2563
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:28,960
I mean, I know it's a character when they're like wearing their shirt.

2564
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:32,240
You can't see their tits, but miraculously when they open their shirt,

2565
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,640
all of a sudden they have gigantic titties or whatever.

2566
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:38,320
I don't know what the term for it is, but that could be a Zoomie still on the table.

2567
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:41,680
The term for it is canon.

2568
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,240
All right.

2569
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,680
Let's end on a high note, people.

2570
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:47,600
Think about a Zoomie's big hidden titties.

2571
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:47,920
All right.

2572
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:48,720
Thanks for being here.

2573
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:52,560
Oh, patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2574
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:54,960
We've got like 26 fucking bonus episodes.

2575
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:55,600
Go listen to them.

2576
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,320
They're a great time.

2577
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:58,880
You'll have lots of fun on the patron.

2578
02:18:58,880 --> 02:18:59,360
Less than that.

2579
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:00,800
Getting the patron, that's for a dollar.

2580
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:01,600
That's fun stuff.

2581
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:04,320
And at TPCrastinators on Twitter.

2582
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,080
Updates, releases, et cetera.

2583
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:06,720
Have a good time.

2584
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:06,960
Okay.

2585
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:07,840
Thanks for being here.

2586
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,120
See you next week, everybody.

2587
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:09,840
Love you.

2588
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:10,480
Goodbye.

2589
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:10,960
Goodbye.

2590
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:11,680
Goodbye.

2591
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:12,560
Bye.

2592
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:13,040
Bye.

2593
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:59,040
What the hell is wrong with me?
