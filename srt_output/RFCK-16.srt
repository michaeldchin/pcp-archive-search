1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,080
Routy is the one year anniversary of our fucking video game Endless War, a tech space MMORPG that

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:38,720
you can play in a Discord server.

3
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,920
Today, the 9th of April is the first year since it came online. I believe a year ago and a

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
couple days was the first time our server went online. I have no idea when the actual

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
anniversary of that is. I think that's in March actually. I'm going to look at that.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,760
April 9th is the day that the bot went online?

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah, the bot went online, yes.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah, okay, so that's in my book, that's the Endless War's birthday.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,080
Also, coincidentally, it's also my birthday. It just became my birthday half an hour ago.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
Wait, are you serious?

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,120
Yes, April 7th. Yeah, thank you.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,160
I didn't want to tell you, I deliberately hid that information until the show started.

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,160
That's so crazy. Oh man, I'm going to have to give you something.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,480
My birthday is two days before that of Endless War, as it happens.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
Well, it just still happens.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,360
Yeah.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,760
You're also very close to the first episode or the anniversary of Veryfuckers Cop Killers itself,

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,280
because it's on the 11th of April, so April's just a big month. April's a huge fucking month.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,840
It's like, yeah, two days, two days, two days. Also, I just want to say, so I'm here playing

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,880
Enter the Gungeon, because I want to hunt that rowdy rat sweetmouth. I hear he's lurking down here,

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,040
and I haven't killed him yet, and I'm out for vengeance. He's been the prodigal son for too

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,760
long, and it's time to bring him to justice. I know he's down here somewhere, and I haven't

23
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,120
managed to kill him yet, and also I just fucked up, because I shot the water barrel in the fire

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,120
place room for it, so yeah, so I'm already behind. I've already screwed up, but you know, whatever.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Okay, okay, viewer. Okay, we're going to premiere this, right?

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
Yeah, I think so.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay, so you're watching this premiere. This is a big event. This is the whole day of

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,480
the event that we planned for you, right today. After this video is over, that's not the end of

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,320
things. This isn't just like a, oh, cool, like a Veryfuckers Cop Killers episode. I love those.

30
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,840
You know, I can't wait to click, oh, you know, watch right now. No, click the link.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,600
That was that would be taken to an all day stream that we're going to be doing in person.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,760
You may think a premiere is live stream. No, it's not. I don't know how many out. I don't know why

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,880
that everyone who watches the premiere doesn't know what the fuck it is. Even still, to be honest,

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,360
if you've never done a premiere, if you've never like launched a premiere, I totally get why you

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,120
would have no idea what it is. It says premiere. It says premiere on it. That doesn't explain what

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,360
a premiere that doesn't explain what a premiere is, though. Well, okay, whatever. We're not live.

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,000
We can't see you since Super Chat's still though. Anyway, after this, there'll be a real actual

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,040
stream on our Twitch. Well, Pokemon, XT, Gale of Darkness, not to mention. It'll be a bit of a

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,920
variety stream. Yeah, yeah. Unless XT just takes us all day. It's going to go from noon to midnight,

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
Eastern Standard Time. And during that time as well, if you click on our Discord server, the

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,080
thing that this whole thing is dedicated to, then you'll be able to play the one of the earliest

42
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,280
versions of Endless War. You'll be able to see what it was like back in the old days. Endless War

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,320
Classic will be live, what, today only, right? Today only. Today only. So get in there while the

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,560
fucking game's good. Click that fucking Discord link down in the description if you haven't already.

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Listen, okay. I know there are some people who watch our FCK and know how to play Endless War.

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,160
Not a lot, because frankly, I literally don't understand how that's possible. But if you've

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,680
ever thought, like, maybe it may be something to the effect of like, like, it's almost like

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
like a one piece or a homesick where it's like, it's still, you know, there's so much there,

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,480
it'll take too long to catch up in a way. There's so much well-established, like, societal and cultural,

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,400
you know, stuff that I'll have to, you know, read or just, you know, listen to or something

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,240
intimidated by the vast, deep society that we built for ourselves right now is the time.

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,200
Jump in right now, be part of the community, and stop fucking way on the sidelines.

53
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah. Also, I don't even feel like, you know, I think we used to say, I think maybe we used to

54
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,600
say that there was like, just so much. Well, no, I think we, no, we fought this notion. We fought

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,360
this notion that there's like so much lore that you like can't, you know, it's impossible to catch

56
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,640
up. You don't need to catch up. You don't need to know everything that's happened. It's not important.

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,720
It's all, you know, it's whatever. That's all in the past, and we're looking forward. We're

58
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,120
looking to the future. We are. So just join, you can read orientation, you get caught up in literally

59
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,520
five minutes, and you'll know everything that you need to know. Yeah. Play the fucking game. It's

60
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
literally not hard. This is even like a less complicated version of the game than is like,

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,760
you know, this is literally just, you press mine and you press kill and you're done.

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,120
Temporarily, we're temporarily rolling back that feature creep.

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Temporarily. Very, very temporarily. Among the people who haven't played the game are also people

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,000
who can't mad when you play the game. And while I don't respect you whatsoever, just so happens

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that my interest aligns with yours for a second, because there's just so much to talk about, because

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
through the last thing in February, in February, that was like a billion years ago.

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,440
Was that so like two months ago? Maybe just so much. Yeah. So much to talk about. So,

68
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,720
so we can catch me as much as I would like to. But first, but first, let me crack into,

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,040
let me crack into my new, my energy drink of choice. Please, please, God, please, God, summit,

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,440
summit gridlock. Oh, Mike. Okay, I'm, I'm fucking rigorously Googling. So just right now. Okay,

71
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,960
summit gridlock. Okay. Oh, somebody's like, yeah, this looks like Metal Gear Solid 3 is what this

72
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,440
looks like. It looks like it's like it looks like a health potion. It looks like Metal Gear Solid

73
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,880
3. This is the most like parkour dude 91 thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Yeah, it is.

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,800
It's so parkour. Okay, think of gridlock. It's pretty similar. It's pretty similar to Monster Ultra.

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,560
But the thing about it is it's a dollar can for like a full size can. It's, it's, it's only,

76
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,240
it's like only available at Aldi though. So, so get your butts, get your butts to Aldi, I guess.

77
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm so glad that we are just like, like rapidly becoming the energy drink duo. I feel like this

78
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,400
is the dynamic that we need to empathize, or emphasize in all of our content together. Because

79
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:11,680
I, listen, you've heard of bang, but have you heard of rain? I have. From you. But only briefly,

80
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,120
only briefly, and that was a shit flavor. But I am drinking right now rain energy drink,

81
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Melomania. That's, that's um, that's R E I G N. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's R E I G N. Yeah,

82
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,280
yeah, yeah. And I'm about to send you a picture if you can please show it on, on the episode.

83
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,640
I'll just tab over or whatever. All of my, my potions, my various potions that I have today

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,800
in front of me. I'm going to be drinking all of these this recording session. I've already cracked

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,800
into the Melomania. I'm not, I'm not editing, I'm not editing an image into the video. Okay, well,

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,880
okay. Are you recording your, I was just imagining that you would tab over to his court and then

87
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,640
open it. But if you're only recording your game, then whatever, I was supposed to be in the,

88
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,560
okay, yeah, I can do that. But I'm, I'm, I'm killing the, I'm killing the king of,

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
I'm killing the king of time right now or something. So, well, whatever he's, he, listen,

90
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,760
does he drink bane? Is, is his mental retardation cured? I don't think so. I don't think he matters.

91
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,800
Okay. Show, show me this, show me this, show me this crap.

92
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Right. I deemed it to you. I'm going to be going to taste test. I'm going to be evaluating

93
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
energy drink and I'll be telling you how they're rigged.

94
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Okay. So, okay. There is a new monster ultra flavor. It is green. It is slime green.

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,560
What? And it is, and it is called ultra paradise.

96
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,000
No. And it is apparently green apple watermelon flavor, which sounds

97
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,640
too good. It sounds too good to be true to me. This is so, you know, you know, Ben, this, this,

98
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,640
this reminds me of a, of a, of a local brand of energy drink from new Los Angeles city,

99
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,520
Akinia, Milwaukee, a fuck energy. I used to drink fuck energy as a kid.

100
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Yeah. Until you need to stop. But you didn't.

101
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah. This, you know, it's like stinky tofu. Like when you eat it, it reminds you of home.

102
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,240
It smells terrible and it tastes terrible, but you know, it just, it just brings it back.

103
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,640
It just brings you back. This reminds me of fucking energy a lot. Anyway, I have right right

104
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,200
here. And as I described to you, Ben, over deems, what a rain con candy was, it was just a watered

105
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,880
down con candy bank. It was just sort of like a, someone saw like tasting bank. I was like,

106
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,440
yeah, I guess we can do that. I guess we can make our own energy drink, but they didn't put

107
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
their hearts in the water. However, melon mania, which I'm drinking right now

108
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,880
is fucking de-lish. Have you ever had a hubba-bubba watermelon flavor?

109
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Yes, sir. Yes. It tastes just like that, but it makes you energized and it makes you feel like

110
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,320
you could crush a car between your fucking big toe and your pinky toe. It's absolutely delish.

111
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,640
And rain, I'm giving you a fucking hard, hard eight to light nine. You are doing great,

112
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,720
my friend. You are doing fucking great. Sadly, your con candy flavor sucks. However,

113
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,280
I also have right in front of me the original that rain you cannot stand up to. And that's

114
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
con candy bank. So let me taste some of this right now.

115
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:30,640
Mmm. Rain. Ah, you may taste good, but you're no bang. Bang, bang. That was me shooting rain,

116
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,960
because bang is a fucking literal ten out of ten. This con candy bank is the most delicious

117
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,760
fucking drink I've ever had in my entire fucking life. Nothing can beat it. I have to,

118
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,000
I gotta get me some. I gotta get me some. You've been drooling over the con candy bank

119
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,640
ever since I told you about it. Well, I'm a little skeptical. You know, I'm a little-

120
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh, you're skeptical? I wouldn't say skeptical. I would say curious. I'm curious. Like, what

121
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,040
is a cotton candy energy drink? What does that even like? What does it even mean in today's world?

122
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,560
You know, it sounds weird, but the actual taste itself, I don't think is necessarily radical.

123
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:15,200
The thing about bang is it's, you don't really realize it, but drink, energy drink flavors

124
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,920
are sort of subdued in a way, where it's like, uh, yeah, they do have flavors, and flavors

125
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,200
are usually distinct. Technically, they taste like something. Technically. Yeah. But bang is

126
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,760
like an assault on you. Bang is like the most like, like, it's not that the flavor is better,

127
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,640
it's just that there is more of it. It just is like, they put way too much syrup into it,

128
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
and you cannot- That sounds perfect. It sounds like all your sentence.

129
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,240
It sounds like exactly what I want in a beverage. I know, it's- Ben, I'm gonna fucking smuggle you.

130
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,000
I swear to God, I'm gonna smuggle you a melon mania, uh, rain, and I'll smuggle you in a con

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,720
candy bang. I have, uh, I have, I have yet to actually, like, check any stores near me. There

132
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
could be, there could be bang around here. I just don't know. I'm sleeping on it. I'm sleeping on

133
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,000
that bang. Hey, hold on. Speaking of Boston, next time I'm in Boston. Yeah. Uh, this will be my

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,880
first public, uh, announcement of this. Uh, you know Ben, but, uh, the, the, the, the saga that has

135
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,320
plagued me and my appearances on the procrastinators podcast for a while now is over. I got into

136
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,160
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I, I, I'm all- Massachusetts awaits.

137
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,240
Matt, yeah, I, so I've been, I'm gonna be able to, like, RCK will turn into, like, possibly

138
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:50,640
an exclusively in-person ordeal. Scary. Scary though. How fucking weird will that be?

139
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,680
Imagine having another person in your room ever. Ugh. No, thanks.

140
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:04,160
Uh, I, I suppose I'm gonna, did he used to record, like, like, like we'll, oh wait,

141
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,360
oh, he's gonna be gone though, I think. Is that official? Is that official? I think it's official?

142
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't know. We were talking about this last episode. I don't know. You never know, you never

143
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
know, you never know what that guy, you never know what'll stick. Well, it's, it's not even just,

144
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,520
it's, it's, it's everyone. You never know with anyone, you know, you never know who's going

145
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,400
where, you never know what's going on. But what we do know is that me and Ben, we're gonna be

146
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:32,560
together and we're gonna be able to, we're gonna be roommates. Oh, oh, oh, opening a monkey house,

147
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,720
or sorry, wheelhouse, don't mind if I do. We're gonna be bridesmaids. Hmm, always a bridesmaid,

148
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,640
never a kingpin, as they say. Yeah, I see. Always a consort, never a kingpin. Sad.

149
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,880
I want Tom to fucking move into a monkey house so bad. You keep, you keep begging him to you,

150
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,720
keep saying like, hey, there's a spot open, and he was responsible for that stupid fucking thinking

151
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,120
emoji. He never actually thinks with his real brain. He just lets the emoji do the thinking for

152
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,320
him. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean, I mean, he's not gonna leave, he's not gonna leave Digi's

153
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,400
place because he's got a, he's got a sweetheart deal there. So, I mean, sure, you know, what happens

154
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,840
with Digi's place doesn't exist. Yeah, I don't, so until, I think until Digi's place doesn't exist,

155
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,280
or is confirmed to soon not exist, he probably isn't even gonna think about it. And at that point,

156
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,320
will come the time when he must choose like, okay, do I live in a real house or do I just,

157
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,920
or do I live in my car? He's not gonna commit to anything until, until such time as that.

158
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Also, you can't see this, but I'm using, I found, I've never used this weapon before,

159
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,280
it's called mutation. And it's just a big fucking glob in my arm. And it just shoots out big, like

160
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,120
Akira fucking flesh goo that like splatters blood all over all the walls. Perfect thing to hunt

161
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,320
the rowdy rat with, I should think. Speaking of mutations, we're gonna be reading the mutations

162
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,960
contest on stream. So, look at that. Oh, right. Well, click it at noon. Click it at noon. Sorry.

163
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,480
Click it after this episode is over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It immediately, immediately. There will be

164
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,000
no delay. We will plan it out. We will plan it out. We will plan it out. We think you were doing

165
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,760
anything other than listen to RFCK today. You're, you're, you're, you're so embarrassed for you.

166
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,360
Ben, we gotta do this show monthly. We gotta do it monthly. We gotta have an episode out monthly.

167
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,440
We gotta have a stream out biweekly. We gotta get some sort of fucking schedule here,

168
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,280
because we're, we're hemorrhaging slubs, dude. We're fucking no one, no one remembers RFCK.

169
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,280
By the time we released the episode, everyone was just like, huh? Last, last one was when I,

170
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,000
you know, was two years ago. I don't even know who you guys are anymore.

171
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
I mean, sometimes I forget.

172
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,560
Ah, that's a nice, yeah. I wish I could forget. Ben, I'm sure you had this.

173
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,080
I'm sure you had this, but I've reached the point in my endless war developer career,

174
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,600
where every single time I go to sleep, I just am like, oh, slime court. Oh, oh, oh,

175
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,960
what weapon rebalance? I just toss and turn. That was, that was, that was me in my brain.

176
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,720
That was me in the first couple months. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the first six months or so.

177
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,360
Like, like last night, I just got into bed and like for seriously, like two hours,

178
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,560
like not a joke, like I watched the time fly. I would try to close my eyes, try not to think

179
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,080
about updates to the game, fail miserably and start writing down notes in my phone. I would open it

180
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,560
up and I would just like the light on my phone would blast my eyes fully awake again and the

181
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,160
process would repeat over and over again. Here's the thing. Here's, here's the thing about being

182
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,440
mean or probably any sort of art idiot like me. There's too much to do in life, right? You know

183
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,240
what I'm talking about. There's too much to do. I feel, you know, I feel bad that I haven't been,

184
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,520
I haven't, I haven't been as active in the endless war. I've probably been saying this for a long

185
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,600
time because this has been true for a little while, but I'm like, I'm, I check into the dev

186
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,840
discord once in a while. I'm not like actively developing anything right now because I've,

187
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,960
I've sort of taken a step back and I've really buckled down on like my

188
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,640
comics, basically. That's, that's, that's where I'm at. And whoops, should I not save this on the

189
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:26,640
rfck? Am I being a downer? No, no, no, no, Ben. Okay, listen. All right. Like, what's the most

190
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,520
important thing about rck? Is it making do fucking kill was happy? No, it's being real. It's about

191
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,560
being wrong. It's about saying the actual shit, right? Not the fake shit, not the phony shit.

192
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,640
Yeah. Um, true. And I mean, I'm still like around, like I'm still on discord and everything. Sure.

193
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,160
Sure. Yeah. Um, you know, you know, you know, it's, you know, really, it's the gamers fault.

194
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,880
It's the players fault because we never did hit 100, uh, 100 x's in the secret project.

195
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,640
Uh, we never, we never even hit 50. So, you know, uh, I could blame myself and my own decisions,

196
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,600
but that sounds lame. Uh, so it's your fault. The listener, you're still ahead of type of

197
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,560
recording this. You're still ahead. So we'll see. We'll see how you fare ahead of what, uh,

198
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,400
in, in slime, in slime, in kingpin slime. Oh, Ben, do you remember the mechanics of the game?

199
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,280
Do you remember? That's not what I was talking about. Um, but okay. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I spent

200
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
chin up is what I'm trying to say. Oh, I mean, I've been ahead in slime for, I mean, that's,

201
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm not even worried about that. The killer's got, got the slime on lock. Um, uh, you're, you're,

202
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,080
okay. I will say if there's one thing, okay, in this war, RCK, the server in general,

203
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,560
is sort of a bad mistake. Yeah, unironically in a way. Wait, wait, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's just

204
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:57,680
cause the people in it are so, they're so active. They're so active. You, like you miss a day and

205
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,840
you're fucked forever and they forget about you. Yeah. So I, I can like not tune in for like a week

206
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,640
and everyone's like, Oh, another absentee father. Oh, oh, my munchies just fucking gone. Ben, a

207
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,520
munchie. You don't even check the game. Hey, munchie, do you know what the, do you know what the

208
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,720
street race is? Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Like I'm not in literally every single fucking day.

209
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,840
Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's kind of, yeah. It's, it's a fast pace. You know, it's fast.

210
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,200
It's very fast. I mean, there's just a lot, there's just a lot to do. There's just a lot going on

211
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,760
over there. I will say that your presence has, has been missed by many people to the point where

212
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,560
the killers don't like recognize you as the valid ruler or as a entity that exists. Okay.

213
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,520
Go on. Tell me more. Well, no, like everyone says fuck Ben. Oh, that's what I'm trying to say.

214
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,640
Okay. That's a little more, that's a little more than you're, oh, fuck. The thing about,

215
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
the thing about Gungan is you really got to perfect the bosses. You really got to perfect

216
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,480
the bosses if you want to make it in this life. I'm really fucking this run up, by the way.

217
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,680
But you're on a let's play show. That's expected. Yeah, true. I mean, whatever, what kind of

218
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,040
attention would there be if I, if I, if I got him first try? Yeah, no. Ben can play this game

219
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,200
blindfolded when he's not talking. Well, I don't know. Well, I mean,

220
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,160
okay. Okay. Were we talking about, oh yes, I am a bad person. Yeah. Well, bad father specifically.

221
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,040
Bad father specifically. Um, yeah, I'll come back one of these days.

222
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm still, you know, I went out, you know, I took a trip. I went out to get some jewel pods.

223
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,000
I still haven't come back, but you know, don't give up hope. Don't give up hope. Oh god. 25

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,120
slime coin for a rip of that jewel, please. It's more precious than slime coin. Oh god.

225
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,720
You ever know slime coin is fake, is fake Chuck E. Cheese slime bucks?

226
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,760
No, don't tell them they have to donate. Oh, right. Are we going to keep our sponsorship

227
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,200
deal with fucking energy and subsidiary, uh, uh, slime core slime? Yeah, actually slime

228
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,880
corp has made it has, has incentivized us heavily not to acknowledge the obvious truth of that. So,

229
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm just gonna, don't worry about it. Don't worry about anything that's gone here. Stop

230
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,880
watching this video right now. Oh, what, okay. What's going to happen when we shit talk their

231
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,080
Chuck E. Cheese money? They're going to stop paying us and said Chuck E. Cheese money and then we

232
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,280
won't have any more Chuck E. Cheese money. And then how will we play speedball? Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,200
How will we play the stocks? How will we earn, how will we earn tickets to buy a little plastic

234
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:53,040
rings that look like spiders? Chuck E. Cheese is so like, I, I've never been to an arcade that

235
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,680
was actually good. I feel like they've, there's a thing they are, they exist. Like they must be

236
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,440
people like arcades. I mean, you ever been to like the aesthetic of them are cool. But I've never

237
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,440
been to one that was actually good. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I'm just talking over you.

238
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,480
Right. Sure. I mean, you ever been to like a David Buster's? Now keep in mind, I would never go to

239
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,240
a David Buster's because it's totally human core and it's like $40 for a play of crazy taxi.

240
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,160
Human core? I don't know if I would call it human core. I would call way overpriced to

241
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,000
overrated, which I guess is also human. Things that are overpriced are human. Those are,

242
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,040
there's so much overlap between those two concepts. Yeah, you know what? Okay, that's fair.

243
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,440
I've been to David Buster's. I don't know. It, that's like, that's like, if you want to go to

244
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,800
Chuck E. Cheese, but you don't want to admit yourself, you're going to Chuck E. Cheese. Yeah.

245
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,840
That's what David Buster's is, where it's like the same thing. Yeah. It's still like in all,

246
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,680
in all ways that mean anything. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's just adult Chuck E. Cheese, which is fine.

247
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,680
I mean, I don't even think it sucks too bad. Like I went to one once, played some video games.

248
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,440
That's fine. It's just the cost like a dollar per play of, I don't know, virtual fighter or

249
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,880
whatever. It's a nightmare. God. Or at least it did when I went. I love the idea of stuff like

250
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,600
bowling alleys and arcades and stuff where she's kind of like you hang out. When was the last

251
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,080
time you went bowling? Dude, when I was like six. That's an over exaggeration. Like probably like

252
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,920
12. Probably like 12. Bowling is way fun. Also, I died. Bowling is sick as hell. Bowling is great.

253
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:34,320
I have a fascination with celebration, a.k.a. the most common bowling alley carpet pattern here.

254
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,640
If you, if you start, I think, I think it was like celebration. I can picture it in my mind.

255
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,440
It's purple, right? And it's not like zigzags or maybe blue. No, but you're probably thinking of

256
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,880
one of them. You're probably thinking, I mean, there are multiple. There are multiple. The one

257
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm thinking of is this right here. Hold on. This is my favorite pet. Well, you're at tab back over

258
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,720
Discord. Whatever. Yeah, that's close. That's close to what I was thinking of. Oh, it's so cool.

259
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,400
This is my entire personality right here. Oh, I guess I got to show it on screen.

260
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,000
This is your, this is your background for your Twitch or something? Yeah, it's my

261
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,560
background for a lot of things, I think. It used to be like a pretty heavily,

262
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,560
this was a large piece of branding for me back in the day, like when I was first starting out,

263
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,200
but since how much, how much did you, how much did it cost you to license that?

264
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Zero dollars because I work on the internet and

265
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,640
no one cares about you. Yeah, it's not matter at all. God is fake and hell yeah, dude.

266
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,880
You know, I often think how pretty often a lot of the stuff that people do online is like

267
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,960
clearly not fair use and just is. But it doesn't matter. Yeah, but it just doesn't matter at all.

268
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,000
Nobody's going to actually do anything about it. Yeah, so why should it matter?

269
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Yes, I got the cat bullet king throne. A cat throne to hunt the rowdy rat.

270
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,080
Sourpus turns against his master. I think maybe I stole this from Sourpus. Maybe Sourpus

271
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:28,560
was sitting on this throne. I'm just floating around. Whoa. Oh, it's so cool. I've never had

272
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:35,360
this item before. God, I wish you could see it. You'd be so impressed. I doubt it. I doubt it.

273
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,480
You know, I just realized I could probably actually adjust the screen, the screen size and get rid

274
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:52,240
of these borders. Whatever. She would be breaking the fourth wall though. Because we can't do that.

275
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,000
Obviously K is the opposite of a meta of a meta show in every way that possibly could be. That's

276
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,400
correct. By the way, going back to one thing that I skipped over just to talk about how I'll be in

277
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:13,120
Boston forever now. Get into college. I want to like someone who was received in Oscar or a Tony.

278
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:21,360
I just want to thank everyone who said good job, Munchy, or said go for it. I also want to thank

279
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,120
Nate because he wrote a letter of recommendation. And I like to imagine some small part. Nate was

280
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,040
responsible for at least 1% of me getting in. So good job, Nate. I know you're listening.

281
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,760
Well, that was pretty nice of him. It was pretty nice. It was a nice, nice, nice thing to do there.

282
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:45,280
Hey, actually, did you get to read it? Yeah. Because you were in my essay. I had to write my

283
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:56,880
entrance essay. Oh, geez. Did I ever show you it? Did I ever? No, I don't think so. It was about the

284
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,120
Spicy Bro Pact. You've told me about this, but I haven't read it. Hold on. I don't think you like,

285
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:11,200
yeah. Hold on. I thought it was like a secret. Hold on. I'm going to read this on the show for

286
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,120
RCK, for prosperity. I'll also link it in the description. Okay. Hold on. That's not weird or

287
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:26,320
anything. Is it weird? No, it's fine. No, it's fine. I'm joking. It's real small to see. It's really

288
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,720
it's really funny. Let's see here. Six disheveled men sit in front of a large plate of blistering

289
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,200
in the hot buffalo wings ready to record a video of their feast for an audience of strangers.

290
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,760
So they will be involved in a Spicy Bro Pact, elevating their meager friendship with the highest

291
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,160
form of union one can have with their bros. Forge will eat the hot chicken wings available and

292
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,640
preferably crying in the process. Become rotary experienced while sweating through the agony

293
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,800
together lasts a lifetime. Is it for a matrimony unparalleled and sensitive mentality to me? And

294
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,520
I had been nervously anticipating it as much as one would their traditional marriage. Organizing

295
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,560
their cunning supper had been a pipe dream for so long that I can now even hardly believe I fucked

296
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,960
up whatever it was. This gaggle of men in their late to mid twenties had been my mentors for several

297
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:24,400
years now and I they're young ward. Yes, excellent. Yeah, make young ward a thing. It's already a

298
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,800
thing and I'm glad about it. Oh, it totally is already a thing. Whenever I have an opportunity

299
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,840
to describe myself in relation to the PC guy, always use young ward to specifically offline

300
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,200
That's a yeah. Whenever I describe you, I always say yeah, he's obviously a young ward.

301
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
Like who's this monkey guy? He's my young ward, don't worry about it.

302
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,160
It's like weirdly descriptive in a way where you can like it kind of clicks more than it would.

303
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,520
Yeah, I don't know. It's a great term. You came up with it, right?

304
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,320
Well, I mean, it's from Batman, but I mean, I'm the one that started using it.

305
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,840
Sure. Sure. That's what I mean. Yeah. A mixture of online artists, musicians and writers,

306
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,560
all of them especially in niche content. But by the way, the prompt of this was a describe an

307
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,800
experience that has shaped your life. So the PCP is shaped in my life. You see the collective work

308
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,320
body of work includes everything from comics of autobiographical, autobiographical, homoerotic

309
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,880
mishaps in Germany to sprawling medi narratives, dwelling in the philosophical quandaries,

310
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,440
interwoven across poorly edited reviews. Wait, who had homoerotic autobiographical?

311
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:47,200
You. You. In what line? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. It was homoerotic on someone else's part.

312
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,640
Well, that doesn't make it any less homoerotic. You know what? You're right. You're absolutely

313
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,000
right. And I fucked up. Plus it was funny to say homoerotic. Yeah, it's just what could be more

314
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,360
funny. Yeah. Okay. If you're if you're a woman and you're gay, it's not very funny. But if you're

315
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,240
a man, you're gay, it's super funny. It's super funny. It's I mean, it's a little fun. You know,

316
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,400
let's be honest. It's kind of strong. It's kind of fun. Yeah, it's kind of fun. After finding each

317
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
other's work over the internet, the band together to create it into a creative force with a totally

318
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:27,200
unique artistic voice and counterculture aesthetic. Yeah, it's pretty accurate. Though the game of

319
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,960
being a freelance artist on the internet is to appeal to the wider, this possible demographic

320
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,120
to his crew as many donations and patrons as possible. Their work was less concerned with

321
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,480
being digestible as it was expressing themselves with uncompromising zeal to any other person.

322
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,920
This motley, cruel social outcast might have been the subject of ire, but not for me. They were

323
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:52,800
everything I aspired to be. Oh, jeez. Oh, fucking shucks. You fucking asshole.

324
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,720
Growing up, I was bullied often and ostracized by almost everyone in my school. I feel like there

325
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,320
was no one that could understand me or the offbeat comments I doled in my sketchbooks. That is,

326
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,880
until I found them. Never before I had resonated with art in such an intimate way. There aren't

327
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,760
speaking directly to the part myself which I had to hide on a daily basis. I found kindred spirits,

328
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,560
and so I began to weasel my way into their inner circle, beginning with sending intentionally

329
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,480
terrible pickup lines to various members of the group every single day for months and progressing

330
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,400
to assorted mischievous acts of ironic self-humiliation. You never sent me a single pickup line, you

331
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:34,000
fucking asshole. Uh, you're right. Greatest regret. Greatest regret. I began to be viewed as some sort

332
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,280
of cartoon character in the creative consciousness. That's correct. It was all working exactly to plan.

333
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:48,240
Their door to their hearts was shitty performance art. That's too too too accurate. But it wasn't

334
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,080
but it wasn't all post-modern hijinks. For the first three years after discovering the group

335
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,680
were perhaps the most productive my artistic career thus far. I pressured myself to lip to the

336
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,400
work ethic of the group exemplified, which meant spinning every moment I wasn't getting beat up at

337
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,760
school, working on my creative pursuits. No, I fucked up. Did you die? I didn't die. I just I

338
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,360
fucked up and I forgot to save keys for the oubliet. Um, that's fine, whatever. That that been like

339
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,880
that sentence had no effect on me whatsoever. Boy, if you could see this gameplay, you would be so

340
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,160
you would be so fucking stoked for me right now. That's all I'm saying. Okay, continue. Oh, no. Oh,

341
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,800
no, I didn't get the bloopy blop so I could kill the get the gock. That's right. Yeah, pretty much.

342
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,760
How do you know? Are you a pro? Are you an MLG?

343
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,320
Let's just say that I've saved a few frames in my day. You know, back in the day, heroes would

344
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,400
save dames. Today, heroes save frames. Literally gonna make a t-shirt. We should make an rfck

345
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,560
spreadsheet and put that on a t-shirt, not a joke. Yes, that's brilliant. That is a 10 out of 10.

346
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,840
That is, I want that on my person. Click the link in the description. Yes.

347
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,200
Or you're a fucking loser. Okay.

348
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,040
There was a slow burn, but in early 2016, I was officially declared a member of the group.

349
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,360
In the three years I've seen with my mentors, now lifelong friends, I've grown as a person

350
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,000
as an artist. They fostered my strange sense of humor and artistic expression and in turn,

351
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,600
I blossomed into complete freak. Instead of doubting myself, I press on to even more uncomfortable

352
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,280
and bizarre summits, all because of the men who shower on an as needed basis. And so, I demanded

353
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,440
we seal the deal. Theoretically, we could have just eaten wings together in a Skype call, but you

354
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,600
can't see your friends cry over the internet. So, soon we were recording our feast. It's self

355
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,400
another art piece I would edit and release online. Immediately, my cold feet were worn by the inferno

356
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,160
of spice enveloping my entire body. My friends began to wail in pain, cursing my name with every bite.

357
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
That's right. I remember that. I remember doing that.

358
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,720
It was great. Though I explained its purpose in depth, I doubt they appreciated the

359
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,960
sentimentality of the dinner as much as I did. Tears ran down from my face from a mixture of

360
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,360
passion and the, I don't know how to pronounce it, it's canine. It's not the word canine, it's a spice.

361
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,880
I have no idea. There's a spice called canine?

362
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,360
Yeah, see, oh, I'm not going to spell it, fuck you.

363
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,360
Spell it, spell it, spell it, spell it, spell it.

364
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,600
C-A-Y-E-N-N-E. Oh, canine.

365
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,360
Canine, sorry, canine. I finally knew what it was like to be loved, to belong. I felt the

366
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,520
compassion of my fellow man and it was excruciating. And that's what got me into college, was us doing

367
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,560
the spice of Ropak. That was the end? It was excruciating was the last time?

368
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,640
Yeah, it was excruciating.

369
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,960
Well, I wouldn't have accepted you, but you know, different strokes, I guess.

370
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,880
You know, one man's trash.

371
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,200
I really do. I'm really happy, you know, I'm really happy I got into this group, genuinely.

372
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,200
No, no, I'm, there were some people last episode that felt like I-

373
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,520
Last PCK episode or RFCK episode?

374
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,160
No, no, RFCK episode in the comments, who I think thought that I was being sort of, I don't know,

375
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,240
mean in a way to some of the other members of the group, because I was a little bit,

376
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,240
I don't know, maybe noided that Boston wasn't going to be the place, wasn't going to be the location.

377
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:35,040
But I am, I could not express how happy I am to be friends with everyone in the group.

378
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,280
So don't think that, please.

379
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Yeah, well, I don't. So that's fine.

380
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,720
That's fine.

381
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,800
Viewers, get your fucking heads on straight.

382
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
And fucking please buy, fuck energy.

383
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
And please buy RFCK.

384
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,120
Use the link in the description.

385
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Yeah, if you would be so kind.

386
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,800
I think I'm going to fuck this up.

387
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,600
I don't think I'm going to have enough money.

388
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,240
I thought it's up and didn't get to the ooble yet, and I'm not going to have enough bullets to get to the ratty rats den.

389
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
Well, can I click on an audible link so I can transfer you some more money?

390
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,760
What?

391
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,960
You say you're not going to have enough money?

392
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,440
Well, give me an Amazon link and I'll fucking give you some.

393
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,040
Well, okay. Well, I'll click down in the description, obviously.

394
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,800
That's what any good good fan would do.

395
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:35,520
Now is probably a good time to complain about Oolulia and how he's too fucking dumb to let me make money for him by recording a stupid audio book.

396
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,160
Oh, yeah. Okay. I know about this, but there's a lot of people who don't.

397
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,400
A lot of people who are just thinking like, oh, what, Ben, you couldn't get, you couldn't get Oolulia.

398
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,320
Why am I so lazy? Why didn't I make that thing? I said I was going to make.

399
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,720
Who's the dude who made Tales Control?

400
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,240
Laserbot.

401
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,680
Oh, you let him slip through your fingers just like Laserbot.

402
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,400
You just couldn't get Laserbot on. You just couldn't do it.

403
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah.

404
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
Please explain.

405
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:09,840
Well, okay. So I was going to, you know, I wanted to make the, I wanted to make the audio book for

406
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,000
a legend of the elemental masters.

407
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,160
So I just, you know, a couple of times I contacted Oolulia on Facebook and I was just like, hey, let me do it.

408
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,960
Finally, he got back to me and I actually managed to talk him into doing it.

409
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
And he actually was like, you know, it's.

410
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, shit.

411
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,120
Well, you didn't know that?

412
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,400
I, I, no, I, well.

413
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,600
What the fuck? What did you think I was going to say?

414
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,240
No, no, no, no.

415
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Well, okay. I guess I wasn't caught up.

416
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,120
I thought that you had tried for all the time and he just was refusing.

417
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,480
Oh, you're way behind.

418
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,080
No, he never refused.

419
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,880
Well, it was mostly like the first couple of times he was procrastinating actually doing it.

420
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,920
You're, I can't tell if you're like a behinder ahead on this.

421
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,000
There's continue.

422
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,320
Okay. So I, I, he finally, he responded on Facebook and I was like, hey, I want to make,

423
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
I will record an audio book for you.

424
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
I want to put it on YouTube.

425
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,080
And he was like, well, I'm only comfortable with like the first two acts going on YouTube.

426
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,640
And I'm like, okay, well, what about the rest?

427
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,000
And we talked about it and we said that I could make the audio book version

428
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,040
and I looked into it and I figured out how you do that and how you release it through Audible.

429
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
And I was like, okay, well, let's do that.

430
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,280
So I made an, an Audible account, you know, of the, of the kind you got to do to go through

431
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
the, the correct channels.

432
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
I did all that.

433
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
I got him to start making an account.

434
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,800
And then at some point he's like, uh, I think it's, I think he probably had to enter his tax

435
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,840
information or something.

436
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,320
And he was like, okay, I've been working on this for a while.

437
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
I will, you know, I'll do the rest tomorrow.

438
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,240
You know, months later, months later, every now and then I'll message him and be like,

439
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
Hey man, you ever get that thing made?

440
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
And he's just like, I'm playing a lot of Skyrim.

441
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,280
No, yeah, that's the point of the story that I'm at is that I knew that he, he,

442
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,120
he agreed to, and that you were under the, the impression that you would be able to.

443
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,520
Yeah.

444
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,120
It's, and he is totally fine with me.

445
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,400
He just is too fucking, I'm so mad.

446
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm just, it's not that he's too late.

447
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,120
It's that he's too stupid.

448
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
It's that he's too stupid.

449
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,160
I'm not kidding.

450
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,880
Seriously, I have, this makes me so fucking mad.

451
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,800
Literally, I literally, I just want to make money for him.

452
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
Also, also me, but also him.

453
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,400
You're so connected, but to the wrong people.

454
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,040
Yeah.

455
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeah.

456
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,920
It's like, you have, like, you know, people, you, you have contacted and spoken to people

457
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,000
who many others would consider like a big, like,

458
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,360
you've talked to Crixie.

459
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,520
What the fuck is that?

460
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,400
The fuck is that?

461
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,240
Sad.

462
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,120
Okay, cool.

463
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,920
Sick mom, I'm, I'm recording for the internet.

464
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
Do you want to say something over the internet?

465
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,760
Hi.

466
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,080
Hey.

467
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,200
Okay.

468
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,680
All right.

469
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,240
Thanks.

470
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,800
Thanks mom.

471
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,320
Good to have you on as always.

472
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Pleasure.

473
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
That was great.

474
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,240
Okay.

475
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,280
Anyway, like you've talked to Christian, like that's so crazy.

476
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,840
Like what?

477
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,480
Talking to Christian is a nightmare.

478
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,840
That's so fucking dumb.

479
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,520
And also stuff like this where it's like,

480
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,040
I can't believe you talked to that law cow.

481
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,760
I can't believe you talked to this person, but like it doesn't matter.

482
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,160
They don't, they don't do anything.

483
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,200
They're, they're pointless.

484
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,880
They're, they're fucking useless for a reason.

485
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,840
Like they, there's a reason that their reputation is what it is.

486
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,200
You know, people like Lilia, but like this has made me like not like him.

487
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,560
Like I don't think I even like him.

488
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,640
Yeah, I'm really fucking pissed at him.

489
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,280
I don't know.

490
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,760
Maybe one day if the book, if he lets me make his fucking book for him,

491
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,520
maybe I'll like him again.

492
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,160
But not, not like this.

493
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,520
This is bullshit.

494
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,640
This is some bullshit.

495
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,640
Literally all he has to do is just like finish making his account.

496
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,440
And then it would just be a matter of him like approving the things that I make

497
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,840
and just being like, okay, go through done.

498
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,800
Literally that would be it.

499
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
All he has to do is fucking enter his tax information

500
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,920
and then he'll get free money from me, from my labor.

501
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,720
Man, maybe he doesn't like, he doesn't, he doesn't trust you or something.

502
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,920
I can't imagine why.

503
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,400
I mean, there's no-

504
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
Do you think it's a little bit too lazy?

505
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,640
He's just, he just literally-

506
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

507
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,520
100%.

508
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,320
There's nothing else.

509
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,720
What an asshole.

510
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,040
Yeah.

511
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,720
Boy, that pisses me off.

512
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,840
It would have been, imagine Ben saying-

513
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,400
I spent like-

514
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,720
Like, like audio book narrator.

515
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,520
Yeah, right?

516
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,640
I spent like two days recording and editing a demo version of like the first act or two acts.

517
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,160
It's about 15 minutes worth of like book audio for him to just listen to and approve

518
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,400
before I start like making the audiobook proper.

519
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,040
All he would have to do is approve it.

520
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,840
That's it.

521
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,800
And he just, he just-

522
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,360
No, he's kind of busy playing Skyrim.

523
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,560
It's not even, it's not even a new game, it's Skyrim.

524
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,080
It's actually, it's not Skyrim anymore.

525
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,240
He switched to some other stupid thing.

526
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,720
I don't know what it is.

527
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,400
Okay, but just as retarded.

528
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,720
Yeah.

529
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,120
Why are we cursed?

530
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,320
Why are you cursed to only have internet clout to interact with retarded, crazy people?

531
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,400
Maybe I should try interacting with some better people.

532
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,000
You've got, you're a big YouTuber.

533
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
You're a big poke YouTuber.

534
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,800
Surely you could throw your clout around.

535
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,880
You, you, you can't get Lilia to let you do his audiobook.

536
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,000
You can't get your vape.

537
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,160
You can't get Ben St. Vapor sold physically.

538
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,760
What, Ben, you gotta make a change.

539
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,960
I can't, I can't do a damn thing.

540
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
You can't do a damn thing.

541
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,400
I gotta, you gotta use it or something or else what am I, or else what's the point of

542
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,280
even having it?

543
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,240
It's gonna decay.

544
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,560
It's gonna have life, half life of two weeks max.

545
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
And where's the poo video?

546
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,280
Jesus Christ, Ben.

547
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,720
Jesus Christ.

548
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,400
Speaking of, low art has still, you know, months later, low art still hasn't gotten around to

549
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,760
releasing that fucking Poo's Grand Adventure podcast we did.

550
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,400
Don't know, don't know what his excuse is.

551
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,840
I don't even know who low art is.

552
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,440
He's a fucking guy, whatever.

553
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,080
It doesn't matter.

554
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,160
I'm gonna search low art right now.

555
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,320
He, uh, he, he did a bunch of videos about, uh, like retrospectives on Teen Titans that

556
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,120
got pretty big.

557
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,960
I think he's at like 40k.

558
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,120
Cool.

559
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,640
Yeah, okay.

560
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,240
Yeah, he's at 48k.

561
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,040
Yeah, and we recorded a podcast together and he just has been months and he just hasn't

562
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,600
released it.

563
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,480
It was the same, it was the same for Internet Dream Lounge.

564
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,080
That was, that's, you know, Mary, Maryweather and this.

565
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah, yeah, I know that is.

566
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Yeah, you know, I was on, uh, his, his cohort had me on his podcast, did an interview with me.

567
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,720
You know, months go by and then he's just like, uh, actually I think the show is canceled.

568
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,040
I think it's really, yeah.

569
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,440
Wait, hey, am I allowed to talk about zone?

570
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,680
Why not?

571
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,280
That thing that you were, we're not gonna do a, we're not gonna write a thing?

572
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,760
Yeah, I did.

573
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,640
Yeah, I did.

574
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,120
You did.

575
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:07,920
Did it happen?

576
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,160
No.

577
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,120
Okay.

578
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:09,920
Yeah.

579
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,200
Why are you cursed?

580
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,600
I don't know.

581
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,640
I don't know.

582
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,240
That's so, that's so weird.

583
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,280
It's, it's every endeavor that you do.

584
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,520
Yeah.

585
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,800
Like every, like, you're God.

586
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,920
I don't even like to think about it, but yeah, you're right.

587
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
There's like all this shit that I do.

588
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,800
And then I try to like branch out with, you know, it's just, I don't know.

589
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,120
Other people just fuck it up.

590
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,640
Like when you have to work with other people, they just will fail.

591
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
Like it will always ruin anything.

592
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,000
Especially something like, like, okay, for, for that podcast, right?

593
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,440
Like it's a fucking podcast.

594
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,520
It's a, there's nothing, there's nothing he needs to do.

595
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,680
He thinks he needs to edit it and he's wrong.

596
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,840
Mm-hmm.

597
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,560
Uh, why do people think they need to edit podcasts?

598
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,200
Why are, why are they so fucking retarded?

599
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,040
Like, okay.

600
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,560
I can see the benefit of it if you want to, but it feels like-

601
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,440
But just don't.

602
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,240
Just don't.

603
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,880
It's fine.

604
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,800
It's fucking fine.

605
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,560
Like the release of it in any way, then there's no point.

606
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,840
It just won't happen.

607
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:22,400
If he, like, if he continues to think that, oh, I have to do anything, he just won't do it.

608
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,680
Uh, man, I'm getting mad.

609
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,880
You know what, you know what I'm talking about?

610
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,120
I think, I think you're in a hardcore agree with me, Ben.

611
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,400
The fact people, okay, the best kind of art is like slap-dash art.

612
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,640
Yeah.

613
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,720
Art that just is made.

614
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,720
More and more, I finally just fully recognize the fact that technical skill does not matter.

615
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,000
Means nothing at all.

616
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,880
What so ever.

617
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,280
No.

618
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,400
Means absolutely nothing.

619
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,360
It's a liability.

620
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,880
Comic that I love.

621
00:45:51,600 --> 00:46:01,760
It's a My Little Pony flash comic that is clearly not even fucking attempted to be technically

622
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,320
impressive.

623
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,000
It's just, it's all sketches.

624
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,840
But this dude had an idea and he fucking made it.

625
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,680
And it is, some of my favorite art ever.

626
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,000
Something that shit fucking gave, and look at this shit.

627
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,160
Look at this fucking shit right fucking now.

628
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,520
Hold on, there's a fucking guy shooting at me.

629
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,080
It's so beautiful.

630
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,880
You don't need to fucking come up with all these signed documents.

631
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,000
Like fine one.

632
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,400
You don't have to come up with all these fucking structures in place.

633
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,000
You don't have to come up with anything.

634
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,280
Just, if you have an idea, just fucking do it.

635
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,480
It doesn't matter.

636
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,400
Okay, like you might think yourself, oh, but you know, I want to make,

637
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,200
what I make is good.

638
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,320
I don't want to shit something out.

639
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,360
No, no, shut up, shut the fuck up, you idiot.

640
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,000
Don't say that.

641
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,680
Yeah, that's wrong.

642
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,840
It's so, oh my fucking god.

643
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,720
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

644
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,360
It's better to release a comic or anything,

645
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,360
and instead of shooting yourself in the fucking skull.

646
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,080
Yeah.

647
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,280
She's so fucking mad.

648
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,680
There's, like, this comic is perfect.

649
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,960
You, like, if there's no-

650
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,240
Would it, boy, like, I look at this and I just think, boy,

651
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,520
I wish this guy had spent, like, 10 times as long,

652
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,280
like, carefully rendering all the, like, background details.

653
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,400
Unlike these doors.

654
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,960
Like, what, these, these, they're not colored.

655
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,760
They're not colored.

656
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,600
They're not, like, they're not, like, shaded.

657
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,200
They're not, like, delicately shaded.

658
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,680
Like, they're not, like, you know, he didn't spend, like,

659
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,560
an hour fucking, like, doing, like, three-point perspective

660
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,800
to get the room looking just perfect.

661
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,000
I can't read this swill.

662
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,920
I, okay, okay.

663
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,680
Like, the thing about it, what is the point of this comic?

664
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,400
Okay, it's like a character interaction between spike and rarity.

665
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,680
What's the most important thing?

666
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,920
Oh, the dialogue and the facial expressions

667
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,480
and the, the character thing, being good

668
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,880
and easily communicating what they're feeling.

669
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,880
Does it matter what the fuck is in rarity's carousel boutique,

670
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,840
like, in the background?

671
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,280
Does it matter what her doors look like?

672
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,240
No, it doesn't.

673
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,760
I have gone, I have gone, like, I've gone, like, 10 pages,

674
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,320
I've gone, like, 10 panels and there's just been no background.

675
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,360
What the fuck?

676
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,920
Or why are they just floating in, like, a gray void?

677
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,440
This is a nightmare, right?

678
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,160
So fucking ridiculous.

679
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,960
What a plothole.

680
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,480
Okay, and you want, you want to know how I prove this?

681
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,320
You want to know how we fucking prove that doesn't matter?

682
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,000
Go back to the start bin, go back to the start,

683
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,200
go back to the title screen, go to extra, click on extra.

684
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,520
He made some panels in, like, a try to do a show at yourself.

685
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,200
No doubt, like, way less expressive, way more effort.

686
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,520
Yeah.

687
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,680
Not only did he spend, like, eat, like,

688
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,680
I'm not gonna exaggerate, like, 10 times as much effort.

689
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,880
I wonder if he, like, I wonder if he started doing it like this

690
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,440
and was like, this is a nightmare and is stupid

691
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,240
and it will, it will just, will never be done if I do it.

692
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,960
Like that.

693
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,320
I'm sure this exactly would happen.

694
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,200
I'm sure this is exactly what fucking happened.

695
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,560
This thing is really long.

696
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,640
The comic is literally, but, oh, it's, it's super long.

697
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,680
It's 400 pages.

698
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,240
Oh my god.

699
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,080
Yeah, no.

700
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,400
Never would have been happened if you just wanted to do it that way.

701
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,640
And the comic is literally better, better for it.

702
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,720
It's better because it's in the scratchy style.

703
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,560
It's better because it's this expressive.

704
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,280
It's better because he got it done.

705
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,360
It would have been, you know what?

706
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,920
Sure.

707
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,600
Maybe some people would have liked it better

708
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,000
if it was in the flash style, in the, in the track itself.

709
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,960
But guess what?

710
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,800
No one would have liked it because it never would have come out.

711
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,840
It never would have happened.

712
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Yeah.

713
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,280
That's, that's it.

714
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,560
Brian Leo Malley, I heard him say on, on like

715
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,800
form spring or something, he said like anything,

716
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,880
he didn't originate this quote, but I heard it from him.

717
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,840
It's like anything done is, is automatically better

718
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,120
than anything that's not done.

719
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Like no matter how good it would have been,

720
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,960
no matter how like, you know, no matter how perfect the parts

721
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,960
of it that are done are, like if it's not done

722
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,160
and it's not out, it's nothing.

723
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,040
It's, and it's, and it's, it's worse than anything.

724
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,280
It's, it's worse than even the worst piece of trash

725
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,800
that's, that's done.

726
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,880
Wrapping it around to us, the endless war

727
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,520
was not like meticulously planned.

728
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,480
It was not like, oh, we have a grand vision for this video game.

729
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,280
You know, you know, let's start, let's start building the pieces.

730
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,480
No, it just was like, it was cranked out.

731
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,720
It's blossomed into this beautiful fucking

732
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,840
unreal, unparalleled discord server video game combination.

733
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,560
That you can play in your discord server for for free right now.

734
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,920
Click the link in the description.

735
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,560
This never would have happened if like, like, like you,

736
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,040
you, you'd return and clack and like, like crack, like, you know,

737
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
let's like spin like a few months, like cash out this game

738
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,480
and then we'll have a big reveal, you know.

739
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,080
Let's get it like perfect before release.

740
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,520
Let's make sure it's absolutely perfect

741
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
before we, we put it out there.

742
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,600
Like, you know, let's polish every single second.

743
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,280
No, no thing you, you can improvise.

744
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,280
No, I mean, I, I mean, I knew if I knew,

745
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,280
I knew if I did anything like that with it,

746
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,320
then it just wouldn't happen.

747
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,840
I knew it had to be as bare bones as possible to ever exist.

748
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,200
She's so mad.

749
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,000
You know, well, you know, I don't know.

750
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,160
I don't want to seem too condescending because like,

751
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,360
I know what it's like.

752
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,240
It's like a natural, it's a natural feeling to have, I think.

753
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,360
It's, it's just like, you know, you want your art to be good.

754
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,320
You, you want to have the things you put out be nice.

755
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,480
What I'm saying is not that's like, that you're stupid for thinking that.

756
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,520
I'm saying that like, you have to understand that

757
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,040
that desire will kill you negative.

758
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,400
Yeah, it will kill you.

759
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,440
Instead of you putting out like, you think, okay,

760
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,360
if I do this, everything I put out will be perfect.

761
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,760
Instead, it's, you'll never put anything out.

762
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,120
That's what that means.

763
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,640
It seems like a great idea.

764
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,000
It seems intuitively great.

765
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,160
It's intuitively, like, of course I should work really hard

766
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,440
and make this thing good.

767
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,200
Like, what do you, what do you say?

768
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,560
And I shouldn't do that.

769
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,200
What the fuck?

770
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,240
It's, it's not even about making it not good.

771
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,080
It's just about recognizing.

772
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,640
If you think that, then like, yeah.

773
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,880
I mean, your priorities, your priorities are like,

774
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,200
about what is good, are probably like wrong.

775
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,560
You know, I don't, oh shit.

776
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,880
I don't know if it's like, I can't, I can't say like,

777
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,720
oh, these people.

778
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,280
Well, I mean, about, oh, I can say it, about low art.

779
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,400
Like, I don't think low art is just an idiot who doesn't understand.

780
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,360
I mean, he, he cranks out videos on a weekly basis.

781
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,040
So I don't understand why it, when it comes to this thing, he,

782
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,520
like, why did he bother?

783
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,400
Like, why did he bother like, going through all the effort

784
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,160
to like, do this with me?

785
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,880
If he's just going to like, leave it to language?

786
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,520
I don't know.

787
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,480
It doesn't matter.

788
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,920
It probably doesn't make any different.

789
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,840
Even if it never came out, nothing would probably happen.

790
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,640
It just annoys me.

791
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,160
I don't know what the point was.

792
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,480
I don't know what the, oh shit.

793
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,400
The, the, the reason I get so mad is I'm sure everyone

794
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,480
with a function brain can understand this because I've been there

795
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,560
because I know what it's like and I know what it, what,

796
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,360
I know the exact feelings that you go through and you just think,

797
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,920
well, like, like this is really important to me.

798
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,760
I want to make it as good as possible.

799
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,040
And I, listen, it's, it makes sense.

800
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
Yeah, but it's wrong.

801
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,120
It's wrong.

802
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,240
It just is wrong.

803
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,680
You just have to recognize when you think that making it,

804
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,240
perfect and good will often just mean that it doesn't happen at all.

805
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,440
And if you really care about it, then your number one goal

806
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,520
should be expressing the idea you want to express.

807
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,680
Should be making sure that it does happen.

808
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,160
Yeah.

809
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,960
Yeah.

810
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,760
I mean, you know, perfect is the enemy of the good and all that and all that shit.

811
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:21,920
Yeah.

812
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,760
I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure you've felt that before.

813
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,920
Sure.

814
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,480
All the time.

815
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:38,640
Um, part of a, I mean, I don't know, I mean, I mean, when it comes to,

816
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,360
I mean, I've definitely improved my speed.

817
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,560
I mean, this probably sounds ridiculous because for so long,

818
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,280
I wasn't putting out vapor's pages, but now that I am making them again,

819
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,760
I can tell that like, I've definitely improved my speed.

820
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,120
And a lot of that has just come from knowing what things are not worth focusing on

821
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,280
and not worth like, you know, devoting a huge amount of time and energy.

822
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,720
In Vapors One, on like the first page, there's like a small panel in the bottom right

823
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,080
that has like, you can see like their room.

824
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,600
You can see like their room in the background.

825
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,240
And I spent like hours, I spent like hours drawing.

826
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,480
Okay.

827
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,880
It's going to be embarrassing because it's not even that detailed,

828
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,840
but I spent a lot of time like focusing on that panel.

829
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,320
It's when they're sitting across from each other.

830
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:22,640
Yeah.

831
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,120
Not nice.

832
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,160
And there's the dot dot dot.

833
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,120
I spent a long time on the details of their room.

834
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,600
And that panel is so tiny that you can't even see it.

835
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeah.

836
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,040
It's a, there's a complete waste, complete waste.

837
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,360
I mean, I mean, something like this, like it obviously comes from passion, right?

838
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,360
Like it's obviously like you want to illustrate this room because you feel like it's important.

839
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,240
You feel like it, like a room can say a lot about a character, you know,

840
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,960
it can say a lot about what these people are like.

841
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,160
So you feel like it makes sense.

842
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,440
But yeah, what, what, what matters more to a character, what their room looks like,

843
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,200
or them like writing dialogue and them having like an expression

844
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,440
and you being able to show that expression to other people.

845
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,240
Yeah.

846
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,120
Yeah.

847
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,640
That, that's really matters.

848
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,440
That is.

849
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,280
And that's, uh, and that's what I mean.

850
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,920
That's what, and Vapors one took like a really long time.

851
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,520
Vapors three has taken a really long time,

852
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,160
but not because I've been spending a ton of time like on meticulous details.

853
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,720
It's been because I've been working on other stuff and putting it off.

854
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
Um, uh, different problem.

855
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,920
We're not to say, well, might to some people sound like a backhanded compliment,

856
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,880
but because like that's a societal problem.

857
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,680
That's like people value like perfection.

858
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,760
The abstract ideal perfection way too much.

859
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:44,720
I like, uh, respect people like a digi so much because they, they are able to put out content.

860
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,480
They are able to just get an idea and execute it without having that,

861
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,520
that perfectionist mindset of having to just like toil over it endlessly.

862
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,640
If I had done that podcast with digi, it would have been out months ago.

863
00:55:59,280 --> 00:55:59,520
Yeah.

864
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,120
Just it would have been out the day.

865
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,160
It would have been out the day.

866
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,400
Yeah.

867
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,720
I don't care what kind of cool editing you're going to put on that podcast.

868
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,640
He's not going to put any cool editing on it.

869
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,400
It's, it's the, that's the thing.

870
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,240
I know that he's not even gonna,

871
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,880
he's probably just going through it to like edit out like gaps or breaths or something.

872
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,160
And he's wrong to do so.

873
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,360
He is, he is un-

874
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,040
I mean that, I mean, that's just ridiculous to, to like, to procrastinate this long and taking-

875
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,920
And I think that's probably what EZK from, um, fucking, uh, uh, Internet Dreamland was doing too.

876
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,560
Gotta take those breaths out.

877
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,240
No one's going to listen to it if there's breaths.

878
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,680
Fuck off.

879
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,400
I think what we're saying here could easily be like miscontrude to being like just shit things out.

880
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,920
Just, just like, you know-

881
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,760
Yeah, that's literally what I'm saying.

882
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,360
That's literally what I'm saying.

883
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,400
It's what I'm saying too, but it just sounds wrong to some people.

884
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,120
And I don't really know how to express it in a way that won't, like,

885
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,760
I think that like, you sort of like, it's one of those lessons you might have to learn the hard way in a way

886
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,680
where you might not like get it right now while we're explaining to you and you might think,

887
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,600
oh, listen to these guys, they're, they're just, you know, they're, they're upset that whatever

888
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,760
projects they were working on hasn't come up and now they're trying to just say like, oh, shit it out.

889
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,000
But I, I am telling you, young artist commenting, you'll feel this one day.

890
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,440
You definitely will.

891
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,560
When, uh, one of your projects takes a year to come out.

892
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:24,960
Fuck.

893
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,480
When it's taken a week, then you'll know what we're talking about.

894
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,360
That's how I feel.

895
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,640
That's how I feel about Vapors 3.

896
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,520
That's how I feel about, uh, everything.

897
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,040
It's not, uh, arm retrieval.

898
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,720
Hmm.

899
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,760
What a nightmare.

900
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,960
What a nightmare.

901
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,000
Ben, you want to do a suicide pact?

902
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,400
Hmm.

903
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,320
Do I want to?

904
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,200
Yes.

905
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,840
Will I?

906
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,320
Maybe.

907
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:50,800
Sell me.

908
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,360
That has to be perfect, you know.

909
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,000
It has to be perfect.

910
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,400
Yeah, he's got to be, I don't want to mess this one up.

911
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

912
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,280
This one, you really, is worth, is worth the extra time.

913
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,440
Uh, hmm.

914
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,360
Jesus fucking Christ.

915
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,520
Hey, I just killed the cannonball rug, by the way.

916
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,320
Yeah, I hope, I knew you'd be happy for me.

917
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,520
Yeah, it's only when you, when you, when you kill that guy in the White House,

918
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,800
you know what I'm trying to say, dude?

919
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,760
Oh god, this fucking mimic.

920
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,040
Chest was a fucking mimic.

921
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:17,840
Don't worry about it.

922
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,640
It's fine.

923
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,440
It's fine, yeah.

924
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,440
No, I'm not gonna be fine.

925
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:21,840
A mimic?

926
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,000
What, what, what a ripoff of nuclear throne.

927
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,680
This game is a nuclear throne ripoff.

928
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,080
Oh, but I got a plunger.

929
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,520
I got a plunger out of the deal.

930
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,800
So it's fine, it's good.

931
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,760
God, I hope this, I hope I can buy a blank.

932
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,240
Yes, okay, because I need, I need two blanks to get into the rat's nest.

933
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,080
I'm going to the rat's nest, by the way.

934
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,560
Listen.

935
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,080
Oh, are you, are you gonna kill the ratting rat?

936
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,040
Are you finally gonna do it?

937
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,960
Uh, I mean, that's the plan.

938
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,440
Here's the thing.

939
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,480
God willing.

940
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,360
I, I have, okay, I have gotten to the rat before.

941
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,200
When you get to the rat, there's a two-phase battle followed by,

942
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,720
and I only just discovered this.

943
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,280
There is something else beyond the two-phase battle.

944
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,080
I have died on the second phase of his battle every time, except once.

945
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,400
One time I made it to the, the extra thing, and that was a real fucking trip.

946
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,640
And I'm sorry you're gonna miss it.

947
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,000
It's, it's, it's a sight.

948
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,960
It's a sight to behold.

949
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,400
It, it technically still counts as winning if you just beat the two-phase battle.

950
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,640
Like, but like, I don't know.

951
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,560
I'm sure something else happens if you do the other thing.

952
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,400
And I don't know what it is, but we'll see.

953
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,720
Who, no one knows what it could possibly be.

954
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,520
No one knows it could be.

955
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,200
Um, yeah.

956
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,560
How many of the comments do you think are gonna be, uh,

957
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,360
heavily criticizing your, your gameplay here?

958
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,680
Not that many, because I'm doing pretty good, I think.

959
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,160
That's good.

960
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,360
Ben, you, as a self-employed, self-made man,

961
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,600
who has no obligations to do anything ever in his entire life.

962
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,320
Yeah, true.

963
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,320
What are you gonna do this summer?

964
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,120
Does your life change with the seasons?

965
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,800
Do you feel like it impacts you whatsoever?

966
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,120
Not a, you know, well, not, well, I tell you what, Munchie,

967
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,000
I've fallen into a real funk lately.

968
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,720
And I think it's partially related to the season,

969
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,040
because during the winter I was so unmotivated to, uh, like go outside,

970
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,840
because it was fucking bitterly cold.

971
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,200
But like, I, I didn't, I didn't play, I mean, sometimes I did.

972
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,080
It wasn't like I never went out, but like, especially recently,

973
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,640
I've been, like, I haven't been playing Pokemon Go,

974
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,320
I haven't really been leaving the house very much,

975
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,840
I've just been working a lot.

976
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,080
And, uh, I'm thinking that I should probably take advantage

977
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,680
of the changing seasons now.

978
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,040
I mean, now it's, now we're full on into spring,

979
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,080
so there's no excuse.

980
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,600
Should probably take advantage of the changing seasons or whatever

981
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,520
to, uh, do something about that,

982
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,720
to get out there a little bit more,

983
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,600
get fucking, stop being such a fucking recluse or whatever.

984
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,400
To shut in?

985
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,960
Yeah, anyway, but I think that, so in that sense,

986
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,080
it might have some, uh, effect on me.

987
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,440
Is there anything that you particularly do outside,

988
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,520
or you just want the fresh air, which I think,

989
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,280
I think is a noble goal in it.

990
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,600
Pokemon Go is the only thing that I do outside.

991
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,400
So it's invaluable.

992
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,160
I, I, I, I found a mini-

993
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,840
Oh, it's really bad, I really fucked up.

994
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,200
I really fucked up.

995
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,560
Oh yeah, I ain't gonna get the ratty rat.

996
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,160
There's no way I'm gonna get the ratty rat.

997
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,480
Oh, come on, Ben.

998
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,560
That, you know, one job, one job.

999
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,000
I, that was a complete clusterfuck.

1000
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,480
Uh, since, since I'll be living there soon,

1001
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,040
I figured that I should, uh, try and come up with some, uh,

1002
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,680
you know, things to do in the city,

1003
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,720
because, uh, obviously it's fun to walk around

1004
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,520
and play Pokemon Go, but, uh, I, uh,

1005
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,600
also want to have some sort of maybe, uh,

1006
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,240
a thing I, uh, want to go to, or, you know, like a vent.

1007
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,440
Uh, I've been getting,

1008
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,040
digging the idea of like a, uh,

1009
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,960
maybe a weekly or a bi-weekly club meetup thing.

1010
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,360
And I found, uh, stuff for, like that for,

1011
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,280
for comic books in the Boston area,

1012
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,120
like the Boston Comics Roundtable.

1013
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:09,920
I know about that.

1014
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,360
I, um, I used to go to it, um, in fact,

1015
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,920
I've been meaning to go to it for like a year,

1016
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,720
and I just haven't, and I don't know why.

1017
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,680
Uh, it sounds, it, it seems like it would be great for you.

1018
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,320
Wouldn't it?

1019
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,920
I used to really like it.

1020
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,640
Again, I don't know why I haven't gone back.

1021
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,640
It's like every, I just put it off

1022
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,240
and put it off and put it off.

1023
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,440
Um, I meant to do.

1024
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,040
You want to make sure it's perfect when you go there.

1025
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,440
That's exactly.

1026
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,280
You want to make sure it's a, it's a perfect occasion.

1027
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,640
Yeah, that's right.

1028
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,720
That's, that's, that's the thing.

1029
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,160
Or some, it's something like that.

1030
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,200
I feel like shit now.

1031
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,600
Now I'm remembering that I have, uh,

1032
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,240
failed to avail myself of this thing.

1033
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,720
Yeah, I used to have a lot of fun going to that.

1034
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,320
Uh, did it accomplish anything?

1035
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,600
No, it doesn't matter.

1036
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,480
Got me out of the house.

1037
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,240
That's the only thing that matters in this life.

1038
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,080
What, when did you stop going to it?

1039
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,000
If I, when I, when I moved to Digi's.

1040
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,360
Oh, so you, uh, you have a lot more comments under your belt.

1041
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,640
I'm sure you'd have a lot more social.

1042
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,240
Not, not as many as I should.

1043
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,880
Well, whatever.

1044
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,680
Yeah.

1045
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,880
People will look at you and say,

1046
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,320
Oh my God, it's a song to you guy.

1047
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,000
And then you'll say, I also draw comics.

1048
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,960
And I'll go, what?

1049
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,480
Yeah, I guess.

1050
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,080
Uh, I guess so.

1051
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,400
I mean, I was all, I mean, even before like,

1052
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,720
you know, like two years ago when I used to go there,

1053
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,640
there were people that,

1054
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,400
I remember there were people, there was,

1055
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,840
there was like one guy who like knew who Digi was

1056
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,920
and was like stunned that I knew him or whatever.

1057
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,880
Oh, it's embarrassing.

1058
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,520
Cut that part.

1059
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,960
I hate saying what I just said.

1060
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,520
Cut that, wait, what, why?

1061
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,800
I don't know.

1062
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,600
It's fucking lame.

1063
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,880
What, what, no, why?

1064
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,240
Why is it, why is it embarrassing?

1065
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,520
Oh, I knew, I knew a famous person.

1066
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,360
Uh, that's fucking stupid.

1067
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,000
What a, what a, what a shitty thing to like,

1068
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,040
make any difference at all in your life.

1069
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,760
You know what I mean?

1070
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:11,520
I know, I, you know, so, so it's, it's easy when you're in your,

1071
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,320
to get starstruck easily.

1072
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,600
I feel, you know, if you like someone,

1073
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,600
if you like, if you watch someone's YouTube videos

1074
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,720
and you like them a lot and someone says they know them in person,

1075
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,560
well, that's, that's, that's crazy.

1076
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,520
For a second there, you know, you're like, oh my God, we'll be delighted.

1077
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:29,920
Shut up, shut up.

1078
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,480
I get it.

1079
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,200
Yeah, I get it.

1080
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,960
Um, but it makes me mad and I don't like it.

1081
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,320
Fair.

1082
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,520
Did I tell you about me going to code for Boston?

1083
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,040
Did I ever give you follow-up on that?

1084
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,800
I, I told you about what it is, right?

1085
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,680
You mentioned it, you mentioned it,

1086
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,720
you didn't give me any follow-up on it.

1087
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,280
No.

1088
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,120
When, when I, I was a bit, part of this,

1089
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,440
just wanting to Google search things to do in Boston,

1090
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,520
like meetups and stuff, I found this code for America brigade.

1091
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,840
And it is a group, an organization dedicated to making a civic code,

1092
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,760
which is a very nebulous concept to say the least.

1093
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,240
I don't, yeah.

1094
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,920
But I was intrigued by it.

1095
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,320
I thought, what is that?

1096
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
Well, I guess I'll have to find out myself.

1097
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,960
So, uh, I, I went to one last time it was in Boston before I got a cold

1098
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,040
and we weren't able to record Lego Star Wars.

1099
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,280
You're wondering why we aren't doing Lego Star Wars right now,

1100
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,800
because it got a cold and, uh,

1101
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,000
You couldn't record it before it was.

1102
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,760
I remember.

1104
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,640
Uh, what, hey, when was that?

1105
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,600
When did that trip end?

1106
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,080
It ended like, more, no, wait.

1107
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,000
Did we, did we hung out with once while you were here that time, right?

1108
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

1109
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,960
Who did that trip end?

1110
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,480
Oh God, I have no clue.

1111
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,840
I have no clue when that ended.

1112
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,400
Sometime at least two months ago, I think.

1113
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:56,880
At least.

1114
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,400
Whatever.

1115
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,120
Doesn't matter.

1116
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,520
Okay.

1117
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,720
Uh, but yeah, it sucked and it was a nightmare.

1118
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,240
Anyway, I went, I went to code for Boston with, uh, with Ethan.

1119
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,760
He was in town, so from our, or from RBCKCon.

1120
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,520
And, uh, we went there and, uh, it was, uh,

1121
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,480
I didn't really know what to expect because I was getting mixed signals.

1122
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,360
On one hand, it seems like it'd be one of those things that's a

1123
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,120
similar serious like, you know, we're making, we're improving the community with our code.

1124
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,720
We're, we're, we're updating the government to government 2.0.

1125
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,400
Literally a thing they've said.

1126
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,240
Uh, and so, you know, it's, it's, um, you might think it's somewhat a high brown,

1127
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:37,040
but then also plastered everywhere on the website was come get free pizza.

1128
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,840
Come to Cove for Boston and get free pizza, free pizza night.

1129
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,440
We come for Cove for Boston.

1130
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,240
And I was like, okay.

1131
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,920
Give me, give me, give me on a cauliflower crust and I'm there.

1132
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,760
Cove for Boston.

1133
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,280
Dude.

1134
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:49,760
Wait.

1135
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,240
Important, important, important.

1136
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,520
Guess who's Keto?

1137
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,720
My hero.

1138
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,600
Guess who's Keto?

1139
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,960
It's my hero, Arlo.

1140
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:58,800
Really?

1141
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,960
Arlo is a, Arlo is a Keto puppet.

1142
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,920
I saw him posting about, uh, low-carb red crusts.

1143
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,840
Or, I'm sorry, look, I saw him posting about no-carb pizza crusts the other day.

1144
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:09,920
I was floored.

1145
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,160
Famous for that, uh, that, that, that, that thumbnail of a video he made that was sadly

1146
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,640
deleted, uh, endless war, boring to shit.

1147
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,120
Yeah.

1148
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,160
Uh, yeah.

1149
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,280
That's the name of the show.

1150
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,440
We mass flagged him and got it taken down.

1151
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:21,920
Yeah, yeah.

1152
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,160
Uh, good times, good times.

1153
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,000
I can't believe, I can't believe puppets, puppets first of all can be Keto.

1154
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,440
I, I replied to his tweet about the pizza crust and I was like, Arlo, I don't know

1155
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:31,920
you were Keto.

1156
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,080
I didn't even know you had him a tablet or something.

1157
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,320
Yeah.

1158
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,800
Um, you know, learned, learned something new every day.

1159
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:37,760
You do.

1160
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,400
Anyway, there's, there's two ways that Cove for Boston go.

1161
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,680
It's either just like a bunch of hipsters, ideas man, you know, it up.

1162
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,360
An eating pizza or it's a real shit.

1163
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,360
I wanted to take my chances and hope that it was the hipsters ideas manning so that I

1164
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,880
could possibly, uh, I don't know, somehow use it to my advantage.

1165
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,640
Maybe somehow manipulate them into a plane in this war somehow.

1166
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,320
This actually ties into many things in my life.

1167
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:05,280
I'm going to do a story later about me going up to LA for a premiere of an independent movie

1168
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,840
where my also goal was solely to get people in LA to play in this war.

1169
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,480
But, uh, that that's basically the only, uh, operated, like the only thought in my mind

1170
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,040
is how can I get people with clout to play this game?

1171
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,640
Anyway, I go, I go to Cove for Boston, get some free pizza.

1172
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:27,360
And, uh, immediately to my, uh, my shock and my horror, it's real people actually

1173
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,760
accomplishing things and my, my, my influence is, uh, worthless.

1174
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,360
So, so it's, it's unfortunately just, um, me kind of like it's, it, there's a couple of

1175
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,640
rooms each have their own, uh, project assigned to them.

1176
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,760
It's a bunch of people.

1177
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,600
There's some ideas manning, but it's mostly just people working in silence.

1178
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,080
So imagine me and Ethan going there to have, to, you know, just to have a good time just to,

1179
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,920
you know, see, see things that just, you know, have, have a good time, party up and code for

1180
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,960
Boston. And then, uh, we're shuffled into an office space where people are just silently

1181
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,760
coding and somebody asked me, Hey, what are they coding?

1182
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:10,960
Uh, well, one of them is, uh, one of them was, uh, you had to know Python, uh, but also know

1183
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:17,760
the Alexa Amazon API is there making it so you can ask Alexa, like, I don't know,

1184
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,080
fucking like, like something about health insurance.

1185
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,080
I don't even remember something stupid like that.

1186
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,040
Sick. Yeah.

1187
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,880
Uh, the only cool thing was, uh, blocking.

1188
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,640
There was a blocking Pokemon go app.

1189
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,600
You know what blocking is?

1190
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,240
Uh, you've told me before, but I don't remember.

1191
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,320
It's, uh, it's a combination of jogging and picking up trash.

1192
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,600
It's a Scandinavian thing.

1193
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,280
What does it stand for?

1194
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,560
It's like a portmanteau, right?

1195
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,160
Yeah, it's a portmanteau.

1196
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,560
It, it, it's, it's some fucking here.

1197
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,680
I'm going to get it right now.

1198
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,440
It's, uh, some like Danish word, I think with jogging, some shit, some fucking,

1199
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,080
some stupid non-English word that I don't even care about.

1200
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,200
It doesn't even matter.

1201
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,640
But anyway, there was an app for that and, uh, that was, that was at least that one.

1202
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,080
There were people who, uh, were ideas manning it pretty hard.

1203
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,840
It was pretty in its early stages.

1204
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,760
I got to watch them make a reading file, but other than that, it was a pretty boring event.

1205
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,640
Yeah. Um, Boston Comics Roundtable.

1206
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,080
You know, it, it was, I don't know.

1207
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,640
I guess I liked, it was, it was weird.

1208
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,240
There was like, you would go there and there would be like, sort of,

1209
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,680
people would sit around and like, they would talk about like events, right?

1210
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,560
Cause they have, they have sort of a community that does events.

1211
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,880
Like they will have like tables at like local conventions and stuff, which is good.

1212
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,640
That's, that's all pretty cool.

1213
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,880
Um, they, they would just kind of discuss what's going on in their community.

1214
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,880
Like sometimes they would have, there was one time they had like a guest speaker

1215
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,480
who like spoke in like a lecture hall.

1216
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,160
They used to meet at like a, the downtown, a library near Harvard Square.

1217
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,560
I don't know if they still meet there, if they've changed venues, doesn't matter.

1218
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,320
But they would do that.

1219
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,320
And then you would, like before the meetings proper started,

1220
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,640
you would post your like latest, like anything you'd drawn that week,

1221
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,560
or something you'd drawn that week, you would post it on like a court board.

1222
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,400
And then everyone would walk around and sort of, uh,

1223
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,320
just critique each other's like stuff for the week.

1224
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,000
And it was really cool.

1225
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,320
Yeah.

1226
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,160
That sounds really sick as hell, actually.

1227
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,760
And it was a lot of, um, you know, it was a, it was a big spread.

1228
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,760
There were a bunch of like college kids, uh, there were a few of those.

1229
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,680
There were, um, you know, there were a bunch of older people,

1230
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,880
like, like maybe middle-aged or verging on middle-aged,

1231
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,040
people who were like veterans or whatever.

1232
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,200
There wasn't a lot, there wasn't a lot in the middle.

1233
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,320
There was, it was, it was mostly like those two,

1234
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,520
I guess there were some kind of in the middle, like 30 something or whatever.

1235
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,680
But it was a lot of the kids there, a lot of the college kids were like really bad.

1236
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,080
But everyone was, everyone was polite about it, you know.

1237
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,840
You know, everyone offered, everyone offered a constructive criticism,

1238
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,080
no matter how good or terrible you were.

1239
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,480
Uh, just, you know, that's fine.

1240
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,520
What, what, what kind of stuff happens in it exactly?

1241
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,400
Like, like, what, like, what is like the, the main thing that you do there?

1242
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,320
Is it just shoot the shit and try and network?

1243
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:18,240
It's mostly, you know, you convene about events, shoot the shit, network, critique each other's

1244
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,400
work, go out for burgers afterwards.

1245
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,640
Oh, burgers, I sold, sold.

1246
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:30,240
Yeah, um, I have, uh, I feel, you know, every day, I don't know why,

1247
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,000
I don't know why I haven't done it.

1248
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,440
But every day I know in my heart that I'm fucking up by not going back, and I haven't.

1249
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,280
Tell me why.

1250
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,480
Look in my soul and explain it to me.

1251
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:49,040
You can surely, listen, Ben, I had no idea how like big

1252
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,800
Boston Comics roundtable is.

1253
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,440
Maybe like 25, 30 people.

1254
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,080
You can surely become a sultan there.

1255
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,120
I, I, I believe that you have the ability to make people gravitate around you and become a sultan.

1256
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,080
I think you can do it.

1257
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,800
I was, hmm, I wasn't, I wasn't a sultan.

1258
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,720
You could be one now though.

1259
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,200
I mean, I was, uh, I don't know.

1260
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,000
I don't know.

1261
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,160
You know, maybe I'm afraid of, I think maybe I'm afraid that like I'll go and nothing will have changed.

1262
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,000
What do you mean?

1263
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,520
Like, I'll go and maybe, and I feel like I've been doing this whole comics thing and art thing

1264
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:34,240
and internet thing for like, you know, two or three years since then, and I'll go back and, uh,

1265
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,400
it won't be any different.

1266
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,040
And I'll think like, what was any of it for?

1267
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,360
You know, I'm still just a schmuck.

1268
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,720
I'm still just one of these schmucks.

1269
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,280
Oh, oh, so you're afraid you won't be sultan?

1270
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,200
In fact, you might be a peon still.

1271
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,520
Yeah. Oh God. Fuck.

1272
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,040
I think that's, I think that's it.

1273
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,080
I think I figured it out.

1274
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:59,680
You also, you seem, you seem to have a, you seem to have an insecurity complex about comics, Ben.

1275
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,520
You went to mice and you're just like, oh God, I'm just, I'm just a cattle.

1276
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,760
I'm, I'm just a sheep to be herded here.

1277
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,680
I need to be behind the booths.

1278
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,280
Yeah. I hated, I hated not being behind the booths.

1279
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,640
What's so wrong with being just another, another citizen of comic land here, of webcomic land?

1280
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,800
You know, you'll get your just desserts one day, but for now, but you know,

1281
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,040
you got to toil a little bit.

1282
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,720
You got to a little bit in the sand before you can ride this to the gate and prekeat yourself.

1283
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,520
No, that's not, I don't agree with your framing of the issue there.

1284
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,560
Yeah.

1285
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,640
Toil is fine. I'm okay with toil.

1286
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,880
It's not, the problem is not toil.

1287
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,560
It's not like, oh, I have to work and these, and these heroes, these champions, like lorded over me behind it.

1288
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:52,320
It, it was that I, I just didn't, I didn't want to go there to consume stuff.

1289
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,400
I wanted to go there to, you know, pedal stuff. I don't know. I wanted,

1290
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,160
it's, it, this is not even like a hierarchy thing.

1291
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,800
Like, oh, I'm lower on the totem pole, although that is part of it.

1292
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,120
It's that like, I was there for the wrong purpose.

1293
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,120
I see.

1294
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,920
Does that make sense?

1295
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:18,080
No, I feel like what you understand, like you, you were going there not because you particularly like

1296
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,720
loved comics in concept, but because these are other comic artists.

1297
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,400
I kind of want to rub elbows with them.

1298
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,520
And I kind of want to, if not like get people to literally buy Ben St. Vapors,

1299
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,480
just talk to other people in the trade, maybe not, maybe not collaborate directly,

1300
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,800
but just at least, you know, get in there.

1301
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,040
A bit, there's a little more to it.

1302
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:44,480
It was like being, being there as a, as a guest, as a, as a consumer was like,

1303
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,680
I wanted to be like, no, listen, you don't understand.

1304
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,880
If this is a mistake, yeah, yeah, that's exactly it.

1305
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,160
I wanted to be like, this is a mistake.

1306
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,200
This is just an accident.

1307
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
I'm supposed to be on the other side.

1308
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:05,280
Listen, I'm not, I, please, like, don't, don't, don't look at me like these other freaks.

1309
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,680
I actually do things like you.

1310
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,320
I promise.

1311
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,120
Yeah.

1312
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:13,760
Okay.

1313
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,240
There you go.

1314
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,000
I, I, I get you.

1315
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:23,200
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, what if, what if there are more people like that in that crowd?

1316
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,600
What if instead of, well, that's part of it, that's part of the existential horror of it,

1317
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,320
Munchie, is that I think probably there's lots of them.

1318
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:31,680
Mm hmm.

1319
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:37,520
And I don't know if maybe they don't feel it as acutely as me or maybe they do.

1320
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,320
And we're all equally frustrated to be there.

1321
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,960
But, but then if that's the case, then why not turn on each other?

1322
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:51,280
Why, why not, why not find some solace in the fact that there are other people like that here?

1323
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,400
And you know, it's just, it's, it's almost as though the, not the people behind the booths

1324
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,640
are, I don't want to say luckiness as they haven't worked.

1325
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,920
I'm not locked in there with them.

1326
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,960
They're locked in here with me.

1327
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,200
Yeah, yeah, in a way.

1328
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:09,680
It's, it's not that they're a, they, you are a consumer, like it's a binary system,

1329
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,520
either you're a creator or a consumer.

1330
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,160
It's just that, you know, maybe you are blending in with the sheep.

1331
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,680
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing in a way.

1332
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,080
And then maybe there are other wolves, wolves in sheep clothing.

1333
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,120
You can interact with them and maybe talk to them and find comradery.

1334
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,960
I mean, in your, in your, well, well, it feels to me,

1335
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,280
like if you were really a wolf in that scenario, you wouldn't be wearing,

1336
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,000
why would you wear it?

1337
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,600
Why would you be wearing sheep's clothing?

1338
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,960
Like any, any, I don't want to, I don't want to hang out with these pervert wolves that

1339
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,080
like dressing up as sheep.

1340
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah, okay.

1341
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,000
I think our, our metaphor is getting muddled here a little bit.

1342
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,280
I feel like the game, I feel like, I feel like they were muddled as soon as they left my

1343
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,480
mouth, but you know what, that's fine.

1344
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,440
Um, I actually speak, speaking of that.

1345
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,480
Actually now is the time for soon anyway.

1346
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,720
We'll be the time to register at a table at mice.

1347
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,000
So I gotta do that.

1348
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,080
Oh, what's the requirement of that?

1349
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,160
Is that, is that just to first come, first serve?

1350
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,560
And if you're just anyone who's anyone or even just like asked nicely, you can get in.

1351
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,320
I, I don't know.

1352
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,120
It might be.

1353
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,000
It might, I mean, there are problems.

1354
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I mean, there's probably some like priority people, like maybe like certain people who

1355
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,800
tabled successfully at like previous events or probably people with clout like Casey

1356
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,000
Green or whatever, he was there.

1357
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,840
Um, like I'm sure, or Abby Howard or whatever, like I'm sure they would be like, I'm sure

1358
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,520
they wouldn't be turned away already.

1359
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:39,840
Yeah.

1360
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,520
But maybe it might just be, fuck, it might just be first come, first serve.

1361
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,680
Let me ask you this bit.

1362
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:47,920
Yeah.

1363
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,360
All right.

1364
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,560
Two questions.

1365
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,320
First of all, would you consider comics to be your main thing slash main Colin like thing

1366
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,240
you want to present yourself as the most thing I want to present myself as the most?

1367
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:00,640
Yeah, definitely.

1368
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,520
Like a comics artist.

1369
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:01,760
Okay.

1370
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,320
Yeah, definitely.

1371
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,560
How much do you read or interact with the independent comic scene just in general,

1372
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,360
like webcomics, Boston local, just at all?

1373
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,720
Almost none.

1374
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,440
That's, that's what I figured.

1375
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah.

1376
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,240
Is that a problem?

1377
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,040
Cause I know.

1378
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,480
Probably, probably.

1379
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:20,720
Okay.

1380
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,920
A lot of, I have been thinking about this a lot.

1381
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,600
The thing about online communities, thinking about how I miss the old fandom days,

1382
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,520
which I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever it is matter.

1383
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:37,280
But I don't have a, a interest that I have where I feel like I know what other people

1384
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:42,080
with the interest have, which feel like I have a lot of interest and I know the interest

1385
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:46,080
themselves was pretty deeply, but I don't really know for instance, like for instance,

1386
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,000
I don't really know a lot about like maybe the, the homesick community, for instance,

1387
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,960
or something more broad.

1388
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,360
Like I don't really know a lot about like the podcast community or just things that

1389
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,880
like I do and sort of like almost like my livelihood in a way depends on.

1390
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,120
I don't really have a sense of like what the community is.

1391
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,760
Like, like, like I watch other podcasts.

1392
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,560
Do I like know anything about how like other people view said podcasts?

1393
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,720
Have I ever been in a red discussion, a forum discussion, a tweet on Twitter?

1394
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,240
Have I ever seen anything like that?

1395
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,160
You know, no, not really.

1396
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,080
I mean, I don't know if there is something like that for podcasts.

1397
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:22,560
Exactly.

1398
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,200
Well, okay, well, sure.

1399
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,800
But you get what I'm trying to say.

1400
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,040
Like, I totally get what you're trying to say.

1401
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:29,760
Yeah.

1402
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,440
I felt that way about comics.

1403
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,080
The comics, I feel that way as well.

1404
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,440
The comics community, as I have seen it, it's really weird.

1405
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,800
And I don't think I get it.

1406
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,480
It's really weird.

1407
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,000
What?

1408
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,120
What do you, what do you like?

1409
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,400
Well, okay.

1410
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:46,960
What's weird about it?

1411
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,760
What's weird about it?

1412
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:48,880
Okay.

1413
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:59,760
It, it just, you know, I mean, maybe I should try and give another shot.

1414
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,480
Maybe, maybe I didn't like it before because I had no like cloud.

1415
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,400
I had like very little work under my belt.

1416
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,040
And it, and it wasn't like, and that's why it wasn't working out or whatever.

1417
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:19,360
It just, it all feels like people just sort of like buying each other's shit.

1418
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,840
Like, like artists all just like buying each other's books.

1419
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,680
And like, that's, it's like a bunch of amateurs.

1420
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,320
It's like a, just like a bunch of amateurs just like barely keeping each other afloat

1421
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,280
with their own money.

1422
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,480
That's how it felt like to me.

1423
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,480
Well, what's wrong with that?

1424
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,560
I hate it.

1425
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:39,840
Yeah.

1426
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,560
Okay.

1427
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,160
Is that, is that the goal?

1428
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:48,400
Is, is the goal of it to like make shit that like just you and your fellow

1429
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,880
members of this community are interested in?

1430
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,800
I don't think, I don't think that's why they do it.

1431
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,240
I don't think that's the goal.

1432
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,200
I think that's a byproduct of them wanting like thems.

1433
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:05,360
I would say almost it's, I think like, I can empathize with a lot in almost like a selfish way

1434
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,880
where it's like, I want my comic to be successful.

1435
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,080
Not just like monetarily.

1436
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,640
I like, I want people to know who the fuck I am.

1437
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,760
How do I do that other than collaborate and to like, to mix and mingle with other comic

1438
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,240
artists to get their audience into my stuff as well?

1439
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,520
But, okay.

1440
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,480
What, yeah, I get that, but what if everyone that you're commingling with, everyone's

1441
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,360
audience is just the same other people, other people that make web comics?

1442
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,280
Hmm.

1443
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,120
I mean, sure.

1444
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,680
But I don't know if that's, okay.

1445
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:48,320
When you're working on the internet, I feel like that sort of thing is almost like,

1446
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,640
like there's no way there's going to be one big circle for like the idea of comics.

1447
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,680
Like, like the concept of a web comic, you know?

1448
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,240
There's no, there's not one big circle.

1449
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,640
There are like several small circles.

1450
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:09,920
I completely understand the idea of wanting to like, just sort of like get the word out.

1451
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,200
It's like, I don't, I don't think I'm communicating this well.

1452
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,320
Cause like I'm not saying, it's not that I'm saying like, why are these people collaborating

1453
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:18,880
with each other?

1454
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,480
Like that's not the problem.

1455
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:31,840
I get that the problem is just like, I don't know that I just, I see people, I see people in

1456
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:38,080
these little comics communities, you know, sort of all it's like, you know, like, like

1457
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,880
retweeting each other's kick starters and stuff and whatever.

1458
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:49,840
And like, it feels very insular and like it's not, like it's, it feels very like circle jerky

1459
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,160
in a way.

1460
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,920
Circle jerky a little bit.

1461
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,280
But like, in a way that's like not even their fault.

1462
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,680
Like, yeah, maybe they're circle jerky.

1463
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,480
It's like pathetic.

1464
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,800
I don't want to say it like that.

1465
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,480
Like, maybe like, it's like, yeah, there's circle jerking.

1466
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,480
But I mean, who else is going to jerk them off?

1467
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,000
Maybe, maybe the problem is there's nobody else is going to jerk these people off.

1468
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,840
You know, maybe the audience just isn't there.

1469
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,920
And that's very discouraging.

1470
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,960
And would you say it's discouraging in a way where it like it makes you confront your own

1471
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,680
mortality in a way?

1472
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:26,560
Or it's like, oh, if this is all I can ever aspire to is just being like, like other people

1473
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,680
also who are commissars liking my stuff.

1474
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,400
Is that what you mean?

1475
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,600
Yeah, that that one, that one.

1476
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,240
Like, I don't know.

1477
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,800
I think I said before that I'm not married.

1478
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,640
I'm not married to the idea of like, comics being the thing.

1479
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:50,880
Like, if I could do something with like a similar skill set, but in a different format

1480
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,880
that would have like a bigger readership be more popular, I wouldn't have any problem

1481
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,640
with doing that.

1482
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:07,520
Um, and the web comics community sort of sort of smells to me like one that is very limited

1483
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,600
in its readership.

1484
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,120
And I don't know if I'm right about that because like there are comics that are successful that

1485
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:20,640
people do read, but also by your own admission, it's you don't, it's not like something you're

1486
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,760
fully invested in.

1487
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,720
You would like know if like, like, you know, you weren't that involved with it.

1488
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,960
That's, I think you're conflating.

1489
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,440
I mean, I, I didn't say that.

1490
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,360
I mean, I think I know where, I think I know how it works and everything.

1491
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,800
I didn't like, I'm not invested in that as like, it has to be this or like, I'm not invested

1492
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,120
in the format specifically.

1493
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:51,680
Um, my, my, I mean, there are comics that people read that have like a decent readership.

1494
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:57,920
But they're mostly on, they're mostly on things like, um, they're networks like

1495
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,480
HiveWorks.

1496
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,720
Actually, HiveWorks is like the only one I can even think of.

1497
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:05,920
But like most, I feel like most comics that anyone actually reads are like on something

1498
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:11,840
like HiveWorks or they're like print, print comics or something like that, or they're just

1499
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,320
totally independent and like word of mouth has gotten them around like Ogloff or something like

1500
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,360
that.

1501
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:24,400
And like being independent and being known, like that, you can't make that happen.

1502
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,680
That's, you can't, you can't manufacture that.

1503
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,200
Um, you know, what are you even supposed to do about it?

1504
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:31,600
I don't know.

1505
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,680
Getting into something like HiveWorks, well, I tried once and it didn't work.

1506
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,120
Um, and I should probably try again at some point.

1507
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,880
Um, but you know, I don't know.

1508
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,680
That seems like a weird, difficult nut to crack.

1509
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:54,880
And also seems sort of, it's sort of like a, it seems just like a less embarrassing

1510
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,760
microcosm of the webcomics community in its own way.

1511
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,920
Like it has the same general atmosphere, just like, I mean, there are plenty of comics

1512
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,640
that nobody reads on HiveWorks too, um, for instance.

1513
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,720
And then print comics, I don't fucking have any clue about that.

1514
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:18,000
I don't think I'm going to get like a, I've been thinking about this.

1515
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:25,520
Um, the idea of like having a job, the idea that of like a publisher like paying me to

1516
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:34,320
produce content on a schedule seems ridiculous, just seems ridiculous, like a, like a stupid

1517
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,320
thing to even think about.

1518
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,200
Like, I mean, I think, I think those jobs do exist, but I think

1519
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,320
they are, they do not, they're not being created.

1520
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,320
I don't know.

1521
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,720
It doesn't, it doesn't feel like anyone is being hired to do that.

1522
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:57,440
And like professionals say, like, like old professionals say, like these days,

1523
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,280
just go indie, just, just kickstart.

1524
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,360
Don't, don't, don't go through a traditional like publisher.

1525
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,360
Like that's what, that's what I was confused for a second point.

1526
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:05,840
Yeah.

1527
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,080
Okay.

1528
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:11,680
I thought, I thought that was like a comment from, uh, Ben, uh, Communism Saint, uh, just

1529
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:15,280
like saying like the idea of the jobs were ridiculous, but you're saying like it's hard,

1530
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,840
like, like, they're mythical in a way where it's like, how could you ever land one?

1531
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,800
Is that what you're saying?

1532
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,040
Yeah.

1533
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:21,200
Yeah.

1534
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:21,520
Okay.

1535
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,880
Like who, like who's, who's hiring for that?

1536
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,160
Uh, no one.

1537
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:32,720
And nobody wants, I mean, I'm not, I don't have no audience, but I don't have the kind of

1538
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,880
audience that like, that like a company would hire me because like, oh wow, this guy's going

1539
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,560
to bring in a lot of, a lot of people with him, a lot of readership.

1540
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,680
You know, yeah, I, I, I totally get you, dude.

1541
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:51,440
I feel like it's, I, I mean, I would chalk up for me, I don't know if you would consider

1542
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,160
this way, but I would just consider it an experience on my part that I don't really

1543
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,240
know how the hiring process works for a lot of things.

1544
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:00,640
Like, I, like, I, I mean, I agree with you that I have no idea how like the first thing

1545
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,760
to do, but how I would even like approach a like, like, for, like, for instance, like,

1546
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:12,080
like, like everyone who's published a, a, a comic has just like,

1547
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,920
uh, well, what am I trying to say?

1548
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,320
I'm trying to say that, like, okay, you think about a, a Brian Leo Malley, you think, okay,

1549
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,800
how'd he get Scott, Scott Pilgrim published?

1550
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,360
Well, he went to Oni Press and he had already had some work under his belt that he'd published.

1551
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,200
And so he got, how'd he publish the first one?

1552
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,000
No clue.

1553
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,640
Like, was he just fresh off the like college or something?

1554
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,200
I mean, I, I know, I know a bit about this.

1555
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,520
Do you, what, how'd he do it?

1556
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:45,120
Well, he had a comic called, um, Lost at Sea.

1557
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,640
Yeah, he had a book.

1558
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:54,400
That one, I, he had like done, okay, I don't know the exact order that these events occurred in,

1559
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,800
but he had done Lost at Sea.

1560
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,960
I think before that he had done some like strips.

1561
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,080
He had done some like comic strips on like some website.

1562
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,120
That were sort of the precursor to Lost at Sea.

1563
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,560
I don't know what the deal was with those.

1564
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:17,040
He had, I think this was post Lost at Sea pre Scott Pilgrim.

1565
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:27,520
He had a deal with Marvel and Marvel had him draw a like Spider-Man Children's book.

1566
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,880
Had him illustrate like a Spider-Man Children's book.

1567
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,320
And I, in like an interview or something, he said that like,

1568
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:40,240
that paid really well and like let him like concentrate on like his other stuff.

1569
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,880
And, uh, boy, I wish I, I was thinking about that.

1570
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,880
I was like, boy, God, I wish I could get paid to illustrate a fucking Spider-Man Children's book.

1571
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,520
I'll bet, I'll bet it paid like crazy.

1572
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:55,920
I, I'm sure there's like a clear, I'm just doing, I'm just like looking at his Wikipedia page right

1573
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,560
now. It seems like, yeah, he was doing, he was just doing like small, small stuff at like a comics

1574
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,160
studio. He was just doing the smallest stuff and doing like lettering and behind the scenes

1575
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,760
stuff. And I guess you just have to like, you know, go somewhere.

1576
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:14,320
I mean, imagine, imagine getting a job as a comic book letterer today as like a letterer or like a

1577
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:18,640
fucking, I don't know, colorist. I mean, I guess those jobs exist.

1578
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,120
Do, I don't know, do they even exist? They probably exist in some form.

1579
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,480
But again, it feels mythical. It feels ridiculous.

1580
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,560
I feel like, I don't know. I think we're talking out of our ass.

1581
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,960
I like, surely like there's, there's answers to these questions.

1582
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,400
I don't know. I've just, I've never looked it up. And I don't know. I don't even think I'm

1583
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,160
complaining about it really. I, I, uh, I'm complaining about it.

1584
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:52,320
Oh, oh, Ben, one, one day you'll be behind, you'll be behind the booth.

1585
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,000
You'll be behind the booth. I can be behind the booth. Being behind the book is easy.

1586
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,480
It was just an accident of history that it didn't happen.

1587
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,360
It was a mistake. It was a glitch in the matrix.

1588
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,120
It was. That's exactly what it was.

1589
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,520
As a matter of fact. Yeah.

1590
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:10,320
Ben, let's go to comics, boss comics round table. Let's like go together. Let's like do it.

1591
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,560
Yeah. I mean, I should probably just go like this.

1592
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,600
You go, go right now.

1593
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,400
Just like, why not? I think they're still on Tuesday.

1594
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,360
I'll check right now. I'll check right now.

1595
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,080
You only, you won't even have deniability. You didn't, you didn't check it.

1596
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,440
Okay. Thursday, 7 p.m. Thursday is okay.

1597
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,720
Are they still at that library?

1598
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,680
Is it the same way?

1599
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,320
They're at Leslie college of art and design,

1600
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:37,760
Lunder hall room 003, uh, near Porter square in Cambridge.

1601
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,480
Huh. I wonder if that's a downgrade.

1602
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,360
The library they used to meet at was pretty nice.

1603
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,080
Open all and all are welcome to matter.

1604
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,120
Your level of interest or experience in comics, beginners to experience.

1605
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,240
You don't have to give a fuck.

1606
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,360
Yeah.

1607
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,360
Okay. We're talking about local comic events.

1608
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,960
Look at each other's work in progress and generally socialize about the comics theme.

1609
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,160
So this is what I wanted.

1610
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,200
That's exactly what I wanted.

1611
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,240
I just wanted people, ideas, man.

1612
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,600
And just being like, yeah.

1613
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,000
So I got this like idea about like this comic that like I'll make, you know,

1614
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,560
one day when I'm just 30 years from now.

1615
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,680
When I, you know, when I'm good, you know,

1616
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,280
after I practice a whole bunch and you know,

1617
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,640
Yeah. Yeah. After it's perfect.

1618
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,800
After I really iron out all the flaws in the story.

1619
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1620
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,320
Discussing.

1621
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:26,800
Perfect.

1622
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Um, it sounds really cool.

1623
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,560
I really want to go.

1624
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:32,320
I don't know.

1625
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,080
Okay. I feel like I do get what you're trying to say,

1626
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,520
but it's a little bit insular, a little bit circle, jerky.

1627
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,960
I honestly feel bad saying that because like,

1628
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,360
what's the alternative that I'm proposing?

1629
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,240
What would be better?

1630
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,480
What would I do in their place?

1631
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,000
I don't know.

1632
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,240
I, I, I get your saying.

1633
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:55,120
I don't know if I, I don't know if I, like if I feel the same way.

1634
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,520
I feel like I, I don't know.

1635
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,400
Honestly, like I think the only difference is that I have like the PCP and other like

1636
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:06,240
internet stuff as like secondary creative outlets.

1637
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,520
Like I'm sure for a lot of these people,

1638
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,480
comics are just what they do and that's it.

1639
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:17,040
And like, you know, nothing wrong with that, but I don't know.

1640
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,960
Let me ask you this Ben.

1641
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,840
Do you think, have you ever reflected upon that effect?

1642
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,080
Like, do you think that's bad almost in a way that you are doubly down on one thing?

1643
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,600
Yes, probably.

1644
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,240
Yeah. I'm, I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none.

1645
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,800
And you know, they say that to get, that to become a master,

1646
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,040
you got to just buckle down on that one thing and you shouldn't do what I do.

1647
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,720
Yeah. You shouldn't, you should, you have to specialize to become great.

1648
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,160
And I haven't specialized.

1649
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:54,240
I've cast like a really wide net and you know, mistake.

1650
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,440
I think about, especially now that I'm staring down college.

1651
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,360
Maybe I'm like, what do I want to do with my life?

1652
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,920
Maybe, maybe if I had like done nothing but comics,

1653
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,120
maybe I could have made some headway in the comic sphere,

1654
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,320
like more than I actually have.

1655
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,000
Because you know, I mean, what, what, what like actual comics headway have I made?

1656
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,960
Like I had my Kickstarter that did pretty well, great.

1657
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:22,160
But like, I mean, what does that, what does that mean in terms of like other opportunities?

1658
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,800
I mean, well, I don't know, maybe it could mean something.

1659
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,440
I don't know.

1660
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,840
No one's fucking come to me with any job offers or anything.

1661
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,360
Is that what they do?

1662
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,880
Is that what's supposed to happen?

1663
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,600
People email you and say, hey, I got a job for you?

1664
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,200
Maybe. I don't know.

1665
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,720
How could I know?

1666
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,520
I think about a lot.

1667
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,040
Like what do I want to do with my life?

1668
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,920
Like what, what skills should I be developing right now?

1669
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,160
I've had a whole, I've literally themed the year based around,

1670
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,520
I want to do more with my life.

1671
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,520
I want to learn more things.

1672
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,720
I've been learning to animate.

1673
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,400
I've been learning to play the trumpet more.

1674
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:01,360
I've been doing a lot of things to try and broaden my horizons and get more skills.

1675
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,360
But honestly, like, should I be doing that?

1676
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:10,880
I think about like the skills that I want to use to like farther my life.

1677
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,840
What do I want with my life?

1678
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,640
I want to illustrate.

1679
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:16,960
I want to, I want to, I want to do visual art.

1680
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,640
And so animating works for that.

1681
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,720
But just playing the trumpet?

1682
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,240
No. Does, does, does having new podcast series?

1683
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,120
No, not really.

1684
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,320
I guess you could maybe argue that quick draws help with that because it's about drawing.

1685
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,120
But that's sort of a roundabout way.

1686
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:38,160
It's mostly my, my actual, like what I'm doing for that is I'm editing a video series.

1687
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,800
It's, there's no reason to be doing a lot of things I do.

1688
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,800
But it's just, it's so hard not to.

1689
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:52,640
I mean, I think it's, I think most people would say it's a good thing to be broadly

1690
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:58,640
experienced, you know, to have had a wide range of experiences in your life and such.

1691
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,760
Sure. I don't disagree and I don't regret anything, of course.

1692
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:10,160
But it's almost just, I feel like maybe I am wasting time in a way.

1693
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,560
Maybe I should just be doubling down on, maybe I, maybe I should open up commissions again.

1694
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:19,280
Maybe I, maybe I should just be doubling down on visual art in a way instead of

1695
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,040
separating time to, maybe even like, maybe even something like R of CK.

1696
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,480
Maybe I shouldn't even be, be trying to manage the community as much as I do now.

1697
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,400
But I think about that and I think about like the reason to do so.

1698
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:36,720
And it just feels like my life would be just so much duller if I did that.

1699
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:42,000
I feel like there's such spice to having very interest and to being so,

1700
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:50,160
like, even though it's not good for like, business, it feels good to be multi-faceted,

1701
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:54,720
multi-faceted and like, not really easy to describe in a way where it's like,

1702
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,560
yeah, I like that.

1703
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,040
For instance, you, like, there's a lot of things that one could describe you as,

1704
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,600
but it's hard to kind of like, succinctly do.

1705
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,040
So like, you stream sometimes, okay, so you're like a Twitterer,

1706
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,560
but you also do comics and, and, and different sorts of comics.

1707
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,200
But you also like, do YouTube, but like, what kind of YouTube stuff do you do?

1708
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,080
Well, you used to like, Pokemon Nuzlocs, but now you do like,

1709
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,160
poo, any of the poo videos, but it'll usually do all this other stuff.

1710
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,800
It's like, it's not really, you know,

1711
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,240
you're sort of everything and therefore not really anything.

1712
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:33,520
Yeah. And, uh, you know, that has a certain appeal for me, but I think it's, I mean,

1713
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,120
I think it's bad, like business-wise, right?

1714
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,360
Oh, definitely. Like, definitely, definitely.

1715
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,120
Because, because what do you say?

1716
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,320
Like, what's, what's the pitch?

1717
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:47,760
Like, oh, Ben's saying, why should I, why should I support him on Patreon?

1718
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,360
Well, he does.

1719
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,560
And then you do a list of things that have almost nothing to do with each other.

1720
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,880
It's like, maybe someone likes one of those things or two,

1721
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,240
but what about all the other shit that I don't care about, you know?

1722
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:08,480
Yeah. In a way, it's like, okay, making your business based upon the fact that you are a

1723
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:14,880
personality is such a slippery, treacherous slope where some people can make it work really well.

1724
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,360
But I feel they can only make it, they can only make it work well once they've already

1725
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,000
established themselves with one trait.

1726
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,040
For instance, you look at, you look at, you look at the top of the list, you look at PewDiePie.

1727
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:33,440
That dude could do literally anything and have it be successful.

1728
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,240
Yeah.

1729
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:41,200
Because it does not matter what it is or even like the quality of it, it's just PewDiePie.

1730
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,640
That's all that matters.

1731
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,080
But how did he get that big?

1732
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,480
Well, he was a video game, let's play, almost exclusively for a really long time.

1733
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,480
Then he started vlogging, started to branch out.

1734
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,880
But that kernel of him like developing that one skill of him,

1735
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,880
him being in front of the camera and that of him playing video games,

1736
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,200
he doesn't even like really do that much video game content as far as I know now.

1737
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,640
It's just, he built up with that and then branched out into further things.

1738
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:10,720
But I feel like with you and me, other people in the PCP and just, I mean, a lot of people at

1739
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:16,400
large just are starting with, hey guys, it's me, you're supporting me, do, you know, whatever.

1740
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,960
And I don't think people like want that.

1741
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,400
I don't want, I don't think people want to like just run off the bat.

1742
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:27,920
Like just now have to follow this random dude who does all these disparate random things.

1743
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,920
I feel like our audience will disagree with that because that's what they do.

1744
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,080
But I think they're like, you guys are the minority, you know.

1745
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:36,960
Yeah.

1746
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:41,760
People want people to be comic machines or want them to be video machines or want them to be

1747
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,880
let's play machines.

1748
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,640
They don't want them to be like, for instance, rapping all the way back to endless war,

1749
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,200
first year SL version, happy birthday, ah.

1750
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:51,760
Oh, right.

1751
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,240
Oh, right.

1752
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,120
Happy birthday.

1753
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,280
Happy birthday, endless war, up all the way.

1754
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,080
I would go up and give him a present.

1755
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,520
But I'm afraid he would shoot his eye laser beam at me.

1756
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,160
Yeah, that's the fable ultimate beam.

1757
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,280
Mm hmm.

1758
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:10,960
Like this is just not like this RCK.

1759
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,560
Like this is an unwieldy mess.

1760
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,480
No one wants to play this.

1761
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,840
And I understand.

1762
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,960
It makes sense.

1763
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:22,400
I don't think the way we run.

1764
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,520
I mean, the show is called Rowdy fuckers cop killers.

1765
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:31,200
And I think like I thought about like there are ways we can better monetize it.

1766
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,280
And there are ways that we can do that without changing the soul of the show.

1767
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:39,680
But but honestly, like I don't care because I don't want to change RCK in any way that

1768
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:46,320
would lessen it's it's it's like part of the appeal of RCK is the fact that it's very that

1769
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:50,720
it's weird that it's unlike anything else in this war.

1770
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:56,800
Just in concept, this this like the idea on its own of being a text based MMO in a discord

1771
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:01,120
server they can play for three years for free using the link in the description on its own is

1772
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,920
crazy.

1773
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,920
But the fact that it is tied into this fucking weird avant-garde.

1774
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,200
Let's play show is just is a whole nother layer.

1775
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:10,800
It is.

1776
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,760
So yeah.

1777
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,200
And that's great.

1778
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:17,040
And that's why and that's why it's cool.

1779
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:22,880
And that's why I am you know fucking and that's why I'm a fucking nothing master.

1780
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,280
What's the word?

1781
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,240
A wasteoid.

1782
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,680
Waste wasteoid.

1783
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,480
Webazoid.

1784
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:32,880
Go nowhere.

1785
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,760
Fucking idiot.

1786
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,960
It doesn't have a fucking real art job.

1787
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:43,040
It was just it was just yeah yeah yeah great.

1788
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:43,760
Sorry.

1789
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,800
That was kind of that probably sounded kind of spiteful of me.

1790
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:55,040
But like I do think that it is part of like it is an outgrowth of a kind of attitude that I have had

1791
01:42:55,120 --> 01:43:00,400
where like I don't care about I don't care about the monetizability of X idea.

1792
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,280
I just care about the fact that I think it's interesting and I want to do it

1793
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,400
and I'll make something that's not like anything else.

1794
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,160
Doesn't appeal to a wide audience.

1795
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:08,880
I don't care.

1796
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,320
And um I don't know.

1797
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,040
Is that was that a good idea.

1798
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:15,520
I don't know.

1799
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:16,960
Yeah.

1800
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:18,080
I don't know.

1801
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,760
I I don't like maybe maybe maybe munchie.

1802
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:33,440
Maybe if I'd made some more maybe if I'd made a web comic about I don't know a little fucking it's

1803
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:39,040
like you know it's like a dark it's like a dark modern take on like Little Red Riding Hood.

1804
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:43,280
But it's like you know kind of like it's kind of creepy but it's cute like it's a cute creepy

1805
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:47,520
kind of like you know it's like a little you know she meets like friends along the way it's

1806
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:53,120
like a fantastical thing you know get that up on Hiveworks or whatever you know chugged away at

1807
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,440
that and nothing else for like three years.

1808
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,400
Maybe by now maybe by now I'd have like a low level like storyboarding job at like

1809
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,640
you know the hub or something you know.

1810
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,000
Well well I get what you're saying but I think you're even overthinking.

1811
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,240
I think just take what you're doing now.

1812
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:15,200
I mean it's just unpolished is the thing if you just spent more time working on the comics

1813
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:19,840
that you'd already made if you just really tried to iron them out more than than you put them out.

1814
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,400
Here's the thing.

1815
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,720
I feel like there'd be way more successful you know.

1816
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,680
Here's the thing.

1817
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,920
I don't think I agree with you.

1818
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,000
And maybe yeah maybe this is ego talking.

1819
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:35,520
I don't think I need to get any better.

1820
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:37,920
Like I don't think I need to.

1821
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,200
Wait Ben you are aware that I was making a joke.

1822
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:41,680
Wait what?

1823
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:46,320
That I was saying you had to make the comics perfect.

1824
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,600
Oh sorry.

1825
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,320
That was obviously bad advice.

1826
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,920
You're like I hear what you're saying.

1827
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,760
I understand what you're trying to say.

1828
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,680
Oh okay yeah you know what I was um that's that's me just that's just the tism.

1829
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,960
That's just the tism talking.

1830
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,560
Yeah um.

1831
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,840
Continue what were you saying.

1832
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,400
Anyway I was just saying like well I mean now my I was objecting to a

1833
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,040
complaint that you didn't actually make sincerely so.

1834
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:14,880
Cool.

1835
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,200
I mean there's like I don't yeah I don't I don't know.

1836
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:26,160
Say maybe maybe maybe if things you know maybe it could fucking maybe it could be like

1837
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:31,200
have built up more of an audience have some fucking storyboarding job at some

1838
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:37,680
animation studio or something uh probably be a lot more it would probably get me more ahead

1839
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:44,080
like in societally wise uh I mean I think I think I have all it's a frustrating because I think

1840
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:49,600
I have all the skills like I think I could easily do something like that that would make me like

1841
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:55,520
much better known much more of like a you know an industry guy like much better connected

1842
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:03,040
much more successful generally um so I'm simultaneously frustrated but that didn't

1843
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:09,360
happen but also I don't even know if I want that anyway I feel both negative emotions

1844
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:13,520
at the same time for conflicting reasons that contradict one another.

1845
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:20,240
We went into productivity as an idea last episode pretty significantly that was a

1846
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:27,040
it was a pretty big section of the episode and I feel it like related to this and and and sort of

1847
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:34,000
like picking what your what what you want to do with your life I feel like having clarity

1848
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,920
on issues is something really big that one can easily lose sight of when they're freelancing

1849
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:45,760
and they have so many options before them and it can feel I think we've talked about this before

1850
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:54,320
me and you but like it can feel like you're doing so much stuff but like you aren't you aren't actually

1851
01:46:54,320 --> 01:47:02,240
doing that much when you when you sit down and actually analyze what you're doing it can seem

1852
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:08,720
almost like you aren't doing anything in a way uh it just feels like when things are undefined

1853
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:15,040
they feel more uh what's the word they they feel more oppressive than they are actually

1854
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:20,320
when you have vaguely defined work it can sort of feel uh like there's so much of it when in

1855
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,400
fact it's it's not that it's a lot of it it's just that you don't really know what you're

1856
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:29,200
supposed to be doing exactly at a good moment and the reason I bring this up is because I feel like

1857
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:36,000
when we have varied works like we do now uh me and you we have so many different things that we

1858
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,320
could be working on we could be working on in the store we could be working on quick drive

1859
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:42,400
can be working on the pcp we could be working on our own individual stuff you have like a thousand

1860
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:50,000
different things you could do and it that can be very paralyzing that can be very very like well

1861
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,480
and the thing about me is that I'm prone to paralysis yeah it's just realable palsy yeah I'm

1862
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:05,680
I'm serious I'm heavily prone to to paralysis and stuff I completely understand yeah I I uh

1863
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:12,640
there's been some developments in my life and I've sat down and I've tried to cut as many

1864
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:17,760
things from my life as humanly possible and I've sat down and thought myself what are the things

1865
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:24,800
I care about doing online I just went I just went through and thought that the things that I want

1866
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,360
to do with my time what do I want to do with my time and I've come back with a very simple

1867
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:38,640
short list rck endless war quick draw the pcp and personal art like commissions and stuff like

1868
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:45,760
that those are the things I care about doing and before it was sort of like yeah I mean obviously

1869
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,320
right like those the biggest things in my life it's not like I have another project that's running

1870
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:56,080
but even just the the the sort of vague like should I be making a new podcast series right now

1871
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:04,640
should I not be just even like the the the the vagueness even in an abstract uh like potential

1872
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:10,880
way of like maybe I should be doing something more was causing me to to have paralysis in a way

1873
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:17,120
work paralysis and I also cut down stuff like discord servers and I've tried to leave as much

1874
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:21,440
as I can and just try to I haven't been spending a lot I haven't spending a lot less time on

1875
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:27,440
discord lately yeah uh I uh I haven't been on social media long since I've deleted all that

1876
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:34,400
to my friend I'm just trying to listen your brain is always gonna want to do stupid shit your brain

1877
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:40,000
is always going to want to uh do stuff that's easiest and that requires a little amount of work

1878
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,640
so you have to construct the world around you to be make it impossible you can't okay you know

1879
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:52,000
you have twitter on your phone you say yourself I will go on twitter um I just won't go on twitter

1880
01:49:52,000 --> 01:50:00,560
anymore uh you're retarded that won't ever happen you need to have actual systems in a place to

1881
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,880
incentivize that behavior because if you're not changing the system then why would you think that

1882
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:13,040
you would get a different result you need to either you know like delete it outright which is what I

1883
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:19,360
did or at least come up with like a different like like come up with different ways that your brain

1884
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,440
wants to interact with twitter maybe do it at a specific time when you've deemed it's valuable

1885
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:29,040
or just you know like you can't just say things will be different that's not self-control that's

1886
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:33,040
cowardice and retardation yes my two favorite things

1887
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:46,080
so I found it very very eye-opening and helpful to just sort of like define what I want to do with

1888
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:51,360
my with my work and be able to think you know there's not actually that much to do you know

1889
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,080
there's only a few projects I want to work on that's not that bad maybe I'll work on quick

1890
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:00,160
try today well maybe I'll work in rck today I mean it's part it's part of the reason I haven't been

1891
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:08,080
as active in in rfck is because like you know I I mean I don't want to talk I've said this a lot

1892
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:12,240
before but like you know I realized like I really had this fucking vapor's three thing hanging over

1893
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:16,880
my head for a long time time to fucking time to fucking put things aside and deal with that

1894
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:23,840
just for my own sanity's sake I'm interested I'm interested at the same thing that I've done

1895
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:28,240
would benefit you in a way because again you have a thousand you have a thousand different

1896
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:33,840
things you could be doing is there any is there any ones that you think that you should be spending

1897
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:39,680
more time on are there any like you think you would benefit from like removing some of the gunk

1898
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:44,640
from your mind and just trying to streamline the process of okay I'm going to re-evaluate

1899
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:48,000
what I'm doing I'm only going to be working on these this this and this do you think that would

1900
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:56,880
be helpful for you well it already has been oh oh have have you done that or what what ones

1901
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:02,960
was it just vapor's three that you're yeah that's the only that's the only thing I'm focusing on

1902
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:09,520
these days um which is the right thing to do and I should have done it a lot sooner

1903
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:15,840
and I think it's this way it'll be and I think do I have a sketchbook no a schedule like not

1904
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,400
and I don't mean the sense that you uh regiment every single hour of your day I just mean uh do you

1905
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:29,680
have like do you have a bedtime do you have a wake up time no I've taken it was been very very

1906
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:36,160
motivating in this way uh that he's sort of uh made me think he he too has a bedtime and uh I

1907
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:40,720
thought it was very appealing and I've finally actually done it uh I've got I've given myself

1908
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:44,480
a bedtime which I'm sadly going to be breaking to record this show but you know it's the break

1909
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:51,360
yeah rules are meant to be broken exactly but I've actually uh it feels weird to wake up

1910
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:57,200
in the morning yeah it feels very unnatural for me but uh also very good because it feels like

1911
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:05,040
oh my god it's two o'clock and I've been awake for like an hour already oh my god yeah yeah yeah

1912
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,920
yeah I know I know that feeling the feeling of like I got up early my day feels so much longer

1913
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:17,040
but the possibilities are endless um yeah yeah yeah I mean okay now this might not be the best

1914
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:26,160
but it's been working well enough uh I have no bedtime I have no schedule or anything I have

1915
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:33,520
just kind of been like I'm just gonna stay up until the next page is done and I'm just not going to

1916
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:39,120
sleep until it is I mean I don't always get a whole page done in the day or anything it's I've

1917
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:46,400
been getting maybe like one every two or three days lately um but you know they are getting done

1918
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:52,240
under that system so give me give me an overview of the of a day in the life I've been saying

1919
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:58,640
like well like well like what's what's the overview look like uh you you wake up do you

1920
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:05,600
immediately just like get on your computer and start drawing or yeah well I'll get on my computer

1921
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:12,800
and I'll either start drawing or I'll like I don't know play some Gungeon or something okay um and

1922
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:18,160
it's pretty much I mean it's pretty much just alternating I mean it's pretty much just alternating

1923
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:26,480
between like playing Gungeon or whatever game du jour uh you know looking at like social media

1924
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:32,240
stuff and and drawing and like I just I get bored of one and I switch to the other and the cycle

1925
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:39,440
repeats forever until until you collapse or until you get a page and you're finally allowing

1926
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:45,280
yourself to sleep yes that's right that's that's it that's it that's pretty much it's all there is

1927
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:53,120
to it do you feel like social media do you feel like social media impact like is bad at all because

1928
01:54:53,120 --> 01:55:00,880
I doubt it I don't I don't actually spend that much time um on social media really I mean I'll

1929
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,400
like I'll scroll through my Twitter for you maybe like once or twice a day uh oh it's

1930
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:12,880
funny huge I mean well I used to I used to be on discord more and I would spend more time you know

1931
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:20,800
scrolling through that um not as much anymore that that discord was more of a time sink than

1932
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:30,320
like Twitter was by far yeah uh it feels so good I I I can now see every server I'm in just like I

1933
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:34,640
don't have to scroll I can't scroll anymore I still have to scroll but I just have tons and

1934
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:42,480
tons of notifications that I'll never read Jesus yeah there's so much like you rck is terrible

1935
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:50,160
that side servers yeah there's just so much shit you have to be in yeah yeah there is there's some

1936
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:55,920
stuff that like you want to be in not even just rck but just in general I mean I'd like to in a

1937
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,560
perfect world I'd be in everything sure but like it's like there's a lot of the servers where it's

1938
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:10,800
like yeah I wish I posted there but like I'm not going to realistically and it even being here is

1939
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:16,080
just another decision that I'll have to make to go in there or not to go in there and just another

1940
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:21,920
like again going back to streamlining just another thing that could possibly lead me to just having

1941
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:31,200
the choice overload just like literally like like there is I think a noticeable difference or like

1942
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:37,920
like impact on your life just even just having one more choice like a discord server I think it

1943
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:43,840
makes a genuine impact on your life to have clutter in the form of like your room is messy

1944
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:49,920
or like your your discord things are messy and it can just feel like uh again there's just so much

1945
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,920
to do uh you aren't uh you aren't fully dedicated to even just a few tasks you can just feel like

1946
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:03,280
you're you're if your room is messy your life is messy it's my motto well my room's a fucking

1947
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:12,960
disaster so yeah mine too lol well um well I don't know I'm thinking about cleaning my room

1948
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:19,280
lately uh probably could do that um I'm cooking I've been cooking a bunch

1949
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:24,080
ooh have you that's very human cordy bin that's a that's a that's a betrayal of your character

1950
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:31,520
I don't know I don't know if it is uh well maybe a little bit um I mean my cooking generally is

1951
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:38,960
about being as efficient as possible um it's about you know getting getting the right macromutrients

1952
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:46,720
um you know fat specifically doing that doing me and Arlo you know doing our keto thing yeah yeah

1953
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:53,520
two together me and Arlo should go on a keto day oh dude bins oh well now that's a guy who won't

1954
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,200
let you down you you say collaborating with people is always a nightmare collaborate with Arlo and

1955
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:04,960
do the keto podcast and you'll be fine oh you can come with some pun for keto kermit or something

1956
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:12,960
that effect the the only the only show dedicated to puppets and being keto keto kermit yeah yeah

1957
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:18,800
yeah I mean that's a very niche audience but I think it's one that's been crying out yeah well yeah

1958
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:28,880
it's it's um it's um like like the the silent majority you know yeah totally um okay I'm probably

1959
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,160
going to die to this mimic I'm really fucking up I think they're still not killed or the rat I've

1960
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:42,640
only gotten to him once um come on Ben oh and I yep I died I died to the mimic okay yeah it's hard

1961
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:49,200
it's hard it's a lot harder to play when you're talking but that's fine um okay what was I gonna

1962
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:58,400
say oh yeah I make uh I I undertook a project the other day and I made a cauliflower crust pizza

1963
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:08,160
and it came out pretty good um yeah but it took forever okay the real problem was that I don't

1964
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:15,360
have a food processor all I have is a blender and it was a nightmare blending the cauliflower into

1965
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:21,600
like like ricing it in a blender I I don't think I will even though the results were good and I was

1966
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:29,520
pleased with them and it was a great pizza um I won't do it again because I without a food processor

1967
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:39,040
it is a it is a nightmare yeah like blending it's it's just not made it's it's just not made to do it um

1968
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:48,720
sad sad I I've been dying to cook again but my kitchen for like two months since before I left

1969
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:52,960
the last like to go to Boston last trip and since I've gone back my kitchen has been

1970
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:59,200
fucked and like it like it is it's there was mold found during a dishwasher and some sort of

1971
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:03,600
inspection and now that we just haven't had any stove the only thing in the kitchen that's worked

1972
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:09,040
is our fridge and it's just been a complete like uh construction wasteland for literal months

1973
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:14,000
and I haven't been to cook and I've just had I've just had to eat fucking Chipotle every day

1974
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:21,280
oh what a nightmare I know it is it literally is what a disaster um let's get those keto bowls

1975
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:28,880
let's get those lifestyle bowls no no no no no I listen I'm overloaded on ketones as it is if I

1976
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:35,680
have any more than I might brist that's the life that is the life god I just want to swap keto

1977
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:42,880
notes with Arlo that's a that's a that's a perfect day for me I don't know if I told you but you uh

1978
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:49,680
you've you've you've scored a victory uh a long time ago actually uh I haven't I even I've canceled

1979
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:54,960
my hello fresh a long long time ago even before my kitchen broke oh was that why because of me

1980
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:59,200
no not because of you of course not yeah I don't want to any of your advice

1981
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:04,400
sure uh why it's it's it's because I I've outgrown it I know how to cook on my own I don't need

1982
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:08,560
anymore it's like I've always said it's it's it's a beginner's it's a crutch from when you first

1983
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:15,280
started out okay well fair enough all right well good um that's good then I guess you got something

1984
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:20,960
out of it I did uh but unfortunately I didn't get enough out of it because my fucking kitchen's broken

1985
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:27,120
god damn it you know a real man can cook without a kitchen real man just lights a fire in the back

1986
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:33,920
yeah it's room yeah it's a room yeah real man just uh a real man just uh just burns like a fire in

1987
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:41,120
his trash can and just like roasts roast hot dogs over him man god you know hello fresh might be

1988
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:49,760
too human core for me but instacart is the best uh instacart I just I don't I don't gotta go shopping

1989
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:55,840
I feel like one like 90 bucks 90 bucks one time for a whole year of like I never have to go shopping

1990
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:05,120
it is that's pretty good it's so good do I feel bad because uh for the poor people that have to

1991
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:11,120
like actually deliver the groceries for what I can only assume is a complete shithole gig economy

1992
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:17,920
style job with no benefits and probably just getting just exploited the fuck right out yep

1993
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,640
but you know what it's not my problem

1994
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:30,160
open oh oh oh uh open I mean it's not like if I I mean it's not like if I didn't do it

1995
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:36,240
it's not like if I didn't engage in this hideous system known as capitalism that these people

1996
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:41,520
would be better off because they don't have me getting them to go out and buy my fucking groceries

1997
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:48,320
for me thanks um so whatever don't even worry about it just don't even worry about it just close

1998
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:53,440
your eyes just don't think about it they love it they want it I'll give it to them free

1999
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:02,880
I mentioned earlier uh I was asking you about about if the seasons impact your life and those

2000
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:08,000
is very very very specific reason they ask this because this summer you're shaping up to be another

2001
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,440
year or a summer of pain as it was last time you mentioned this yeah you said that I'm not too

2002
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:19,040
on a recent pcp you said this was going to be another summer of pain uh and uh it's it's fully

2003
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:24,720
locked in that I'm going to be traveling all over the place and I just came back from a trip up to

2004
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:30,480
la now trips at the la for me are not anything particularly special in it other than the selves

2005
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:36,880
uh it's you know I go up to la somewhat regularly but for this was for a um very special purpose

2006
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:42,320
you see as I alluded to uh before um talking about code for boston uh I was I was given an

2007
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:48,320
opportunity where I thought if I can somehow finagle if I can get some some people with social

2008
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:54,800
clout to play in this war then uh then all would just be fucking golden uh and and this the opportunity

2009
02:03:54,800 --> 02:04:02,400
came to me in the form my mother asked me to attend a world premiere of a independent movie in

2010
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:07,840
los angeles and to my honesty I don't really know why I thought I was gonna be able to talk to anyone

2011
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:14,320
who would want to play in this war but to me the calculation was simply people in one place

2012
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:20,560
they like movies so they might be nerds maybe I can somehow talk to someone uh who would uh

2013
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:27,040
just like be like hey it's me I'm a big I'm a higher up at EA and I'm attending this la uh yeah

2014
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:33,440
this this uh you know this this event and then I can be like well well mr EA I tune a video game

2015
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:40,080
and would you for a chance want to play me for an afternoon or two and hopefully he would say yes

2016
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:46,400
but anyway you know he's not fucking yes yeah yeah you yeah listen EA I feel like our business model

2017
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:50,800
is very similar to what EA would have demanded of us you know it's completely ringing our audience

2018
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:55,200
cash in this war is the most profitable thing we've done in our entire lives

2019
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:01,120
and I wouldn't have it any other way uh as soon as that bottom line as soon as the bottom line

2020
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:11,600
falls out of endless war it's canceled um yeah I I uh I so so I go up there and it's a fucking

2021
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:17,680
arduous four-hour drive as it always is because LA is shit traffic um so I know by the way LA is

2022
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:24,640
like the worst city on earth like no one lives in LA I'm just convinced that it's like a joke or

2023
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:30,000
perhaps I'm sort of like prank people come out and like like say that they got me after a while

2024
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:37,520
you approach LA there are no roads there are only highways there's no like you know you get in there

2025
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:42,560
there's some surface streets but it's all just they all just lead in highways you approach the city

2026
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:47,920
there's just a bunch of drab gray buildings in the distance they're just sucking life out of you

2027
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,720
sucking all the color out of life as you approach them there are no lights on you pass by apartment

2028
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:56,320
after apartment there are no people in those apartments they're just they're just out there's

2029
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:59,600
some sort of like building quota they have to keep up so it's like it's like the town of city

2030
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:06,000
yeah exactly um it's it's like that one north korean city i'm a dmz that there's no one in but

2031
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,280
they just want to make it seem like there are people there so the so people in south korea will

2032
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:14,640
affect and that there's actual people living in north korea uh it's complete far since i've

2033
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:18,720
been real is that a real thing that sounds like a real thing you just it is a real thing yeah it is

2034
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:26,320
okay yeah excellent uh it's a fucking nightmare and i hate LA uh but that's that's that's my impression

2035
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:36,560
of you but opposite uh got him so so we're inviting this premiere my my friends are my mom's friend

2036

2037
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:49,680
normalizing it um we go to the chinese theater i will speak of gay people i just want to once again

2038
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:56,160

02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:11,600
something similar i saw it really well kind of he me i just saw him on twitter um like yesterday i

2042
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:17,440

2043
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:26,560
we spend too much money on endless wars oh and that was very offensive to me um well hey funny

2044

2070
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:54,400
literally why i signed up that's what you get that's what you get for getting involved in your

2071
02:09:54,400 --> 02:10:00,000
community fucking idiot it is it's literally disincentivizing it's literally like i won't go to

2077
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:38,480
is probably like obviously not the case because why would it be but it seems to be like okay there's

2093
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,600
heart so i might die um my weapons are pretty oh i was i was saying that i was going up to a

2094
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:13,360
film premiere to this shit fucking movie okay right yeah yeah was there more to that yeah oh

2095
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:22,000
ben okay i haven't even started with this movie uh i know so we go to the chinese theater ground

2096
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,840
chinese theater sure little in fact the theming of it being a chinese theater stop starts and stops

2097
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:33,360
at the entrance yeah it just it looks like a mall i'm the inside yeah uh it sounds about right

2098
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:41,440
uh a nightmare uh we go and we get our seats uh the the the the attendant at the start says uh

2099
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:47,600
if you gotta go back and go to the bathroom now uh it's a long movie and uh i listened but i thought

2100
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:53,440
how long can this movie be really long yeah really really really really really really long

2101
02:12:53,440 --> 02:13:02,560
how long uh it is often said by by me even uh me especially i often describe things as nightmares

2102
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:08,240
yes and and well that's you know it's easy to do they pick that up from you who picked that up from

2103
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:16,640
did i say that too i i i i think maybe you from me i don't know doesn't matter okay anyway it's

2104
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:21,920
a very common thing to say i guess and i'm tempted to say that but i would describe it more in a

2105
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:27,600
literal sense it wasn't a nightmare and since it was bad like overly bad even though it was it was a

2106
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:37,200
it was dreamlike in a lot of ways you know how dreams have quote unquote stories but it's just

2107
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:42,160
sort of one long continuous your brain is constantly coming up scene after scene after scene

2108
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:49,280
there's no beginning middle or end it's just one like like like it just is continuously going along

2109
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:54,880
it's almost like an improv comic in a way yeah it just is just it's just continuously developing

2110
02:13:54,880 --> 02:14:00,160
in weird haphazard ways that don't connect to with one another and just seemingly endlessly until

2111
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:04,800
you wake up and you wake up in a cold sweat that's what this movie is like genuine it's

2112
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:09,760
wait so the movie was like yeah this is what the movie was okay i wasn't sure if you were

2113
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:15,600
describing the movie or your experience of going to this theater no no the the movie itself though

2114
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:19,680
i guess it could be said for the overall experience for going to the theater because in itself it was

2115
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:27,440
a nightmare but i'm going to uh i'm going to uh say the the movie title was the turnover and it's

2116
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:35,760
on imdb right now you can go you can go to turnover is it about is it about the pastry indeed um well

2117
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:44,640
it's sort about the pastry oh what you have to understand is that okay this is a it says on

2118
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:51,760
here that it is uh two hours uh it felt like it was way longer so i like to the point where like i

2119
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:57,520
don't believe that this could possibly be true like it can be like oh well i just thought the

2120
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:03,840
movie was really long but it's so it felt so long to the fact that like i like there's no way it was

2121
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:09,520
two hours that feels like it's impossible with the amount of time that i was there watching it that

2122
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:15,280
you just there's no way that you possibly compute but um even though it is two hours which is long

2123
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:21,520
on its own it felt like it was longer in the editing bay and it was cut down to be two hours

2124
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:30,080
so there's so much that's like implied to have happened or to be a character trait

2125
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:35,680
for instance i'll give you the part of the movie in a second here yeah but it's about a restaurant

2126
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:41,120
owner and at one point the restaurant owner rebrands his restaurant and one of his employee he

2127
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:47,600
renames it and he gives it a new logo and one of the characters the waitress um says i thought i

2128
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:53,040
threw that design out implying a lot of things implying she's an artist implying she might have

2129
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:56,720
you know she might be perfectionist in a way she might you know she might be down herself and might

2130
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:01,680
not think that her good enough and and there might have been a scene where the restaurant owner

2131
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:06,880
pete finds a design in the trash or something and it has a you know a moment where he's like

2132
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:10,400
this this girl's too hard on herself i'm gonna i'm gonna make things right i'm gonna make sure

2133
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:16,960
she knows that she's cool um literally not mentioned once the woman is an artist never

2134
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:22,720
mentioned again not even like just so many things are just like implied to be you know

2135
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:27,920
it's taken for great like yeah you know this girl draws i guess i guess that's something she does

2136
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:34,400
this can be said for every character every plot point every just aspect of the story just like

2137
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:39,760
things are supposed to be just you know you just get it like a dream there's no explanation for

2138
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:44,480
things it's just like i guess this is how things are i guess this is just like what is happening

2139
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:48,320
right now um sounds a little like the vapors honestly

2140
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:56,080
ben why would you say that about yourself well i mean there's not a lot of like explanation

2141
02:16:56,080 --> 02:17:02,800
about stuff stuff it like vapors is just like a series of things that happen right that they're

2142
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:09,440
all around a central idea okay maybe maybe i'm maybe i'm not maybe i'm not getting what you're

2143
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:16,240
saying because it doesn't this doesn't sound like a bad thing that you're describing maybe it doesn't

2144
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:24,560
sound like a bad thing in concept but it was a very confusing film in a lot of ways i just i don't

2145
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:28,800
mean to imply that it just because it was a goon coonsverk and that everything didn't lead back to

2146
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:35,600
a central theme it was bad or that because it was like a sort of sliced life in a way that that was

2147
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:43,840
bad yeah it's it's that it felt like it didn't know what to like what it was or what it was trying to

2148
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:48,960
accomplish on the surface of it it's like supposed to be like a character study in a way of the

2149
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:56,720
restaurant owner pete but it's just you know i almost want to say that you just have to watch it

2150
02:17:56,720 --> 02:18:03,680
and you would understand what i'm trying to say sure and uh it's it's just you can't was it just

2151
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:08,880
didn't accomplish anything it did not accomplish in making me like any of the characters having any

2152
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:15,680
memorable dialogue it did not accomplish having even like the semblance of a storyline or the

2153
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:22,800
semblance of stakes in any way that you just felt like sort of an arbitrary series of things that

2154
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:28,240
happens exactly exactly where it's like it didn't feel like one led into the other it didn't feel

2155
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:34,320
like it was uh progressing in any way the the vapor is like sure it doesn't have it like a story

2156
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:42,080
per se but and well understand what's happening and damn it yeah okay so was it just like confusing

2157
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:46,880
were you just confused what yeah that that is the afterwards that is the afterwards that it was just

2158
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:52,160
confusing in in every way i didn't get what it was trying to do i didn't get what the characters

2159
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:59,040
were trying to do uh i didn't understand the point of the fucking movie at all um to get into

2160
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:04,400
more specifically i will read the indb cafe owner peter at least his disgruntled manager

2161
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:09,440
henry to take care of business instead he hires a crew of misfits peter returns to an

2162
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:13,680
unrecognizable business but soon learns of the value of camaraderie with his new team

2163
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:20,320
it's about family it's about family literally literally it's about family okay he's sick yeah

2164
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:27,920
i mean i love camaraderie personally maybe i'm maybe i'm this movie's target demographic

2165
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:33,280
yeah you just don't care about family or camaraderie that's that's your problem

2166
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,880
so what i'm going to describe the movie and you may think that doesn't sound that bad

2167
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:47,760
yeah but keep in mind i am heavily condensing things because i don't want to be here for an hour

2168
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:54,480
explaining each scene that just happens and there's no rhyme or reason for it and there's no

2169
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:59,040
like it adds nothing to the structure of the film it just is like a plot point that just

2170
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:06,640
you know just happens for no reason so the gist of the movie there's this old dude named peter

2171
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:12,560
who owns a restaurant and a twink named henry who is who is his affiliate

2172
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:21,200
partner in crime partner in crime i suppose in a way not incredibly well defined what's

2173
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:26,640
going on there he's like the waiter and the chef and like the like everything else as well

2174
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:32,880
he just like runs the entire business sure um and uh he's disgruntled for for because he doesn't

2175
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:39,840
feel like his potential has been lived up to so he forces peter to make a uh a new franchise

2176
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,960
yeah well and he is the manager of this is wait what kind of a restaurant is this that's like

2177
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:51,200
a little cafe it's like a french restaurant it doesn't really matter okay um it uh and and and

2178
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:58,320
so peter agrees by the way this entire movie wants to treat peter like he's an asshole and

2179
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:03,600
peter's the main character right yeah peter's the main character he's the old dude yeah and they

2180
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:08,080
want to like the entire movie like the conceit of the movie is that like it's a character

2181
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:13,600
art he's a character study of peter and how he learns to accept his eventual crew of myths

2182
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:19,600
fits for who they are yeah and it he wants to portray him as stubborn he's not portrayed that way

2183
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:25,120
as all except for in dialogue where people are belittling him and berating him like saying like

2184
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:30,800
don't be some stubborn peter yeah and he and he's like oh yeah i don't know like i'm sorry i guess

2185
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:39,520
you're right sorry and okay oh shit oh fuck okay yeah i could see uh you can see how that would be

2186
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:44,080
annoying that's just one of the many things where it's like yeah it's implied in dialogue to be the

2187
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:52,320
case but it's it just isn't it just is not the case you're on team peter oh oh i'm white dude

2188
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:58,480
i could not be more on team peter unfortunately it turns into a pussy later but that's you know

2189
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:09,360
that's it you know sweet yes um then his evil ex-wife comes into frame his ex-wife is a frequent

2190
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:13,840
character but each time she's a completely different person so for her first appearance

2191
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:22,400
she is unbelievable like corolla de vil evil yeah um and comes in what did she do um okay i'm

2192
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:27,120
going to get to it um but she also introduced like else in that scene is introduced my favorite

2193
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:34,800
character in the show all right in the movie who is peter's son and peter son is played completely

2194
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:41,040
straight like he's on the andy griffith show where he says to flake ah gee pops like can i

2195
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:50,880
go to my friends huh can i can i completely isn't a child actor he's like 13 he's not even young

2196
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:58,720
okay he he's like a teenager who is like pops i'm so happy to see you again i'm you know you

2197
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:03,520

2198
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:10,240

2199
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:16,400
what you were that's what you were like don't you remember oh gee whiz oh gee whiz did you golly

2200
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:23,920
uh beautiful and it's like that in every single scene by the way this is one of the scenes that

2201
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:29,440
don't matter and isn't uh you know like like um expanded upon it anyway so i'm just gonna mention

2202
02:23:29,440 --> 02:23:34,160
it here at one point he's rocking back and forth during a conversation with uh between peter and

2203
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:40,640
his ex-wife um and he shot almost like a horror movie fourth and just cut between him rocking him

2204
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:46,320
back and forth with a knife in his hands and them talking and then eventually he falls out of the

2205
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:52,240
of the chair and stabs someone else on accident and then like that like peter just takes the guy to

2206
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:59,040
the hospital and like that's the end of the scene like he's just fine no he's like he just like stabbed

2207
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:05,920
someone and that's like not a plot point wait just stabs someone why does he just stab wait with

2208
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:12,160
what i'm sorry i was i was see i'm being attacked by a beholder right now okay i understand um can

2209
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:16,720
you can you repeat can you repeat some yeah yeah they're just in a restaurant they're in

2210
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:22,000
peter's restaurant yeah uh peter and his ex-wife are talking his son's rocking back and forth in a

2211
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:28,160
chair with a butter knife in his hand and i'm dead okay he falls out of the chair yeah and he stabs

2212
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:35,520
a patron one of the staff with this butter knife he's bleeding and like that's like never brought

2213
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:40,560
up it's just like he starts to bleed peter says i i take him to the hospital he takes him to the

2214
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:46,400
hospital and like that he stabs him on purpose well not on purpose but it's a mishap and he says

2215
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:53,920
oh gee i like i'm really sorry okay well so it's like oh wait i you haven't seen the room i was

2216
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:59,200
going to compare it to the scenes did you know that in the room there are like not one but two

2217
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:04,960
scenes where they're just tossing the old pigskin around and someone just falls on someone else

2218
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:11,920
for no reason is is that the case yeah there's i think they're tossing the pigskin and but there's

2219
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:19,280
a lot of pigskin tossing yeah is that the term they use as well i don't think so but they might as

2220
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:24,800
well there's one where mark just like they're just they're just like laughing and then like he just

2221
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:30,240
like from no reason just falls on another guy like just from a perfectly balanced standing

2222
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:35,520
position yeah yeah yeah yeah um and there's another one too i don't remember when the second one

2223
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:45,200
happens but there's at least two okay so okay so it's just a weird accident just it well let's

2224
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:49,920
think about let's think critically did they just not have a was it just a way to end the scene

2225
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:56,320
like did they just want to end the scene and didn't know why didn't didn't know how to do it okay it

2226
02:25:56,320 --> 02:26:03,920
in in okay i think it might okay okay the only thing i can think is that setting up the idea

2227
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:11,280
that there's a hospital in the city for later oh good okay see that's world that's a way that's

2228
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:16,000
world-building look it up sometime that's the only thing i can think because later the hospital is

2229
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:22,560
relevant but completely unrelated to the incident and that is not important does he like meet a

2230
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:31,920
character at the hospital when he goes to drop this knife no wound victim no okay okay um not no

2231
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:38,720
not at all uh but anyway back back to the back to the chronological order see um evil wife demands

2232
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:43,520
that this literal child is the manager of the new franchise for his restaurant instead of Henry

2233
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:49,920
this literal 13 year old g whiz who's Henry Henry is the old manager yeah yeah he's the

2234
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:54,240
tweak manager who's who's disgruntled and feels like he should be behind the booth instead of out

2235
02:26:54,240 --> 02:27:01,520
there and you know at mice like the proletariat yeah okay i'm with them i think i'm on team Henry

2236
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:08,640
yeah everyone post in the comments are you are you hashtag team peter hashtag team Henry um don't

2237
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:14,480
be don't be team pete because pete bootages wants to bring an end to endless war oh i can imagine i

2238
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:19,520
think i think is i have no idea what his name is his name is something like something stupid like

2239
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:25,440
like pete pastry or like pete pierre or something in the fact no his name is not pete pastry it can't

2240
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:33,760
might as well be can't possibly might as well be pete pastry um and and and so that's like a name

2241
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:42,080
that like jk rowling that's like a jk rowling name but like the laziest jk rowling character ever

2242
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:51,760
um so okay the scene is like the the the start of the entire plot and here and the wife just says

2243
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:57,760
like make Henry or i'm sorry don't make Henry the new manager make our son who's a literal baby

2244
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:07,360
the manager and peter says no i mean why and then the scene ends uh also to emphasize how how evil

2245
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:13,040
the x y face she says that she like he'll never see the sun again if he doesn't make the sun the

2246
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:22,640
the man how how would that work which i don't know so and so this is obviously leading to like like

2247
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:26,960
then you know the plot of the movie comes in and she there's like a custody battle or something

2248
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:37,040
you know obviously no okay no no all right uh and so like pete just he is on vacation now i

2249
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:40,960
don't want to emphasize the fact that he like it's not like pete says like oh i need to break from

2250
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:47,600
this i'm on vacation now there's that scene i just described smash cut to him in a sailboat

2251
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:53,520
looking at the sun gleefully smash cut back to the restaurant and like it's only revealed later

2252
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:58,960
that he's on like vacation and for like an extended period of time he's been on vacation this whole

2253
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:03,760
this whole time is what is what you're saying no no i'm saying that like he starts vacation

2254
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:09,200
just not announced to the audience that what he's doing or for like a reason

2255
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:16,160
really it's not like he's particularly in like hot water right now or he wants to get away

2256
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:21,680
it's just like again like again it's just so confusing like he okay smash cut him in the in a

2257
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:26,800
sailboat hey he's on vacation right now he could just be sailing i don't know why i would imagine

2258
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:32,320
that he is now like off of work for like a week and a half like what is actually happening

2259
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:37,520
or why i'm just expected to know that but anyway the ex-wife just tells henry that peter agreed

2260
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:44,160
and so peter or i'm sorry now now henry takes it upon himself to hire a bunch of literally

2261
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:49,600
mentally deficient people and minorities in order to make the restaurant go belly up in

2262
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:56,480
order to spite peter that's the plot of the of the of the story is is henry just now is like

2263
02:29:56,480 --> 02:30:02,800
full just like like listen if i can't be kasey green i'll kill kasey green because my thoughts

2264
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:12,160
exactly um yeah okay wait so this is like supposed to be like the actual like plot of the story

2265
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:16,480
is like you know again it's a story about family it's a story about you know peter coming to

2266
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:21,840
determine with this class of misfits that that henry hires this is like an hour into the movie

2267
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:31,040
okay good yeah yeah yeah all right i'm with you he hires two what's the problem like like mentally

2268
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:39,280
disabled people unironically yeah um an old lady just a girl who i guess is that yeah even the worst

2269
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:45,280
of all yeah yeah yeah yeah and and a black guy and a mexican guy and like that's like that's like the

2270
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:50,480
crew of misfits that he's acquired here that's the crew of like like it's it's what a what a color

2271
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:55,360
what a colorful cast of characters i'm sorry you're not allowed to say colored anymore yeah um

2272
02:30:56,080 --> 02:31:03,600
just like like normal people basically yeah okay um by the way i'm not about to send you a picture

2273
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:09,440
of of henry just like you know what he looks like um this is you in about uh 12 years ago

2274
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:19,760
no yeah no all right i'll show it there it is yeah there's me there's me

2275
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:26,000
he's super killer he's such he's such a killer yeah not enough killers wear cowboy hats

2276
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:32,640
um we gotta do something about it so the next couple scenes are frankly indescribable

2277
02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:39,360
henry leaves the misfits in charge of the restaurant and like bad things happen question mark

2278
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:48,160
yeah literally describe it i literally cannot describe like some people come to the cafe but it's

2279
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:55,680
like oh by the way this entire movie is shot indoors it's there's never a scene of them outside

2280
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:59,280
except for that aforementioned shot of the hint of peter outside sailing

2281
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:12,640
literally not a single shot outside good wait yeah uh hmm i mean i want to clarify it's the same

2282
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:18,320
building and the building is a small cafe so just feels like you're in the same place over and over

2283
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:25,600
again every single scene as you are that's a nightmare did you die again no i didn't die

2284
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:32,080
i just i fucked up and i don't have enough keys for the ugliet the ugliet is a side level

2285
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:40,320
by the way i okay one in one ear out the other okay fine um you know what this might be i might

2286
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:45,040
be able to make up the difference uh and you're fine and finally kill the rat like you've always

2287
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:52,000
been destined to do i mean maybe that's the plan possible that's that's that's that's the plan

2288
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:56,960
um all right i want to speed this up because i won't be talking about this movie forever

2289
02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:01,280
anyway there's just a bunch of scenes of the of the of the new crew just fucking up and being

2290
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:07,440
stupid uh in ways that are confusing and ill-conceived and also not really well portrayed in the audience

2291
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:13,840
peter comes back and is just like like upset that his restaurant has been turned upside down and like

2292
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:18,720
it's been on the twist turned upside down yeah and none of these people have any experience in the

2293
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:24,960
restaurant uh scene uh and this is treated as peter being unreasonable and everyone in the

2294
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:29,760
all the crew is like for instance there's this one line that's delivered when peter comes in and

2295
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:34,000
says like guys like what's going on here like you're supposed to be making french cuisine

2296
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:39,200
and then one of the misfits says i'm sandal i'm i relate to him thus far

2297
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,600
uh there's a lot you don't know about around here peter there's a lot you don't know about around

2298
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:50,240
here it's his restaurant wait what yes yes he says you're supposed to be making french cuisine

2299
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:59,200
and the response is there's a lot you don't know about around here yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah

2300
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:04,160
so this gun so this gun that i'd have it um it just summons sharks from the ground

2301
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:11,360
really yeah like it it's it shoots out a little like shark fin that sort of like floats along the

2302
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:15,520
floor and then when it hits an enemy just a giant fucking jaws comes out and eats them

2303
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:21,840
it's sick okay that's just i just want you to know what's going on for the audience i've literally

2304
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:25,200
by the way viewers in case you couldn't tell i can literally cannot see bin screen he doesn't have

2305
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:30,320
screen sure on and i don't care it like it's it's better this way fuck i miss the key fuck i miss

2306
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:35,120
the key god damn it okay uh yeah this is the way it should be this is the way it should have always

2307
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:40,080
been uh anyway there's there's like an arc where pier has to learn to accept this new cast even though

2308
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:44,560
the new crew like can't do anything right according to the movie but we're supposed to

2309
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:50,960
like them anyway and want them to succeed um and uh eventually uh his ex-wife shows up

2310
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:58,640
now like a sweet woman who like is like reasonable did he like do something to like change your

2311
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:04,080
attitude no no okay but but he's about to do something that could theoretically change her

2312
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:10,240
but she's already like this before the scene yeah where uh peter uh wants to uh help his ex-wife

2313
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:15,120
you know come to terms with it and you know show that he's moved on by inviting her and her new

2314
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:24,560
fiance to a banquet at the uh the the now renamed eclectic cafe which is uh where i that's that's a

2317
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:43,440
cafe you understand and then it's like no everything's going to verse like oh because

2318
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:48,320
there are a rowdy band of misfits and we gotta acknowledge that yeah yeah so they're eclectic

2319
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:55,280
yeah eclectic cafe is it about pete learning not to be racist is that what you've done here

2320
02:35:55,280 --> 02:36:01,040
okay it's it's about shooting on pete for like two hours and then him being the exact same thing

2321
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:07,120
and then uh everyone but like everyone likes him now cool yeah he's been through a lot yeah he has

2322
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:11,920

2327
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:44,640
thing oh god it's like that song it's like that song about when the guy he's trying to call

2329
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:58,480
a show i will become the blow learn to take it well i only wish my words could just convince

2330
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:05,040
myself that it just wasn't real but that's not the way it feels good song anyway go on i'm gonna

2331
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:12,720
have to hit the road it's by peepootage it's a big hit by peepootage in a past life

2332
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:17,760
uh i you know i i bet the reason he hates in this war so much is because when he first rode

2333
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:21,760
into town in the scorch home to find some nematodes over in toxington he never found one he just

2334
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:29,120
got cancer instead yeah you know tails all this time um okay okay so while at this banquet the

2335
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:35,360
fiat the the the wife's new fiance go like rance about how like the the restaurant uh crew is just

2336
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:40,960
like a bunch of like weird freaks about how he hates them for being different no no it was henry

2337
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:44,960
that made him higher than new guys yes oh henry's just out of the movie henry's just out of the

2338
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:50,400
movie he's just not even here why what happened what did she do to him what has she done with henry

2339
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:54,640
uh henry's just like like after he screws up everything he's just gone for the rest of the

2340
02:37:55,120 --> 02:38:01,440
movie okay well that makes sense i guess and and uh you know i guess he just got gunned down

2341
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,600
somewhere like maybe maybe in glocksbury and he hasn't responded he's just stay dead now

2342
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:10,720
yeah um you know after after trying to raid killer uh ready territory anyway there's a fist

2343
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:17,520
fight and a food fight at the scene and uh peter just starts beating up the fiance and they start

2344
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:22,000
throwing blows and everyone's just throwing food at one another goes to shit and then peter has a

2345
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:27,920
stroke and a heart attack and then they go and this is what the the final act of the movie is like

2346
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:31,920
i thought this this quirky food fight was gonna be like the end of it and like peter has grown

2347
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:38,080
up and he's like learned to stand up is the new fiance like younger than him yeah okay is the

2348
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:45,840
wife his age or is the wife younger or what the wife is hmm hey you there why now i'm here

2349
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:51,280
okay sorry you cut out you cut out but you're back okay cool yeah um and then peter has a stroke

2350
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,680
and this is like the rest of the movie is what it's about it's like it's completely shipped away

2351
02:38:55,680 --> 02:39:00,000
from it being like about learning to accept people who are different it just is like help peter not

2352
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:06,400
be like mentally disabled anymore like help him recover from his stroke really and then yes i'm

2353
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:12,960
not joking and then the most emblematic scene of the entire movie takes place imagine this imagine

2354
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:22,720
a scene in the reception like the you know a a a um uh inside a hospital talking to the receptionist

2355
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:28,080
uh and the misfits want to see peter they want to you know they he was taken by him i mean who

2356
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:33,600
wouldn't after after all they've been through together of course so it's it's it's the scene

2357
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:39,440
that keeps getting cut back between the mexican chef this gun is so fucking good i can't believe it

2358
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:46,720
yeah demanding to see him the where the receptionist saying we don't have him on file the mexican chef

2359
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:53,440
just saying find him his name is peter cutting in between that and the waitress uh millennial

2360

2383
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:19,280
god i mean i mean jam he's not cursed he's jammed two different things uh it's just that scene of

2384
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:26,080
just it's so dramatic the entire thing just completely just out of nowhere this girl has

2385
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:33,440
hang ups about being like like the child of like a sperm donor thing and she has hang ups about that

2386
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:38,720
apparently yeah and then it's immediately resolved and there's no point to it i don't understand what's

2387
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:43,920
happening movie why they just never brought it up before but then they just have a totally

2388
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:50,880
unearned emotional scene where she confronts and gets over her mother buying her sperm from a sperm

2389
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:58,560
donor yeah do i have do i have the do i have the right the idea yeah okay cool i was probably

2390
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:01,680
really buoyed for everyone in the audience for me to repeat that but i'm still not over this

2391
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:08,640
like this was like like three weeks ago yeah still thinking about well hey you know

2392
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:14,400
the movie made an impression so maybe it's actually a masterpiece you know what you're right yeah i know

2393
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:21,760
you know i i i would recommend if you are able to do so watch this movie don't watch the entire thing

2394
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:26,560
because i'm not advocating suicide but i am advocating that you at least understand what i'm

2395
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:32,080
saying because i guarantee you if you watch this then you will uh you'll understand what i am uh

2396
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:38,000
you'll know your pain you'll know my pain yeah you'll know my pain it's as i said i went to like

2397
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:43,840
the premiere so uh it's gonna be a a while before this thing is even on dvds it's gonna be a while

2398
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:50,000
but this this is going on the rck museum it's going the rck uh animals of history and uh i'll

2399
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:57,200
let you know about updates to the turnover i went to a movie premiere at mit a few years ago

2400
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:02,880
i don't remember what the movie was i don't remember like anything about it might have

2401
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:09,200
been a documentary i can't remember but i think i remember that like the xkcd guy was there and he

2402
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:14,880
like gave like there was like a q and a with him it was like him and the directors i don't know what

2403
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:20,800
the i don't know what was up with this i don't know why this event happened or what if anything the xkcd

2404
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:27,760
guy had to do with it um but that's the true oh my god the black hole gun i got the black hole gun

2405
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:33,280
and i don't know what it does but i'm gonna find out probably choose a black hole i had to give up

2406
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:38,560
all right i gave up my key i probably won't be able to get to the ooble at this round but that's

2407
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:44,080
okay i'm gonna try without it it's worth it for the black hole gun i should mention by the way

2408
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:48,960
i started out with the saying that i wanted to rub shoulders to people in uh in in LA yeah immediately

2409
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:54,800
after the movie was over uh everyone who worked on the movie uh uh like just like left like they

i should put a lot of thought into me responding i'll get i'll get i'll get back to that yeah yeah

2473
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:46,720
i'll get back to that way hardcore yeah um smash cut to a month later i'm like oh

2474
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:54,080
shit i forgot about that yeah uh and so i respond super apologetically uh and i explain like it's

2475
02:51:54,080 --> 02:52:01,680
it's a cool idea i suppose i'll try it out maybe and i'll let you know um i said that i would pass

2476
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:07,520
on to digi which i i'm not going to or had any intention to it was a straight up lie uh um

2477
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:14,960
and and uh i was just like um yeah uh you know it's it's interesting i'll give it a shot

2478
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:21,760
and then he spawns another thing uh and he's he says something effective um like like can you

2479
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:27,440
tell me more about you and your group and i'm like ooh like here's my chance to explain who i am and

2480
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:33,200
maybe he can scratch my back in some way well it's a free it's a free uh rpg you can play on your

2481
02:52:35,440 --> 02:52:43,040
yeah and uh and and that was uh two months ago yep i haven't responded uh well you know

2482
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:52,720
i mean whatever who gives a shit i i i i'm i'm always i'm always trying to find ways to

2483
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:58,400
shill endless war that's that's not it's never working it's never it's never ever in what way

2484
02:52:58,400 --> 02:53:03,680
is that a shilling opportunity what what do we possibly stand to gain literally nothing yeah

2485
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:09,520
literally nothing yeah but but but you see it's it's it's it's like um fuck it's like it's like the

2486
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:14,640
animal part of your brain that wants you to have sex and procreate it's like if i can just even talk

2487
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:19,680
about it then i'll i'll have some way to tell something to gain if i can literally just mention

2488
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:26,960
it to anyone who's willing to listen i don't i don't feel that way at all yeah for me it's like

2489
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:33,600
why bother mentioning it to anyone okay as as it's obviously clear from everything i've talked about

2490
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:38,640
like the multiple times right so i got my intention here is to show my product and all three times i've

2491
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:42,560
mentioned on the show have been completely like there's no way they could possibly happen

2492
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:48,560
i'm aware that like the ways i'm doing this are completely like wrong and there's no rhyme or reason

2493
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:52,480
to believe that the things like going to this meeting with me are going to go for boston or

2494
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:57,600
respond to this guy who wants to develop an app in any way could help me i understand that that's

2495
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:03,120
true however it doesn't stop me from wanting it to be the case it doesn't stop me from just wanting

2496
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:07,680
because like what do i have to lose to respond to this guy and like he's he's asking for for

2497
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:12,720
podcasts in the boston area whatever i'll just fucking lie to him just here but tell me what you

2498
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:19,040
can offer me but i don't know yeah but the answer he gave you an answer and it was nothing um yeah

2499
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:25,280
you're right and that's sort of why i stopped responding yeah okay good i just want you to

2500
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:31,520
understand that like the problem here is not oh no why did i stop responding the the the the end

2501
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:40,080
goal is here is so naturally i stopped responding the end good end we made it oh well yeah i'm not

2502
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:45,280
trying to imply that i should have kept responding after i realized that this would not work for the

2503
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:53,520
our fans in any way i mean uh i mean yeah well i mean even if it did even if it did it's not like

2504
02:54:54,560 --> 02:55:00,400
it's not like knowing this guy who made the app confers any benefit on us whatsoever

2505
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:08,480
we would just have access to the app like everyone else right true uh i don't know i don't know maybe

2506
02:55:08,480 --> 02:55:14,720
there's there maybe you see we could get we could get we could i feel like i'm uh i'm i'm lucy from

2507
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:20,240
i love lucy and i feel like just knowing famous people will get me uh it's not a famous person

2508
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:26,560
this is a nobody who's making some app but but he has he he's developing an app and he never

2509
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:32,800
surely must know pewdiepie are you okay all right all right listen i i know i know it's irrational

2510
02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:39,920
i completely understand don't get it but i'll get a little but listen i just listen again any chance

2511
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:45,520
i can even say the words endless war or pcp my brain shoots up and i get a dopamine rush

2512
02:55:46,240 --> 02:55:51,680
the moment the moment anyone says that to me at all what why don't you take that nervous energy you

2513
02:55:51,680 --> 02:56:00,160
got and put it to some use like impossible even like instead of fucking contacting a random app

2514
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:05,520
developer why don't you why don't you send a fucking press send a fucking press release to the gaming

2515
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:11,440
journalist or something you know because i saw his post on okay listen i saw his post on r slash

2516
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:22,880
oh i'm i like okay you know what stop defending yourself you're right i should stop okay good

2517
02:56:22,880 --> 02:56:29,920
i'm glad we figured it out we found we found the solution if only if only if only he reversed

2518
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:34,960
what you gotta get on the app we gotta get on that app if we gotta get on it it's uh

2519
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:42,160
i mean it's not a terrible idea but we're not famous enough i think i made an account and i

2520
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:48,400
did i like i i think i linked it on my twitter and i uh i never checked it again you linked it

2521
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:54,080
well you linked your okay worth it yeah worth it strange name why do you think it's called that

2522
02:56:54,080 --> 02:57:02,960
like man asking this question was totally worth it uh no idea i know who i was looking i was talking

2523
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:07,360
to too there's a list of a good team it's kenny it's kenny lee i was talking to

2524
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:19,200
he is fucking mainlanders but he doesn't even believe in ghosts uh well i was asking

2525
02:57:19,200 --> 02:57:23,600
that's what i'm gonna dm him i'm gonna say hey listen before we go any further with this what do

2526
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:30,400
you think about ghosts yeah you guys have ghosts on the mainland because we got ghosts in space if

2527
02:57:30,400 --> 02:57:35,600
we don't have ghosts but i don't know if we're gonna be able to work together just ask him hey

2528
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:43,040
question you guys got ghosts on the mainland no context context is the enemy

2529
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:51,840
fuck you see this is why i want to go to boston round cable is because i'm just so eager to

2530
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:56,720
collaborate like collaboration at any cost talking to other people at any cost no matter

2531
02:57:56,720 --> 02:58:04,560
yeah in any form um i mean i should probably have like the opposite problem

2532
02:58:05,360 --> 02:58:11,280
we're like i i like don't i like don't talk about it unless i'm sure that like there's some

2533
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:17,760
like tangible benefit to doing so and other other than i'm like i mean you know what's the point

2534
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:27,600
bring that up you know whatever like that's just the thing um i you know i'm casting a wide net

2535
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:33,440
bin i'm talking to literally everyone and eventually there has to be someone who actually cares well

2536
02:58:33,440 --> 02:58:39,040
sure well here's the thing even if they cared so what you get like one guy to join the server

2537
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:45,520
that that guy that guy could tell other guys or or maybe it's not like like i'm trying to sell

2538
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:50,000
that person like i'm not like i'm not trying to get like that one guy but i'm trying to get people

2539
02:58:50,000 --> 02:59:01,040
some that guy who maybe has a platform to share it yeah sure sure um hey let me let me bring it back

2540
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:08,000
to the round table yeah let me ask you so like i think they do like a i think they do like a

2541
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:13,600
newsletter or something and like people contribute like comics to like the newsletter uh

2542
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:20,240
i'm just curious if like that's something you would want to do because like i never ended up doing it

2543
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:24,720
but i thought about it like oh maybe i just you know draw some shit and like put it in this

2544
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:31,280
fucking like a zine basically like a zine like they kind of have their own zine yeah so well it's

2545
02:59:31,280 --> 02:59:36,080
it's what you're describing is just that like it is like they have a newsletter and you can just

2546
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:42,400
like draw like a like like a like a like a um a funny in the local paper pretty bad like a

2547
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:49,920
like a garfield strip i think uh yeah i think maybe they they took like full page ones as well

2548
02:59:49,920 --> 03:00:04,000
but yeah pretty much more or less um well uh no but not because of the underlying idea of it

2549
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:10,960
not that like it's just like work to do to get my work seen by people in any capacity

2550
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:15,920
which is something i'm into i don't know if i have a particular want to do that type of work

2551
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:21,760
though i might not be understanding it completely well i think i got a glitch oh yeah yeah a corpse

2552
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:30,880
just turned into a pink rectangle oh come on developers come on sad sad uh but sorry state

2553
03:00:30,880 --> 03:00:36,720
of india games with all these days oh wait it's gone i think it faded okay whatever i i i do like i

2554
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:42,400
think i think zines are cool in concept and i don't have a i don't have a any issue with doing it

2555
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:48,320
just in like the abstract though i think just maybe like like if it is indeed like a garfield funny

2556
03:00:48,320 --> 03:00:53,360
i don't know if i want to do that no i don't think i mean i think it can be whatever you want

2557
03:00:54,080 --> 03:00:59,600
okay like it's just you know did you make a comic are you do you are you in the boston comics

2558
03:00:59,600 --> 03:01:04,000
round table put your comic in the round table newsletter because that's what we're about

2559
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:11,040
well then okay yeah if it just is like you can like like have like an ad for your comic or something

2560
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:16,400
i don't just like your comic i don't think it yeah i don't think it's like they hand you off a script

2561
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:22,400
and are like here make this or anything well yeah sure i don't think so but i i i thought i might have

2562
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:29,280
been like like you remember comic strips from the newspaper we should have those but for our

2563
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:33,760
newsletter because it's like quirky in a way kind of no i i think it's just whatever you

2564
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:37,840
want to make pretty much okay well then yeah i'm not actually sure i'm not actually sure because

2565
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:42,960
i never actually did it or really look much into it i knew that they did this sort of thing i think

2566
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:48,320
they do them like maybe every couple months or something um i have no idea what i would do but

2567
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:52,800
yeah i do have an interesting i think i think that could be cool yeah i i told you about that one

2568
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:58,640
homesick sign that i signed up for but i got rejected for yes you mentioned you mentioned it

2569
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:05,760
uh yeah it wasn't an official thing though right uh it was pseudo official it was like

2570
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:10,720
endorsed by will pumpkin it was made by fans but like what pumpkin like supported them in a way

2571
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:18,240
okay yeah was it canon was it technically technically i'm serious i'm serious was it like

2572
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:23,360
no no not at all i mean i mean it wasn't like a story it just was pictures of homesick people oh okay

2573
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:32,480
lame dumb uh i'm almost glad in a way that i didn't get selected because uh that that whole

2574
03:02:32,480 --> 03:02:38,560
operation was a huge shit show and uh very untrustworthy what do you mean untrustworthy

2575
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:43,680
do you think they would have not followed through just like low art and and uh and uh

2576
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:51,040
oh liliah and all these other losers that i failed to collab with it it took them 10 months

2577
03:02:51,040 --> 03:03:02,080
to select a a like like the roster for people who were doing art uh weird yeah very weird

2578
03:03:03,840 --> 03:03:08,800
when they said it would take them like a like a couple like a week a couple weeks 10

2579
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:17,520
that just speaks to like some weird priorities or something by the way my quest my sub quest this

2580
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:24,880
round is to i have to drop i want to drop this weird egg into fire and hatch it into a serpent

2581
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:30,240
that's my that's my that's um that's something i want that's something i want for myself

2582
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:39,520
mm-hmm yeah wait wait so so why did you say that you just didn't happen to do this newsletter

2583
03:03:39,520 --> 03:03:44,880
thing or that you didn't want to for a reason uh i think i was just like

2584
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:51,280
what's the point i was just like eh you know that sounds kind of neat maybe i'll do it but

2585
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:56,320
kind of lazy eyes i'm not even gonna worry about it you know i just like didn't really worry about

2586
03:03:56,320 --> 03:04:01,760
it imagine if you had like a like one of the like like the first vaporette but it's in there

2587
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:06,080
and it's just like a small interaction i mean that just seems like why wouldn't i do that

2588
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:17,040
i gotta fuck i gotta write some vaporettes because i am trying to hopefully do the

2589
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:22,080
fucking vapor's three vapor's two kickstarter sand i need some fucking vaporettes for that

2590
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:28,000
i want to do another one and don't worry i won't try it all this time good good as we discuss

2591
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:37,600
trying is the trying is the path to failing my vapor is sick though yeah um kazi wants to do one

2592
03:04:38,400 --> 03:04:41,680
i told her she wants to do one vaporettes are cool i told her she could months ago

2593
03:04:42,400 --> 03:04:48,480
like months and months ago and uh sometimes she makes fun of me i still haven't given her one

2594
03:04:48,480 --> 03:04:54,320
to do because i haven't written anything oh i mean and that's fair you know whatever yeah i mean

2595
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:57,920
instead of writing vaporettes you should be writing real vapor's which is what you're doing so

2596
03:04:57,920 --> 03:05:03,200
yeah yeah pretty much um i

2597
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:06,720
one you know

2598
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:16,160
i don't know i haven't thinking about like thinking about like uh money and like my future

2599
03:05:16,160 --> 03:05:25,200
uh oh uh oh i know right i'm just thinking like in the absence of some kind of hard to foresee

2600
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:32,240
event where like i gain a lot of exposure very fast you know like i don't know if my audience

2601
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:37,440
i don't know if like my my audience is gonna grow like i you know i've been wondering about

2602
03:05:37,440 --> 03:05:43,760
my growth potential like i did the poo videos kind of because i thought it was like it would

2603
03:05:43,760 --> 03:05:51,360
might be a good way to grow and reach new audience uh turns out no um i don't think the poo audience

2604
03:05:51,360 --> 03:05:58,880
is that big i mean do people know what poo is i don't know i thought i thought it'd be interesting

2605
03:05:58,880 --> 03:06:03,360
tom is telling us about that that video series the digi i think i think he did it i think for

2606
03:06:03,360 --> 03:06:08,160
fron games did you retrospective of the tales of series yeah that's a good video i actually

2607
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:14,880
really like that also i mean i think i'm in it sort of wait were you i don't know but he

2608
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:19,920
mentions me by name because one of the characters he named one of the characters after me and he

2609
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:26,880
reminds of me that's that's cool yeah uh but like like that was to like capitalize on like it was a

2610
03:06:26,880 --> 03:06:30,400
series that like not people have a lot of people to talk about maybe there wasn't a quote-unquote

2611
03:06:30,400 --> 03:06:34,240
community for but like a lot of people like it and remember it so it might be a good thing it was

2612
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:39,680
it was like that where it's like maybe like maybe it's not like a poo community per se but it's like

2613
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:43,440
you know everyone knows like people are nostalgic for it people remember it people are interested

2614
03:06:43,440 --> 03:06:48,880
to hear about it that's i don't know that was the idea it didn't work out and i don't know why

2615
03:06:48,880 --> 03:06:56,400
but whatever um so so you're afraid you're stagnating you're you're plateaued well

2616
03:06:56,400 --> 03:07:06,480
well i mean in terms of audience in terms of reach sure like what's how like how do you get big

2617
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:12,080
how do people how do people even fucking get big i think the way you get big is what we were talking

2618
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:17,440
about earlier you focus on one thing do it a lot i don't think that's true munchie because i see

2619
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:25,680
people that do that and don't get big example i could name a dozen people in my fucking twitter

2620
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:32,480
who make comics i'm not doubting i'm first of all i'm not trying to doubt that that like that

2621
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:38,320
is possible or that even is not the case i'm just saying there might be something they aren't doing

2622
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:46,000
correctly like like like like i don't know if that necessary like there are a lot of things that go

2623
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:51,200
into like someone's success online and i think that i don't know just because there are people who

2624
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:57,440
are doing that but like but not succeeding is the case because there are people who do succeed

2625
03:07:57,440 --> 03:08:05,680
that do do that you know i think those people are the exception well then what do you think

2626
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:13,760
or they are doing right does is luck do you think it's luck yes yes basically basically

2627
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:20,080
a hundred percent okay yeah i mean maybe that's a little pessimistic well it's not a hundred percent

2628
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:25,520
i mean but like i mean okay like obviously you have to be a certain level of talented

2629
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:31,920
think about that lots of people are that level of talented i think people don't really talk about a

2630
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:38,320
lot it's you do have to even if you're not talented in the way that we would think if you're not

2631
03:08:38,320 --> 03:08:44,480
interesting or something no matter what it like i'll take being a youtuber uh yeah to be

2632
03:08:44,480 --> 03:08:50,880
my same here no matter even if you're just like a shit boilerplate uh like like an analyst you

2633
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:57,920
still have to work hard to put out videos yeah it's not yeah no listen talent and hard work are

2634
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:05,120
necessary but not sufficient okay and i think the last thing is you just have to get lucky

2635
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:08,400
and some people do and some people don't there's nothing you can do the only thing you can do

2636
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:14,880
about it is keep trying and and not give up and like let let it just just keep hoping i would say it

2637
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:20,960
depends i don't know i don't know if that's i mean i think there did you ever do you ever do this

2638
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:26,400
do you ever like find some content or a content creator and just look at like you know a little

2639
03:09:26,400 --> 03:09:32,160
sample of their work and then try and guess like hmm what do i think this person's making on patreon

2640
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:42,640
you ever try never play that game no i don't i play that game yeah is it only would you say it's

2641
03:09:42,640 --> 03:09:47,680
more or less or just just fluctuate it's just a fun thing to get i got it a long imprisoned

2642
03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:54,080
serpent it looks hungry but wait hello can you hear me yeah can you hear me yes i can hear you

2643
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:59,520
is it is higher is it lower than you expect or is it just fluctuate no the thing the thing is

2644
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:07,840
that i'm pretty good at guessing and i get pretty close a lot of the time and i don't know what that

2645
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:13,280
means like that i can just like sometimes you can just look at someone's work like what kind of videos

2646
03:10:13,280 --> 03:10:17,600
they're making and just be like i bet i bet i know what this i bet i know how much this person's

2647
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:24,960
making on patreon and like i get pretty close and i guess that means that there is a correlation but

2648
03:10:24,960 --> 03:10:31,200
like you maybe it is like predictable and like gameable and it's not just luck because like if

2649
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:35,280
you can predict it based on what they're making then like clearly there's a rhyme or reason behind it

2650
03:10:40,160 --> 03:10:47,200
i don't know if there's ever a patreon that i feel like it doesn't make sense for the person

2651
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:53,840
that it makes that that that means like in the sense that like it's either way more or substantially

2652
03:10:53,840 --> 03:11:01,520
less i'm trying to think if there's a patreon that doesn't make sense in the sense that it's

2653
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:05,920
either way more or substantially less than what i would imagine they're making i can only think

2654
03:11:05,920 --> 03:11:10,640
of anyone that doesn't like fit in a way but it might just because it is what it is and i haven't

2655
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:14,400
really thought about it till now so it just makes like like of course it's that that's what's always

2656
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:16,960
better

2657
03:11:23,440 --> 03:11:32,080
uh i don't know you like fuck oh dead i'm just i got the fucking serpent i got the

2658
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:38,320
fucking serpent but i didn't feed it enough price you you come across people online that you think

2659
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:42,560
should be making way more than they are right that's not a weird thing to observe

2660
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:50,640
yeah mostly me well it's mostly it's artists like artists and well sure well i mean the thing

2661
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:55,440
like the difference is hard you mean like visual art is that what you mean like specifically yeah

2662
03:11:55,440 --> 03:12:01,760
yeah yeah like the difference the difference in skill between like a person who's making thousands

2663
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:09,920
of dollars and a person who's making like tens can be like nothing and it makes me so mad

2664
03:12:10,720 --> 03:12:17,200
just thinking about it and if you want if you want to make money as an illustrator online

2665
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:25,920
you gotta do porn yeah and you can't and i don't get it i don't get who gives you money for that

2666
03:12:27,440 --> 03:12:31,200
uh they just want to do well make their we go hard

2667
03:12:31,200 --> 03:12:36,320
by seeing so many ways to do that there's so many ways to do that why do you need to give

2668
03:12:36,400 --> 03:12:41,600
your money to this specific person to accomplish that aim i don't i don't get it

2669
03:12:42,640 --> 03:12:52,160
uh you like dart style i i guess yeah sure i mean i would never do it it's it's never something

2670
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:57,040
i would want to it's it's always so disheartening though to see someone who you think should be

2671
03:12:57,040 --> 03:13:02,960
earning a lot but then just they aren't it's so weird okay i well i mean i i mean i am one of

2672
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:10,080
those people so i have no pity for anyone uh i found this channel that i really enjoy called

2673
03:13:10,080 --> 03:13:15,840
j foreman and he's like a he's a british dude who makes videos he makes video series talking about

2674
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:21,280
um for instance he has a series where he talks about like unfinished public works projects in

2675
03:13:21,280 --> 03:13:27,680
london talking about like very specific i know like like unused train lines and stuff like that

2676
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:34,320
and like plans for highways that never got built that sounds like the kind of thing that is not

2677
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:40,800
interesting but could be made interesting with the right sort of narration style he does he does yeah

2678
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:49,280
yeah um how and and you think this guy's gonna have no views but he's extremely popular well

2679
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:58,240
maybe not extremely but he's way more than 100 100k followers 100k subs no dude almost 400k wow

2680
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:04,560
wow okay god damn yeah he doesn't break a million on any of his videos but he gets

2681
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:10,160
sort of close sometimes and is usually usually on like one of his main series he gets like above

2682
03:14:10,160 --> 03:14:19,120
500k um pretty good so he's doing good youtube wise but his patreon is just like a thousand dollars

2683
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:25,440
that's not bad that's not bad that's nothing to complain about it's nothing to complain about

2684
03:14:25,440 --> 03:14:32,560
however i don't know it sort of feels disconnected from me from his subscribers and his views to his

2685
03:14:32,560 --> 03:14:43,280
low for 400 you know you know 500k for something so for something so like weird and something that

2686
03:14:43,280 --> 03:14:48,240
like nobody else is doing that's the kind of thing that i would expect to have a disproportionately

2687
03:14:48,240 --> 03:14:52,400
high patreon yes exactly that's what i'm trying to say it's like yeah i don't know how this has so

2688
03:14:52,400 --> 03:14:59,040
many views but so many not people who resonate with it it's not like these are like particularly like

2689
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:05,760
boilerplate videos at all i mean even just by their subject matter they aren't popular i wouldn't

2690
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:12,240
imagine like there's a guy called um there's a guy called krug smash who makes like he makes like

2691
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:17,920
narratively focused dwarf fortress let's plays they're really good and he does art for them and

2692
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:22,960
stuff and they're he's he's he's got some really that's some really great stuff but he makes like

2693
03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:31,520
i think he's only gotten the tens of thousands but he makes like uh he makes like a like like three

2694
03:15:31,520 --> 03:15:36,320
or four thousand dollars a month on patreon or something like a relatively small audience um

2695
03:15:36,320 --> 03:15:40,480
because it's niche because it's niche and nobody else does it the way he does that's the thing like

2696
03:15:40,480 --> 03:15:48,400
how can you watch these videos be one of like the like almost a million people who have done so

2697
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:55,760
and then like and like subscribe to him but then like not care enough about this weird niche

2698
03:15:55,760 --> 03:16:02,000
interest to like patron him like why are you watching this it just feels weird i don't know man

2699
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:05,680
maybe it's not it's not the fact okay it's not okay if it was just like he was getting

2700
03:16:05,680 --> 03:16:11,600
shit views and his patreon that was that i would understand yeah yeah exactly it's just that he's

2701
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:18,400
getting so much views like it's it's just that his views are weird to be this seems like the kind of

2702
03:16:18,400 --> 03:16:26,320
thing that a small group is really passionate about and you would think they would be like you

2703
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:32,320
know really eager to support him yeah that's that is that is what i would like think but instead it's

2704
03:16:32,320 --> 03:16:37,760
weirdly mainstream and no one really cares enough well i i i don't i don't want to care

2705
03:16:37,760 --> 03:16:42,640
rise his patreon is this it's like it's like uh you know it's not a wasteland yeah yeah yeah

2706
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:49,520
but you get what i mean i get you yeah hmm i mean who's someone else who's got like 400k

2707
03:16:50,880 --> 03:16:56,880
i mean i'll bet i yeah in g question mark let me tell you no he's like three he's like less than

2708
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:04,160
three oh he has equal amount to him so he's at 375 and the guy i'm just like oh literally the

2709
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:11,680
exact same 375 both of them no shit yeah i should also mention by the way that this guy's been on

2710
03:17:11,680 --> 03:17:18,320
like the bbc and stuff so like he's like really popular in the uk i suppose or at least like the

2711
03:17:18,320 --> 03:17:25,920
london area question mark hmm maybe it's a demographic thing like maybe british people don't

2712
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:38,880
patreon as much or something you know maybe aren't we lucky to be in america and every and all

2713
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:50,560
art is catered towards us yeah i think the answer is yes it is i agree i mean it's convenient i don't

2714
03:17:50,560 --> 03:18:00,240
know well i mean would i really care if like every story i read was set in england no that wouldn't

2715
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:07,920
bother me i don't know if that's i just mean uh well it's not the fact that just it's it's set in

2716
03:18:07,920 --> 03:18:13,440
another place but just i don't know like our the culture we have is so ubiquitous in everything

2717
03:18:13,440 --> 03:18:19,120
ranging from like narratives to like the like just settings of narratives to just like like anything in

2718
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:24,320
art is made with like the americans might want to watch this unless it's like something super niche

2719
03:18:24,320 --> 03:18:30,480
like anime or something count counter argument i mean that yeah american culture is pervasive

2720
03:18:31,360 --> 03:18:38,640
but not just in media just in general so like well sure other places kind of have a lot

2721
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:44,240
have pretty similar cultures anyway so like if american media is made for an american audience

2722
03:18:44,240 --> 03:18:48,880
an audience with american sensibilities that is actually a lot of the world beyond america

2723
03:18:49,440 --> 03:18:55,680
because there's so much like cultural lead over um i don't disagree with all i don't think that i

2724
03:18:55,680 --> 03:19:03,280
mean i mean i think that's true i i also think that if for instance you live in a vastly different

2725
03:19:03,280 --> 03:19:09,920
culture you the like the sort of stuff that might appeal to you like well okay well actually

2726
03:19:09,920 --> 03:19:16,480
let me rephrase that it might be that you kind of maybe not are forced to at all but just like

2727
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:23,200
you know a lot of art is you know for like american sensibility and uh it might not be based around

2728
03:19:25,360 --> 03:19:29,920
not like the overwhelming majority of things might not be uh it's something that you might want to

2729
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:34,000
partake in as a member of a different culture kind of talking about my ass right now dude i love

2730
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:42,960
partaking in culture i hate it you know what you're right sorry uh the why i'm looking at

2731
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:48,080
patrons right now you've got me interested uh did you hear about try and get play the game

2732
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:52,720
try and try and like when you find a content creator and you see they have a patreon it's

2733
03:19:52,720 --> 03:20:00,640
trying guess it's trying trying to do that do you know about patreon pro no oh ben i don't think

2734
03:20:00,640 --> 03:20:07,200
you're gonna like this hold on a new update coming to patreon uh they're raising the cut of how much

2735
03:20:07,280 --> 03:20:12,960
they get they uh uh they get or they take from creators uh and they're having it scale

2736
03:20:12,960 --> 03:20:22,880
with how much money you make wait what explain yes so okay you can go to patreon.com slash uh new

2737
03:20:22,880 --> 03:20:29,280
creator plans uh literally do that literally do that right now i i don't i'm trying to find the rat

2738
03:20:30,640 --> 03:20:36,240
you're never gonna do it then no i got a good feeling about this one so they're doing sort of

2739
03:20:36,240 --> 03:20:42,400
like a twitch affiliate thing almost kind of what youtube does where when you're a small patreon

2740
03:20:42,400 --> 03:20:48,480
and you're starting out you don't have as many tools available to you so there are gonna be three

2741
03:20:48,480 --> 03:20:55,040
tiers of creator there's going to be picture on light patreon pro and patreon premium oh my god

2742
03:20:55,040 --> 03:21:03,040
okay and when you start out a patreon you can't have multiple like tiers of of like of like um

2743
03:21:03,840 --> 03:21:13,760
like like donation okay so uh so you can't like for instance if you just start out a patreon

2744
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:19,680
you cannot have like five dollar month patrons get this one dollar a month patients get this

2745
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:23,680
ten dollar pensions get this you cannot do that now if you just start a patreon

2746
03:21:24,640 --> 03:21:32,640
but like old patreon old patrons won't be effective um no they won't okay ones will uh

2747
03:21:32,640 --> 03:21:43,440
well i don't why i don't know what what what do they what do they gain from that

2748
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:52,160
well let me read their blurb yeah sure oh okay like they say new creator plans then immediately

2749
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:56,640
they say in bold no change for current creators on patreon so like please don't get mad at us if

2750
03:21:56,640 --> 03:22:01,840
you're already on patreon like if they okay so clearly they know this is like a bad and unpopular

2751
03:22:01,840 --> 03:22:10,000
thing why do they want it okay let's see patreon has grown in our community of creators has grown

2752
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:14,400
with us we now serve so many different types of creators from a painter with 100 fans who created

2753
03:22:14,400 --> 03:22:19,760
business with 100k fans and a staff of 25 this allows us to tailor our offerings to different

2754
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:23,760
types of creators we're also introducing a new payment processing rates for our future creators

2755
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:29,200
including a new low rate of payments for three dollars or less um so basically wait i'm interested

2756
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:36,160
in that part because that actually might make me more money um well they they're they're having

2757
03:22:36,160 --> 03:22:44,720
a tax in the rich scenario i yeah exactly explain um okay so okay this could this could be good or

2758
03:22:44,720 --> 03:22:53,680
bad for me um i'm trying to see uh with new low rates for smoke okay future creators will choose

2759
03:22:53,680 --> 03:22:59,280
one of the above plans uh detailing light probe premium and we'll have new payment processing

2760
03:22:59,280 --> 03:23:03,440
rates including a special low rate for small pledges pledges of three dollars or less we'll

2761
03:23:03,440 --> 03:23:09,920
use the micro payment rate of five percent plus ten percent for successful payment wait wait wait

2762
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:20,000
wait wait wait wait wait five percent plus ten percent plus ten cents okay oh okay so it's not

2763
03:23:20,400 --> 03:23:25,360
it's not by how much a creator is making it's by how much the individual donation is

2764
03:23:25,360 --> 03:23:32,240
yes oh that sucks that's fucking stupid okay so here are the rates for new um

2765
03:23:33,360 --> 03:23:39,840
patron things and this does affect you yeah uh uh okay okay so if you're a light user so it means

2766
03:23:39,840 --> 03:23:44,160
you just start a new a new patreon get five percent which i believe it is now wait no no

2767
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:48,480
stop stop hold on i'm very confused because it sounded like you were just saying that the

2768
03:23:48,480 --> 03:23:53,200
the rate depends on the pledge not based on the creator and how much they're making

2769
03:23:54,240 --> 03:23:57,600
that why i just described the three dollars thing i was just talking about previously

2770
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:04,720
that it only affects small pledges that affects the pledges that people make we're not to explain

2771
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:10,000
now is related to the patron thing they're they're not related they are just they're just changes

2772
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:15,840
that are separate but they have to be related because that that doesn't make any sense but the

2773
03:24:16,640 --> 03:24:20,160
the the amount that they're taking the the amount of cut they're taking

2774
03:24:21,200 --> 03:24:28,960
has it can't like those those things those things don't exist in a vacuum like yeah like the pledge

2775
03:24:28,960 --> 03:24:35,120
has an amount and the creator is making an amount and if the amount of that they're taking in fees

2776
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:43,680
depends on one or the other it matters which is no okay okay it's not that they're not related

2777
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:49,360
but it's okay it's like um okay the base rate if you're a light member of patreon which is like

2778
03:24:49,360 --> 03:24:57,360
the lowest tier is is is five and when you go up the leaderboard and you get to a pro status

2779
03:24:57,360 --> 03:25:02,400
once you have more patrons it goes up from five percent to eight percent but if you have people

2780
03:25:02,400 --> 03:25:08,720
who are still pledging like we're pledging you even though you have a higher percent or you have

2781
03:25:08,720 --> 03:25:15,680
more patrons and you are a bigger patron and you are a pro patron user if they are doing smaller

2782
03:25:15,680 --> 03:25:23,840
pledges they they still have the base amount they send you so five percent do you get what i'm saying

2783
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:32,560
no okay well it makes sense okay okay okay okay let's say you're let's say you are a creator

2784
03:25:32,640 --> 03:25:34,160
you are a pro creator

2785
03:25:40,320 --> 03:25:47,680
and you and the baseline every person who pageants you uh patron takes a eight percent cut

2786
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:55,200
let's analyze two patrons of yours one person who does one dollar and one person who does twenty

2787
03:25:55,200 --> 03:26:01,440
dollars the person who pledges twenty dollars will be affected by your higher rate of eight percent

2788
03:26:01,440 --> 03:26:09,520
because that's what that that's the base rate for your patron your your patreon now okay but small

2789
03:26:09,520 --> 03:26:14,960
pledges are affected at their own like smaller amount yes okay you know what that does make

2790
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:22,080
sense i i got you okay okay um so it goes up to to eight percent uh but for you it will stay five

2791
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:29,760
percent just so your grandfather did uh for premium users it goes up to 12 percent if you're new

2792
03:26:29,760 --> 03:26:37,520
and nine percent if you're old so so this means my rate's gonna go down so that's good well oh wait

2793
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:43,200
um i guess yeah okay you know what you're right it will well but but if you will write but but but

2794
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:52,480
if you grow more then it will go down uh well yeah but i'd be growing more uh true so worth it

2795
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:57,760
well this actually sounds like a well i mean i'm gonna have to look this over

2796
03:26:58,640 --> 03:27:03,680
but it sounds like another thing to mention is that features are are gated behind

2797
03:27:04,480 --> 03:27:09,040
other but but not for me because i am already having a count no they will be gated for you

2798
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:17,440
still like what um i don't think anything that you might care about but there are there's stuff like

2799
03:27:17,440 --> 03:27:24,400
um you can have let me here let me see uh there's there's there's some bulletless here uh dedicated

2800
03:27:24,400 --> 03:27:28,720
partner manager which i'm not really sure what that means merch for membership which i believe

2801
03:27:28,720 --> 03:27:34,400
is some sort of like patreon built in merch store and a team account which might affect

2802
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:42,320
i i don't know if we were at a higher level that might have effect pc yes not this sounds like none of

2803
03:27:42,320 --> 03:27:51,520
it affects me um well also also by the way um hold on hold on wait actually let me see

2804
03:27:54,720 --> 03:27:56,720
i guess it would be bad if it affected the pcp

2805
03:27:58,720 --> 03:28:03,040
as well that would affect me indirectly no i wouldn't affect me directly actually

2806
03:28:05,120 --> 03:28:10,960
i'm trying to read it's kind of hard to parse something here okay premium is the best for

2807
03:28:10,960 --> 03:28:17,360
creators that expect to make at least 2500 a month on patreon so the 12 percent fee equals to 300

2808
03:28:17,360 --> 03:28:21,840
dollars a month do you have to like opt in or is it automatic no no no okay then what's the

2809
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:25,440
point of saying it's best for it's like it doesn't matter we're forcing it on you

2810
03:28:26,800 --> 03:28:30,000
fucking god i i hate patreon i hate their attitude

2811
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:39,920
this ensures our costs provide the services to premium yay i got it okay so they're saying if you

2812
03:28:39,920 --> 03:28:48,080
make over 2500 a month of that they will take uh 300 dollars in processing

2813
03:28:49,840 --> 03:28:58,640
um what percentage is that about 12 percent oh yeah okay well uh okay so that's a little more

2814
03:28:58,640 --> 03:29:03,920
because i think they take like nine percent now no they take five percent they take five percent

2815
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:12,000
wait they take five percent now yeah oh what it was more than double i thought they take nine percent

2816
03:29:12,800 --> 03:29:18,160
okay well in that case then it's only bad so we so all that's happening is that they're just

2817
03:29:18,160 --> 03:29:25,680
taking more from big creators and taking the same amount from small creators yes uh unless you are

2818
03:29:26,400 --> 03:29:33,280
i think in your case if you were to have created a a patreon uh after these changes are implemented

2819
03:29:33,280 --> 03:29:37,040
and you are a new account they would have been charging you more like and you had the same

2820
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:41,280
amount of money that you're making if you just had a new account and you didn't you didn't have the

2821
03:29:41,280 --> 03:29:45,840
grandfathered in rates then you would then they would be taking more from you because you were

2822
03:29:45,840 --> 03:29:56,320
like a medium fuck um hmm all right well sounds well awful bad okay stupid um

2823
03:29:57,040 --> 03:30:07,280
um um what's that other patreon alternative subscribe star subscribe star yeah maybe i should

2824
03:30:07,280 --> 03:30:14,960
make a subscribe star but it has a bad name been it has a stupid name yeah but well look i mean i

2825
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:21,200
haven't looked that deeply into it but i mean i complain about patreon a lot i'm sure i'm sure

2826
03:30:21,200 --> 03:30:25,600
that i'm sure there's at least one nazi on there though so i think we might have to label the entire

2827
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:32,240
operation uh stephen molyneux on there uh i don't i don't like that i don't like that guy yeah

2828
03:30:34,240 --> 03:30:41,280
we got we got to do something about him uh we got to be black warming insert poorly edited uh

2829
03:30:42,400 --> 03:30:46,720
youtube poop of the end of star wars episode three where obi once says you're supposed to

2830
03:30:47,280 --> 03:30:52,320
destroy this if not join them yeah but anakin's face is replaced with the old patreon logo

2831
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:59,120
you should make that you should just make that and it would probably go viral on you know what

2832
03:30:59,920 --> 03:31:07,040
literally literally it might yeah literally it might uh oh if i had been like literally the day

2833
03:31:07,040 --> 03:31:11,440
was announced i i fucking to shit you not that probably would have literally gone back the day

2834
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:16,880
that this announcement was announced yeah yeah yeah well you fucked up yeah i guess i did

2835
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:25,280
well doesn't didn't dick masterson make his own patreon alternative he did but like it's uh

2836
03:31:27,440 --> 03:31:33,920
you know i you know you he has to like personally accept you right it's not like just anyone can

2837
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:40,800
sign up for it and like apparently he just like does it like from his own like bank account

2838
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:46,880
uh okay so i'm sure he isn't looking to like you know make it a huge platform with tons of

2839
03:31:46,880 --> 03:31:51,600
because like you know so i'm sure it's just going to be like for a couple of people that he thinks

2840
03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:57,440
need you know the patreon alternative he's like wants to personally endorse or whatever subscribe

2841
03:31:57,440 --> 03:32:05,680
about star please change your name it's so shit um yeah i mean i don't know is it too is it that bad

2842
03:32:06,160 --> 03:32:10,320
like how bad is it i think i think it's pretty clunky i think it's pretty stupid and clunky

2843
03:32:12,160 --> 03:32:18,320
subscribe star yeah it's pretty it's not it's not it's not great patreon is a lot more it feels

2844
03:32:18,320 --> 03:32:23,280
like off-brand like like something you would like like it there's it's like um it's like it's like

2845
03:32:23,280 --> 03:32:30,640
an off-brand soda it feels like it feels like mr. pibb to to do patreon i mean are you sure you

2846
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:36,160
would continue to feel that way if it became something that a lot of people used or is that

2847
03:32:36,160 --> 03:32:41,120
just your bias is that just your your currency bias or whatever recency i don't know whatever

2848
03:32:42,560 --> 03:32:47,200
i don't think that like the the thing itself is i just think the name is like that i don't i

2849
03:32:47,200 --> 03:32:51,520
i i think the actual thing itself i know what you're saying i'm just saying what if people like

03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:55,600
what if it caught on and it was big and everyone was on subscribe star would it still sound like

2860
03:33:58,320 --> 03:34:04,880
right now by the way i'm just depressed that i haven't gone it makes me so sad it's not that hard i

2861
03:34:04,880 --> 03:34:11,360
know that's the point and i don't know i don't know why i didn't i have like no reason not to

2862
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:18,240
and i just didn't do it been i'm gonna set an alarm shit for you to pasture you Wednesday night to go

2863
03:34:19,760 --> 03:34:27,360
isn't it Thursday i know that's what i'm saying so the night before you know what yeah it'd probably

2864
03:34:27,360 --> 03:34:38,560
be good for me uh i'm saying this up right i'm i have been i mean double-edged sword i have been very

2865
03:34:38,800 --> 03:34:44,240
i've had very little in the way of distraction i've gotten a lot of work done on vapors on the other

2866
03:34:44,240 --> 03:34:56,160
hand i've had like no social life um so you know that's that's that's it that's the thing i i i could

2867
03:34:56,160 --> 03:35:00,880
foresee this being somewhat well okay i mean it obviously depends you might go there it might be

2868
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:04,560
just like shit and make you depressed and feel like no one's ever changed like you described earlier

2869
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:11,840
yep but i don't i don't think it's unlike i don't think if you were to bet if i was a gambling man

2870
03:35:11,840 --> 03:35:18,160
i would not bet against the fact that you might even it might be useful to you to just even just

2871
03:35:18,160 --> 03:35:22,880
to be around other comic people and not even just necessarily show your own thing but though obviously

2872
03:35:22,880 --> 03:35:27,680
that would be an official name but uh to do what i was describing earlier about like i don't know

2873
03:35:27,680 --> 03:35:31,200
i i kind of feel like i'm losing out not really knowing what other comic people or what other

2874
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:37,760
youtubers are up to i feel a little like i'm losing out in that way yeah totally i don't know i you

2875
03:35:37,760 --> 03:35:46,000
know i've thought a lot about that like about my feelings of like complete and utter disconnect

2876
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:56,080
from the like comics community as a thing and and just like i i feel like maybe i this kind of

2877
03:35:56,080 --> 03:36:00,400
come it's sort of related to the whole like you know don't spread yourself too thin you know master

2878
03:36:00,560 --> 03:36:07,200
of one and all uh like you know maybe i should have tried harder to get into that whole thing maybe

2879
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:13,120
i would be maybe i would have a better like network or something if i had like quoted that more

2880
03:36:13,120 --> 03:36:19,120
in some way but i don't know i just don't know i don't even know what i think about i don't even

2881
03:36:19,120 --> 03:36:25,760
know if i think it's good i i mean i'll tell you this bit yeah you go to bostoncomics.com

2882
03:36:25,840 --> 03:36:31,600
and you you you scroll down in boston comics round table it's just bostoncomics.com as the

2883
03:36:31,600 --> 03:36:37,200
is the urinal they have um and they have a promotional image for lgbt comics from the

2884
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:44,240
boston comics round table and it is this image of presumably all of the lgbt comic authors all

2885
03:36:44,240 --> 03:36:51,360
their characters and like a big group shot and this just screams to me like people who go here

2886
03:36:51,360 --> 03:36:59,440
are connected they know who each other are yeah and it is a very clear community that has formed

2887
03:36:59,440 --> 03:37:05,840
here and i think because it's so close to you and it's so related to your work and it's not at all

2888
03:37:05,840 --> 03:37:12,240
hard to go to i think there's almost no reason not to attend this thing i almost no reason not

2889
03:37:12,240 --> 03:37:19,600
i just you know again i have known for this whole year that there's no reason not to

2890
03:37:19,680 --> 03:37:26,400
do i'm just like i just find you know i just find excuses if if hold on i'm i'm gonna i'm

2891
03:37:26,400 --> 03:37:30,560
gonna link to find excuses not to do the thing that i want to do unequivocally

2892
03:37:32,720 --> 03:37:35,840
all right okay boy what boy i'm sure would suck to go do that thing

2893
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:43,440
imagine vincent and magna here it underneath the being true pride flag i can't for you the lgbt

2894
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:49,040
conica it's just too it's too good to be true i you put but you know what maybe i should dream

2895
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:53,600
bigger look look at this shit look all these varied characters you could be one of them

2896
03:37:54,160 --> 03:37:59,040
let me see hold on look look at all these very these varied characters who all look like they

2897
03:37:59,040 --> 03:38:02,240
were designed by someone who just got out of college and they just are a person

2898
03:38:07,360 --> 03:38:10,960
why are you showing me this what you're so are you supposed to be encouraging me

2899
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:19,120
no what okay that's so boring it's so it's so fucking dull oh wait i remember

2900
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:24,480
i remembered why i'm not involved in the comics community or go to any of these things or or

2901
03:38:24,480 --> 03:38:29,440
or care care about this at all is because i'm a big fucking elitist who turns his nose up at

2902
03:38:29,440 --> 03:38:36,160
everyone else's shit the things that's retarded yep that's what and that's what i'm doing that's

2903
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:44,640
doing okay but whatever that image does not fill me with confidence was that drawn by erica

2904
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:49,680
moan was that drawn by erica moan it looks like it was drawn by erica moan but it probably wasn't

2905
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:54,160
it's i don't think she lives here was that drawn by so that person that i hate i don't hate erica

2906
03:38:54,160 --> 03:39:01,840
moan do you know who she is no i have no clue she's the ojoy sex toy lady oh i hate only joy six

2907
03:39:01,840 --> 03:39:08,240
toy i walk out do you there's there's no reason i would i would understand it looks ugly yeah i

2908
03:39:08,240 --> 03:39:15,280
don't fuck you know i like i've said this before i really liked erica moan as a person on strip

2909
03:39:15,280 --> 03:39:24,720
search um all of her work is dumb and bad and bad well i mean i'm not interested in it and i don't

2910
03:39:24,720 --> 03:39:32,720
like it um which is a shame it's like all of her work is the autobio stuff it's like an autobio

2911
03:39:32,720 --> 03:39:41,280
like like like a diary comic that's one that's one big thing she did uh it was oh she did like a

2912
03:39:41,280 --> 03:39:48,080
story comic about like a kid finding a lost bicycle and like having to team up with juggalos or

2913
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:52,720
something which sounds really wacky but it's actually totally pedestrian and fuck i shouldn't

2914
03:39:52,720 --> 03:39:58,720
have killed that guy with a cape um he's actually like a bonus thing you're supposed to collect

2915
03:39:58,720 --> 03:40:04,960
whatever i i thought that's that that's what the child juggalos did during oh no no no that's

2916
03:40:04,960 --> 03:40:08,800
whatever anyway that one was fine but it wasn't that interesting wasn't that funny it's just

2917
03:40:08,800 --> 03:40:14,720
whatever and then she did ojoy ojoy say after going on strip search uh robert coup advised her

2918
03:40:14,720 --> 03:40:20,480
to go in a direction that ended up leading her to ojoy sex toy which naturally was a huge success

2919
03:40:20,480 --> 03:40:26,880
for and made her a billion dollars not really but in comics terms it did and uh everyone hates it

2920
03:40:26,880 --> 03:40:34,400
also what the fuck's the cup what is that is that what it's called what the fuck yeah what the

2921
03:40:34,400 --> 03:40:40,960
fuck yeah what the fuck's the cup oh god it's you know it's pretty funny i don't i don't get

2922
03:40:40,960 --> 03:40:48,560
anything out of ojoy sex toy yeah but whatever you know follow follow your bliss i guess

2923
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:55,120
yeah hey let me let me talk about my let me talk about my sour grapes let me talk about my um

2924
03:40:55,920 --> 03:41:00,560
ben i was unaware that there was any other aspect of your personality other than sour grapes okay

2925
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:05,920
so i was listening so i've been um i've been listening to so i was breeding alone in my room

2926
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:12,720
late one night as i as i often that goes without saying um like in just like layer that on top of

2927
03:41:12,720 --> 03:41:22,000
everything else that i say um i was um i've been listening to the uh fucking i don't don't

2928
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:28,080
ask me why i'm doing this i've been listening to the like penny arcade like a dnd podcast that they do

2929
03:41:28,960 --> 03:41:35,280
um like the c team for example mostly the c team which has as one of its players

2930
03:41:35,280 --> 03:41:43,120
erica or not erica amy falcone um who was on strip search and actually everything i just said

2931
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:49,280
is unrelated there's um okay but there was another thing i saw i saw like an interview

2932
03:41:49,280 --> 03:41:57,360
with amy and um oh god who's the one that did last halloween she was at mice i'm i'm i think

2933
03:41:57,360 --> 03:42:01,280
she also amy whatever the one i did last i'll wait these two contestants that were on strip

2934
03:42:01,280 --> 03:42:07,440
search i saw an interview with them and so the interview is asking them a bunch of stuff

2935
03:42:07,440 --> 03:42:10,880
what because they because they moved in together they briefly became roommates they're talking about

2936
03:42:10,880 --> 03:42:17,600
that and i think one of the questions was something like where would you be where would you be if you

2937
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:25,600
had not been on strip search and they both like laugh sort of nervously and say like oh my god

2938
03:42:25,600 --> 03:42:30,800
like my life would be so bad if i had not been on strip search and i leaned back and i realized that

2939
03:42:31,520 --> 03:42:36,880
ben saint who is not on strip search and living in these two people's personal hell

2940
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:48,320
um what do you think about that i think okay so so you're you're saying like they've made a big

2941
03:42:48,320 --> 03:42:54,080
and they're like they're they're economically big and embarrassed to even consider like like

2942
03:42:54,080 --> 03:42:59,760
like their idea of like oh god if i if i wasn't famous god if that if that hadn't happened like

2943
03:42:59,760 --> 03:43:03,520
everything would suck yeah like like i would just be like toilet in the way just like like

2944
03:43:03,520 --> 03:43:07,600
kind of doing stuff in the void and no one would be reading my stuff yeah and you feel

2945
03:43:07,600 --> 03:43:13,920
like wait a second that's me that's what's happening to me so i i am the failure i'm the bad timeline

2946
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:18,080
yes that's right well you know what the solution has been you have to be on strip search

2947
03:43:19,760 --> 03:43:23,760
you say that like i don't think about that every single day of my life you fucking

2948
03:43:24,080 --> 03:43:31,120
wait okay is it actually still running no that's okay no i would fucking

2949
03:43:32,880 --> 03:43:38,880
god pester them relentlessly let me i mean this is fucking i've talked about this before it's

2950
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:43,760
fucking sad whatever i'll say it again uh like i saw strip search and i was like this is the coolest

2951
03:43:43,760 --> 03:43:48,800
thing ever i want so bad they and they said they were gonna do another one i was like i want so bad

2952
03:43:48,800 --> 03:43:54,880
to be on to be on this to be a part of this um so what i'm gonna do so like i'm like it's for

2953
03:43:54,880 --> 03:43:58,800
me to actually i'm gonna fucking start drawing you know like more than i did before this was one

2954
03:43:58,800 --> 03:44:06,960
of the things that got me like to start taking it more seriously and i was like you know my like i

2955
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:12,560
boy like i hope that like maybe by the time they do strip search too i'll have like you know

2956
03:44:12,560 --> 03:44:17,840
i'll hone my skills i'll have more of a following you know maybe it maybe it could make it happen

2957
03:44:18,800 --> 03:44:25,520
season two never happens and and well and what did i get out of nothing it was all worthless

2958
03:44:27,920 --> 03:44:33,760
it's it's you know what what like what what's a person to do literally what's a person to do

2959
03:44:33,760 --> 03:44:38,480
how do you get ahead in this fucking doggy dog world if you if you can't be in strip search

2960
03:44:38,480 --> 03:44:46,480
what can you do uh i mean i guess you know i mean i guess i'm being kind of a little baby

2961
03:44:46,480 --> 03:44:52,720
about this because like i have the pcp most people don't have the pcp i have the pcp that's

2962
03:44:52,720 --> 03:45:03,760
pretty good that's something it is something i mean yeah um but it's not strip search everything

2963
03:45:03,760 --> 03:45:11,760
else is inferior nothing else matters even even a little bit um then what anyway anyway this

i won got here before you anyway as i was saying jerry jerry jerry and mike just they they got

3013
03:51:44,080 --> 03:51:50,400
they got so successful off the backs of like a stupid gaming webcomic they continue to do out

3014
03:51:50,400 --> 03:51:56,080
of sheer pseudo creative momentum that they can just do shit that nobody cares about except them

3015
03:51:56,080 --> 03:52:00,560
like the fucking irwood nobody gives a shit about the irwood but they're just all about it and they

3016
03:52:00,560 --> 03:52:08,320
love it they have the time of their lives i hate them

3017
03:52:10,320 --> 03:52:14,240
okay there has to be something practical we can do here we have to turn this anger

3018
03:52:14,800 --> 03:52:20,880
in to some sort of like all right how did they get my my guan stones are fucking glitching out

3019
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:27,520
like crazy right now your jio crystals yeah that's right that's right that's correct you did it

3020
03:52:28,480 --> 03:52:35,360
you know what okay i've always been a big proponent of like you know i i feel as though you look at

3021
03:52:35,360 --> 03:52:41,040
like the top youtube creators or the creators in general and like well sure there's luck there and

3022
03:52:41,040 --> 03:52:46,320
you can say they don't have a lot of talent in the way that we would describe it there's obviously

3023
03:52:46,320 --> 03:52:52,640
hard work there yeah but i'm trying like there's obviously like like like uh purified and get where

3024
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:59,040
he was by just being idle and just pure luck no not to say that luck is not in a factor you'd never

3025
03:52:59,040 --> 03:53:05,200
say that you know if you retarded to say that but um there's obviously something actionable there

3026
03:53:05,200 --> 03:53:08,880
where don't you live with don't you know we live in a in a meritocracy month you don't

3027
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:13,520
know that under capitalism everyone always gets exactly what they deserve um everyone has the

3028
03:53:13,520 --> 03:53:19,600
exact same starting uh like like everyone starts the exact same level in every way yeah and and

3029
03:53:19,600 --> 03:53:26,000
they're rewarded proportionally to their you know to the value that they offer to the world 100%

3030
03:53:26,000 --> 03:53:34,880
of the time fuck fuck okay i'm fuck sorry i'm i'm fucking up uh hold on wait one second i just

3031
03:53:34,880 --> 03:53:40,080
find okay hold on one second i'm never never mind actually i'm retarded never mind i was i was

3032
03:53:40,080 --> 03:53:46,320
going i was going to um say that uh i found you google search pewdiepie one of the first thing

3033
03:53:46,400 --> 03:53:51,840
that comes up for me i have no idea why is a video from this person named no life shack

3034
03:53:51,840 --> 03:53:57,680
pewdiepie bitch lasagna reaction first time hearing and i was about to say that uh

3035
03:53:57,680 --> 03:54:02,160
pewdiepie is so famous that even just reaction videos by no one get a million views but this

3036
03:54:02,160 --> 03:54:08,640
guy only has 900 or 900 and one views so i'm now just baffled on why google gave this to me

3037
03:54:08,640 --> 03:54:14,160
and why this was one of the first results when pewdiepie came up same so uh cool great

3038
03:54:15,120 --> 03:54:23,680
what a mystery it the answer is gotta be just like you just try hard right that's gotta be

3039
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:29,280
how the world is i i want to believe yeah but it's not you just no yeah but it's wrong it's wrong

3040
03:54:29,280 --> 03:54:41,200
though it's the only problem there no it can't can't be yeah no sorry it might be i guess

3041
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:47,280
yeah uh and it's very discouraging um

3042
03:54:49,280 --> 03:54:55,840
you know it's such major ass i don't know i'm not convinced that i like it can't be manipulated

3043
03:54:56,640 --> 03:55:06,480
um i mean it's not that it can't be manipulated it's just that it more it gets more of a chance

3044
03:55:06,480 --> 03:55:14,000
there it's just yeah that and there are just um i mean there are ways to manipulate it but not

3045
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:20,400
all of them are possible for everyone and you know there's only so many there's only so many ways to

3046
03:55:20,480 --> 03:55:31,680
do it sure you know to to game the system one way or another you have to quote unquote sell out

3047
03:55:32,560 --> 03:55:38,400
and i guess it's just a matter of personal preference whether um any of the ways you might do

3048
03:55:38,400 --> 03:55:44,080
that are palatable to you and i guess the key is finding a way to do that that is

3049
03:55:44,320 --> 03:55:53,520
hmm but but okay like the most influential art on my entire life home stock yeah i wouldn't say

3050
03:55:53,520 --> 03:56:01,280
is like a selling out product or is like super almost not at all yeah yeah and that's super

3051
03:56:01,280 --> 03:56:09,280
popular you know it's not popular enough and it makes me mad every day that um homestuck is

3052
03:56:09,280 --> 03:56:15,120
remembered as anything other than a than a brilliant masterpiece that like anyone says anything bad

3053
03:56:15,120 --> 03:56:22,560
about homestuck now i hate them they're cowards what what what bubbler okay wait okay what what

3054
03:56:22,560 --> 03:56:30,240
what do you mean that like it's not popular enough it was really popular it was really popular

3055
03:56:30,240 --> 03:56:36,160
like people don't like it anymore people talk shit about it that's what you do like you when

3056
03:56:36,160 --> 03:56:40,560
people say homes when people say homesuck nowadays they don't mean anything good by it

3057
03:56:40,560 --> 03:56:46,560
but that means that that's really determined on who you talk to there are many people who like

3058
03:56:46,560 --> 03:56:53,360
everything about homes okay many people many yes i would say the majority fuck fuck fuck i didn't

3059
03:56:53,360 --> 03:56:58,960
die i didn't die but i'm going to um

3060
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:12,160
oh god i got him and i oh man i landed on a i landed on a mousetrap but as it so happens it

3061
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:22,320
was in the cutscene okay um okay here to conclude that thought uh i just i think that the zeitgeist

3062
03:57:22,400 --> 03:57:27,600
about homestuck now is that it's just sort of an awkward embarrassing thing i think that's

3063
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:31,520
i think that's the general opinion and yeah i know it's got its fans i know a lot of people

3064
03:57:31,520 --> 03:57:35,920
still love it and look back fondly on it and everything i don't think that's the majority

3065
03:57:35,920 --> 03:57:40,640
opinion it makes me mad i'm mad thinking about it right now i can make

3066
03:57:43,840 --> 03:57:48,240
i can make two mistakes i can make two mistakes in this next battle or i'll die

3067
03:57:48,240 --> 03:57:52,480
if i make any more of that it really depends on who you talk to

3068
03:57:54,080 --> 03:57:57,680
like i'm trying to think about like the homesick community okay okay well okay first of all

3069
03:57:57,680 --> 03:58:03,840
the zeitgeist and homesick like faded of like of course like it's nowhere near as popular as it

3070
03:58:03,840 --> 03:58:11,040
once was nobody had about that that's fine i just i think people remember it generally people's

3071
03:58:11,760 --> 03:58:13,680
big like say it with like a roll of their eye

3072
03:58:18,800 --> 03:58:26,880
you know what i actually think i agree but that and maybe not the same way because okay

3073
03:58:26,880 --> 03:58:33,360
fuck i think i think that was an easy one for people to fuck god damn it like this is it that's

3074
03:58:33,360 --> 03:58:39,840
it watch this video oh you're fucked up you died yep yep well i got further than i did before i

3075
03:58:39,920 --> 03:58:46,960
got to a second phase it's uh it's um it's easy for people to watch this and who have

3076
03:58:46,960 --> 03:58:52,000
watched armor shield will be like yeah homesick fucked up but it was good in a lot of ways which

3077
03:58:52,000 --> 03:58:57,920
is my opinion that it's my favorite thing in the entire world and it makes me mad when i think

3078
03:58:57,920 --> 03:59:01,920
about certain aspects of it but like what i want it to not have happened because it makes me upset

3079
03:59:01,920 --> 03:59:09,440
in some ways of course not homesick is the best art ever made yeah um but i think okay i think

3080
03:59:09,440 --> 03:59:14,080
the majority opinion knowing what i know about the homesick community which i wouldn't say that

3081
03:59:14,080 --> 03:59:18,320
okay i'm in bro hold on hold on hold on hold on if we're talking about the homestuck community

3082
03:59:18,320 --> 03:59:26,560
specifically i mean obviously it's going to be fondly remembered you know there uh i'm talking

3083
03:59:26,560 --> 03:59:32,800
about like the world at large i mean who like i don't mean the homesick community as it like

3084
03:59:32,800 --> 03:59:39,360
it currently exists i mean like like like seeing the the the dialogue of it transform over the years

3085
03:59:39,360 --> 03:59:43,520
and like people who used to be in homesick who aren't into homesick anymore taking them into

3086
03:59:43,520 --> 03:59:51,520
account i don't mean like just like like r slash homestuck okay i mean i i do mean the world at

3087
03:59:51,520 --> 03:59:56,720
large i think the general opinion well well to me the world at large includes people that never

3088
03:59:56,720 --> 04:00:03,920
read homesick okay well okay we just like have an opinion of it because like they don't like cosplayers

3089
04:00:03,920 --> 04:00:14,560
of it yeah hmm yeah okay i can i can see your point i would say okay all of the people who have

3090
04:00:14,560 --> 04:00:19,280
read homestuck i would say doesn't just piss you right the fuck off the people have the

3119
04:03:18,480 --> 04:03:25,360
some human core shit some human involved like human core ak just involving people in any capacity

3120
04:03:25,360 --> 04:03:27,920
that's right that's correct god look at them howl

3121
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:37,120
listen to the howling mob of blackheads in the street

3122
04:03:37,360 --> 04:03:42,320
i took a picture with leopards and the whole town's on its feet

3123
04:03:43,600 --> 04:03:49,120
he is dangerous ahead of its time does it have you know who could have predicted you know who would

3124
04:03:49,120 --> 04:03:53,360
have known they would have they would predict the rise of the unit and the uh and the gig economy

3125
04:03:56,880 --> 04:04:04,000
tyco won't you listen to me i've been your right hand man all along but every comic you make today

3126
04:04:04,080 --> 04:04:11,680
gets twisted around some other way you don't even plug my patreon this is you know next to you

3127
04:04:11,680 --> 04:04:18,160
seeing that tyco you're the judas to his jesus i wish i wish you know maybe the maybe the grass

3128
04:04:22,240 --> 04:04:30,080
i mean he got a whole movie about him um maybe maybe it's like grass is always greener it just

3129
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:36,400
it just seems to me right from an outsider looking in right outside of looking in perspective

3130
04:04:36,400 --> 04:04:43,280
it seems to me like you meet the penny arcade guys under any circumstances you make them like you

3131
04:04:43,280 --> 04:04:49,040
you become their friend and from then on your whole life is just a fucking it's just a fucking

3132
04:04:50,080 --> 04:04:56,480
it's just a fucking it's just a no he fucking broke my water barrel idiot quick restart and from

3133
04:04:56,560 --> 04:05:00,400
then on you just play d&d and fuck around for the rest of your life and you just have a great time

3134
04:05:01,360 --> 04:05:06,000
well okay well actually okay i want to say something because i feel like it was too obvious

3135
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:10,400
and i didn't say it because it was obvious but i actually feel like it might not be obvious

3136
04:05:10,400 --> 04:05:19,120
so i should say it please uh it's the the way to accomplish things is how the way that we have

3137
04:05:19,120 --> 04:05:24,720
accrued our success which is tied into what everyone else is doing that's collaboration i don't mean

3138
04:05:24,720 --> 04:05:30,800
like in a nebulous sense i mean uh like like i described in my college essay it's weaseling

3139
04:05:30,800 --> 04:05:36,480
into people's inner circles it's just it's 100 percent trying to be a no good weasel and just

3140
04:05:36,480 --> 04:05:42,160
trying to get people to like you you gotta wait what you're a star fucker munchie i am a star

3141
04:05:42,160 --> 04:05:49,280
fucker um by the way um i've shown that our fngr video to people like my like offline friends

3142
04:05:49,280 --> 04:05:54,480
obviously have no idea who fngr is or i have like a vague notion that like i make youtube videos

3143
04:05:54,480 --> 04:05:59,440
sometimes and so to them just like imagine like one of you like your friend like imagine like like

3144
04:05:59,440 --> 04:06:04,880
like little john just comes into your room and uh it's like hey i there's someone make a hit like a

3145
04:06:04,880 --> 04:06:10,720
hit video on me and he's listening it's just like a slimy fucking snake star fucker like like

3146
04:06:10,720 --> 04:06:15,680
mongoloid like munchie like or john like i hate you with all my heart and you and you will be the

3147
04:06:15,680 --> 04:06:21,840
downfall of everyone in in your life yeah and how jarring that would be oh that's it's great it's a

3148
04:06:21,840 --> 04:06:29,440
great experience it's um well what do they what do they say about it i'm curious they like can't

3149
04:06:29,440 --> 04:06:33,600
believe it or also are extremely confused they don't understand what he's saying half the time

3150
04:06:33,600 --> 04:06:38,880
because he speaks in such a way i mean that's just that's just fngr for you yeah um so okay

3151
04:06:40,160 --> 04:06:45,280
i don't know i don't know how much we can learn from that specifically but anyway okay so think

3152
04:06:45,280 --> 04:06:50,880
about like like that's that's very interesting if you didn't like just mention the fact that you

3153
04:06:50,880 --> 04:06:56,960
like digi in that one episode if you didn't become the tbap q and a yeah the tbap q and a or you know

3154
04:06:56,960 --> 04:07:03,760
with the other guys you wouldn't have a nearly the same audience that you do now yes the pcp would

3155
04:07:03,760 --> 04:07:11,200
not have happened and so on and so forth yes so i mean it's the answer is somewhat obvious it's

3156
04:07:11,200 --> 04:07:21,440
just a manner of how to in the brody community so small i bet so i so and yeah it's easy to think

3157
04:07:21,440 --> 04:07:26,960
if define people to like you just like and and express the fact that you like them and whoops

3158
04:07:26,960 --> 04:07:32,480
today isn't your best friends now it there's it's so easy to become a big fish in a small pond

3159
04:07:32,480 --> 04:07:38,240
and stuff like that whereas when you're dealing with like the idea of comics like the the comics

3160
04:07:38,320 --> 04:07:46,160
community that ranges from so many different things it's so hard to get into quote-unquote

3161
04:07:46,800 --> 04:07:52,400
with with when you're in a fandom it's so easy to be on the same page just watch the

3162
04:07:52,400 --> 04:07:56,880
latest episode of a show read the latest update of a comic you like that you can now discuss it

3163
04:07:57,440 --> 04:08:01,600
when you're you need to be in like the comics community it's like do we have to read all

3164
04:08:01,600 --> 04:08:10,480
comics now i don't want to do that no how fucking how could you um i've been thinking about this in

3165
04:08:10,480 --> 04:08:16,320
in with respect with respect to the whole round table thing it's really it's really actually

3166
04:08:16,320 --> 04:08:22,320
pretty surreal that you like brought up the round table on this episode because i had

3167
04:08:22,320 --> 04:08:28,320
been like thinking about it personally a bunch lately um i mean i have as well since i plan to

3168
04:08:28,320 --> 04:08:39,040
go there as soon as i am able to yeah um wait pause pause no okay um

3169
04:08:42,160 --> 04:08:47,840
oh i fuck what was i talking about i lost my i lost my train oh oh i was i was thinking about like

3170
04:08:48,560 --> 04:08:58,720
i don't know you want you want to get out there into a community to like make connections

3171
04:08:58,720 --> 04:09:05,520
right and like make friends make associates people to collab with or just be or just people

3172
04:09:05,520 --> 04:09:09,680
to like that you like and you like spending time with you know i think that's what a friend is

3173
04:09:10,320 --> 04:09:18,800
supposed to be uh if i if i if i recall my uh my latin um so you know you want you want to you

3174
04:09:18,800 --> 04:09:25,600
want to get out there in the world and do all that but like specifically with regards to like

3175
04:09:25,600 --> 04:09:35,280
making connections networking um i just have listen i know this is wrong i'm just i'm just like

3176
04:09:35,280 --> 04:09:44,400
afraid to like waste my time on people that have no i i know i know how that sounds and i'm

3177
04:09:47,200 --> 04:09:51,680
i don't mean to say that like oh like i see everyone as like a potential business connection

3178
04:09:51,680 --> 04:09:54,880
and if they have nothing material to offer me then i don't want anything to do with them

3179
04:09:54,880 --> 04:10:01,360
that's not even what i mean but just in in the in the i mean look i did this podcast with low art

3180
04:10:01,360 --> 04:10:05,600
i tried to make this i tried to make this book with this audiobook with fucking oh lilia

3181
04:10:05,600 --> 04:10:10,880
they i mean low art might still come through eventually but these guys they oh lilia might

3182
04:10:10,880 --> 04:10:15,520
too if i fucking pass through him for another who knows how long but the point is you know

3183
04:10:15,520 --> 04:10:20,480
people flake on you you waste your time you you invest your time what do you get back for it

3184
04:10:20,480 --> 04:10:27,920
you know usually nothing um and i mean i guess you just gotta keep chugging away at it

3185
04:10:27,920 --> 04:10:36,320
but it's just not a very it's not it's not very exciting to me doesn't sound great i

3186
04:10:36,320 --> 04:10:40,240
i talked about this on the pcp and i and i don't want to harp on it more but it's

3187
04:10:40,240 --> 04:10:45,680
a derid rate for this conversation since it's relevant i have been craving the fandom connection

3188
04:10:45,680 --> 04:10:50,960
for a while now and it's hard to get into because i don't know what i mean by the

3189
04:10:50,960 --> 04:10:57,200
fandom connection uh sort of what i just described a moment ago where it feels like

3190
04:10:58,640 --> 04:11:03,840
i don't have any connection to people like i don't really have anything to talk about with

3191
04:11:03,840 --> 04:11:09,440
other people because my entrance art shows where it's easy to communicate with people on a forum

3192
04:11:09,440 --> 04:11:16,640
or on tumblr or on a subreddit my interests are more abstract now like for instance i don't go on

3193
04:11:16,640 --> 04:11:21,760
the homestuck subreddit because while i like homestuck they don't really interact with it in

3194
04:11:21,760 --> 04:11:26,640
the way that i want to and i don't really know if i want to spend my time in that particularly

3195
04:11:26,640 --> 04:11:35,120
but sure i i just i felt like again i think a lot of this is like nostalgia a lot of this is no

3196
04:11:35,120 --> 04:11:39,760
depth like i just want things to be the way they were before but i do think there's so you know

3197
04:11:39,760 --> 04:11:45,040
things aren't the way they were before you wouldn't even recognize me anymore not that you you know

3198
04:11:45,040 --> 04:11:51,040
what i'm doing it's linkin park lyrics munchie linkin park get fucking educated um i've never

3199
04:11:51,040 --> 04:11:57,440
seen the room anyway i uh i i think there's something real there where it's like when you're

3200
04:11:57,440 --> 04:12:05,120
a part of a community and you're a fan of something it's so easy to make connections with other fans

3201
04:12:05,120 --> 04:12:13,280
of that specific thing for instance okay like you listener you fucking you you whoever the hell you

3202
04:12:13,280 --> 04:12:22,960
are fucking a frame yeah you are specifically yeah yeah um you bedfellow card card god koonrat

3203
04:12:22,960 --> 04:12:29,520
cheeky chicken crypto coin lever dolphin boy madish rampage marco boko uh deviated dr plague

3204
04:12:29,520 --> 04:12:36,480
frame matt uh steel viper arrow it's yeah you guys uh you are what i'm talking about i think

3205
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:42,400
a lot about this and how it relates to endless war think about how great it would be to be an

3206
04:12:42,400 --> 04:12:48,400
endless war fan you have all these people uh based around this really small community

3207
04:12:48,400 --> 04:12:51,680
and it's not a lot of people but because it's not a lot of people and it's something that you

3208
04:12:51,680 --> 04:12:57,040
care about a lot it's so easy to make connections and to make fans to make friends i hear you yeah

3209
04:12:57,040 --> 04:13:02,640
imagine how yeah yeah you know imagine being able to like endless war instead of having it

3210
04:13:02,640 --> 04:13:08,080
just be a ball and chain around your ankle you know what i mean literally yeah yeah yeah fuck yeah

3211
04:13:08,560 --> 04:13:15,600
i i feel like like i envy that a lot i really do i really envy just being able to like

3212
04:13:15,600 --> 04:13:20,800
make friends and do stuff and like i feel like i've made friends a lot with the people in here

3213
04:13:20,800 --> 04:13:27,360
this is a thing that that wraps into what i'm you know yeah when you're a fan of something

3214
04:13:27,360 --> 04:13:32,240
right you're passionate about something you want to you want to share that passion with others you

3215
04:13:32,880 --> 04:13:39,600
you want to you know the community whatever the fuck you know um i just want to say by the way

3216
04:13:39,600 --> 04:13:47,680
that i want this like just to be a fan again i want to have that because okay before i cut down my

3217
04:13:47,680 --> 04:13:55,520
discord list i was in like 30 different servers all of them combined like the amount of unique

3218
04:13:55,520 --> 04:14:02,960
users was less than 100 probably yeah like in what in what in what in what in across the

3219
04:14:02,960 --> 04:14:08,560
discord servers what i mean by that is that like i was just surrounded by the same same people over

3220
04:14:08,560 --> 04:14:16,240
and over and over again who i talk to on a daily basis but fans of the pcp i communicate exclusively

3221
04:14:16,240 --> 04:14:23,200
with people who like know all there is to know about me in a way i and who are like fans of me

3222
04:14:23,200 --> 04:14:28,480
in a way and that doesn't like i don't think that legitimizes our relationship in any way but it's

3223
04:14:28,480 --> 04:14:35,280
just well i kind of want to be anonymous in a way sometimes maybe that's a little bit of a harsh

3224
04:14:35,280 --> 04:14:40,800
statement but like i just want to like exist i mean i can be anonymous of that context i mean

3225
04:14:40,800 --> 04:14:47,280
i can be anonymous in real life anytime i want uh i don't know i think there's something to be

3226
04:14:47,280 --> 04:14:52,000
something i want to be a part of a community where the community is not about me yeah i just want

3227
04:14:52,080 --> 04:14:57,600
to be a fan of something else again and be able to meet different people i feel so stifled by the

3228
04:14:57,600 --> 04:15:02,480
pcp audience i don't want to sound ungrateful at all i don't want to sound like so i have so many

3229
04:15:02,480 --> 04:15:07,360
fans but like it is a real feel that i have or i just i want to have different connections this is

3230
04:15:07,360 --> 04:15:13,040
this is kind of related who the cheat trigger finger do i want that i think i want that do i

3231
04:15:13,040 --> 04:15:17,200
have the money for i don't know okay what you're saying it's kind of related to what i was going

3232
04:15:17,200 --> 04:15:21,600
to say but you're coming at it from like a different angle the community angle i don't

3233
04:15:21,600 --> 04:15:32,880
have a i don't feel stifled by um you know a community well okay then yeah i just want to

3234
04:15:32,880 --> 04:15:39,040
say real quick i think i think the distinction here is to be frank you have your own identity you

3235
04:15:39,040 --> 04:15:46,320
have your own content that you have a you have your own unique sort of brand i i don't have that

3236
04:15:46,320 --> 04:15:52,640
i don't i don't i don't know if i'd say that i mean i understand what you're getting at

3237
04:15:54,000 --> 04:15:59,200
it i mean is what you're saying that like your identity is more tied to the pcp specifically

3238
04:15:59,200 --> 04:16:04,640
than mine yes yeah okay well that that might be true um

3239
04:16:05,360 --> 04:16:07,360
um

3240
04:16:10,240 --> 04:16:16,400
to an extent i mean i don't think it's as dire as all that but okay whatever i go what you're

3241
04:16:16,400 --> 04:16:23,600
saying i'll at least begin um my what i was coming at it was not the the problem of like you

3242
04:16:23,600 --> 04:16:32,240
know the community or whatever whatever um my my problem is it's it's it's it's i i would kind

3243
04:16:32,320 --> 04:16:38,240
of like to be a fan again i know i get i get you but like what am i passionate about

3244
04:16:39,360 --> 04:16:44,240
and you know it i don't know if this is like narcissistic but like what i'm passionate about

3245
04:16:44,240 --> 04:16:51,520
is my stuff like to the almost to the almost to the exclusion of everything not to the exclusion

3246
04:16:51,520 --> 04:16:59,680
but like to an extent that dwarfs everything else like i used to i used to go to like parties

3247
04:16:59,680 --> 04:17:04,400
or something and i and people would be you know oh everyone's a nerd there everyone's a geek you

3248
04:17:04,400 --> 04:17:08,320
know they're all involved in the geek culture and they're all excited they were talking about like

3249
04:17:08,320 --> 04:17:14,240
you know marvel movies like talking about lord of the rings talking about stuff that they liked

3250
04:17:15,120 --> 04:17:19,600
and i mean god i don't want to sound like an elitist because i don't judge them for that

3251
04:17:20,160 --> 04:17:26,560
i don't think that they're stupid for liking those things i i'm just i'm just i can't do it

3252
04:17:26,880 --> 04:17:33,600
you know then i completely agree with you and it's the subject of much personal strike

3253
04:17:34,160 --> 04:17:40,400
yeah because i i too like i don't play video games unless it's specifically with another person

3254
04:17:40,400 --> 04:17:44,400
and i can kind of justify in the sense that like i'm doing it with another person it's a social

3255
04:17:44,400 --> 04:17:50,880
experience i don't read things television shows fucking terrifying me i could never watch like

3256
04:17:50,880 --> 04:17:58,160
two seasons of something that you're joking me every million yeah i feel i feel maybe once every

3257
04:17:58,160 --> 04:18:03,680
like a couple months maybe dude yeah okay you get it you totally get it okay no i told i totally

3258
04:18:03,680 --> 04:18:08,320
get it then when i wake up i just think okay what do i want to do with today what art do i want to

3259
04:18:08,320 --> 04:18:14,960
create today to like the absolute like complete detriment like like what have i consumed in the

3260
04:18:14,960 --> 04:18:20,160
in the last week literally could not tell you probably the same games i played a thousand times

3261
04:18:20,160 --> 04:18:27,040
together for like maybe 30 minutes i can't think of a new thing i've watched oh i recently started

3262
04:18:27,040 --> 04:18:31,840
watching you know you know this is somewhat personal by recent started watching orange is new black

3263
04:18:31,840 --> 04:18:39,360
with kazi but like i had to stop because i got literally too intimidated by sheer length and

3264
04:18:39,360 --> 04:18:46,160
i was just like i just can't watch this i i can't watch a tv show that goes on that long

3265
04:18:46,800 --> 04:18:52,400
mmm it's just it's so much time i can't do it i can't watch television shows what's like what's

3266
04:18:52,400 --> 04:19:00,880
like i can't justify it what's like this i would like to have the experience of having you know

3267
04:19:01,600 --> 04:19:06,560
having something that i'm passionate about something i'm a fan of right and then like

3268
04:19:06,960 --> 04:19:17,440
becoming like having a community centered around that thing and like you know meeting people through

3269
04:19:17,440 --> 04:19:27,040
our like shared love of this thing yeah yeah yeah and okay but i'm i'm so sort of single-mindedly

3270
04:19:28,000 --> 04:19:35,760
uh uh devoted to like my own shit to the point that it kind of hampers my ability to engage with

3271
04:19:35,760 --> 04:19:42,800
other things completely agree and i hate it and i'm i'm so much like that but like and that might

3272
04:19:42,800 --> 04:19:50,080
be fine that might be fine if but like my like for that for that to fill that community void my

3273
04:19:50,960 --> 04:19:56,000
fan base or if you want to call it my yeah like my the community centered around my

3274
04:19:56,000 --> 04:20:00,880
shit would have to be bigger and it would have to be growing faster it doesn't there's not

3275
04:20:00,960 --> 04:20:07,280
not i don't have if i had like a vast following that was like way invested in like

3276
04:20:08,080 --> 04:20:11,360
like if ever like tons and tons of people talking about like oh what's the next chapter

3277
04:20:11,360 --> 04:20:14,800
gonna be oh what's the next thing he's gonna make whatever like i'm i want to talk about it like

3278
04:20:14,800 --> 04:20:19,680
like i could probably just engage with that and it would be fine but it's not enough i don't have

3279
04:20:19,680 --> 04:20:25,040
enough of a following that that fills the void for me do you know what i mean not not at the rate

3280
04:20:25,040 --> 04:20:29,840
not at the rate at which i produce content which based on which because of the format i produce

3281
04:20:29,840 --> 04:20:37,440
content in is just not that fast i i just think about how every single day like like all i do

3282
04:20:38,160 --> 04:20:43,360
is think about what i want to create and what i like like you know i think about in this war

3283
04:20:43,360 --> 04:20:47,920
updates i can make i think about like ways i could implement it and it techniques a quick draw

3284
04:20:47,920 --> 04:20:55,680
and it's so draining in a way not like i don't want to sound ungrateful i love the fact i love my

3285
04:20:55,680 --> 04:21:00,880
fans i love the fact that i'm able to do this i'm very privileged and it's fun like i would not

3286
04:21:00,880 --> 04:21:05,600
be doing our unless it was literally just fun for me to do and i'm sure i would be doing it

3287
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:13,840
regardless yeah it's it's just that like it's like where am i gonna find the time to do other things

3288
04:21:14,640 --> 04:21:21,440
never when am i ever going to like wake up and there's a distinction here that i want to make

3289
04:21:21,440 --> 04:21:27,120
where it's like if i'm hanging out with friends which is something that i do somewhat often but

3290
04:21:27,680 --> 04:21:33,520
by that i mean like you know i'm paying them calls with people i can sometimes you consider watching

3291
04:21:33,520 --> 04:21:38,720
something or playing something though honestly not even that often i can't think of a single

3292
04:21:38,720 --> 04:21:46,080
fucking scenario where i would be at my computer and not at least thinking about my art i might be

3293
04:21:46,080 --> 04:21:52,320
absentmindedly consuming some media like like youtube videos i find no community or any sort of like

3294
04:21:53,120 --> 04:21:59,840
like i don't feel part of like a youtuber's audience or anything like that no whatsoever

3295
04:21:59,840 --> 04:22:04,960
yeah i might be doing that but there's never a moment where like i'm seriously like watching a show

3296
04:22:05,680 --> 04:22:12,240
watching a movie reading a comic and then like i want to discuss that like i cannot imagine that

3297
04:22:12,240 --> 04:22:19,040
and it's stupid it's dumb and it's bad for my art it's stifling me creatively i feel like i'm so

3298
04:22:19,040 --> 04:22:26,080
insular just like like it's it's bad for my art it's bad for my like my mental health i think to be

3299
04:22:26,080 --> 04:22:33,520
so like i don't have that barrier of people interacting with me yeah it's just bad but i

3300
04:22:33,520 --> 04:22:39,360
can't stop all i want to do is make suffer endless war all i want to do is do that because i'm just

3301
04:22:39,360 --> 04:22:52,160
fucking dumb i guess um boy uh i'm it's not that i didn't think you would understand but i am

3302
04:22:52,160 --> 04:22:57,840
surprised at the extent to which you are articulating the way that i feel about this kind of thing

3303
04:22:58,720 --> 04:23:03,280
you know then it's time like these where i where i remember that i think i think you're my friend

3304
04:23:03,280 --> 04:23:07,040
i think that we have we have similar elves on life and that's why we talk to each other

3305
04:23:10,560 --> 04:23:16,480
is that canon is that canon though i don't know if that's i don't know i don't know i i think i

3306
04:23:16,480 --> 04:23:20,560
think i'm still gonna command my child's soldiers to destroy your child's soldiers there we go that's

3307
04:23:20,560 --> 04:23:25,520
what i thought that's what i thought the deal was but i'm glad you reminded me of the deal i wouldn't

3308
04:23:25,520 --> 04:23:31,760
by the way buy fuck energy from slime corp dot com uh buy and bulk thirty eight dollars per uh

3309
04:23:31,760 --> 04:23:43,360
four pack for some you know energy yeah from fuck city um yeah yeah oh maybe this sounds

3310
04:23:43,360 --> 04:23:49,360
fuck city anymore i i like to call it once in a while just to throw people off yeah it's like the

3311
04:23:49,360 --> 04:23:57,680
big apple that's like calling new york the big apple um uh maybe this sounds weird to people

3312
04:23:57,680 --> 04:24:03,200
like to the to the kinds of people who are listening to this right now it probably sounds weird

3313
04:24:03,200 --> 04:24:09,120
right to that okay i wonder i wonder constantly to what extent

3314
04:24:11,920 --> 04:24:17,920
what if what if like everyone what if everyone was like me what if everyone who was like

3315
04:24:18,560 --> 04:24:24,160
listening to rfck watching endless war was like me listening to penny arcade

3316
04:24:24,160 --> 04:24:33,360
shit or or or and not not even fully engaged with it on a level where i'm like i'm like this

3317
04:24:34,080 --> 04:24:38,480
but like to a large extent of my fucking brain processes is like

3318
04:24:38,800 --> 04:24:42,960
like coveting you know what i mean

3319
04:24:46,960 --> 04:24:52,240
and we're so fucking pathetic we should be wiped off the map oh no what i mean we should

3320
04:24:52,240 --> 04:24:57,920
despawn we should fucking despawn wait we are you saying we plural yeah we plural do you know what

3321
04:24:57,920 --> 04:25:03,360
i mean do you i i of course i know i just want to be here you say that i just want to be here you

3322
04:25:04,080 --> 04:25:10,080
know i i of course i i feel that i feel that way about other people completely unjustified

3323
04:25:10,080 --> 04:25:15,040
yeah i feel that i feel the way about other people in the pcp completely unjustified and i wonder

3324
04:25:15,040 --> 04:25:18,880
well i mean it makes me wonder how many people are listening to this feeling the exact same way

3325
04:25:18,880 --> 04:25:25,200
about me like like like to me hearing amy falcone say if i hadn't been on strip search my life would

3326
04:25:25,200 --> 04:25:31,200
be shit and i think i have been on rfck my life and i yeah and i think i'm living i'm living her

3327
04:25:31,200 --> 04:25:36,960
personal hell and then someone listens to this and i and and one of us says like yeah if we hadn't

3328
04:25:36,960 --> 04:25:42,960
like formed a horseshoe crew made the pcp my life would be shit and they think i'm living their

3329
04:25:42,960 --> 04:25:48,880
personal hell and this and it's just and it's just hell all the way down it's just it's just

3330
04:25:48,880 --> 04:25:56,720
hell within hell i i i want to iterate to our fans that don't mistake the meaning in any way

3331
04:25:57,440 --> 04:26:07,440
i envy you i wish i was you so badly i don't you're nothing you're nothing i i want like

3332
04:26:07,440 --> 04:26:14,000
can you imagine if i like if i found in this war and how much you would gel with me because i

3333
04:26:14,000 --> 04:26:20,320
created it sure you know well yeah like i mean i mean it's not gonna it's not going to appeal to

3334
04:26:20,320 --> 04:26:27,760
anyone as much as you or that would be like a miracle if it did yeah yeah yeah yeah it like

3335
04:26:28,480 --> 04:26:35,360
i i i can imagine this would be frustrating to people you're gonna talk i i yeah totally they

3336
04:26:35,360 --> 04:26:41,200
don't get it and i don't want to sound like i'm imagining listening i'm imagining listening to

3337
04:26:41,200 --> 04:26:46,480
like amy falcone say this kind of stuff and i'm and i would be my reaction would be

3338
04:26:46,720 --> 04:26:53,120
be fuck you you are so fucking privileged you have no idea like what what i what i wouldn't

3339
04:26:53,120 --> 04:26:57,760
what i wouldn't have given fuck what i wouldn't give to have had the opportunities that you have had

3340
04:26:58,880 --> 04:27:08,240
die i i think this kind of goes back to this is what that's a lot of things in my life i i i'm

3341
04:27:08,240 --> 04:27:13,840
really like even though it's like it's fun it's funny the fact that i feel this way i feel like

3342
04:27:13,840 --> 04:27:19,920
weirdly like a camaraderie now yeah yeah yeah i want to talk about it and i want to

3343
04:27:19,920 --> 04:27:25,600
edit it because i'm ashamed of it and i don't say i express it and i don't express it um you know

3344
04:27:25,600 --> 04:27:30,800
like this it's funny that i say it's funny that i think this about these people specifically these

3345
04:27:30,800 --> 04:27:36,480
are not like famous people these are what the fuck okay sorry i'm mimic just attack me and it's

3346
04:27:36,480 --> 04:27:40,560
sorrowing me a little bit like these like these are not like huge person amy falcone has like

3347
04:27:40,560 --> 04:27:47,040
four thousand twitch followers this is not this is not like a fucking i think that might be you what

3348
04:27:47,600 --> 04:27:51,920
maybe maybe because like it's like it's closer like it's more tantalizing and close like i don't

3349
04:27:51,920 --> 04:27:56,000
like i'm not going to think about like what if i was what if i was a Bradley Cooper what if i was

3350
04:27:56,000 --> 04:28:02,080
yeah i was gonna say ninja but like you know whatever someone same thing someone huge well yeah

3351
04:28:02,080 --> 04:28:09,120
i'm not like like oh man i could have been like um i don't know who's fucking giant i mean i don't

3352
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:17,920
want to say pew yeah pewdiepie yeah that's right um insane should be your new intro that's right

3353
04:28:17,920 --> 04:28:24,800
you're correct uh well yeah you solved it you cracked it you know we're wondering how do you

3354
04:28:24,800 --> 04:28:34,000
grow how do you grow your audience you just say the things he says yeah that's it you just say

3355
04:28:34,000 --> 04:28:39,520
pewdiepie that's my god i got my new catchphrase it's pewdiepie subscribe oh the youtube algorithm

3356
04:28:39,520 --> 04:28:43,200
will detect that you say pewdiepie i assume that you are pewdiepie and then recommend you to all

3357
04:28:43,200 --> 04:28:47,200
pewdiepie subscribers that's how you do it that's how you do it you gotta trick the algorithm

3358
04:28:48,320 --> 04:28:53,120
it's not about it's not about making appealing content it's about tricking a computer to promote

3359
04:28:53,120 --> 04:29:00,800
you it is though for real that's true a few things in my life yeah uh just ties into me

3360
04:29:00,800 --> 04:29:06,560
wanting to streamline my time this ties into me wanting to go to college and sort of almost

3361
04:29:07,840 --> 04:29:11,360
okay i don't i don't want to sound like a drama queen i don't want to sound

3362
04:29:12,160 --> 04:29:18,800
brash but sort of rethinking the way i've led my life in a way and sort of re-questioning

3363
04:29:18,800 --> 04:29:25,040
if i want to continue my life in the way that i've been living it in a way yeah where i think

3364
04:29:25,120 --> 04:29:31,280
streamlining my content has or a streamlining like like the way i think about work is not so

3365
04:29:31,280 --> 04:29:41,360
that i can work on my art better which it is but i want to try and force myself to socialize the

3366
04:29:41,360 --> 04:29:50,560
people who don't think of me as like a person they watch on youtube you know yeah i i really

3367
04:29:50,640 --> 04:29:56,960
want to try i have not done this whatsoever this is going to be a complete failure so far of me

3368
04:29:56,960 --> 04:30:01,600
trying to streamline my my life and my work and just try and socialize in general this is one of

3369
04:30:01,600 --> 04:30:08,320
the main tenets of of the year of more which i wanted to accomplish year of more i've not

3370
04:30:08,320 --> 04:30:16,880
described this uh it sounds familiar but i don't remember what the year of more is well it is a

3371
04:30:16,880 --> 04:30:21,840
yearly theme that i've been talking to for this year that i thought up in i think February or

3372
04:30:21,840 --> 04:30:27,520
maybe january where it's uh i have a theme for the year which i'm trying to live my life by and

3373
04:30:27,520 --> 04:30:33,840
i'm trying to uh accomplish oh you're trying to live moss i'm trying to live moss um say

3374
04:30:33,840 --> 04:30:40,000
he's speaking of live live live moss one of kazi's roommates won the talk about live moss

3375
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:44,560
scholarship and she got college for free because she because just because you live because you

3376
04:30:44,560 --> 04:30:49,440
lived moss yeah because she lived moss and she is currently living moss right now that's that's

3377
04:30:49,440 --> 04:30:57,120
cool that's pretty cool um so i live moss that's that's fucking

3378
04:30:59,440 --> 04:31:04,320
okay this is gonna sound negative and normally it would be but i don't even think it's bad in

3379
04:31:04,320 --> 04:31:10,960
this case it's a little dystopian the live the live moss college scholarship yeah yeah yeah i

3380
04:31:11,520 --> 04:31:16,640
if you look something from idiocracy it does it totally does yeah but i like it but you know

3381
04:31:16,640 --> 04:31:22,000
but rarely in a way that i like and i'm totally behind 100 yeah it's it's really sick it's really

3382
04:31:22,000 --> 04:31:27,200
fucking sick yeah i wish that i got to live my scholarship i mean of course that's that's literally

3383
04:31:27,200 --> 04:31:33,040
the only reason it exists is so that people that don't get it would wish that they did yeah increase

3384
04:31:33,040 --> 04:31:39,040
brand awareness okay but anyway i've been trying to branch out my life in a lot of different ways

3385
04:31:39,040 --> 04:31:43,600
i've taken the the the the the word more i mean a lot you've taken the pepsi challenge and you

3386
04:31:43,600 --> 04:31:48,080
want the pepsi i want to do the momo challenge and i'm failing spectacular i think i'm afraid i might

3387
04:31:48,080 --> 04:31:52,880
kill myself soon well uh okay all right we'll keep we'll keep up and you never have back

3388
04:31:52,880 --> 04:32:03,600

3389
04:32:03,600 --> 04:32:10,320
a contract uh that's uh i'm not allowed to say i'm not allowed to reveal the nature i just you

3390
04:32:10,320 --> 04:32:14,800
know like don't don't ask me these questions don't ask me these things i'll i'll be i'll be revealed

3391
04:32:14,800 --> 04:32:19,440
in in due time uh this was one of the main things i was thinking about in february or whenever i came

3392
04:32:19,440 --> 04:32:26,560
with this and i wanted to branch out more in like art as well as in social life and before you say

3393
04:32:26,560 --> 04:32:31,680
you want to live moss just keep saying i want i wanted to live moss in a lot of different ways

3394
04:32:31,680 --> 04:32:38,640
what the fuck what oh sorry i gotta i have a familiar i have a uh sick familiar now um

3395
04:32:38,640 --> 04:32:43,840
neat what would you look like well he is his sir junkin he's a piece he's like a dirty paper bag

3396
04:32:44,400 --> 04:32:49,520
and he's currently wearing a knight's helmet and if i upgrade him i can turn him into like an

3397
04:32:49,520 --> 04:32:57,360
angelic crusader that's cool that's really cool i that okay that's my new goal okay i got him i

3398
04:32:57,360 --> 04:33:02,560
just got him a shield okay am i new giving up giving up giving up giving up yeah just give up

3399
04:33:02,560 --> 04:33:08,880
well no no i can pursue them both in parallel okay okay so i wanted to animate more i wanted to

3400
04:33:08,880 --> 04:33:13,840
animate which i'm doing and it's great and i almost you know the way tom describes things where it's

3401
04:33:13,840 --> 04:33:18,880
like 3d clicked with his brain in a way that other art memes didn't uh i feel the way about animation

3402
04:33:18,880 --> 04:33:24,400
i fucking adore it and it's great i feel that way about drawing in general that it just clicked with

3403
04:33:24,400 --> 04:33:32,080
me in a way that like i got decent at it in like like faster than i think most people do

3404
04:33:32,080 --> 04:33:36,080
and it just made like intuitive sense to me in a way that i think it does for a lot of people

3405
04:33:36,640 --> 04:33:39,840
i feel that way about animation i also want to do code more i want to illustrate i want to do all

3406
04:33:39,840 --> 04:33:43,600
these things and all the art like i had a lot of like art goals and they're all coming along

3407
04:33:43,600 --> 04:33:51,760
swimmingly but one of the goals was to branch out socially complete failure have not changed

3408
04:33:51,760 --> 04:33:56,480
for a while there i was going on reddit uh you know i was going on r slash box you know i did

3409
04:33:56,480 --> 04:34:04,960
mean i did meet some lifelong friends uh from reddit meetups fuck dammit okay okay i'm not reset

3410
04:34:04,960 --> 04:34:10,800
no we're cool cool yeah we're cool no we're good no we're good um i got sir junkin you know it's

3411
04:34:10,800 --> 04:34:22,240
fine your carol live my scholarship um okay but yeah i was saying yeah i meant i mean were you going

3412
04:34:22,240 --> 04:34:26,800
to like reddit meetups or are you just on reddit no i was just on reddit well i mean that's not

3413
04:34:26,800 --> 04:34:33,200
enough that's not good for you well i mean i literally stopped going on reddit i could not

3414
04:34:33,200 --> 04:34:37,200
like it was such a fail i couldn't even continue to go on reddit or continue to go on website

3415
04:34:37,840 --> 04:34:44,400
on websites just any yeah what do you mean you just stop what do you just stop going on

3416
04:34:44,400 --> 04:34:48,800
websites what do you what are you talking about are you are you are you smoking crack what what

3417
04:34:48,800 --> 04:34:53,120
i mean is i just stopped going on social media like one of my goals was literally just to go on

3418
04:34:53,120 --> 04:35:02,800
reddit more which i failed at well because i got bored and i didn't want to stop well that's a weird

3419
04:35:02,800 --> 04:35:09,360
goal like going on reddit is not socializing i mean i guess in a way it is but no more than like

3420
04:35:09,360 --> 04:35:18,400
being on discord i don't know i disagree because the sort of socializing that i would be doing on

3421
04:35:18,400 --> 04:35:23,440
reddit would be completely different than the one i would be doing on discord on discord as i said

3422
04:35:23,440 --> 04:35:30,880
before all of the discords i could possibly talk in are ones that i am like like i made in a way

3423
04:35:30,880 --> 04:35:35,520
that like are like fan discords of me and that would not be the case on reddit

3424
04:35:35,520 --> 04:35:44,000
oh i have i have a magic fish munchie i have a great great ben i have a no i have a magic

3425
04:35:44,000 --> 04:35:50,160
fish that will show me what's in chests this is literally a game changer okay just okay you know

3426
04:35:50,880 --> 04:36:00,640
yeah that's it okay cool um sick do i want this to be yeah so it would be way different to go on

3427
04:36:00,640 --> 04:36:05,760
on reddit and like i wanted really a part of that community the fandom feeling that we were just

3428
04:36:05,760 --> 04:36:11,680
talking about that that was my goal was to talk on reddit and try and and other social not not

3429
04:36:11,680 --> 04:36:15,120
just reddit but i this was a concert effort where i wanted to go on tumblr more i wanted to go on

3430
04:36:15,120 --> 04:36:19,760
reddit more i wanted to do more stuff like that try and go in on the chance more uh failed i don't

3431
04:36:19,760 --> 04:36:26,400
go on any of them it's out of my thing you know i if you know if you feel like that is um like

3432
04:36:26,400 --> 04:36:31,120
where you would get a sense of community that you're looking for fair enough i don't i have no

3433
04:36:31,120 --> 04:36:36,400
interest i have no interest in that um i don't i i don't i don't think that would do it for me i

3434
04:36:36,400 --> 04:36:44,000
want you know i want to like i like being on i like talking to people on discord and stuff you

3435
04:36:44,000 --> 04:36:48,720
know i want uh i don't know i don't want to talk to people on discord though is the thing

3436
04:36:49,760 --> 04:36:59,040
i mean i don't want to never do it well okay sure me neither um uh i don't know i i i also

3437
04:36:59,040 --> 04:37:04,240
i also don't think reddit is like or going on social media is the end of it this equation that

3438
04:37:04,240 --> 04:37:10,560
was sure this was like a baby step situation yeah sure um okay um so you know what i think i

3439
04:37:10,560 --> 04:37:16,000
think i just remembered i think i just realized another thing that keeps me from that has kept

3440
04:37:16,000 --> 04:37:21,280
me from going to uh the round table and that is that like in theory this is funny because i've

3441
04:37:21,280 --> 04:37:25,840
been there and like i i used to go there so i should know right like i shouldn't even have to think

3442
04:37:25,840 --> 04:37:33,840
about this but i do like in theory it is the perfect thing it is it is in in theory the the ideal

3443
04:37:33,840 --> 04:37:40,080
solution to like every problem that i have but what i just mean like like it is because it's

3444
04:37:40,160 --> 04:37:46,880
it's like a community that is centered around like creative endeavor of the kind that i am

3445
04:37:46,880 --> 04:37:53,920
you know focused on almost to distraction from everything else right so what so like

3446
04:37:54,560 --> 04:37:58,560
so what if i so what if i go and like it sucks you know what if like what if it's not it's like

3447
04:37:58,560 --> 04:38:03,120
it's not enough and i'm like oh why did i bother then what then what do i have left what do i have

3448
04:38:03,120 --> 04:38:08,800
left out after that i've exhausted all my possibilities so in a way it's almost like

3449
04:38:09,840 --> 04:38:13,680
you want to keep that option open and not capitalize on it so it always feels like

3450
04:38:13,680 --> 04:38:20,720
there is another option almost yeah actually yeah you said it you said it perfectly um

3451
04:38:22,320 --> 04:38:26,720
you gotta go you gotta go i know it's fucked up i know it's fucked up i know it's wrong

3452
04:38:26,720 --> 04:38:31,280
i know that i'm bad

3453
04:38:33,920 --> 04:38:43,040
i mean that that's why i mean it like i if i can't go like if i can't even do

3454
04:38:43,040 --> 04:38:49,040
the babyest thing in the entire world that's just find a fucking subreddit that i want to go on

3455
04:38:49,680 --> 04:38:54,400
if i can't do that then i'm like i've just basically embraced the fact that i'm going to die alone

3456
04:38:54,880 --> 04:39:01,840
that's the only thing that can be derived from this yeah yeah naturally naturally um well

3457
04:39:03,040 --> 04:39:10,880
what's the solution is there a solution do we even want to solve this is this even a problem

3458
04:39:12,480 --> 04:39:22,160
nobody knows nobody knows i i've been thinking about how i've taken it for granted that my life

3459
04:39:22,160 --> 04:39:29,360
i will have a picture on i will be an online creator that's just what i will do like why even

3460
04:39:29,360 --> 04:39:38,000
analyze it but more and more i've i've found the idea of having a job that's not like a

3461
04:39:38,000 --> 04:39:44,080
office job one that pertains my interest ones that may maybe you know oh working in the arts as a

3462
04:39:44,880 --> 04:39:52,640
uh but having like a clock out time having just your job be well your job not your

3463
04:39:52,640 --> 04:39:58,480
fucking life as it is for me uh that consumes every waking moment of your entire being

3464
04:39:59,120 --> 04:40:03,280
yeah just having something that you can just go to and then come home from well not wanting to

3465
04:40:03,280 --> 04:40:09,040
die while you're there well that's pretty appealing okay kind of but like

3466
04:40:09,920 --> 04:40:19,360
but then like i mean the yeah when you when you say it like that when you say like that it

3467
04:40:19,360 --> 04:40:25,120
sounds pretty good but like second like what are you actually doing there like is what you

3468
04:40:25,120 --> 04:40:31,840
are doing there something you actually want to do or that you derive meaning from i i understand

3469
04:40:32,400 --> 04:40:38,880
and maybe i'm really young and i don't yeah i would have to like see for myself

3470
04:40:38,880 --> 04:40:43,680
but thinking about it thinking about it critically i thought about like me personally

3471
04:40:43,680 --> 04:40:48,400
and what i derive pleasure from and i've said this i've said this before where it's like what

3472
04:40:48,400 --> 04:40:54,480
i enjoy about the work that i do is a lot of the time like the busy stuff i'm talking about art

3473
04:40:54,480 --> 04:41:00,560
specifically where it's like i don't know if i particularly there's a few comics that i

3474
04:41:00,560 --> 04:41:06,000
would like to do in my life but that don't really call to me like narratives don't really call to me

3475
04:41:06,000 --> 04:41:12,080
in the same way the drawing the drawing itself the drawing itself yeah that's what i care about

3476
04:41:12,080 --> 04:41:18,080
the most and i can understand that i don't know if i am entirely in the same boat but i get it

3477
04:41:19,040 --> 04:41:24,880
you know okay so i feel like i am in a unique situation where it's like i don't really like

3478
04:41:24,880 --> 04:41:31,120
as long as like just am drawing for whatever purpose i may be or am animating or you know just

3479
04:41:31,120 --> 04:41:37,120
as long as i'm working visually i don't i think that i would be fulfilled i don't know i don't

3480
04:41:37,120 --> 04:41:41,200
know if i would be completely fulfilled creatively but i would have a job that i wouldn't hate and i

3481
04:41:41,200 --> 04:41:45,200
would have off time to sometimes do my creative work or just live my life and be able to actually

3482
04:41:45,520 --> 04:41:56,000
watch a television show you know i'm gonna i don't know if this is walking back i'm not

3483
04:41:56,560 --> 04:42:04,160
fuck no no no what i don't know why i didn't just die i don't know i don't know i don't know i also

3484
04:42:04,160 --> 04:42:11,040
want to say by the way that i'm not computing internet creative work or even saying that i will

3485
04:42:11,040 --> 04:42:17,600
not it's i'm simply saying it's appealed to me more than it has before in my past i mean i have

3486
04:42:17,600 --> 04:42:22,400
been thinking it's it's it's creative like doing creative work on the internet is in my life it like

3487
04:42:22,400 --> 04:42:27,680
is in my blood i've done it my entire life it's something that i stop i don't think you know uh

3488
04:42:27,680 --> 04:42:35,440
he totally um i mean like hippo right like hippo's fucking big boy job i fucking i covet hippo so

3489
04:42:35,840 --> 04:42:41,200
yeah i love it him hippo's big boy job or approximation thereof you know has made me think

3490
04:42:41,200 --> 04:42:48,640
and i've thought like i mean you know what i was saying before about like jobs lettering jobs

3491
04:42:48,640 --> 04:42:55,040
like inking like those don't exist those can't possibly be real like what like what are you talking

3492
04:42:55,040 --> 04:43:04,320
about um that is a gun i don't want it okay i thought you were referring to the jobs like

3493
04:43:04,320 --> 04:43:11,200
that's a gun that's that's just impossible no i mean i mean like but it can't be true right

3494
04:43:11,760 --> 04:43:20,720
like i am a god i have skills i have skills that are not like totally fucking worthless

3495
04:43:21,440 --> 04:43:27,440
right sh i mean i don't know i guess i guess any feel that i might like i don't know the

3496
04:43:27,440 --> 04:43:32,080
pokey the point is i've been thinking every every once in a while i think about like what if i like

3497
04:43:32,080 --> 04:43:39,440
what if i like what kind of a job even could i get like i would i would be fine to you know

3498
04:43:40,080 --> 04:43:46,400
to an extent i would i would be okay i would be okay doing creative work for an employer

3499
04:43:47,200 --> 04:43:53,840
as long as like the hours were reasonable um and all that shit um

3500
04:43:56,000 --> 04:44:00,160
i mean i've never had a job like that before i'd like to try it at least like maybe it would be

3501
04:44:00,160 --> 04:44:06,000
great you know maybe it would provide structure or whatever to my fucking waystoy lifestyle

3502
04:44:07,360 --> 04:44:13,520
who knows i crave i crave structure like i i i crave structure right now well i've been thinking about it

3503
04:44:15,120 --> 04:44:20,960
and i guess i'm just like um but how would i oh my god i got the pig i got pig i got pig

3504
04:44:22,000 --> 04:44:27,120
you don't understand you don't understand about pig bitty you don't understand it from my perspective

3505
04:44:27,120 --> 04:44:31,360
when you're just talking and then like yeah so this really serious thing happened oh my god

3506
04:44:31,360 --> 04:44:37,840
the fucking squiggly dude i got the pig activate my bingity bomb do i got a pig this is a game changer

3507
04:44:37,840 --> 04:44:45,760
just like last time this is a absolute game changer um i think i want this armor please

3508
04:44:45,760 --> 04:44:50,240
okay look it's a pig it's a pig it's a pig deal that's all i'm saying um

3509
04:44:50,560 --> 04:44:51,040
um

3510
04:44:52,880 --> 04:44:58,320
what the fuck was i talking about i got really distracted by the pig that's all um

3521
04:46:01,600 --> 04:46:07,120

3522
04:46:07,120 --> 04:46:12,320
hippo no after me a job please well listen this is when you'll be interested i asked hippo like

3523
04:46:12,320 --> 04:46:17,520
i mean are they hiring i that's interesting and he said uh you probably have to move to

3524
04:46:17,520 --> 04:46:29,920
london and i was like oh damn but uh so there you go um how much is living in london probably a lot

3525
04:46:29,920 --> 04:46:39,440
i mean how much is living i mean uh i don't know i mean it's probably it's probably a little more

3526
04:46:39,440 --> 04:46:45,120
than living where i live now not probably not by too much but anyway you know whatever it's not

3527
04:46:45,120 --> 04:46:53,840
important um the important part is like i have thought that maybe like you know i've got like a

3528
04:46:54,800 --> 04:47:02,720
a not insubstantial internet following right based off of my art and creativity and i thought like

3529
04:47:02,720 --> 04:47:07,920
well maybe you know that being the case i'm sure that would be like a strong like foot in the door

3530
04:47:07,920 --> 04:47:14,480
like i'm sure that would be like a good thing and maybe help me but i i have like not recently but

3531
04:47:14,480 --> 04:47:18,880
in the past i have gone onto like craigslist and stuff and just look for like you know creative

3532
04:47:18,880 --> 04:47:22,400
jobs and just be like oh why not and like send out applications like let's just see what happens

3533
04:47:22,480 --> 04:47:28,320
it has never borne fruit or even come even close or even like nothing has ever materialized or even

3534
04:47:28,320 --> 04:47:34,400
looked like it could materialize from it and i don't know what the fucking problem is um and by

3535
04:47:34,400 --> 04:47:40,880
is i mean was because this isn't the thing i've done recently at all sure and and i don't know

3536
04:47:40,880 --> 04:47:47,040
what to think about that um it makes me think that maybe everything that i've spent my time doing is

3537
04:47:47,040 --> 04:47:52,000
totally inapplicable to any other field of work and if i ever wanted to get a more traditional

3538
04:47:52,000 --> 04:47:59,040
job then it's impossible and and and it's just not just not not with how i've spent my life uh i

3539
04:47:59,040 --> 04:48:04,640
don't think that could that can't be true uh but it feels like it is

3540
04:48:09,680 --> 04:48:16,480
what a fucking bummer yeah sorry uh no no not you just the just the whole just life just the

3541
04:48:16,480 --> 04:48:29,200
way the life is well yeah i'm true um i mean you know i i i guess i don't know maybe maybe i'm wrong

3542
04:48:30,080 --> 04:48:34,960
and um because yeah i have been thinking about this i have been thinking about like what could i

3543
04:48:36,080 --> 04:48:41,520
i mean you know thank you to patrons like i really i appreciate so much everyone who

3544
04:48:41,520 --> 04:48:48,880
patrons me but you know i mean in terms of like living off of like like the money that i make

3545
04:48:48,880 --> 04:48:55,680
from patreon is it's a it's it's a meager amount to like live off of and i like we all know this

3546
04:48:55,680 --> 04:49:01,680
this is obvious this isn't gonna blow anyone's minds um as i say this um so i've been thinking

3547
04:49:01,680 --> 04:49:06,800
about like well what if i what kind what kind of a real job what kind of a real ish job would be

3548
04:49:06,800 --> 04:49:13,920
palatable to me right because i just don't want to fucking you know pound the pain i don't want to

3549
04:49:13,920 --> 04:49:18,960
look back on my this is a cliche but i'll use it i don't want to look back on my deathbed and be like

3550
04:49:18,960 --> 04:49:23,440
wow look how many years i spent doing some stupid shit that i didn't care about you know that's

3551
04:49:23,440 --> 04:49:30,320
that's fucking horrifying to me um and that's what a job is right i mean you trade your time for your

3552
04:49:30,320 --> 04:49:34,400
money you trade your time you spend doing some shit that you don't want to do but maybe someone

3553
04:49:34,400 --> 04:49:39,360
else wants you to do it and they give you some money if you if you do that you make that sacrifice

3554
04:49:39,360 --> 04:49:47,200
fair enough you know i get it um but it's a it's a fucking you know it's a shame

3555
04:49:48,320 --> 04:49:54,080
you know okay i want to give voice to what i think people could be thinking right now

3556
04:49:54,720 --> 04:50:01,120
and and like to play devil's advocate a little bit to what we're kind of expressing right here

3557
04:50:01,120 --> 04:50:04,800
and uh for some reason when i'm imagining someone constructing this argument which i'm about to

3558
04:50:04,800 --> 04:50:09,920
relay i imagine it's just Nate for some reason yeah uh i just imagine the Nate will say something

3559
04:50:09,920 --> 04:50:15,520
which i kind of agree with in a way where it's like okay we've been talking a lot about productive

3560
04:50:15,520 --> 04:50:20,400
talking a lot about how we don't have time for anything else and it's just us doing our art

3561
04:50:20,400 --> 04:50:29,920
and i think that someone could say well you say that but is that true yeah how much art do you

3562
04:50:29,920 --> 04:50:37,280
really put out dude yeah like are you really spending every waking moment just

3563
04:50:37,280 --> 04:50:43,120
you know you're completely just absorbed with your art and you know what you show for it well

3564
04:50:43,120 --> 04:50:48,800
that's not like yeah yeah i i can definitely see someone thinking that that's not what i'm saying

3565
04:50:48,800 --> 04:50:58,480
that's not what i'm saying yeah i don't think yeah because it's not i mean i mean look i mean only

3566
04:50:58,480 --> 04:51:03,440
recently have i really got back into the swing of drawing again and that's on me and it's to my

3567
04:51:03,440 --> 04:51:15,520
eternal shame um and so and so on and so forth um what i don't know uh die die die die die die

3568
04:51:15,520 --> 04:51:24,080
okay okay um yes eternal was i saying about eternal shame um that you haven't been drawing

3569
04:51:24,800 --> 04:51:29,280
yeah yeah and i'm and i'm only now kind of recovering i just want to add on to that yeah

3570
04:51:29,280 --> 04:51:33,520
that like like we've been saying that we don't have to make time for other things in our lives

3571
04:51:33,520 --> 04:51:37,840
but like and this people could say that they could see that like or say that like you know

3572
04:51:37,840 --> 04:51:43,280
we aren't producing you like unbelievable like homesick levels of art surely you can make time

3573
04:51:43,280 --> 04:51:48,480
and this is in your hands and like you know it's your fault and you can be better yeah yeah i know

3574
04:51:48,640 --> 04:51:54,640
yeah i hate myself yeah yeah obviously like obviously yeah this is our fault naturally

3575
04:51:54,640 --> 04:52:03,120
no 100% agree um the thing is you know because now a lot of this a lot of this past like

3576
04:52:03,120 --> 04:52:06,640
while or so you know there were times when i was it wasn't on comics there were times i was productive

3577
04:52:06,640 --> 04:52:10,480
on endless war there were other times when i was kind of fucking up and was not productive maybe

3578
04:52:10,480 --> 04:52:15,840
those times i would have been better off working a job uh maybe maybe i would have more to show for

3579
04:52:15,840 --> 04:52:24,320
it in the long run possible whatever um yeah the point is right it's not it's not that i'm

3580
04:52:24,320 --> 04:52:30,800
it's not that anyone is just working 24 hours a day it's just like drawing 24 hours a day

3581
04:52:30,800 --> 04:52:35,920
writing 24 hours a day i don't think i mean maybe andrew hussey did that maybe he maybe he could

3582
04:52:36,000 --> 04:52:46,240
manage that for a while um but you know it's it's it's it's it's in your brain it's in your mind

3583
04:52:46,240 --> 04:52:49,520
it's that you're you're thinking about it and even when you're not doing it you're thinking i could

3584
04:52:49,520 --> 04:52:55,600
be doing it and it eats you up inside i think something that's very hard for people who aren't

3585
04:52:55,600 --> 04:53:02,080
in our work to like conceptualize yeah especially if you're working exclusively a wage job yeah like

3586
04:53:02,720 --> 04:53:08,640
when you clock out of work you're done with work for the day you go home and you you you

3587
04:53:08,640 --> 04:53:16,480
snuggle with your wife and your children and you watch tv um when you do what us you're never

3588
04:53:16,480 --> 04:53:22,640
clocked out yeah because there is no schedule there is no like a time you're working and time

3589
04:53:22,640 --> 04:53:28,080
you're not working there's just time you should be working and it's 100 of the clock it's time

3590
04:53:28,160 --> 04:53:34,400
you should be working and time you are working yeah and i can't i can't maintain uh i can't

3591
04:53:34,400 --> 04:53:41,760
maintain focus on on creative stuff uh you know 24 hours a day i don't think anyone can uh

3592
04:53:43,440 --> 04:53:50,160
um where are we going with this uh just fucking bitching and moaning yeah um

3593
04:53:51,440 --> 04:53:56,640
someone give me a job but like a good job like an easy job that's fun friend makes a lot of money

3594
04:53:58,080 --> 04:54:05,200

3601
04:54:50,240 --> 04:54:55,920
slide of questioning i don't yeah i don't like it i don't like the base your base assumptions um

04:55:12,080 --> 04:55:19,600
the gun and then we let go at the same time wait so what do they die of and wait nothing

3605
04:55:20,000 --> 04:55:23,760
we just put down our arms and live a happy prosperous life we just lay down the weapons

3606
04:55:23,760 --> 04:55:31,840
and who are we who's news who's gone who are we our own our own now there's no that's interesting

3607
04:55:33,200 --> 04:55:40,800

3609
04:55:47,840 --> 04:55:58,640
fucking crack pipe excuse me why can't i been literally why can't i just like steven universe

3610
04:55:58,640 --> 04:56:03,360
like all of it and just be like super into steven universe i'll tell you go on tumblr and then

3611
04:56:03,360 --> 04:56:10,800
like just talk about how much i love steven universe i will oh that's a good one oh yeah heavy

3612
04:56:10,800 --> 04:56:17,440
bullets yeah oh yeah steven universe no listen i will tell you why there's a good reason um

3613
04:56:17,440 --> 04:56:24,160
it's because it's not gay enough yeah i think i've talked about this on the pcp yeah uh um

3614
04:56:25,040 --> 04:56:30,560
steven universe gets away with having its cake and eating it too by being quote unquote about

3615
04:56:30,560 --> 04:56:37,440
lesbians but with all these qualifiers that make it like not really like they're aliens

3616
04:56:37,440 --> 04:56:44,080
they're not they don't even have bodies there aren't any men in their species like that's it's

3617
04:56:44,080 --> 04:56:51,600
bullshit i hear people say that it's no it's not it's a weak shit it's it's clear like it's

3618
04:56:51,600 --> 04:56:57,440
cleared that like those are things about them that don't like are you trying to say that like

3619
04:56:57,440 --> 04:57:02,720
they are gyms are not female presenting and like oh they're like they're exactly bodies of light so

3620
04:57:02,720 --> 04:57:08,400
like oh like oh they're not actually female like no no i mean of course they're female presenting

3621
04:57:08,400 --> 04:57:15,280
obviously but like none of them aren't so what does it mean for them to be quote unquote gay

3622
04:57:15,280 --> 04:57:23,360
it doesn't mean anything because there's no alternative it but the reason people want

3623
04:57:24,160 --> 04:57:29,600
well a reason a lot of people want representation is so that it's normalized in our society

3624
04:57:29,600 --> 04:57:36,160
not so that it can necessarily explore those themes in the show itself but just so that

3625
04:57:36,160 --> 04:57:41,920
people can see yeah they are gay or lesbian or whatever they can see themselves in just

3626
04:57:41,920 --> 04:57:48,160
represented in media whatsoever yeah so so while they might not be dealing with the same backlash

3627
04:57:48,160 --> 04:57:53,760
that a real lesbian real lesbian couples would doesn't mean that it's not impactful i mean like

3628
04:57:53,760 --> 04:58:01,680
we recognize them as you know as humans do just because they aren't like technically a gender

3629
04:58:01,680 --> 04:58:07,040
doesn't mean that we don't recognize them as such you know that's a that's a good point

3630
04:58:07,600 --> 04:58:13,040
that's a good point you make there i'll i'll buy that mm i mean five million nine please

3631
04:58:13,680 --> 04:58:20,960

04:59:55,760 --> 05:00:00,080
i sort of feel like even though like there's been nothing said that's convinced me we've

3648
05:00:00,080 --> 05:00:08,160
talked for a long time and said basically nothing yeah yeah yeah um there's nothing that's like

3649
05:00:08,160 --> 05:00:14,000
convinced me of this so i don't know why i feel this way specifically maybe just i've like i've

3650
05:00:14,000 --> 05:00:18,480
talked and therefore my brain has worked it out itself yeah i sort of feel like

3651
05:00:19,760 --> 05:00:28,080
i should just stop doing all the stupid things i'm doing only do things i really care about yeah

3652
05:00:28,080 --> 05:00:33,600
what yeah yeah stop doing the things i'm just doing smart things in this war and then just like it's

3653
05:00:33,600 --> 05:00:38,160
like like that's almost it basically and then just double down on the other thing they want to and

3654
05:00:38,160 --> 05:00:43,920
that's just draw yeah i should just do i should just fucking like stop spread myself even a little

3655
05:00:43,920 --> 05:00:50,800
bit thin and just completely fucking like hammer down on like trying to network trying to push

3656
05:00:50,800 --> 05:00:57,520
this art aspect of me and just do that yeah missions just do that sure harm you feel that's

3657
05:00:57,520 --> 05:01:05,600
that way uh doesn't sound like uh that's doesn't sound too wacky um i'm i'm fighting a giant snake

3658
05:01:05,600 --> 05:01:11,600
by the way um so i'm a little distracted um and really really important that i not take any damage

3659
05:01:11,600 --> 05:01:19,600
here like it in real life you're doing this yeah oh god oh god oh god the snake is a symbolism for

3660
05:01:19,600 --> 05:01:25,840
his uh sense of regret for not being on penny arcade i did it i fucking did it i killed the

3661
05:01:25,840 --> 05:01:32,560
ammo i got no damage um why am i oh god i must have failed to get the health upgrade in the first

3662
05:01:32,880 --> 05:01:39,360
buck okay that sucks something's gotta change something if i don't change something because

3663
05:01:39,360 --> 05:01:44,960
of this conversation yeah i'm just retarded i'm just i just like even if i've articulated it with

3664
05:01:44,960 --> 05:01:50,720
someone else something's gotta fucking change or else i'm just gonna kill myself one day

3665
05:01:51,840 --> 05:01:56,240
yeah i hear you actually have you ever been like actually suicidal like actually for real

3666
05:01:56,240 --> 05:02:05,680
um not really why yeah well just wondering because i have been and it's like it's like

3667
05:02:05,680 --> 05:02:10,080
sort of weird it's hard to explain because it's suicide is like stupid yeah that's what feels

3668
05:02:10,080 --> 05:02:13,120
like oh people who want to commit suicide just like what's you know even what's going on with

3669
05:02:13,120 --> 05:02:17,920
them but like it's a weirdly like i have been i have been weird at the moment it doesn't feel like

3670
05:02:18,960 --> 05:02:24,240
when you're when you're in that mindset it's just like yeah you know like if i was dead i wouldn't

3671
05:02:24,240 --> 05:02:30,400
feel bad so like if i don't want to feel bad like maybe i should just kill myself sure you know i mean

3672
05:02:30,400 --> 05:02:37,840
it's logical in a sense right uh there's a certain certain logic behind it i mean i've been depressed

3673
05:02:37,840 --> 05:02:44,320
to the point that i've been like man i should probably like be dead that would probably be better

3674
05:02:44,320 --> 05:02:51,840
i've been i but i've never been like to the point that i'm like seriously considering doing anything

3675
05:02:51,840 --> 05:02:56,480
about it you know i mean i almost jumped out of a car once i was about to but literally my mom held

3676
05:02:56,480 --> 05:03:00,960
on like like like grabbed me and because she was way bigger than i was she was able to well

3677
05:03:01,520 --> 05:03:06,480
well no no no i i that that that was i don't know why i said she was way bigger than me because

3678
05:03:06,480 --> 05:03:10,160
that wasn't the case but just just because she would like held on to me with a vice grip i didn't

3679
05:03:10,400 --> 05:03:19,760
uh that's the good stuff that's the good stuff right there and i continue to live morse ever

3680
05:03:19,760 --> 05:03:28,080
since yes ever so yeah i you you all that on that on that day you almost lived manos

3681
05:03:33,200 --> 05:03:38,880

05:06:26,640 --> 05:06:34,960
looking for rats i'm just looking for rats baby um um hey well let me pivot okay now sure i have um

3706
05:06:35,840 --> 05:06:43,600
been thinking and mulling over right i've been fucking for some reason honestly i think it was

3707
05:06:43,600 --> 05:06:51,920
just a lack of a lack of healthy alternatives i started falling down this like dnd podcast um root

3708
05:06:51,920 --> 05:06:57,040
you know sitting there and and and you know sitting there and just coveting right and coveting

3709
05:06:57,120 --> 05:07:03,040
this lifestyle and oh fuck fell down a hole sorry what

3710
05:07:05,840 --> 05:07:13,280
wait oh my god the fish saves me the fish saved me munchie the fish i have the fish

3711
05:07:13,280 --> 05:07:16,480
everything it's gonna be okay i got the fish and the pig and it's made all the difference

3712
05:07:16,480 --> 05:07:23,200
okay okay look got the toad all right so um i mean coveting this lifestyle and and i keep

3713
05:07:24,160 --> 05:07:28,320
bringing me keeps bringing me back to thinking like how can i do this right i keep having the

3714
05:07:28,320 --> 05:07:33,120
idea of how do i run like a game oh i want to play in a game i want to be one of these people

3715
05:07:33,120 --> 05:07:37,840
i want to play in a game and and have that be content that people consume watch me play in a

3716
05:07:37,840 --> 05:07:42,240
fucking game watch me have a character run through a story tell a great story have a great time very

3717
05:07:42,240 --> 05:07:48,400
entertaining um you know i mean no one's gonna do that that's not gonna happen the only alternative

3718
05:07:48,400 --> 05:07:54,000
is that i have to run one and that's a nightmare but maybe i maybe i'm so desperate that i'll do it

3719
05:07:54,000 --> 05:08:02,640
anyway and um i mean that's what it is that's a that's a healthy way to view yourself i mean

3720
05:08:03,760 --> 05:08:10,480
like i'm so desperate i'll do a thing that i know isn't a good idea just for a sad just for a

3721
05:08:10,480 --> 05:08:18,880
taste just for a taste of the reflective glory um i don't know you know i propose i propose doing

3722
05:08:18,880 --> 05:08:25,120
one set an endless war that's a maybe i was thinking i was i was actually thinking about um

3723
05:08:25,680 --> 05:08:29,520
like the other day i had a i had an idea i actually really liked it and i mulled it over

3724
05:08:29,520 --> 05:08:33,840
like for the rest of the night while i was doing other stuff i think i might run like i could i

3725
05:08:33,840 --> 05:08:38,000
could run like a game i could run a game set in the champion world i actually think i could i

3726
05:08:38,000 --> 05:08:44,240
i actually thought of like oh i have an idea for a story like i have i i have like a concept for

3727
05:08:44,240 --> 05:08:49,920
like a story that would take place there and it would be like it would fit cleanly into like a

3728
05:08:49,920 --> 05:08:56,160
one-shot thing it has like a thing behind it the thing is i don't know any i don't know if people

3729
05:08:56,160 --> 05:09:02,480
that play these games right like like if i got like maybe you or hippo right to be in this thing

3730
05:09:02,480 --> 05:09:07,600
with me like you guys to have like it would be weird you'd never played it before and it would

3731
05:09:07,600 --> 05:09:12,960
be weird to have it be like your first exposure to it and i thought maybe i could have maybe i

3732
05:09:12,960 --> 05:09:17,680
could come up with like a more like like a more simplified like sort of rules light variant do

3733
05:09:17,680 --> 05:09:23,440
i really want to fucking spend the time like coming up with a whole system for this or like

3734
05:09:23,440 --> 05:09:30,560
maybe i could find a simpler system and also it could be like it's like yeah like me and hippo

3735
05:09:30,560 --> 05:09:34,720
are in it but like doesn't that just mean like it's the same audience that you would have already

3736
05:09:34,720 --> 05:09:43,040
in a way it does it does mean that um i mean i wouldn't i mean it would work like because

3737
05:09:43,040 --> 05:09:49,360
i have like a story idea for it it would work for it could work regardless honestly it might

3738
05:09:49,360 --> 05:09:54,240
play out differently depending on who else was there but like it could work with anyone um it

3739
05:09:54,240 --> 05:10:00,800
would be fine um honestly i mean this isn't even like this isn't an audience building thing this is

3740
05:10:00,800 --> 05:10:08,800
a this is like a man i know i was just i was talking earlier about how it's a bad bad thing

3741
05:10:08,800 --> 05:10:14,720
to like diversify and not just focus on one medium but at the same time i like i like being a

3742
05:10:14,720 --> 05:10:20,000
diverse i like that's why we do it that's why we do it i like being multimedia i like the idea

3743
05:10:20,560 --> 05:10:25,600
i like the idea that like like i mean man i almost never even think about the fact that

3744
05:10:25,600 --> 05:10:31,280
i made a whole fucking game for the champion like yeah that almost never even crosses my mind and

3745
05:10:31,280 --> 05:10:39,200
yet it is an indisputable fact of some importance i think probably um oh that's a fucking stupid item

3746
05:10:39,200 --> 05:10:47,920
but you know what i want it anyway um okay so i don't know i like the idea that like the story

3747
05:10:48,640 --> 05:10:53,360
could would be a multimedia thing like there would be you know a game there'd be comics there'd be

3748
05:10:53,360 --> 05:11:02,400
these fucking like rpg like tabletop games like set in the universe um that stuff's really cool to

3749
05:11:02,400 --> 05:11:11,680
me and i really like it um it's super cool yeah that there just is a video game for this comic

3750
05:11:12,400 --> 05:11:18,960
yeah like that's undeniably great and cool i'm very proud of it it's and i actually made it really

3751
05:11:18,960 --> 05:11:26,480
fast like that's a weird thing about it is i actually it only took me like three weeks to make it

3752
05:11:27,520 --> 05:11:36,800
like like maybe less i okay another thing i want to i want to mention um okay two things actually

3753
05:11:36,880 --> 05:11:41,440
number one i was just a broad thing i feel like no matter what even if it's not a

3754
05:11:41,440 --> 05:11:45,440
thorough podcast to ever there's always just gonna be stuff in your brain that you can't

3755
05:11:45,440 --> 05:11:49,520
articulate it and like there's always some like asterisk to everything you say in a way

3756
05:11:49,520 --> 05:11:54,400
where it's like you could always like articulate your point it's like a little bit better and then

3757
05:11:54,400 --> 05:12:00,080
like if you when you don't someone's gonna comment it um you mean are you talking about this like

3758
05:12:00,080 --> 05:12:05,920
game idea thing or are you talking about no no no i'm talking about in general i'm talking about

3759
05:12:05,920 --> 05:12:11,280
in general okay not i'm saying i'm talking about like like me like right now during this conversation

3760
05:12:11,280 --> 05:12:17,440
we're having right now sure sure yeah yeah yeah um where it's like like you know there's there's

3761
05:12:17,440 --> 05:12:22,720
things i'll say which might to some people require context for them to fully understand

3762
05:12:22,720 --> 05:12:27,040
where i'm coming from in a way but just i can't think to do that for every single thing or else

3763
05:12:27,040 --> 05:12:31,920
i would just be talking for an hour and saying not really anything just explaining everything

3764
05:12:31,920 --> 05:12:37,360
that i'm thinking and all the all the nuances that i'm sort of leaving out to save time so that

3765
05:12:37,360 --> 05:12:43,840
that i feel like you can already respond to so one thing i i want to mention one nuance and

3766
05:12:43,840 --> 05:12:51,440
clarification i would like to say that like i don't think that like uh like that like being good

3767
05:12:52,160 --> 05:13:02,400
is bad for business uh and i feel like people can like say that like all you do for instance like

3768
05:13:02,400 --> 05:13:08,640
on youtube is follow the algorithm and feed the algorithm and that's like if you just do that

3769
05:13:08,640 --> 05:13:15,440
well you have to you you do that but you like i mean you have to be confident at it right like

3770
05:13:15,440 --> 05:13:20,320
yeah you need well yeah you i mean you need a certain base level competency and some people

3771
05:13:20,320 --> 05:13:28,000
don't have it but it's not that uncommon either like you know lots of people could oh god i almost

3772
05:13:28,000 --> 05:13:34,560
okay um like lots of people could um do it you know not everyone but a lot of people

3773
05:13:35,200 --> 05:13:43,200
and that's probably why it seems not special just some you know it it's also like i i think that

3774
05:13:43,200 --> 05:13:49,520
there are things that exist that are successful maybe not as successful as someone who is competent

3775
05:13:49,520 --> 05:13:54,240
slash either good maybe who is strictly trying to follow the algorithm and just is doing that

3776
05:13:54,240 --> 05:14:00,560
specifically and like with intentionally to get paid but there are definitely people who are good

3777
05:14:00,560 --> 05:14:08,240
who've succeeded on the back of just being good and there are people there are you know fine success

3778
05:14:08,240 --> 05:14:12,560
so i don't i just want to clarify that that is possible and i don't think i think we can it's

3779
05:14:12,560 --> 05:14:17,520
easy to get wrapped up and just like oh like like like you know i want to all these things which are

3780
05:14:17,520 --> 05:14:23,680
good like you know but like i there's not worth it business wise um i think that is

3781
05:14:24,960 --> 05:14:29,360
like it's not that that's wrong i don't think either of those thinkings are wrong that just

3782
05:14:29,360 --> 05:14:33,600
like you should just like follow the algorithm on you or something and be a bit competent and you

3783
05:14:33,600 --> 05:14:38,480
can do it i also don't think that if you wanted to it's impossible for you to not follow the

3784
05:14:38,480 --> 05:14:43,200
algorithm we'll still make quality content and making stuff that people want and like there's

3785
05:14:43,200 --> 05:14:48,960
no way to get popular that way well i don't know i just think it's it's harder in some senses and

3786
05:14:48,960 --> 05:14:54,320
that's what we're discussing currently well it's like i think yeah i mean i mean i mean if you're

3787
05:14:54,320 --> 05:15:02,000
finding okay go on go on i would find it very plausible that there's some like maybe making

3788
05:15:02,000 --> 05:15:11,120
that game was not like entirely like the best use of your time in a way that like um well i don't know

3789
05:15:11,120 --> 05:15:16,720
yeah cranky now like like uh like uh like like you know a lot of pages i mean the game

3790
05:15:16,720 --> 05:15:23,600
theoretically made me zero money yeah exactly and and honestly it probably literally made me zero

3791
05:15:23,600 --> 05:15:29,920
money because like nobody talks about it like after it came out like nobody talked about it

3792
05:15:29,920 --> 05:15:36,080
and i don't know of anyone who was like wow i saw that game you made and i was really impressed

3793
05:15:36,080 --> 05:15:42,400
and like i i check out all your other stuff because that that might be true for this but

3794
05:15:42,400 --> 05:15:47,600
this sort of thing in general that's like not strictly for business but you do because you have

3795
05:15:47,600 --> 05:15:52,400
a spark of inspiration and you think it's good you think it's a quality idea and it's just creatively

3796
05:15:52,400 --> 05:16:00,880
fulfilling i think that thing can feel it can like work just in a business sense of it being like

3797
05:16:01,600 --> 05:16:09,840
part of why people like you is that you create content which they enjoy and i think it's i it's

3798
05:16:09,840 --> 05:16:18,480
often like almost understated in a way that the masses aren't like stupid they like good things

3799
05:16:18,480 --> 05:16:27,360
and when you create stuff of quality they enjoy it often yeah so well maybe that video game in

3800
05:16:27,440 --> 05:16:32,800
specific did not generate you money and i'm not complaining and i'm not complaining about that

3801
05:16:32,800 --> 05:16:39,360
yeah i think we mix together like stuff like that and maybe endless war which we've said before is

3802
05:16:39,360 --> 05:16:47,200
not really made us a lot of money almost at all in the sense uh like i still think that just is

3803
05:16:47,840 --> 05:16:53,840
good to do because people will like you more and people will be more often to support you

3804
05:16:53,840 --> 05:17:03,360
oh no i'm please please please please yes ah okay i just i was terrified because i realized

3805
05:17:03,360 --> 05:17:08,480
i was out of blanks and i need two blanks to get to the rat's nest uh but luckily the store

3806
05:17:08,480 --> 05:17:14,880
had some so we're good don't worry about it okay sorry to interrupt you but well no no hold on

3807
05:17:14,880 --> 05:17:20,320
also by the way i just want to say that you've said this before but i didn't notice and i thought

3808
05:17:20,320 --> 05:17:25,280
you were exaggerating but now like really paying attention to every single panel the halftones

3809
05:17:25,280 --> 05:17:33,440
and the vapors is like ridiculous in chapter one the halftone in oh sure sure you mean the dots

3810
05:17:34,000 --> 05:17:43,360
yeah the dots yeah you mean the dots what is the halftone yeah um uh it is yeah it is very i was very

3811
05:17:43,440 --> 05:17:50,960
meticulous about it too meticulous in fact yeah yeah you know with with vapors one with

3812
05:17:50,960 --> 05:17:56,240
vapors one in specific i was very focused on the idea of like replicating the look of a print

3813
05:17:56,240 --> 05:18:03,440
comic i used the halftones because they are very print comic e uh in two and now in three i mean

3814
05:18:03,440 --> 05:18:07,600
i didn't stop using them but i definitely use them less and i only use them in cases where i

3815
05:18:07,600 --> 05:18:14,000
thought they were necessary um there were a couple of shots like the one of vincent like coming

3816
05:18:14,000 --> 05:18:19,360
through the door dramatically that looked like the halftones and that looked really cool i literally

3817
05:18:19,360 --> 05:18:24,000
as you say that i was i'm looking at it yeah that that's that one's really good um and sometimes

3818
05:18:24,000 --> 05:18:29,360
halftones are good but like generally i'm fine with just using like you know gray because like

3819
05:18:29,360 --> 05:18:34,800
yeah like the format that i printed can print gray like the reason they had halftones is because

3820
05:18:34,800 --> 05:18:41,920
they couldn't print in gray back in the day well you know i can so whatever um yeah um

3821
05:18:43,280 --> 05:18:47,040
oh no now i feel now i feel bad now i feel like maybe i should use maybe i should use

3822
05:18:47,040 --> 05:18:52,080
more halftones maybe i abandoned something that was important and added value to my work

3823
05:18:53,600 --> 05:19:00,800
law i don't know um you were gonna say something i cut you off was i i mean wasn't i just mad

3824
05:19:00,800 --> 05:19:07,680
because i had thought that i didn't have blanks to find the rats nest no we were talking oh god

3825
05:19:07,680 --> 05:19:11,280
i'm retarded i forget what we were talking about but you were definitely gonna say something

3826
05:19:11,280 --> 05:19:16,480
and we're gonna be oh oh we were talking about um how just like inspiring goodwill by creating

3827
05:19:16,480 --> 05:19:23,520
quality content is a method to but that is not like inherently goes against the idea of doing

3828
05:19:23,520 --> 05:19:27,840
something for a business purpose where it's like doing something that's good for business

3829
05:19:27,840 --> 05:19:32,960
core code is described is not necessarily mean just like gaming things or like like

3830
05:19:32,960 --> 05:19:39,840
cynically i mean that's that's what go ahead and yeah i mean that's what i always wanted to do

3831
05:19:39,840 --> 05:19:48,240
right i wanted to be like okay i'm not i don't want to be like super commercial i don't want to

3832
05:19:48,240 --> 05:19:53,840
make shit i don't i don't want to make shit because the algorithm favors it uh you know i just want

3833
05:19:53,920 --> 05:19:59,840
to make cool stuff and if i just work really hard and make cool stuff people will see it

3834
05:19:59,840 --> 05:20:06,800
i'll see that it's good and you know just sort of naturally you know by just just by on the backs

3835
05:20:06,800 --> 05:20:14,320
of the quality of the shit that i make people will find it and appreciate it and that has happened

3836
05:20:14,320 --> 05:20:28,000
to extend yeah uh you know not not i mean i'm very poor right so so that's you know but that's

3837
05:20:28,000 --> 05:20:38,960
not necessarily a failing of the ideology um that's not that's not a what am i trying to say

3838
05:20:39,600 --> 05:20:49,120
okay what am i she helped um blah blah blah live moss um yeah yeah yeah strip search um brood god

3839
05:20:49,120 --> 05:20:58,000
is is that is that ben sain in the flesh is that really by the way also looking at vapor's one

3840
05:20:58,000 --> 05:21:02,880
right now by the way i've realized that like the way you draw magda while she's in her i don't know

3841
05:21:02,880 --> 05:21:09,280
how you describe her her grim bark her grim dark state yeah sure um is literally the way i draw you

3842
05:21:09,280 --> 05:21:17,440
in r of ck are which i didn't even realize it look at this literally it's the exact same classes i

3843
05:21:17,440 --> 05:21:25,920
did not even notice yeah that's that's a little bit ridiculous it's a little bit weird but that is

3844
05:21:25,920 --> 05:21:36,160
the case really funny that's really cool i love it i love it um um i i i get what you mean it like

3845
05:21:36,160 --> 05:21:48,080
it's uh i i mean i think the goal is always to just do what you find creatively fulfilling

3846
05:21:48,080 --> 05:21:54,640
and if you could do only that and be successful like like no one like okay me and you said this

3847
05:21:54,640 --> 05:21:59,600
a thousand times before our goal is not to become the richest people on earth oh that would be a nice

3848
05:21:59,600 --> 05:22:06,640
spiritual outcome slash ben sain uh yeah it's i mean it's it's it's about doing what you want

3849
05:22:06,640 --> 05:22:11,920
well here's i mean pop it's about it's just about being a guy you want to be not for like

3850
05:22:11,920 --> 05:22:16,960
strictly a monetary sense but just in the sense that you want to be able to make your art and not

3851
05:22:16,960 --> 05:22:21,440
have to do shit that you don't want to i mean here's my i mean i've said i've said this before

3852
05:22:21,440 --> 05:22:33,440
this is sort of my philosophy if i were rich um what i would do with that is i would use the

3853
05:22:33,440 --> 05:22:39,600
fact that i don't have to work anymore to just like work on my shit that's what i would do with a lot

3854
05:22:39,600 --> 05:22:45,360
of money maybe if i had a whole lot of money i would like hire assistants right maybe maybe that

3855
05:22:45,360 --> 05:22:51,360
could help you know grease grease the pipeline yeah yeah that's that's all i would use it for

3856
05:22:51,360 --> 05:23:00,080
um uh maybe and if i were famous if i were super popular all i would do with that is

3857
05:23:00,080 --> 05:23:03,520
use it to make money so that i could do what i just said i would do with a lot of money

3858
05:23:04,320 --> 05:23:15,760
uh yeah ben yeah hmm how do i say this okay your god question mark i'm i'm on i'm on saint

3859
05:23:15,760 --> 05:23:21,040
tomlicks.com right now right now which you can too viewer if you click the link in the description

3860
05:23:21,040 --> 05:23:29,040
right um these these are genius what are you talking about these why are you talking about

3861
05:23:29,120 --> 05:23:37,520
these comics that's bullshit no man i suck remember no you do suck because you make

3862
05:23:37,520 --> 05:23:43,920
fucking Winnie the Pooh videos yeah you make you make youtube videos to be fair i was kind of

3863
05:23:43,920 --> 05:23:49,760
interested i was kind of personally interested in in like no sure okay no okay in Winnie the Pooh

3864
05:23:49,760 --> 05:23:57,040
i'm i'm personally a big Winnie the i'm personally a big Pooh head um it okay there's like a

3865
05:23:57,040 --> 05:24:01,360
weird disconnect in my head like like i said this before like i asked you if you felt this way

3866
05:24:01,360 --> 05:24:05,760
sort of like in like an abstract like questioning just like sort of um you know do you feel like

3867
05:24:05,760 --> 05:24:10,240
ben the saint the comic guy and ben saint the the twitch stream or whatever i just can't people

3868
05:24:10,240 --> 05:24:17,920
and i didn't really like like i didn't really notice but i feel that way i don't really often

3869
05:24:17,920 --> 05:24:24,400
think about like how i'm friends with ben and you have created the vapors it seems like

3870
05:24:25,360 --> 05:24:30,960
the vapors ben couldn't have made the vapors yeah right the vapors is the best thing ever made

3871
05:24:30,960 --> 05:24:37,360
no come on now you just yank me you just yanking me no okay you crank yanking me

3872
05:24:38,480 --> 05:24:44,640
also it's really cool it's but like i mean i don't think about you that way i mean you know

3873
05:24:44,640 --> 05:24:50,160
you know i don't think about myself that way enough and that's that's my problem that's one of my many

3874
05:24:50,160 --> 05:24:58,400
problems um and like oh okay i fell into a hole but it's fine um one of the things that i want to

3875
05:24:58,400 --> 05:25:04,640
do you know i want to i just you know i spread myself thin and it wasn't even just about you

3876
05:25:04,640 --> 05:25:08,880
know i just got out of the mindset right like it's about you know you know the secret is

3877
05:25:08,880 --> 05:25:13,840
bullshit obviously but like there's something to be said about like visualizing you know what you

3878
05:25:13,840 --> 05:25:21,200
want to see and then like and having it come as a as a consequence of that like just by virtue of the

3879
05:25:21,200 --> 05:25:26,800
fact that if you're focused on it you will sort of naturally take action to bring about that

3880
05:25:26,800 --> 05:25:31,120
reality and you know when i'm thinking about streaming when i'm thinking about you know

3881
05:25:31,760 --> 05:25:36,960
fucking editing doing fancy editing on the latest pcp when i'm thinking about you know making 10

3882
05:25:36,960 --> 05:25:41,120
paces draw like really good i'm not thinking about yeah being a comic sky getting my comic

3883
05:25:41,120 --> 05:25:49,200
sun getting my yeah work done yeah yeah yeah um uh the the it's such a it's such a because it's not

3884
05:25:49,200 --> 05:25:54,400
like okay well okay i'm gonna speak i'm gonna speak like like strictly as i want to say a viewer

3885
05:25:55,360 --> 05:26:00,640
i want i want to say this to the view okay no go on okay to the viewer i'm sorry i found it okay

3886
05:26:00,640 --> 05:26:05,600
i have been running around the same level like everywhere just looking for the hatch that leads

3887
05:26:05,600 --> 05:26:10,160
to the rat's nest and it took me forever but i finally found it so okay uh disaster inverted

3888
05:26:10,160 --> 05:26:15,760
okay what are you saying um i just want to say for like i'm strictly thinking as like a fan of

3889
05:26:15,760 --> 05:26:22,880
bin saying like i wouldn't say that like just like just only do comics now because like i like when

3890
05:26:22,880 --> 05:26:30,000
you do other stuff yeah it's just it's like it's kind of like like you're just fucked like no matter

3891
05:26:30,000 --> 05:26:38,240
what you do uh just die in a way it's like i guess like i like the vapors more than other

3892
05:26:38,240 --> 05:26:43,840
thing everything else you do but like it's almost like again like i don't i can't recognize out of

3893
05:26:43,840 --> 05:26:50,160
the fact in my mind that you've created the vapors i don't i don't get i don't what are you getting

3894
05:26:50,160 --> 05:26:57,040
at now i'm getting at i'm getting at that like i like i i don't even like when i think about you

3895
05:26:57,040 --> 05:27:04,160
i don't think about the vapors at all really in a way i see um so it's it's almost like i can't

3896
05:27:04,160 --> 05:27:09,920
even imagine a world where the vapors or you know any video comics are like the main thing you do

3897
05:27:10,560 --> 05:27:16,000
even though i think that would be like the best in certain aspects

3898
05:27:17,760 --> 05:27:22,160
like i just can't imagine it this is the thing there's no what's what's the elevator pitch for

3899
05:27:22,160 --> 05:27:28,960
ben saying there isn't one yeah it's like 14 different things oh god oh god oh god um i just

3900
05:27:28,960 --> 05:27:36,960
a bad room i got a bad room uh there's a there's a demon the grim raper is here

3901
05:27:37,760 --> 05:27:46,080
the grim raper is here that's it fuck part part of me thinks that like i like like like as as like um

3902
05:27:46,800 --> 05:27:52,800
i guess like as like like a backseat a comics artist in a way like a backseat gamer but like a

3903
05:27:52,800 --> 05:28:00,240
backseat uh just like fan of you if i were you i would double down on comics and just try and

3904
05:28:00,240 --> 05:28:04,240
throw myself into that community and just kind of focus on that just because i don't know

3905
05:28:04,880 --> 05:28:12,240
that seems to be what i like the most of you but like but like i mean i think that's the most

3906
05:28:12,240 --> 05:28:16,320
unique i think that's the most unique thing about me definitely the most unique definitely

3907
05:28:17,040 --> 05:28:24,240
but like like would i like with that like would i say like you know like i'm comfortable never

3908
05:28:24,240 --> 05:28:28,880
seeing another uh like another twitter like ben stream again i'm comfortable never seeing

3909
05:28:28,880 --> 05:28:34,800
like stuff like that or his appearances on on pcp or just anything else like that like no no no

3910
05:28:34,800 --> 05:28:41,120
no yeah that would be that would be a big loss yeah it would i i think so definitely i don't

3911
05:28:41,120 --> 05:28:47,200
want to do i don't want to do nothing but like i don't really want to be someone who does nothing

3912
05:28:47,200 --> 05:28:56,480
but you know whatever thing i don't i mean that sounds boring definitely maybe that's maybe that's

3913
05:28:56,480 --> 05:29:03,840
my problem maybe that maybe that's my problem and maybe if i were cool for example i would be like

3914
05:29:03,840 --> 05:29:07,760
i would be totally okay with yeah i'm just gonna sit in my room i'm just gonna do nothing but draw

3915
05:29:07,760 --> 05:29:12,880
forever you know i mean that's how people get i mean that's how people succeed as artists is

3916
05:29:12,880 --> 05:29:16,800
they fucking do nothing but it and they become super good at it and they're prolific and they

3917
05:29:16,800 --> 05:29:23,360
just put out a ton of shit fuck damn it oh i've got just fighting some orbs just fighting some

3918
05:29:23,360 --> 05:29:37,840
real nasty orbs right now um um what's the solution i don't know yep yeah yeah agreed

3919
