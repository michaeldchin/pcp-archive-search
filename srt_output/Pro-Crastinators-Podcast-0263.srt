00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is Gibbontake and we've got Simsie. Today is with us. Simsie at Simsie Fart on Twitter is a self-described artist who likes drawing lips and boobs and flanged.

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I bought into the meme. I bought into the cryptocurrency.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a great meme and I'm honestly a little sad that nobody else made a flange sonar for themselves. Only is.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, I think it's because your octopus hermit is the only one.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The fucking profile picture on Twitter is hideous.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's so terrifying.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's what's cool about it, you fucking idiot.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's so abrasively vile that it's put everybody off of contributing to this fucking meme.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is that what being flanged means? I don't know, man.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, you saw the monkey. You know what it means to be flanged and yet it's simply the most desirable state.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't understand.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, you have to be a man. You have to be a male to be flanged.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you're a fucking unflanged...

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You males can't have flanges.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's what you think.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you're an unflanged human, then yeah, of course you fucking see a flange. You're like, ew.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But that's just the sign of the unflanged is that you don't fucking appreciate it.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The sign of the unflanged.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh my god.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast is being unflanged.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's the mark of either an imbecile or the unflanged.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The sign of the unflanged is like an Anamorph's book title.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't even read those. It just feels like the sort of thing.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I retweeted that meme from the Anamorph in Time Twitter of the cover of an Anamorph's book, but it's Rick turning into Pickle Rick.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, that one fucking did me. That one did me a chuckle.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That one really got me.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I haven't even thought about Rick and Morty in such a long time.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Rick and Morty has just been absent from my cultural perception for like a year now.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's not about Rick and Morty. It was about, I'm there for the Anamorph's content.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And there I see the cover of an Anamorph's book and I'm like, ah, yes, this is what I'm interested in.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But the twist is what if it were Rick and Morty and then I remember, oh, Rick and Morty.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What a time in the zeitgeist that was.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What a blunder.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What a blunder.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Did you see that Justin Roiland was bullied for making a Rick and Morty NFT?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And then he was like, ah, geez, guys, ah, geez.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, geez.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He was like, legitimately, ah, geez.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I saw that he was making an NFT.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, but did he get bullied out of it?

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know whether he got bullied out of it, but he was bullied and he made a sad tweet about it.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He should be bullied.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's like, I can't, I can't, this is why I can't deal with Twitter, you guys.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then I don't know what he did after that.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, I saw that.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I saw that fucking weak shit, the fucking weak pussy cow or that piece of shit.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I hope he fucking dies.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Fuck that guy.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Nah, fuck him and his NFP.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He's rich! Who cares what he thinks?

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think, I think you're agreeing with me.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not sure.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A little bit.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's some truth in my statements.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Fuck him.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, deny it.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Fuck him.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, I'm just in Rowland.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's just in fucking Rowland.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What does he need to make an NFT for?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, I scream.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Nothing.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I really think it's like, it's just, he had no idea somehow.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know how.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't know how he had no idea.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He feels like he would be more connected to the internet.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Maybe he's been deliberately distancing himself from it.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And thus does not know how bad NFTs are and was surprised.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, I can believe him not knowing, but if he's going to do it, he should.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I mean, he should have researched it ahead of time and he should know.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Before you do one, you should know what it is and know why it's bad.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All that I care about is that he didn't do it.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He was pulled out of it.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I've got to make a confession here.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
When I first heard of NFTs and I didn't know any of the concerns around it, I was like,

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to make one of those.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I didn't.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, we're all born knowing nothing.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, I don't.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't like blame people.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like, I don't, I don't blame him.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't blame him as long as he didn't go through with it.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As long as he didn't fucking make that devil's bargain.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't blame him for doing a bad thing.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
As long as he didn't do the bad thing, then everything's fine.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, I don't.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, I say I don't care that he was going to do it.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I wouldn't care if he was going to do it as long as he changed his mind and did the right thing.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's, that's all I'm saying.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But, but, but you know what?

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But on the other hand, what, what drives, you're, you're just in Royland.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You have like TV shows on like networks.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are like, you are like a rich, famous person who's like well connected in the industry.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You've, you've, you've literally got it all.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What drives you at that point to be like, I should make an NFT?

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What, what's the, what's the point?

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Most likely it's a PR person saying, hey, NFTs are a thing that's going around now.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You should make one.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We've got the thing set up and he's like, oh, okay, cool.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Ah, geez.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And then he tweets about it, not like, I feel like he wouldn't have, if he had found about it,

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
found out about it himself, he probably wouldn't have like promoted it.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I feel like it's just one of those things.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Because a lot of people who don't know what they're talking about have things called jobs

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in the real world, in offices, and they wear suits and then they don't know anything.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And then they tell people to do stuff.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I feel like one of those people told him to make an NFT.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's definitely more of a publicity thing than like a money thing.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Like he doesn't need the money.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's just this concept is popular at the moment.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's an extra boost.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Does it generate publicity that you made an NFT?

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Generally have no idea.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Does it do that?

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't understand the mindset of people.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think it's just like, oh, it's the hot new fad thing.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Exactly, yeah.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you see the guy, the Oscars, the guy's golden head?

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, God.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, the guy who played Bozeman.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Chadwick Boseman.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Chadwick Boseman.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Chad Boseman.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Real Chad.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
See, that one's actively disgusting.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's one of the most loyal things that has come out of this whole NFT thing.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That one was pretty hideous.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It is.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Say what you like about NFTs, but that one's not in good taste.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I saw that it was just like, it was like a stock, like 3D model that like the NFT,

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the guy who made the NFT, just like he bought the model and then he just like applied a gold texture to it.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He didn't even make the model.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm an multimedia artist.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I take the tools and use them to my fullest extent and make thousands upon thousands of dollars of selling an NFT of it.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I love my book.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And fuck you.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If some PR suit told him, like, NFTs are hot, it'll be a big thing if you do one right now.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
People will think it's cool and he was like, okay, I guess.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And he did it, like, I mean, fair enough, I guess.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But I mean, if not, like the alternative is that like...

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There's no reason to defend it.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, him.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The alternative is that he thought it was cool.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The bullying him into not doing it is a good thing.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, it's a force for good.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I just wonder, I just wonder, like, did he think it was cool?

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's what it means.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like, what does it say?

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What should I infer about you that you were gonna, that you were like on board with this?

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because it's so lame.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's so shit and lame and bad.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's bad in so many ways.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Even if it didn't destroy the environment, I would still hate it, honestly.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is NFT more like not fucking tasty?

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because we can't eat it.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, true.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Not flanged.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's flat.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Not at all.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Not at all.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's the opposite of being flanged, guys.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
New vile, fresh teat.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Gross.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, wow.

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't think new vile is the right word to use there.

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Gross.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But that's what it stands for now.

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What does new vile mean?

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hey, guys, welcome to the new vile means that you're capable of, new vile means that you

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
are capable of childbirth, right?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's what new vile means.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, no.

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, you know.

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I mean, stranger things have happened.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I guess so.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Speaking of teats, Simsie.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Jesus.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's me.

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello.

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You draw the ladies a lot.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Teats.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You draw the ladies.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Teats on the ladies, on the teats.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And there they are.

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Links in the description.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You are very good at what you do.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I make baseless thoughtless art with the sole purpose of titillation.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You do the cash grab fan art, pick a popular character, cash in on their existing fan base,

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
draw them looking sexy, rinse, repeat.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You've done me there.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're right.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's true.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, I see you do it.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I know what you're doing.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And it's fine.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I get it.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But yeah, you're a guy.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You like to draw.

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It says right in your body.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You like to draw tits and lips.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why not draw them on, you know, Nico Robin or, I don't know, Tubi or like whoever is fucking trending right now.

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Or Goku or whatever.

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Or whatever.

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's so easy.

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's like cheating.

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not fair.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It really is.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And that's why you've got like 10 times as many Twitter followers.

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What do you mean like 40k?

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I used to hate that.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Like people who would just do whatever is popular and make bank off of it and usually tits are involved.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm like, damn it.

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't want to do that.

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But if I did want to do that, I'd be jealous.

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Realizing that I don't actually care to do that art.

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It means that it's fine.

229
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
People are just making money.

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm under the impression that you're just kind of just genuinely like doing it.

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And you're not like suffering through the process.

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm just doing this cynically to fool them all.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, no, no.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I would still be drawing tits if like commissions were not a concept in this universe.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I would still just be like drawing tits in person online.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like it's not purely for the money.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The followers of the fame.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I just really like doing it.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I never disliked it because it was like a cynical thing.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was just sort of like, oh, damn it.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
People make money from things they draw that I am not drawing.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That sucks.

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I wish that sucks when people do that.

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
When people go to Google.com, they type in their favorite character, Big Booby, and they would find my art instead.

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But they don't do that.

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That is one of the most satisfying things about.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I think I am a little bit of an egomaniac, to be honest.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like seeing my numbers go up is very satisfying.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like typing in a character like Google.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, typing in a character on Google and seeing my own art on there.

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Just like on Google.

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's really weird.

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The couple times that I...

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, I had them...

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I've done a couple pieces of fan art.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I've never done number one result or anything.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But I have a couple of old fan arts that I did.

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Like if you Google Lisa and you scroll down a little ways on the...

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It doesn't take you that far to find the one like Lisa fan art that I did.

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think that's pretty cool.

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Where she became president in 2020?

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes, where Lisa Simpson became president in 2020.

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, the one with the game, with the guy.

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With Brad.

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Darling House?

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No!

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Greg of Art, he'll come back.

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, yes.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Speaking of the Simpsons, have you guys heard Dr. Hibbert's new voice?

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There's a voice?

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, Dr. Hibbert.

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, I heard that he has one.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I haven't heard it.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They recast Carl and Dr. Hibbert and all the other recurring black characters because, you know...

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
White people can't play with people.

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay.

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm fine with that, but the voice for... they're not good voices.

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I...

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That is the...

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know.

284
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The concern sometimes.

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I mean, who cares, really?

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It is the Simpsons.

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If it ruins the jokes, then that's the problem, I guess.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean, if it's just unfamiliar, then people can get used to it.

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, I guess who cares, really.

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's pretty weird.

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like a quasi-impression of the old one, but like much deeper and like...

293
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Of course.

294
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Squishy-squishier sounding.

295
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's got that like, whoa, thing going on with his voice, you know what I mean?

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's like a weird way of putting it, but...

297
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He's... what?

298
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He's got the what?

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like, like...

300
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He sounds a bit like Mr. Bean, but like an American man.

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was gonna say, Mr. Bean.

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Jesus Christ.

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah, exactly.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Like, he's got big jowls on his face.

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah.

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I get... I think that the Appu thing makes more sense,

307
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
because Appu is like a specific ethnic group,

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and he's from a country, and he has a linguistic accent.

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Dr. Hippard and Carl are just like American dudes.

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know.

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know about that one.

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The thing with him is the aspect of the character matching...

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Like, the voice actor matching the ethnicity of the character being portrayed.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That doesn't matter, because voice actors are talented.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The actual issue that was like...

317
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Nobody really understood, because the surface level of,

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
oh, it's a brown character played by a white person.

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's bad.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Like, that's fine.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's just that there's less minorities in the industry,

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
or able to get into the industry as work tech.

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I mean, is that...

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
All characters could be black voice actors,

325
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
if there's no reason some of them have to be white,

326
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
because they're played by white characters all the other way around.

327
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's just like, there should be, you know...

328
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's not really... that's the reason, Ben.

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's not really that's the reason.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The show is 30 years old, and made it a time when you just hire people.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think it's probably good.

333
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's good if people of every stripe can get a fucking job doing their shit.

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's all fine and good.

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We should have...

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We should have the white characters.

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They should have replaced white characters with black voice actors.

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I just wanted to say, the voices do sound really bad.

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's just my point.

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, I don't know.

341
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What are you going to say?

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If people are trying to do an impression of a character that has existed for 30 years,

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
it's definitely going to feel weird.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Because it's not the same.

346
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, yeah.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I just watched the real gyms did a...

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know him? The Simpsons? The Simps... The Simptuber?

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah, he did a character history video on Dr. Hebrou.

350
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Maybe that was why he picked him or something.

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh, maybe.

352
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There's not that much to talk about, really.

353
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Dr. Hebrou is not like Edna Krabapal or someone who has a arc that's carried throughout the show.

354
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Dr. Hebrou has been the same fucking guy every single time he's appeared.

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's never had an episode dedicated to him, ever.

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Wasn't there that one time there was a mayoral race and Mr. Burns was running,

357
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and he had his League of Evil politician people?

358
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Or maybe it was just some other evil organization.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And there was Mr. Burns there, for one.

360
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But Hebert was there.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Are you talking about when Cytro Bob was running for the Republican Party?

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's what it was. Cytro Bob.

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And Hebert was there.

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, that was weird.

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't know why he...

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That was a very secret Republican.

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Is that some weird statement on hospitals being secretly owned by political parties or something like that?

368
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like bias towards them? I don't know.

369
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I think they probably just picked a bunch of kind of upper crusty springfieldians

370
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and were like, we'll make them the secret Republican cabal.

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And you know, you pick a doctor, you pick a lawyer, you pick the rich Texan guy.

372
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You would think Dr. Nick more so, wouldn't you?

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Dr. Nick.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, I think...

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, I can totally see Dr. Herbert being a Republican.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He wears fucking Argyle sweaters.

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He's got his wife...

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, his wife wears the fucking shoulder pad suits.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He's well to do.

380
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's kind of his joke, isn't it?

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
His joke is that he always says something totally horrible.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But laughs afterwards.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And so it's like silly how he's laughing about it.

384
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Maybe he's a really nice diva.

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Can't do his voice at all.

386
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, that's much better.

387
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm so bad at voices. I used to be okay, but now I just don't even try.

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? It's complicated.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm gonna get fired.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Israel deserves to exist, Bart.

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Do we want to get into that?

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Worse fucking hybrid impression.

393
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We could. I'm flabbergasted.

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That was a really awful hybrid impression.

395
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let me try again. He sounds like...

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There's a couple of injections into the spine.

397
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, God, I don't remember. I don't remember what he sounds like.

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He goes, no, let's get along with your COVID-19 vaccination.

399
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's better than mine.

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Right, there's war. There's war happening now.

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It was kind of like Israel-Lamao.

402
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Israel-Lamao. A week ago, when it was Monday, I think, everything kicked off.

403
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
When there was the attack on that mosque and those people praying.

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It was the Islamic religious holiday.

405
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then Hamas retaliated by firing rockets and then Israel jumped in and shot back.

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It was like, okay, it's a big old thing.

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is that what inside of the Hamas rockets, the mosque attack?

408
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I missed that part. I forgot.

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I think that was the initial spark.

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The first thing I saw was there were people praying in Arab.

411
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Is it Muslim?

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes, it's the word.

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:26,000
During a religious holiday, one of the three most important places for Islam.

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It was tear-gassed by Israeli police at the time for seemingly no reason.

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I didn't know what was going on.

416
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I still don't really know.

417
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But tensions between Jews and Arabs in the area have been high and up and down for generations.

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Ramadan ended May 12.

419
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The basic gist is, from what I understand, the Israeli Prime Minister.

420
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I forget his name.

421
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Netanyahu.

422
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He's a far-right ethno-nationalist who is very anti-Arab.

423
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Right now, him attacking in such force is good for his party.

424
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Because Hamas is firing rockets, he can get to say,

425
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
you need to keep me in power because I'm defending you, citizens.

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
These terrorists are destroying us.

427
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And if we don't blow them to fucking Kingdom come, they'll come and get you.

428
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Vote for me in the next election, lol.

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Nice, nice.

430
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It sounds about right.

431
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's pretty bad.

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I didn't know much about the Israel-Palestine conflict other than what I'd heard from bits and bobs

433
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
in my entire life that it's complicated.

434
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I guess it's too complicated.

435
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't want to know.

436
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's what bugs me.

437
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I was raised as a kid.

438
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was told that that whole Israel-Palestine thing,

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
it's an ancient battle that's been fought.

440
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's like the blood war.

441
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's like the blood war between demons and devils.

442
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's raged since time immemorial.

443
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's an intractable conflict that can never be solved.

444
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It will outlast all of us and it began before anyone living today.

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Israel is like 50 years old.

446
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It was made within living memory.

447
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's like a new country.

448
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It was made at the end of the First World War.

449
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I looked into the origin of all of it.

450
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And it's basically Britain's fault.

451
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because that land was occupied by Turkey.

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
During the First World War, Turkey stayed neutral for a while,

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but then due to some shenanigans,

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
because they were upset at the Ottoman Empire shrinking.

455
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The Balkan Wars previously were like,

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
they lost territory and they're like,

457
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
damn it, we got to make the Empire great again.

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So they joined Germany.

459
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And so in order to fight off the Turks,

460
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
the British enlisted the help of some Arabs

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
who were trying to, from Arabs in the area,

462
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
they wanted a unified Middle East, a singular nation.

463
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And they said, we'll help you fight the Turks, Britain,

464
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
if you help us and recognize our right to this land.

465
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And the Britons said, okay.

466
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And then they fought together in the war.

467
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And then Britain was like, and lol, no, actually,

468
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
we're just going to carve out the land to our own benefit.

469
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Against the Turks of the Ottoman Empire, right?

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Am I following you?

471
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The Turks were defeated.

472
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The Ottoman Empire was pushed back.

473
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And that land that was going to be like a united Arab era,

474
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I can't think of the word to describe.

475
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It was agreements.

476
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There was stuff on Wikipedia about it that I read.

477
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's basically all I did.

478
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I just looked at Wikipedia for like three hours.

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But then Britain and France secretly had been talking,

480
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
all right, so we're not actually going to recognize their state.

481
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We're just going to take...

482
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Radcon 5 Gibbon takes lecture on the Israeli Palestine.

483
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, this is brilliant.

484
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's just Wikipedia.

485
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's so easy to find.

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I could fucking do a lecture on it.

487
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It'd be funny.

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Do it.

489
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So like Britain and France, it was just like,

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
let's cut up the land.

491
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
We're going to make Jordan here.

492
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We're going to make Lebanon.

493
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We're going to make Palestine cut the land into these sections.

494
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And those are the countries in that area now.

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
For their own benefit to like for trade or something,

496
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
colonies, I don't remember exactly what the reason for cutting it up.

497
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Obviously it was beneficial for them.

498
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They just said, we're not going to honor the promise to you Arabs.

499
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I think that carried over into a different separate agreement

500
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that was made by Zionists and the British government at the time

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to make a safe haven for Jews in Palestine after the First World War

502
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
because the Jews were going to help fight in the war if they agreed to that

503
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and they made an agreement.

504
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I thought...

505
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And the agreement was extremely vague

506
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and did not consider the Palestinian people who lived there or the Arabs

507
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and at last it was just sort of between Jews and the British government.

508
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
We want a place to live and we want it to be in our homeland

509
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and this Holy Land area give us this.

510
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And they said, okay, we won the war.

511
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Turkey is smaller and this area is now occupied by the Britain.

512
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
We're going to give you this land in Palestine

513
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and we're just going to leave the rules very vague

514
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and you can have a land in Palestine, quote, in Palestine.

515
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It doesn't say how much of Palestine.

516
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And then they just left and everything was fucked from there

517
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
because the Palestinians were like, you didn't tell us...

518
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You first of all fucking betrayed us.

519
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You said this whole area was going to be like an Arab.

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You lied, you bastard.

521
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And also you're giving this land to the Jews

522
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and I don't know whether they were on good terms back then.

523
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I don't know religious history that much.

524
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But they obviously were persecuted up to that point, the Jewish people.

525
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So I guess it was not welcome and they started fighting almost immediately

526
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and it wasn't so bad for a while.

527
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't know, that was where my reading stopped.

528
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But basically Britain fucked everything up.

529
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You sound like you've read up more on it than I have,

530
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
but I thought that the Israel that exists today,

531
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I thought that it came into being after World War II and the Holocaust.

532
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What happened with that is that the Holocaust had...

533
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Obviously Germany at that time was doing a lot of bad stuff to Jews.

534
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
They had to run away.

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Lots of them ran to Israel and they grew Israel

536
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
because there's more Jews there and people would come in all the time

537
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and it would grow and they would use the excuse that

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
there's more people here, we need more land.

539
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Hey Palestinians, we're going to take more of your land now

540
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and you're just going to give it to us

541
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and there's nothing you can do about it because we have the backing of the West

542
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
because current day the US backs Israel a lot

543
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
specifically because it is a good jumping off point

544
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
as a good jumping off point to bully other places in the Middle East with military power.

545
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
This is a very powerful place.

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Have you seen that old clip of like somewhat younger,

547
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
weirdly balder Joe Biden ranting about Israel?

548
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
There's a several minute clip of him.

549
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He's like banging his fist and he's shouting

550
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and he comes off as extremely aggressive and thuggish almost

551
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and he's like, if we didn't have an Israel,

552
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
America would have to invent an Israel to protect our interest in the region

553
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and stuff like that.

554
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's like, oh boy, now here's a guy who really likes Israel.

555
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Our interest in the region meaning quick and easy access to bullying Arabs out of their oil.

556
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't think it's entirely about oil.

557
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's about foreign policy relationships.

558
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's about foreign policy, but ultimately foreign policy is dictated by resources

559
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that the US and the UK to some extent.

560
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't know exactly what they're...

561
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
They have not like...

562
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
What was that thing?

563
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's like a call for a ceasefire, the UN,

564
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but the US didn't back it.

565
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Everyone else did, including the UK.

566
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I don't know exactly what the UK's relationship is.

567
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But yeah, it's a foreign policy thing,

568
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
but a lot of it is dictated by resources, oil, other things, uranium that you can mine.

569
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Are you still learning Arabic, by the way?

570
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Capitalism is the problem.

571
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Capitalism is the problem.

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
True.

573
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
If I can...

574
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I did stop.

575
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I just fell off.

576
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I like it.

577
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's a cool language.

578
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I want to learn how to write it, like calligraphy style.

579
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It looks so cool.

580
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It's a really cool looking language, written...

581
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I do remember a lot of the little quirks of writing the letters,

582
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
where there's a shape that is like one way when it's the first letter in a word,

583
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and then another way when it's like the middle letter in a word,

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and you can recognize the similar swerve of the ink,

585
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and it's like, ah, that's a zh sound.

586
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's a zh, and if you put a dot about it, it's a zh sound.

587
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Stuff like that.

588
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
How are you feeling by the way?

589
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's cool.

590
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Feeling?

591
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Have you recovered?

592
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh no, I feel terrible right now.

593
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Nice.

594
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I was going to talk about it, but I need to pee,

595
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
so I'll be back in a second.

596
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Ah yes.

597
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Okay, Simsie.

598
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Let's talk about what a fucking nerd give is,

599
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
for doing research and reading up on history and shit.

600
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
She knows things I don't.

601
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I have nothing to contribute.

602
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah, I didn't go that in depth with it.

603
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm just a basic bitch.

604
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm just your basic bitch.

605
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I see some fucking ethnic cleansing on my Twitter timeline.

606
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I say, I don't like that.

607
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Exactly.

608
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I saw a headline and I was like, oh that's bad,

609
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and then I haven't seen anything else again.

610
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Wait, I did make that.

611
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I made a, since I was fucking around in Game Maker,

612
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I made a quick and dirty edit to my game

613
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
to record a little footage of Phantom Horn destroying Israel.

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh my god.

615
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That was a bit...

616
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
That was great.

617
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, I understand the sentiment is funny.

618
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's like, yes, Israel is being bad,

619
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
but the idea of destroying it with a sword slice...

620
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I was laughing so hard as I uploaded.

621
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Just imagine you sat in your dark room,

622
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
hunched over on your keyboard.

623
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's pretty edgy.

624
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It isn't that edgy.

625
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You click done after importing Israel.png to Game Maker.

626
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I would do the same thing for America.

627
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You think I won't have Phantom Horn slice Israel,

628
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I mean America in half?

629
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'll do it.

630
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I get it, but I think it's annoying,

631
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
but it's true that there's a lot of actual anti-Semites

632
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
who just hate Israel for stupid reasons,

633
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and they would want to kill Israel and Israelites and Jews.

634
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And so people get confused a lot.

635
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's annoying.

636
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
There's this very clear difference

637
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
of the actions of a prime minister who is a far-right guy

638
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and an entire ethnic group.

639
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I did get one or two people mad at me and their replies,

640
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but it's a country, and countries aren't people,

641
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and countries are bad, states are bad,

642
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and they should be killed.

643
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So, I don't know.

644
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Fuck it.

645
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Insert any fucking country you want in there,

646
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and it's fine.

647
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's always correct.

648
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's always moral to kill a country.

649
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, fucking it.

650
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's not in Merry Old England.

651
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I do like the design of the flag,

652
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
but I will destroy it.

653
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I will kill everyone present.

654
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's aesthetically pleasing.

655
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Give me, put the England in there,

656
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and I will just, I'll have phantom horn

657
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
just neatly slice Northern Ireland right off.

658
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Right off of it.

659
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Freedom.

660
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Freedom.

661
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Northern Ireland is an England ban.

662
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's not part of England, you fool.

663
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Wait, is that, am I stupid?

664
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I thought Northern Ireland was part of England.

665
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's part of the United Kingdom.

666
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
England is its England.

667
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh God, yeah, now you're right.

668
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
England and Scotland and Northern Ireland and Wales,

669
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to some extent.

670
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I was just thinking like,

671
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
you could do like a whole political series

672
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
of phantom horn destroys X,

673
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and it would be like, oh Brexit,

674
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
like slicing the UK off from Europe.

675
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
From the EU, yeah.

676
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's like, oh man, commission.

677
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Commission me to have,

678
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
you can have phantom horn slice anything

679
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
you want in that.

680
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Unironically, could be like a,

681
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
like a Patreon reward.

682
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I mean, shit.

683
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
$70.

684
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I mean shit.

685
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, I could, I can,

686
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
when the game's done, I can release

687
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
a custom version.

688
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Patreon me $100, and I will release a custom version

689
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
that just has, I will put

690
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
anything you want in there as the final boss.

691
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Well, I don't know about anything you want.

692
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Anything you want.

693
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Anything, it's yours.

694
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's done.

695
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This could backfire heavily.

696
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No.

697
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'll just pretend someone else did it.

698
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'll pretend they hacked the game.

699
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Somebody modded my game.

700
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
They modded my game against my will.

701
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Should we go back to Gibbs Health

702
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
for a second?

703
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Sure.

704
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, yeah.

705
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, I mean, I sound all right at the moment,

706
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I think.

707
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But last few days,

708
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
especially, have been

709
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
agonizing.

710
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And I don't like it.

711
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's, I'm still waiting

712
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
one, I've got one week to go

713
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
waiting for my fucking

714
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
ultrasound that I'm having on my

715
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
liver so they can see inside

716
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and see, ooh, there's a gremlin in there.

717
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
We mis-stab it and chop it up.

718
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
There's a nasty Whittle Galboy.

719
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Just get the harpoon.

720
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Nasty Whittle Galboy in there.

721
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, I still don't have a diagnosis.

722
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I've been waiting.

723
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They said they'll call me or text me or whatever.

724
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I gave my blood.

725
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What more can I do?

726
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The ultrasound is the only thing left

727
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
that is like a test to be done.

728
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So I assume after I get that done,

729
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
they'll tell me that I'm going to die

730
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
in one minute.

731
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Did you get vaccinated yet?

732
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
No.

733
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Vaccines are still like,

734
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
you have to be old-ish.

735
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Really?

736
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And they're only now.

737
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

738
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You have to be old or sick.

739
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't think I'm going to get a vaccine for a while.

740
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Oh, damn.

741
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I guess we're hogging them all.

742
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I was thinking of like seeing

743
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
what the accommodation was because I smoke

744
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and seeing if I could get mine a little bit quicker

745
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
than all the other-

746
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I've heard that some people have gotten moved up the list

747
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
because they smoke, yeah.

748
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Fucking cool as hell.

749
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, look into that.

750
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Definitely.

751
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Cigarettes are so fucking cool.

752
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
No, they're not.

753
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
They're so fucking good for you.

754
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
No, dude.

755
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm so ruthlessly addicted to them.

756
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I literally just like put on my coat,

757
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
went out in the rain earlier,

758
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I was smoking.

759
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And I felt like this is nothing.

760
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm not even like socially doing it.

761
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm just like putting toxins into my body

762
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
for no reason.

763
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I mean, yeah.

764
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's how it is.

765
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But I kind of like it though.

766
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I kind of like it.

767
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Let me just take that nicotine out of there.

768
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I just-

769
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Get some like parsley.

770
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Roll that up.

771
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It would still be toxic to just burn something

772
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and inhale the smoke from it.

773
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I've tried to quit.

774
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's still bad.

775
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I mean, I've been in the worst situation

776
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
because I tried to quit

777
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and I quit for about six months

778
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and like with a vape.

779
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's pretty good.

780
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah, with a vape.

781
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And then now I just smoke and I vape at the same time.

782
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I smoked less, but I vape a lot.

783
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So now I'm just doing both.

784
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Why didn't you just not buy any more cigarettes

785
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and just vape instead?

786
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That's what I did for six months.

787
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, okay.

788
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And then I went to the pub with my friends

789
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
during summer and they were like,

790
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
just one, my friend.

791
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then it happened.

792
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You must kill them.

793
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I have not smoked or vape

794
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
like hardly at all for months now.

795
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Occasionally, a friend will offer me a cigarette

796
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and I will smoke it.

797
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But I've been off smoking for long enough

798
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that it doesn't give me the fucking shakes

799
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and I crave it anymore.

800
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm just like, I'll smoke one.

801
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And then I'm like, okay.

802
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, I think it's literally just a matter

803
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
of not being in the habit

804
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
of going to the store to buy cigarettes.

805
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Because when I'm in that habit,

806
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
then I'll go and I'll buy them

807
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and then I'll have them.

808
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But now I'm out of the habit of buying them

809
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
so I never have them.

810
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So it's not even an option.

811
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
The price of them keeps going up

812
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and I thought that would stop me.

813
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But also the amount of money I make

814
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
has kept going up.

815
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So I just fucking keep buying them.

816
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Well, okay.

817
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You heard it here.

818
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Stop paying Simzi.

819
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You're killing him.

820
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You're killing me.

821
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You're killing me.

822
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Pay us.

823
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Customers.

824
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

825
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Pay the PCP.

826
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Donate.

827
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I don't even smoke weed.

828
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
No, I don't.

829
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I hate weed.

830
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I've only smoked weed twice

831
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and I had a horrible experience both times.

832
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I smoked a few times

833
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and it's been like okay at best

834
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and pretty fucking terrible at worst.

835
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I was like, I'm violently sick

836
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and then also all of my senses

837
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
went backwards and then I passed out.

838
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That sounds like some strange weed.

839
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I've looked it up

840
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and I think I'm just allergic to it

841
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and had like a really violent reaction

842
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
or something.

843
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I had one time that I smoked it

844
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
that I thought maybe there was some other stuff

845
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
in what I smoked

846
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
because this one time that I had it

847
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I had like a really intense

848
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
like physical body high

849
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that felt like a nightmare

850
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and I wanted to scream.

851
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That's probably just more accurate.

852
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Like that's not normal.

853
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah.

854
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And it hasn't always been like that.

855
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But it's one time it was super bad.

856
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Both times that it's happened

857
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
like everyone else who's done it

858
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
has been absolutely fine.

859
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So either it's just

860
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I have a really low tolerance for it

861
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and it's fucked me up

862
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and I think that I'm having

863
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
a nightmare reaction

864
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and then it happens.

865
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
My understanding

866
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
it seems like some people

867
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
just feel different

868
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
when they smoke it

869
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
than other people do

870
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and those people

871
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and I think I'm one of them

872
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and maybe you are too.

873
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It just

874
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
for us it just feels like shit

875
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and it's like no thanks.

876
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It was a wild bite.

877
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I mean I've

878
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I've had it like

879
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
two or three times

880
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and it's only been

881
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
when Trixie has given me some

882
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I've probably done it maybe

883
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
or maybe a dozen times

884
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
maybe a dozen times at most.

885
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We're so lame.

886
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The most it's ever done

887
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
is

888
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
at Redcon 4 actually.

889
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I had like a pretty mellow cool

890
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
walk on the beach at night.

891
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I was like seeing weird

892
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
patents in the sand.

893
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So I was like whoa,

894
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
that's nice.

895
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And that was it.

896
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That was the most I ever got high.

897
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I've been much more drunk

898
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
than I have been high.

899
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, absolutely.

900
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah.

901
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Before I ever smoked weed

902
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
the first high I ever got

903
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
was fucking

904
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
this is so embarrassing

905
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
but it was a

906
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Downing Robotessin

907
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
because

908
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
my girlfriend in college

909
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
she in high school

910
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
she and her friends I guess

911
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
had just fucking down

912
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Robotessin and Robotrip sometimes

913
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and she got me to try it with her

914
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and it was a

915
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I mean it wasn't

916
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
it wasn't too horrible.

917
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It was fine

918
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
but it's just so embarrassing

919
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
to admit it.

920
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Robotripping is not

921
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
it's not cool.

922
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Wait.

923
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's not hip.

924
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What is that?

925
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's when you just drink Robotessin.

926
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
What's Robotessin?

927
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Is it a brand name

928
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
or is it?

929
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's cough syrup.

930
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Oh.

931
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's DMX I think

932
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
is the chemical in it.

933
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's a

934
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
BMX.

935
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Robotessin.

936
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What's the

937
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
what's the active chemical

938
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
in Robotessin?

939
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It is

940
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
cyanide.

941
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Weed.

942
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Dextro.

943
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Dextro metherfan

944
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
is the active chemical

945
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that I don't know

946
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
makes you fucking

947
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
high and I

948
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
did that a bunch of times.

949
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So you got absolutely

950
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
shot faced on cough syrup

951
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
and had a

952
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
had a lovely time.

953
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I don't know if I was shit faced.

954
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I mean it's

955
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I mean I don't know.

956
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I was probably I probably acted weird

957
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
because you know

958
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I have really visceral memories

959
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
of the first time I smoked weed and

960
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
just like after after I'd been sick about

961
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
six times I went and sat in the garden on a chair

962
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
while everyone else was like getting drunk and stuff

963
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and my friend who's got a really thick

964
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Bristolian accent came over

965
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
and kneeled next to me and he's like

966
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
it's alright bro.

967
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You're just having a bad trip.

968
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's alright.

969
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Just calm down.

970
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Just don't worry about it.

971
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It happens to everybody.

972
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It happens to the best of us.

973
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I was just sitting there just like

974
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
please leave me alone.

975
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I can't hear a speech now without feeling

976
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
worse.

977
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah.

978
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
God bless him.

979
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
He's trying his best.

980
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The time that I had the worst

981
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
reaction to it I remember

982
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I felt um

983
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I was in a room.

984
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I went to a party after I smoked.

985
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This was with that same

986
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
girlfriend in college.

987
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We went to a party

988
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and I was like sitting on the floor

989
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and there was a ceiling fan

990
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
going.

991
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It was blowing the air in the room

992
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and

993
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I could feel the wind from the ceiling fan

994
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
but in my in my high

995
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
my weed state I felt

996
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
like it was like a

997
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
torrent.

998
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It was like a

999
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I was being like blasted

1000
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
with like dry air from this

1001
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
ceiling fan that was like drying me out

1002
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and killing me.

1003
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
In my weed form.

1004
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah.

1005
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And I was like this is the worst feeling

1006
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I've ever felt.

1007
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It was awful.

1008
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Awful awful.

1009
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
The second time I had it it felt like

1010
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the inside of my nose was swelling up

1011
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
which which is why I think I'm allergic

1012
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
because it just sounds like it was happening

1013
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and then like it sounds like yeah

1014
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the position of taste on my

1015
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
tongue was swapped.

1016
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So like if like a piece of chicken

1017
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
like because I had chicken wings like afterwards

1018
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and I was like I'm gonna eat something because I feel weird

1019
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and then like food

1020
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
on the right side of my mouth felt like

1021
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
it was on the left side

1022
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and I've tried looking this up

1023
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and I've never heard of anyone having the experience

1024
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
like this ever again with weed

1025
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and all my friends were completely fine

1026
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and I think I'm just

1027
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
How bizarre.

1028
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It was very odd.

1029
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It was one of the most unusual.

1030
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I've never heard of that before either.

1031
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
No.

1032
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think you I think you just invented

1033
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
a new a new symptom.

1034
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Maybe I'm just like

1035
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
of the weed overdose.

1036
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Maybe I'm just lying to myself.

1037
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Maybe it didn't happen.

1038
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I don't know.

1039
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It was only last year but

1040
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I mean you were twisted.

1041
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I was twist.

1042
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I was twist.

1043
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Hello.

1044
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Whatever the new one is.

1045
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Twist.

1046
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Hello.

1047
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Cool.

1048
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Dude.

1049
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's so base.

1050
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Dude.

1051
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Dude.

1052
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
We should pay a mural.

1053
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Back to hook me up.

1054
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Hook me.

1055
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Introduce me.

1056
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You're going to get those connections.

1057
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, do you want a back to the.

1058
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The Gib.

1059
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay.

1060
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah.

1061
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Sure.

1062
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Like is dying corner.

1063
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,320
aside from aside from all that's happening a new

1064
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,500
Complications happened not related. I assume. I have an ear problem now. I think it's nothing serious

1065
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,080
Sorry, sorry, I'm just I'm just so bored listening to other people's problems

1066
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,100
Then that's so awfully rude you nasty man. I

1067
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,640
Know and yet I can't help it. It's my nature to be a nasty man

1068
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,920
Capricious

1069
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:25,400
Continue. So is it just some sort like like ear pain or like you can't hear properly? No, no, no it I

1070
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,760
Can't hear low frequencies in one of my ears and I couldn't tell what was wrong for a really long time because

1071
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,680
most of what I listen to is like

1072
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,400
Fine, but as soon as I speak because it's coming from my you know inside my head

1073
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:49,440
I hear all of the frequencies of my voice including the low-end and it's very clearly not right in one of my ears

1074
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,840
I can't hear low frequencies in my left ear. It is

1075
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,720
so

1076
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,080
Frustrating because I feel like I just need to just to grab something in there and pull it out like as a blockage

1077
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,440
but obviously

1078
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,800
I'm stupid

1079
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,480
There was a bit of earwax there and I was like like scratching at it with my finger trying to get it out apparently

1080
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,680
That's the worst thing you could do is try to get it out

1081
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,040
Because um, you're just pushing it further in and now I think I have a blockage

1082
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:26,440
And that sucks you should you should watch you ever watch those videos on YouTube of like earwax

1083
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,360
Blot like clump extraction. No, please. No

1084
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,960
No, no, no, I mean

1085
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:44,040
You there you can see fucking giant fucking like lumps of like condensed earwax be removed from a person's outer ear canal

1086
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,600
And I mean it's kind of gross, but it's also kind of like oh

1087
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,640
It's nice to see that removed because that was really bad

1088
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,760
I think kind of satisfying I mean see it to see it. It's it's satisfying to feel it removed

1089
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,060
I don't look at it when I scratch my ear

1090
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,260
Hmm

1091
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:09,300
Gross but I feel like the low point of my life is watching weird YouTube videos like that sometimes like

1092
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:15,220
There was a pimple popping. Yeah, it's like worse than that like specifically there was an example

1093
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,360
Like I was drunk and I came home from the club with like my friends and like I went upstairs the bed

1094
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,420
Because I don't want to talk to these people anymore. I'm spent I'm done

1095
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:28,920
I'm gonna be an introvert and hide in my room and I was I was drunk and eating like crisps and

1096
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,120
watching videos of a guy testing like mouse drowning

1097
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,280
contraptions and I

1098
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,640
It was horrible and I don't know why I did it and I generally consider that one of the lowest points of my life

1099
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,720
Well, I wasn't like it entertained. I was watching this guy. So say why why would you do it then?

1100
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,040
I don't know. I found it and I was like whoa

1101
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,660
What the fuck and I start watching it and I I feel evil for having done that I

1102
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,940
Feel I feel like Justin Royland for having done that. I also feel that you are evil

1103
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,780
The point is just that it's it's cuz like yesterday I

1104
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,220
Was feeling so bad in the morning and the night before

1105
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,180
That I could barely like I think it was like

1106
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:33,220
Super dehydrating something going on with my liver is causing me to like dehydrate really easily and very difficult to

1107
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Rehydrate so I've been drinking loads of water and it hasn't been going in it's like frustrating and I was so cracked and dry and dusty

1108
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,660
I felt like I was gonna turn into dust like that one episode of Angel where that guy turns to dust

1109
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,980
Because it's a creature demon goes inside him and sucks all the moisture out of it

1110
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:58,560
Oh, yeah, Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone Harry Potter and the demon that sucks the moisture out from on the side

1111
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
The demon that sucks the moisture

1112
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:15,540
It was just like so perfect. I was watching this angel and this guy

1113
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,980
He was like possessed by this demon that was forcing him to drink

1114
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:26,360
But he was not getting the water in and he was his face was cracking and there was like some like face makeup to make him look

1115
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,140
Like it was cracking like down the side of his face and then he fell over and turned into a pile of dust

1116
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,280
And I felt that that was the most visceral feeling what I have ever had

1117
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,620
Stone

1118
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,020
When when professor quarrel just crumbled to dust and fell and fell and and then Voldemort's

1119
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,540
Ghostface went screaming through Harry's torso. I I felt seen

1120
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,620
Anyway that that

1121
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,700
Coupled with like I was I was trying to survive was trying to like feel better

1122
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,140
I think last week. I wasn't on the PCP because I was feeling similar

1123
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,900
It was just so like I there's no energy and then today

1124
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,180
I well over the last few days this ear thing has come up and I'm like

1125
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,940
Just stop getting sick

1126
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,580
Yeah, and I want to stab myself in the head with a knife doesn't seem fair

1127
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,140
I stabbed myself in a head with a knife to get the ear. It's just not fair like what have you done

1128
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,300
that means that

1129
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,100
You need to fucking fall apart all of a sudden

1130
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,860
Yeah, I haven't released my secret project

1131
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,860
Yeah, they were upset that I that I didn't release my secret

1132
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,900
That's why I've escaped

1133
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,620
Law for you now

1134
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:56,620
So I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Oh, I'll kill you. I'll just kill you. I'll kill you. Oh, yeah

1135
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,820
There's nothing special about it, I'm just mentioning it so you know

1136
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,300
This is why I'm never doing a secret project because I will collapse

1137
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:17,740
Simsie I was I guess I'm does it bear mentioning that one of the things we've talked about in my

1138
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:22,020
Server is that you were one of you were one of the kuso mega people. Yes

1139
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,500
You were on which is for anyone doesn't know that was Trixie's

1140
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,220
Light I guess it started as a light novel series, but it was gonna be more than that

1141
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,180
Right, it was it was a light novel parody series that was gonna get a physical release

1142
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,340
Basically, you she was commissioning like manga pages though, right?

1143
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:47,460
So or were you were you just doing like character art for a light no, there were insert there was lots of different art

1144
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,740
There was commissioned there was like a cover there was like a character page

1145
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,260
Which is what I worked on like at the beginning of the night light novel where it lists all the characters and descriptions of them

1146
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,500
And I did all the basic character designs for that

1147
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:04,020
There was like a ton of like insert pages for key points in the story and things like that and um, yeah

1148
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:11,260
So I was the guy who did like if you open up like a modigatary or some other light novel where they show all the characters at the front and says look

1149
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,780
It's her. Wow. Look at it. Look at look at that

1150
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:18,900
I have never read a light novel in my life. It's sort of it's still the same thing

1151
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,420
It's like in a manga where you pick up a manga volume and it has like piccolo and he's smiling and stuff

1152
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:30,860
You love it up to a picture you see and then and it makes you smile and you smile

1153
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,860
God fucking piccolo rules

1154
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:42,020
Piccolo really does rule we can all agree like triangle shoulders, and that's based

1155
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,780
Yeah, Piccolo dresses like Dr. Hibbert's wife

1156
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,660
with the big shoulder pads

1157
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,620
I

1158
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,860
The entire series

1159
00:54:54,860 --> 00:55:01,540
Yeah, she has a name. I think oh god. I think her name is like Janine is Vivian from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

1160
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,860
She does look like she has she has spoken before

1161
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,660
occasionally

1162
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,660
There are there I

1163
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:16,820
Since I since I watched the real gyms episode. I guess there I guess there are rumors of infidelity

1164
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,940
I guess there are rumors. It's dr. Hibbert's been fucking around with his with his

1165
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,860
I don't know. What would you call it?

1166
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,700
Secretary or whatever?

1167
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,140
It's all concubines. Okay, it's catamite, but it's all unsubstantiated

1168
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,260
Der

1169
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,260
Never had an episode

1170
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:42,040
Never had an episode about him. He's like it. He's like everybody knows dr.

1171
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,640
Hibbert never had an epic comic book guy has had an episode dr. Nick's had episodes

1172
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Yeah

1173
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:56,360
I guess I guess dr. Hibbert's thing is like Applejack. He's like the doctor that is

1174
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,240
He's he's a Republican so he's just like Applejack

1175
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,800
He's just like Applejack because because like Applejack

1176
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,440
Was the the straight man pony the the one that was not

1177
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,800
Stupid and so she would always be the the character that would be like here's the truth you dumb fuck

1178
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,680
Dr. Hibbert they always go to dr. Hibbert because he is the the responsible one who knows medicine

1179
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,280
Dr. Nick is the one who doesn't and that's his joke dr. Hibbert is the straight man

1180
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,280
He just has his joke we laughs at horrible

1181
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, even what you can do like with an episode about a character like that

1182
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,360
Wait, Applejack isn't the stupid one. I thought she was a stupid one

1183
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,080
Wait, do you actually not know? No, I've never watched my little pony, but I've gotten the impression that she's just she's the one with the hat, right?

1184
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:53,240
Oh, isn't there isn't there like an old quote? Oh my god, please please. Let me say what I want to fucking say

1185
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:59,640
Oh my god, isn't there an old quote from like Gen 2 or whatever where it's like Applejack's a silly pony? I

1186
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,220
Feel like that's a thing that is like a line that I've seen

1187
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:10,380
Yes, Applejack is a silly pony. Okay, good. Thank you for confirming

1188
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:17,820
See I was right. She's sorry sound like I'm cutting you off. I think my I'm sorry. Yeah, I know the connections bad

1189
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,900
I know there's lag. I know it's not your fault, but I'm like, yeah

1190
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:26,100
I I'm sorry. I flew off the handle a little there. I got a little frustrated feeling like I was being talked over

1191
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,780
I know it's not because I'm sorry. I apologize

1192
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,780
I brought the whole vibe down my little pony. Oh, please forgive me

1193
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:40,060
Anyway, no, Applejack is the responsible one. She's she's yeah

1194
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,900
She's the hard-working

1195
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,220
doesn't react like down to earth cuz she's an earth pony

1196
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,740
Twilight is like a a like a nerd that gets extremely stressed out about scheduling

1197
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,520
Pinkie pie is jumping off the wall all the time Rainbow Dash is like

1198
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240

See, I don't know anything about my little pony. No Apple. No Applejack. Well, you better know

1202
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,200
You should you should get into my little pony so that you can humanized versions of Fluttershy with

1203
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,720
Humanized Applejack in in the boots Applejack is hard-working and honest and

1204
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,680
runs a business and

1205
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,800
loves her family and

1206
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
Responsible and boring

1207
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Love's traditional equestrian values

1208
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:44,680
Equester equestrian values from an outsider's perspective. She's definitely the coolest one. She has her

Yeah, she's the cool one cuz she has a hat. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. She's like

1218
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,620
Twilight Sparkle has a fucking crown

1219
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,860
So she does

1220
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:38,440
That's a lie. I've never seen that. You're lying. You're a liar. Well, she's got a tiara

1221
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:46,520
She doesn't she doesn't wear it all the time. Just sometimes lame on special special occasions lame. She's not cowboy. I'm googling

1222
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,040
Oh, yeah, that's yeah Applejack's hat is identified as the one that bright Mac gave her

1223
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,160
bright Mac being her dad

1224
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,520
Just just chicken eggs. I thought that's a red. Where's the hat come from?

1225
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,760
Luffy it's it's this emotional value the best character boy for turn up then

1226
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,960
She's basically

1227
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,960
Except she's nothing like him

1228
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,080
Okay, but I'm sure there is a haberda. I'm sure someone in Ponyville runs a haberdashery

1229
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,860
Somebody's got to know we can't all get our hats from our dead dads

1230
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:28,100
Okay, no, that's where they spawn they if you have a if you are born with a hat on your head

1231
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,220
When you come out of the room that means you're gonna be a dad of Applejack. That's what that means

1232
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:36,300
I I think it's more like, you know, when we die

1233
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:44,660
You know, we all drop loot, but your loot depends on your loot table and and dad's dads are on their own loot table

1234
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,300
And dad's just have a very high chance to drop hats

1235
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Sentimental hats

1236
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:58,940
Sentimental hats and AXP so you have the experience of your father dying and you level up

1237
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,900
And you go yes, and you go all my strength rows

1238
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Thanks dad

1239
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
Ah

1240
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,340
The

1241
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,060
It could be a funny like thing. Yeah, Kusa mega. Oh

1242
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,220
Yeah, what Kusa mega?

1243
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,820
What how's about Kusa mega? Well, basically

1244
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,460
Well at first I was in the wrong

1245
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:33,820
Because I was about a week late in sending like all the designs and stuff like it took me ages to get them done because I was balancing

1246
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,060
Work

1247
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,980
Tricks he didn't seem to mind too much. It was just like hey

1248
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:42,460
We got to get this thought we've got to get this project done so we can start the Kickstarter is what she kept saying to me

1249
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,300
I was like, okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do that and I gave it to her

1250
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:53,780
And if a few weeks later and we had heard nothing about the Kickstarter and we we never have again

1251
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,780
Who's you you and the other you and the other artists you mean? Yeah, exactly

1252
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:03,460
So the the idea was it was stupid deal. I shouldn't have taken it

1253
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,940
It was like well below my commission rate for five drawings

1254
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:14,860
And it was like payment only on successful funding of the Kickstarter, which is just the stupid really yeah, exactly

1255
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,860
If you if you ever do

1256
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,620
Something like this like like like you knock it for someone

1257
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,340
Yeah, I didn't sign on for immediate pay. No, there was no guarantee that I would get paid

1258
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,740
Did you did you not get paid at all?

1259
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:33,260
No, I did get paid in the end like what what actually happened was the Kickstarter was basically canceled and then she just paid

1260
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,780
All the artists out of pocket, but um, yeah

1261
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:41,660
It it took a while and apparently I was the last artist to get paid and um, yeah

1262
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,780
So yeah, just like forgot apparently and I'm pretty I'm pretty sure everyone else got paid

1263
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,020
It took me making like a

1264
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:58,040
Post on Twitter saying like any other artist for the kusa mega project. Please contact me like that like vague and mysterious

1265
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,340
Yeah, I saw yeah, I saw that I saw that and I saw I remember you replied to it and saying what happened

1266
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,620
I was curious like I was mad

1267
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:14,780
I was mad because I I saw that and I inferred I just inferred like why would somebody make this tweet?

1268
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:20,700
Somebody didn't get paid for their work and it makes me mad and when it's when it's someone I know I'm like

1269
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,820
Don't do that. I mean it was stupid

1270
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:30,020
I was like I was a big fan of Trek see at the time and I was like watching all their videos

1271
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,900
And then it was like I'm making a light level and artists can sign up and I was like hey

1272
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:40,620
I do that, but it wasn't even that because I had done the first like light novel chapters that she released on YouTube

1273
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,420
It's like an audiobook

1274
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,340
I drew like a piece fan out for it and send it and she retweeted it

1275
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,140
I was like that's cool, and then like immediately like that like as soon as I was like messaging her

1276
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,380
I was like hey, I want to work on the actual physical release project

1277
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:56,700
She was like I was like can I do this page because it was like a big list of all the different parts of the book that you

1278
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,580
Could work on like a drawing a specific scene or something like that

1279
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:03,140
And I was I was like hey can I do this one and she was like actually

1280
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,660
I want you to do all of the character designs at the beginning of the book and I was like oh Jesus

1281
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:14,940
But yeah, I did them slightly weak slightly lake like a week or two weeks late late. Sorry, and um

1282
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:23,380
That's bad. Don't be late people, but um and then nothing three months, and then project was canned and like

1283
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,140
So the reason why I signed on for basically no guarantee of pay was because I was such a big fan of

1284
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,700
Trixie at the time, so I was literally doing the

1285
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,500
The parasocial fucking. Oh, I like this person. I trust them

1286
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,660
So parasocial of you

1287
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:45,180
Cream you got dr. Wolf. Yeah, it's that yeah, you got that

1288
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,260
You get you get dr. Wolf. It's so it's he's still

1289
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,820
He's I got the money in the end is fine

1290
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:57,500
Yeah, true. Yeah. Um doctor. Dr. Wolf is still at it

1291
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,380
I saw a reddit post that someone made being like guys

1292
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:07,220
I think dr. Wolf is stealing our theories for his videos and this is like a recent post like like two weeks ago

1293
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,180
People are still like

1294
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,860
Upset although, you know, I feel like that's just

1295
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:18,100
That's common practice, right for youtubers to churn out content

1296
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:23,680
They just go to a subreddit and just like regurgitate some shit. They read on a subreddit. Oh, yeah, and make a list of it

1297
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,500
Yeah, yeah, so I don't know that's common practice

1298
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:33,140
So I think that guy might be disappointed the the one piece the one piece community on YouTube is a nightmare of just

1299
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:36,060
Regurgitating nonsense in evil bio

1300
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,580
It's not good. I'm sure evil bio. I don't watch any of the no

1301
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:48,460
YouTube one piece. Yeah, you're better off. I've watched like a few bits and pieces like and just been told a lot about it

1302
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,580
By the other members of the party discord and it's like, yeah

1303
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:58,620
These people just stupid and they just lie and they just make up things and pretend that it's real. I

1304
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,540
I

1305
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:06,660
Haven't really watched much one piece content. I don't really get the sense that there is a lot of like

1306
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:11,420
In-depth one piece content going on. It's a lot of like a

1307
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:17,340
lot of very like surface level like just like chapter recaps and like

1308
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:23,620
Just kind of like theory crafting but in like the basically just the sense that you're just like reading shit off the wiki

1309
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:30,780
People who make nonsense bullshit theories and then like other people pick up those theories and take them as facts and then

1310
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:37,700
Regurgitate and make their own theories based on those theories and it's like almost like a big chaotic mess of just misinformation and lies

1311
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:44,260
Yeah, I think I'd watched a bit of some of that theory stuff

1312
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,420
And I was only interested because a lot of one piece

1313
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,700
It's so big there's so much of it, and I forget a lot of things

1314
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:58,260
So it's so much of it an order like doesn't clarify like things things that brought together

1315
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,380
It's like oh, I do remember that happening

1316
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:07,500
And I guess if you stretch it you can make it part of this theory like I never really took the theory too seriously

1317
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,900
But I was I don't know. It's just sort of like. Oh, yeah

1318
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:17,540
I guess it's like harm us, but it's embarrassing and like it's enough, but yeah some

1319
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,940
people people I

1320
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,060
Don't know theories crafting is it's fun. I've defended it before

1321
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,820
Yeah

1322
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:33,100
When it when it gets to the point where somebody theory crafts a theory that doesn't end up being true, and then they I

1323
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,460
Don't know lash out to the creator

1324
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,380
Now it's not always

1325
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:44,700
One piece you just be anything then that's stupid and dangerous and vile like the thing that I think about

1326
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,340
With like reddit theory crafting is um

1327
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:53,260
Blade kind eyewear was that poster on the Homestuck subreddit. Oh?

1328
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:01,060
Who had that whole that whole theory about them aspect inversion that like a pretty sizable?

1329
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,740
like

1330
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:08,700
Chunk of the of the Homestuck subreddit community like believed in and thought was sort of like a secret

1331
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,260
spur of mechanic that

1332
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,820
like

1333
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,860
At the time kind of sounded

1334
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:23,100
The gist of it was basically that like there is a thing that can happen in spur where you can like if you basically

1335
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:30,300
Like go evil you become like the opposite of your aspect and the basically the only real evidence was this was that Rose

1336
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:34,740
LaLonde was the seer of light, but then when she turned evil for a second

1337
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:40,820
She went dark, so it was like oh did she did she embody her opposite aspect the aspect of void?

1338
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,740
Like how what does this mean of a seer the blind?

1339
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,980
Can can can the you know can other aspects do this?

1340
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:54,260
Is this like a universal thing and like other quote-unquote evidence was brought forward?

1341
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:59,540
But that was like the only one and like it like really quickly like as the story went on

1342
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:05,180
It was like it never really happened like that again, and it was clear like no. It's just kind of a

1343
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,060
Maybe sort of a thematic

1344
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,660
Coincidence that like she is the character of light and then she was taken over by this dark thing. I mean it's not like

1345
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,100
Yeah

1346
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,860
basically, yeah

1347
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,420
so

1348
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:26,140
Yeah, but the the the the aspect inversion theory generalizes to like ah, yes, so like under these circumstances

1349
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:35,020
John if he were to undergo such a process he being the air of breath would you know become he would become the

1350
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:42,580
I don't know the the whatever of blood because blood is the aspect of bonds and oaths and and

1351
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,340
relations and

1352
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,060
Breath is the one of freedom and and non-commitment or whatever

1353
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,060
movement

1354
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,060
And it was like no

1355
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,860
But like so many words so much fucking digital ink spilled

1356
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:03,300
Over this like yeah baseless fucking thing based on like one. It's piece of evidence

1357
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:09,780
It's harmless and then defended until it makes fans like rabidly attack each other over their

1358
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:16,420
Disagreements about whether or not this fan theory is like more accurate or bad or stupid or not I

1359
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,580
Like communities are terrible

1360
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:27,340
That theory appealed to me because I'm like I like to imagine because I was really into the the spurb aspect of it

1361
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:31,660
I liked the gamey parts of it and the parts of the homestead that explored spurb the game

1362
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:38,500
So the idea that there was like all these hidden mechanics of the game going on that like we're influencing the plot

1363
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
I found that really interesting

1364
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,860
But the evidence just wasn't there for it

1365
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:50,180
But a lot of people were really committed on an emotional level to defending it as a thesis

1366
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,500
Blade kind eyewear would fucking post these like

1367
01:10:54,100 --> 01:11:00,500
Pages and pages long posts like every time there was a new update being like here's my new analysis of what's going on in

1368
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:05,340
In in the you know seen through a lens of understanding that includes

1369
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:09,140
Aspect inversion as a game mechanic LeMau

1370
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,420
Pretty funny pretty good

1371
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,300
pretty based

1372
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,020
Homestuck

1373
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:24,780
Homestuck um, I want to complain read homestuck so that you can draw a brisco with big boobies

1374
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,820
One of these days one of you should you could just do that anyway

1375
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,220
You could just do that anyway. I could just do that anyway

1376
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:43,180
I tried homestuck years ago because I had a crush on a girl and she was like you should check out this comic called homestuck

1377
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,940
She was right. It's like

1378
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:53,140
This is stupid. Oh you fucking asshole. You fucking asshole. I was 12 when I was dumb

1379
01:11:54,100 --> 01:12:00,820
I've never tried again. Yeah, I was like 12 or something. Why how old are you now? I'm 22

1380
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,100
Maybe I wasn't 12. How old was I those that would have been

1381
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:12,220
No, I guess homestuck was around 10 years ago, but that was like I would have been like early homestuck, right?

1382
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,540
Maybe I don't know

1383
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,660
2013 I

1384
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:22,220
Think oh, whatever cuz attack on time was out. I know that she was obsessed with that

1385
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,060
That would have been

1386
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,260
2010 then

1387
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:33,640
No, I think I'm talking was like 2013 2014. I think Jesus, okay

1388
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,060
Jesus Christ. Yeah

1389
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:43,360
In 2014 wait, no, I don't know how it no in 2014 I would have been 15

1390
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,700
Okay

1391
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,840
Fucking remember when I tried to read out

1392
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,220
I was like one I

1393
01:12:54,260 --> 01:13:00,460
In my sleep because it's like Mozart you put you put your baby into the Mozart aka homestuck

1394
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,660
Discography and then watch them grow

1395
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,900
If you ask me to list homestuck characters

1396
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:11,300
I'd be like John Egbert and I know him because he's the main one and then Drisker and I know him because of you

1397
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,900
I know her because of you

1398
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:19,420
That's my greatest contribution to the world is to tell people about risker

1399
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,940
Before we move on before we move on from kusa mega, I want to complain

1400
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,140
I want to complain about Trixie just for a minute just for a moment

1401
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:32,500
Just for a moment. I want to point out something that has been bothering me and it'd be done

1402
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,340
I it can be done. I can I can do it

1403
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:42,420
I haven't mentioned this but it I feel like I want people to know about it because it's really irritating and that is that there was

1404
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,300
I've made up tweet a tweet about this yesterday

1405
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:51,140
Um, there was rad content that Trixie had that nobody else had

1406
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:57,660
That she said she was going to give us and she hasn't done it and she has fucking

1407
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,900
Obscunded and become a vagrant

1408
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:06,500
And I just I just I feel like it's safe to assume now that she's never going to do it and probably doesn't even have it anymore

1409
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,300
And that just makes me really mad that makes me real fucking angry

1410
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:20,220
And I just want to fucking say it confirmation. I tried to this was a footage was like stuff

1411
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,900
we had recorded on phones and

1412
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:30,540
Cameras that was supposed to be behind the scenes and also the the footage recorded at the meet-up

1413
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,300
I think this is all of the stuff that she was that what it was

1414
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:40,820
Okay, I wasn't even sure like what it was that she had just that she had some rad con stuff and she said

1415
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,820
She would give it to us. Yeah

1416
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:46,500
Yeah, okay behind the scenes and meet-up stuff. Okay, cool

1417
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:52,380
I was a in the in the fucking garbage in the fucking garbage because she doesn't give a fuck. Okay. Go on

1418
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,980
I yeah, I haven't gotten any confirmation that she's like

1419
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,820
Gotten rid of it or she can't give it. I did contact her

1420
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,780
Not too long ago before she was she went on that road trip

1421
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,640
And she said yeah, she's on it. She's on a permanent road trip now

1422
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:13,460
Yeah, I mean, I don't know there was like before she went on the road trip. She was like packing stuff up

1423
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:16,700
And she's like, oh, yeah, I'm a little busy right now, but I'll get it to you

1424
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,940
I was like, okay, please could you because it might be difficult to do it from the road

1425
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,940
That was the last I heard and I guess I could ask her again

1426
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:28,500
Like I don't know. I feel like this is just gonna be a continual like yeah, I'll do it for like months years

1427
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:33,700
That's all she ever does you ask all anything you just ask her and she's always says yeah, I'll do it

1428
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,980
Yeah, she'll promise anything. She doesn't give a fuck. So like a Kickstarter. She's a big fucking liar

1429
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,500
and

1430
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,400
I'll tell you what I did when she when she was doing the

1431
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,220
The the not the yard sale. Yeah, the yard sale

1432
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:54,940
Someone bought her hard drives and I and I DM'd the person who bought her hard drives to ask them

1433
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:58,580
Hey, if you get those hard drives and they have data on them

1434
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:06,060
Let me know because I feel like I absolutely believe that she would just sell the hard drives that have our fucking rad content on them

1435
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,540
I totally think that's something she would do. So I don't know. It's possible

1436
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,940
It's possible

1437
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,780
That may it would be so it would be hilarious if that were the way that we could recover

1438
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:23,340
That stuff. I'm not holding my breath. I feel like it's an outside shot, but just in case

1439
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,340
It would be very funny

1440
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,500
It would be such a normal thing to do if you're selling a hard drive to wipe it first

1441
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:39,940
But then again, what does she know about technology? Maybe she just didn't think to do that. Yeah, it could happen

1442
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:45,060
She computers she uses a computer. She might have thought of it. Let's hope she didn't

1443
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:49,900
That's her. I mean, yeah, my I feel like she probably would have my eye

1444
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,140
I mean, we can dream we can just say I'm just saying there's a chance

1445
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:02,020
It was whatever whatever. I'm fucking pissed off about it

1446
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,540
I'm fucking pissed off and

1447
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,300
Disrespected and disgusted and I don't know

1448
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:13,980
Yeah, that sucks. That's another reason to be annoyed. I guess

1449
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:23,300
Okay, well, I guess I guess I guess I could I could go on I could go on but I guess let's continue

1450
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,340
You said you were done bad. You said I was done with tricks. Hey, I know

1451
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,780
I know

1452
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:40,000
Oh, but yeah, but then they did that interview they did that interview with Oki Oki's weird stories who I'm a fan of and who

1453
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:43,740
For some reason, I don't know what compelled him to do this

1454
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:51,540
But he de-embed me he followed me and he de-embed me to let me know that he had just done that interview with them

1455
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:56,300
And I was like, oh wow cool. Okay looking forward to it. I

1456
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,900
Did too it was it was entirely about Trixie's content, which is like

1457
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,060
Yeah

1458
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,860
If you're a fan of her and you're you know, he's like the the conversation

1459
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:16,980
Boiled down to Trixie your content's different and it's bad and we don't like it and Trixie's like that's okay

1460
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,660
I want a new audience and that's the entire video

1461
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,180
Um

1462
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:28,300
Well, I don't care about her like career goals. It's like whatever. I just want the rad con stuff

1463
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,300
I want the stuff that is

1464
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,660
Tight up in and back the stuff. That's the stuff. That's the stuff. That's ours and not hers. Yeah, I would like that too

1465
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:39,500
um, I mean in about that I

1466
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,900
Get I

1467
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:48,140
What stood out to me about that interview was how she keeps like pivoting and playing like this weird rhetorical

1468
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:49,980
game

1469
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,180
Where she will in the same breath claim to

1470
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,100
Not care about money not care about losing the audience

1471
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:02,780
But then at the same time insist like well, I had to post all my music stuff on my main channel because it's the only way

1472
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,340
It'll get views. That's the only way I can make money off it. That's the only way I can build an audience for it

1473
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:14,860
It uh, it was a very interesting video because uh, lots of the points that oki brought up were like proofed by her actions during the interview

1474
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,340
Like it like it it's almost like

1475
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:21,900
He's calling her out for this stuff and then the video itself is just like a complete

1476
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,580
Microcosm of all of those things like giving example

1477
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:30,300
um, he he he briefly brought up her inconsistency on like, um

1478
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:37,660
Like a content and like like void gazes is meant to be like a cooling show like with fans, isn't it?

1479
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,460
I don't know sometimes. I don't know

1480
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,540
We like

1481
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:48,940
A big point of the the interview was uh him saying we don't know what your new content is even supposed to we don't know

1482
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,060
What this channel's for like it's too broad and like

1483
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,380
That interview was emblematic of it because it was fitted into the void gazer format

1484
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,020
Which is like not that

1485
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:06,620
It should have been its own separate thing. It's even more confusing. You know, you're right. Yeah, I I guess I guess that's true

1486
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:09,820
Uh

1487
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:17,180
I don't know. It's probably most not the most solid criticism, but yeah, why yeah, why I feel like why why is this a void gazer?

1488
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,460
I guess I guess I agree with that. It's odd

1489
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:24,380
I don't know. I feel like her answers were were

1490
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,740
Like they maybe were confusing but her

1491
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,100
Like goal seemed pretty clear

1492
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,020
I don't care about appeasing my older audience

1493
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,260
I believe somehow

1494
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:45,500
For some reason the what I am doing now will create a bigger and newer audience that will make me money

1495
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:52,300
And I just need to get enough people who just like whatever it is. I do exactly. Yeah, I'm like, yeah, that's okay

1496
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:56,060
That seems pretty clear if you if you believe that

1497
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:01,100
I guess I I see her perspective, but she's wrong. So she is wrong

1498
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,340
You can all agree on that

1499
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:09,980
Uh, oh, I hate her. I I fucking hate her. God damn it

1500
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:16,620
Uh, uh, I don't know. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad guys

1501
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:20,060
I'm I'm I'm sitting here release the red hands

1502
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:23,660
Hands the red hands on the table hands to God

1503
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:29,580
Heart heart on my sleeve. I just fucking hate her and she's a bad person and she's done wrong

1504
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:33,980
And she's done wrong by me in particular and all of us collectively

1505
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:39,340
And fuck her forever. It makes me feel bad because I keep checking the fucking Kiwi farms

1506
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:44,860
And it makes me feel sick of the ship. Some of the shit people have read writing on there is disgusting and like nasty

1507
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:49,100
I I saw I saw some real racist shit in there

1508
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,980
Like pretty recently and I was like, oh

1509
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,780
Yeah, that's just that's what these people are. It's like

1510
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,540
Yeah, I go I go there to laugh at tricksy making stupid business decisions

1511
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,380
All it is is fucking transphobic and racist comments and I don't care about that

1512
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:09,740
They just they just can't help themselves. They can't fucking think they can't fucking see beyond that

1513
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,460
Like that's such a fucking blinder to them. They're like, ah

1514
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,420
That's it. That's where that's where the buck stops. Oh god. Ah

1515
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,860
I like laughing at people but not in that way

1516
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,940
No

1517
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,620
Jesus

1518
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:29,340
Make make a joke about something funny. Why don't you? Yeah, like how they're literally hobos

1519

1534
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:46,780
I absolutely am and I have been for a while and it's it's peaking. It's peaking and it's not going away

1535
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,700
Uh

1536
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,940
And maybe I should talk to a doctor or something

1537
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:59,820
Uh, yeah, maybe you should touch some grass. Maybe you should touch touch some weed. Maybe I should touch some

1538
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,700
No

1539
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,300
No, no, no

1540
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,660
if I

1541
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:08,380
I feel like if I smoked weed while I was angry

1542
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,100
I would like

1543
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:17,180
Cry I would like like the weed would like affect my judgment and it would like it heighten the emotion

1544
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:22,300
To the point that I would like break down and cry about it because I would like feel it even more strongly

1545
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,660
Uh, so no, I don't want to do that

1546
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,900
I don't I don't

1547
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:32,300
You know what they say like you got to be in like a good emotional place before you get higher else it like

1548
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,540
You can like, you know, that emotion can like spiral out of control or whatever or like it heightens it thumbnail

1549
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,780
A thumbnail and title for this video Ben literally cries about Trixie

1550
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:51,580
It's too much coping and seething coping and seething which I am admittedly I am both doing both of those

1551
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,700
Well, but no more

1552
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,780
That's that's as much as I'll admit to

1553
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,100
um

1554
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,300
Oh

1555
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,820
This is unrelated

1556
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:07,340
But it's sort of related to you being late with the kuso mega drawings. I was also late

1557
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,980
Uh with the cover

1558
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:15,020
Which I just finished drawing this morning for the kato and anthology

1559
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:21,340
Which uh, I don't think I don't think it's my fault that the uh kickstarter

1560
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,860
Launch was delayed. I hope it wasn't well now

1561
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,220
Uh, but anyway, it was it was gonna launch last

1562
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,580
Friday

1563
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:34,300
But I think it might be launching this friday or it's launching sometime this week the kickstarter

1564
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,940
for that, um

1565
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:41,260
And uh, I don't know link link down in the description

1566
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,420
So by the time the episode's out, it's either already started or starting today

1567
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,460
They they told I I gave them the cover

1568
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:54,300
I gave them the cover and they told me that by the time this episode is out the kickstarter for that will be launched

1569
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,540
Uh, which would be pretty cool

1570
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:01,660
Be pretty cool. If that fucking they've had the fucking sell a bunch of copies

1571
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:05,740
Uh, uh white white lion, uh, uh hd remaster

1572
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:12,300
Actually, I have to I have to go and get that re-scanned. I have to go and get like a better scanner

1573
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:16,780
I should try and make a comic at some point. I mean have you never have you never

1574
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:21,020
No, I've never made anything more than like a page and it was like born

1575
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,060
It's nothing all you you

1576
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:29,100
It's funny to me that's like

1577
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,220
If i'm gonna draw something

1578
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,380
It better be a comic. Yeah

1579
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,220
Yeah

1580
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:41,180
I don't know like when you first mentioned the kato thing to show going from point a to point b

1581
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,300
Otherwise

1582
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,780
That's right. That's right

1583
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:50,380
Like when you first mentioned the kato thing I was like, man, I'd love to do that

1584
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,580
But I got commissions and uni work and stuff to do

1585
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:59,180
And I want to sit around and play red dead and waste time. I don't know

1586
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,380
Yeah

1587
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:08,060
Yeah, I mean a video video games are a poison on my life and I need to just uninstall steam

1588
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,300
I'm me me too. I uh

1589
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:17,420
I I I spent a day I spent like a day and a half drawing the the cover for the anthology

1590
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,780
And uh, it was it was tough because there was a lot of detail I had to get in there took me a long time

1591
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,260
It was pretty it was it was a it was a

1592
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:31,660
Trying experience it was a lot of work and then I had to decompress with an entire day of noida

1593
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:36,700
And it was terrible. It's like time to get back to work on my game. Oh or

1594
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:39,740
Or I could just play noida for

1595
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,340
Like 20 straight hours and that's what I did that

1596
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:50,540
If you do a work thing and then you follow it with another work thing, you're obviously not going to want to do the second one

1597
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:56,700
Yeah, that's what I think that's what I tell myself. That's what I tell myself. I earned this I earned this

1598
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:01,180
I did like three commissions in one day. I don't know about 20 hours straight, but

1599
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,060
I did three commissions in one day and then I like turned it off and I was like, okay

1600
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,980
And I just sat and played through all of resident evil village in like one sitting and I was like cool

1601
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,620
good game

1602
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:18,380
Everyone's everyone's fucking abuzz about resident evil village. It's a very good. It's a good game

1603
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:23,020
It's a triple a game that came out and it's finished and it's good and it it's makes me happy that that's happened

1604
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,260
What is on press? What is good?

1605
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:30,140
Never have I heard such a thing. What what's good about it? Um

1606
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:35,340
It's it's got it's it's very broad in terms of its focus like the action is good

1607
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:40,460
It's it's um, it does a good job of making things. Is it an action title? Do you do you shoot?

1608
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,540
Do you shoot the big booby lady?

1609
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,620
Yeah, you shoot the big booby lady. I don't I don't know about spoilers

1610
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,860
I don't know about spoilers because the game is

1611
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:54,060
We don't have to get in the spoiler. You do shoot. They make you shoot the big booby lady

1612
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,700
Oh, she's barely in it

1613
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:01,180
Really how many yeah, she's there's five like main bosses and she's one of them

1614
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,300
So she's like she's one of the longest sections of the game

1615
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:09,660
I mean, she's only she's only about an hour and a half of content from seeing it on social media

1616
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:17,820
I assume the entire game is about escaping from her fucking crazy haunted house. No, no, that's just the that's the first bit

1617
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,980
That's like I see the first section

1618
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,300
It's good. Just be horny though

1619
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,620
Yeah, they Capcom Capcom were very crafty with the marketing and they were like, hmm

1620
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,100
Let's release this trailer with like all these vague images on it

1621
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:34,540
She was in that first trailer and then they just focused entirely on her because they knew that people were obsessed with her

1622
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,180
Yeah, I mean

1623
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:42,860
Makes makes sense. I guess I would say I would say most of the best stuff in the game is completely unrelated to her

1624
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,620
Which is surprising

1625
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,620
considering how focused they were on it

1626
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:51,420
What it's spoiler me. What is the lore for her being so big?

1627
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,020
She is uh, basically

1628
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,820
Uh, do you have a play resin evil seven?

1629
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,100
No, I've never played a video game

1630
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:06,700
Okay, there's evil mold parasites, uh, that like just like a natural thing that makes people weird

1631
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,860
um

1632
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:15,180
Okay, there's this other lady who's trying to bring back a daughter who died with by using the mold parasite in some weird way

1633
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:19,900
And she experimented on a bunch of people and she gave it to the big lady and it meant that she just kept growing

1634
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,060
And it's now immortal land of empire

1635
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
It's like a bio fungus thingy nice

1636
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:30,780
present evils nice, so she's it's uh, she's a clicker. She's a

1637
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:34,940
Mushroom she's towed at from yeah, super mario

1638
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:39,500
She's more like uh lichen like a moldy guy

1639
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,940
Uh

1640
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,940
I see like uh spoilers

1641
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:49,100
She turned like when you fight her she turns into a big dragon monster and she's like sticking out the top of it

1642
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,180
and what?

1643
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:56,620
What you mean like um, you mean like uh that fucking demon spider lady from dark souls

1644
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:02,540
Yeah, a little bit like that except she her body's like fucked up as well. But like there's like a giant dragon monster

1645
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:07,500
It's a reasonable game. It's what surprised the villains turned into big monsters at the end. Wow

1646
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:13,100
I've also never played a resident evil. So it happens in every in every single game

1647
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,780
Like past the first one the villains turned into a big monster at the end. So

1648
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,140
Well now

1649
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:24,540
All right, you thought you could now I know but in fact I am a giant scorpion exactly like it

1650
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:29,980
They were like, oh, it's sexy. Let's turn into a monster and ruin it and make it sad. Well

1651
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,940
Yeah

1652
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:35,580
You gotta you gotta you gotta get rid of her somehow

1653
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:40,860
You gotta you gotta have some kind of conclusion to to her arc of having big tits in a big

1654
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:43,980
Why can't the conclusion be why can't the conclusion be

1655
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:48,220
That you save her and then she fucks you and you have

1656
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:57,580
Because easins winters is a good man. He's too busy trying to save his daughter. That's not family friendly. That's evil

1657
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:00,540
What you just described is fucking evil and it's against god's law

1658
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,900
You have to fucking turn her into a dragon and blow her fucking face off

1659
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:09,180
Also, also in the beginning of the game you can't solve all your problems by turning them into dragons and blowing them up

1660
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:13,820
It's never failed. It hasn't failed me yet at the very beginning of the game

1661
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:19,580
The main character's wife is like killed in front of him. So it's like, I don't think he'd be up for some sex right now

1662
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,660
He's trying to save his daughter

1663
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:25,260
That's it's a it's gonna be the rebound. He's on the rebound

1664
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:31,580
There's now the time within hours. Oh, so he gets his fingers bitten off and she cuts his arm at one point

1665
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:38,140
It's not nice. Never been a better time for a big booby lady to fucking come into your into your life

1666
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,140
Yeah, the blessing

1667
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:46,860
I don't I don't actually think she's sexy. I hate her face. Her face. I hate her scary face

1668
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:52,220
She does have like a weird old lady face if you look closer at she's got like crusty dusty skin and looks weird

1669
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,540
yeah, yeah, yeah crusty dusty skin

1670
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:56,540
and uh,

1671
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,380
Heard big teeth

1672
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,020
And I'm like, I don't want that looking at me

1673
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,700
And I and I and I get that the appeal

1674
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:10,060
I get that the appeal is like a juxtaposition of like her slightly horrifying

1675
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:14,540
Face and skin unlike her fucking sexy ass milf body

1676
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:19,900
Yeah, but I'd rather just have a sexy ass milf body without a horrifying face

1677
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:26,860
If I'm being honest, you can't put that in resident evil. That doesn't have a place in there. It's gotta be spooky

1678
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,260
I guess

1679
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:32,620
I think when I play as like a normal human with big tits

1680
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:37,100
I think the lady who makes the puppets in the game is sexy or anyway, that's a hot take

1681
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,980
You don't even get to fucking see her. You see like a painting of her

1682
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,980
She's like

1683
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,460
I don't even know what they know. Yeah

1684
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,100
He's uh, she's just like a pretty girl

1685
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:53,580
Nice. Yeah red. She's pretty girl and like a gothic black dress. She met henson

1686
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,260
Yeah

1687
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:00,860
She makes muppets she makes evil muppets not muppets puppets

1688
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:02,860
Oh

1689
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,860
Darn

1690
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:06,860
Resident evil with muppets in it

1691
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:08,860
She's the uh, she's the jumping around

1692
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:13,340
She's the cause of the the most horrifying segment I've ever played in a video game

1693
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:20,140
Which is what like her section is and uh, it made me feel the most the most horrifying segment of any video game

1694
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,220
Really any video game I've played

1695
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:27,180
Okay, and I've played a fair few horror games and uh that one shattered me up the most

1696
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,020
Huh

1697
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,940
I I'm just gonna say I don't uh, I don't want to think about babies ever again

1698
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:35,820
Oh gross. Yeah

1699
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,980
It's not pleasant

1700
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,020
hideous

1701
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,020
Sounds like a fucking nightmare

1702
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:48,060
The second half is like a nightmare, but I kind of love it because it turns into resident evil nonsense

1703
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:54,220
Where you shoot things nightmare in like a in in what kind of a way because nightmares seem like in like in like uh

1704
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:59,180
Oh, this this is not totally consistent with anything that's come before in the new continuity

1705
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,580
It's just wacky zany. Yeah

1706
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:06,060
You there's a there's a boss boss battle where you ride a mech and shoot a giant monster

1707
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,820
Um

1708
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,900
Okay, you you play as chris redfield running through a village killing like hundreds of werewolves

1709
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:14,460
Which like took you like three minutes to kill at the beginning of the game

1710
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:19,580
You just kill them with like one shot of a gun and shoot like giant laser beams at a big mold pile and stuff

1711
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,060
It's crazy

1712
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:26,940
But I didn't see any of this in the trailer. No, they didn't put any in the trailer

1713
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,460
This is all this is all wanton spoilers. Everybody stopped listening. Um

1714
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:37,020
But uh, yeah, and there's like a twist at the end. It's a cool game. I liked it a lot. It made me happy

1715
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:42,460
Ah, yes, I guess if you like video games, I guess if you're into that shit

1716
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,820
I know you two don't like care about like triple a games at all. Do you?

1717
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,340
No, um, I really don't know not usually

1718
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:56,860
Like I usually get into a game like a hundred years after it was relevant. Yeah, I'm like, wow. Have you ever heard of

1719
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
Super Mario 64 guys

1720
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:07,580
It's a jump so gross. I have a compulsive issue where backwards long jump up the infinite staircase. It is cool. That is cool

1721
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,020
Like I've been playing death stranding

1722
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:16,460
And it's death death stranding look baby in it. I know I know that game's not that new anymore

1723
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:20,700
But to me I I consider it a new game because it's gonna come out like two years ago

1724
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:24,380
Yeah, that game looks kind of cool from what it is interesting

1725
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:30,220
The whole look honestly just just the yeah like the the fact that you got to like fucking navigate

1726
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:35,420
Like the terrain and you got a stack shit on your back and you got to deal with like

1727
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,580
A very intricate like carrying capacities

1728
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:43,980
Navigation puzzles just seems neat. It's like it's just like a cool thing to base a game around

1729
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:48,540
It feels like an indie game that was just like remade by a triple-a studio or something

1730
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:50,860
It feels like somebody had this idea

1731
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:58,460
And uh, and it's weird and it's it's got all the stupid kajima shit that's clearly shoved in to be like ha ha wacky kajima

1732
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:04,380
But that's not what's cool about it. It's just satisfying. It's like satisfying busy work. It's one of those games

1733
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,940
What what did I watch uh?

1734
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:10,380
It was either joseph anderson or noa called welger vey

1735
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:17,100
I think no noa definitely did do a video on death stranding. I don't know. I don't know if just I've I've definitely seen uh noas

1736
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:23,020
Uh, if joseph anderson did one. I probably watched it as well, but I don't remember matthew matosis did as well

1737
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,420
Oh

1738
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:27,020
He was a lot more sure

1739
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:32,780
Yeah, I'm sure I've seen both of those then. Yeah, and uh, super bunny hop. Yeah

1740
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:38,140
Everyone everyone had a thing about everyone's talked about death stranding barry kramer talked about it

1741
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:45,500
And he had baseless criticisms that uh, who cares about that guy? Yeah, I wouldn't have seen that why that's funny

1742
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:52,780
It's a bad video. I guess he made that kingdom hearts video. Yeah, that also like wasn't that good, but no

1743
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:57,660
But everyone watched it because it was extremely topical at the time

1744
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:03,100
He did like a 20 minute video about skyward sword where the the only point I got from the video

1745
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,740
It's why is this the sky's yellow and that looks stupid

1746
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:10,780
Oh, okay. Jesus. Why are the clouds yellow? It's extremely. It's it's

1747
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:13,100
Barry's

1748
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:17,900
Analysis videos there. They have good points in them, but yeah, they are bloated

1749
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:23,340
To to such a degree with like goofy speech

1750
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,060
I'm just not into it

1751
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:31,740
Yeah, I I love youtubers that just don't waste your time like people who don't try and do jokes

1752
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:36,860
Like if they can slip in the jaw for people who are just making the video and he has what it needs into it

1753
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,900
Like I mean matthew metosis is my when yeah, yeah, I was gonna say matthew metosis

1754
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:48,380
He's so like deadpan monotone the entire way and then occasionally he slips in like a joke

1755
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:51,180
Yeah, he lets like he leaves a little bit of

1756
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:57,020
Space for you to chuckle to yourself and then he moves on to the next clip. It's great. Yeah

1757
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:00,940
He's not try it like he doesn't shove it in if he has an idea for it

1758
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:04,940
He'll put it in but he doesn't like try to constantly have something funny happening in his videos

1759
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:09,980
Which is a big problem with a lot of review-based content on the internet. I think this is a problem with my content

1760
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:16,780
Like I go back to like work money. I thought I thought you succeeded pretty well

1761
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:19,420
I I would say I would say yes

1762
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,380
That yeah, I was pretty good at being funny

1763
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:28,460
Like I I was annoyed at people like kadikaris who would do the loud talking and never laugh at anything

1764
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:29,740
um

1765
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:30,220
I

1766
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:35,900
But I felt like I was pretty funny, but I felt like some of my videos. I was just doing the loud talking

1767
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:41,740
And some of the earlier ones. I was like, oh god. I don't want to I don't want to go back and listen to this

1768
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:45,020
I want to like scott the was but his videos are

1769
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:50,940
A lot of them are like just loud talking is the joke a little bit and i'm like i'm just not into it

1770
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:53,340
I'm just not you seem like a cool guy

1771
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:57,100
But you're i'm just not into the style of comedy that you're putting on display

1772
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:02,220
There's there's some people who do a good balance like some call me johnny does pretty good videos

1773
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:08,620
I've never heard of them. He's very fairly small. He just does like videos about like resin evens

1774
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,260
He just does a series called johnny versus where he talks about stuff

1775
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:16,300
And he's just like uh, he's just like a friendly fat man who talks about video games and makes like decent jokes

1776
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:22,140
I I remember seeing his avatar and thumbnails and I was like that this motherfucking piece of shit

1777
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,780
I just didn't like his avatar. It's not a step. Yeah

1778
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:31,260
Wait, who at last time the voicemails recommended that I watch someone and I actually did

1779
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,940
Oh my god, it was it was I I know it was um

1780
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:40,780
Oh god, who fucking was it? It was that guy with the purple mask

1781
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:47,260
That guy with the purple mask I actually went and I watched one of his videos and it was like all right

1782
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,500
Markiplier

1783
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:54,780
No, he's like a nobody. He's got like 600 subs markiplier with this new luchadorie

1784
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,260
Cosplay go be amigos

1785
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,860
Viewers go back to last episode listen to whatever it was

1786
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:07,180
Whoever it was that they recommended that I watch a channel of and I watched a video and he's got like

1787
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:09,740
He's like a really loud

1788
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:16,140
He's he's got the same accent as kim justice. It's a very it's not just a british accent. It's a very specific kind of

1789
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:23,260
It's a very specific kind of british accent. Oh, and he like burst into laughter like

1790
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,260
like

1791
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,900
Sometimes like he'll end a sentence and just like start cackling

1792
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,620
um, and uh, it's

1793
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,620
kind of funny, I guess

1794
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:37,100
I can't remember what his fucking name was I subbed in everything because it was like this is all right

1795
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:44,060
Check the recent subscriptions if you can I'm looking I'm looking. I can't I can't find isn't there like a thing on the left side

1796
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:48,380
I'm looking wait. No, I'm logged into the I'm logged into the wrong account

1797
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,300
I'm logged into into uh

1798
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:57,900
I was logged in I was logged in as the pcp. I was I should have been logged in as myself

1799
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:59,900
I never watched uh, Noah

1800
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:04,060
Cold World Javais until like yesterday and I watched like eight of his videos in a row and I was like, oh my god

1801
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:10,700
There's another one. There's another really good video game guy. I love I love Noah. He's great. You should watch all of his stuff

1802
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,940
his fucking

1803
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:20,620
His fucking line reads are so bad. Oh, it's charming though. It's a little charming. I don't even mind it

1804
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,020
I really don't

1805
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,820
It yeah, they're just

1806
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:30,700
It's it's funny because you you you you listen to him and he's like, oh he messed up that line

1807
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:35,660
But you realize that it doesn't matter because it's it's a youtube video and you don't care

1808
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:40,460
You've never cared and the only reason people have good audio is because they think they need it

1809
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:45,420
What is this genre of youtuber called who'd like smart guys who talk about video games and don't waste your time with jokes like

1810
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,540
We need like a name for these people

1811
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
Yeah

1812
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,580
Like

1813
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,220
There's no glamour to it, which is what I really like

1814
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:03,500
There's almost like no persona behind it at all. It's just here's here's lots of points

1815
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:06,140
Well constructed and a good argument

1816
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:10,220
Yeah, true. There's there's no ego to it. There's no, you know

1817
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:15,740
It's good and they've all got really nice voices and ways of delivering their stuff, which is great

1818
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:22,380
Which helps a lot. Have you seen I really like I really like his uh his travel logs

1819
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:25,740
Where he just talks about I haven't seen any of those

1820
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,300
He I think there's there's like

1821
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:32,380
Two or three of them. There's like one where he like visits a bunch of

1822
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,340
Places that are

1823
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:41,180
I found it. Oh, there's one where he visits a bunch of places that are like inspired locations in the fallout games

1824
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:47,340
And then there's like a couple more where he it's literally just like him describing like a road trip that he took

1825
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:50,140
with his wife

1826
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,380
Yeah, they're great. They're like three hours long. They're really relaxing

1827
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:59,660
They're awesome. Um the channel I found it was called ray are reviewing

1828
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:06,060
Ray are reviewing this guy with a purple mask. Oh, he has he has like the loudest

1829
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,260
most british laugh

1830
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:17,180
Uh, what I watched I watched his latest one about the the rise of youtube the rise of youtube video game critics

1831
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,340
where he just talks about like

1832
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,420
the the influence

1833
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,780
of uh, you know dug walker and and no no mostly uh

1834
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:33,100
Not nostalgia critic angry video game nerd and like the the diaspora of that, uh, you know, uh

1835
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:39,420
He's I don't know. He's loud. It's really funny. It's it's really funny when he laughs

1836
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:43,340
I don't know. I just think it's really funny when he's just like yelling something

1837
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,980
And then just starts laughing at whatever he just

1838
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,980
said

1839
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:54,780
Yeah, I watched the the running shine video on yiek y2k earlier today

1840
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:59,180
I I watched I love that video. I watched the to snaker

1841
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:05,820
Uh yick video for like the second or third time again yesterday. That's enough those

1842
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:08,860
What is it? What is it? I just

1843
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:14,540
Those videos are so good. These two videos about yick. I'll have to check that one

1844
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:19,420
Because I I was watching the only plays playthrough. They're playing through at the moment

1845
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:24,620
It's like funny. What did you think of? Um, this the running shine?

1846
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,180
Oh, very good video

1847
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:29,740
Funny. It's such a good video. Uh, well argued

1848
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:33,580
Correct entirely in every aspect

1849
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:39,820
The to to snaker is not he's not as funny as running shine, but he has

1850
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:46,860
To snaker has like a really interesting like thing where he he goes through the whole game and then at the end he has like

1851
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:50,380
Two competing thesis about like what he thinks

1852
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:54,540
The game is intended to mean and they're both like different from each other

1853
01:45:54,540 --> 01:46:00,060
And he and he lays out the case for like each one and why like he's not sure which which he believes

1854
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,700
And uh, it's good. Yeah

1855
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:08,700
To snaker, uh, what to snaker. Yeah, okay. Oh look into that

1856
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:13,260
Um, I was on the train

1857
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,060
Like a week or two ago. It was I think it was like

1858
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:19,820
When I was on the way home from getting my shot or something or

1859
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:22,620
I was on a train. I was on the subway

1860
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:28,700
And I just like looked at my phone and I saw that running shine was streaming

1861
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:32,060
And he that he was streaming with cybershell

1862
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,540
And I was like, oh my god

1863
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:40,140
I gotta get in there. So I just just saw my so just on just on my phone. I jumped into the chat

1864
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,220
Just because I was like

1865
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:43,980
I just want cybershell

1866
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:48,140
To see me and I just I just want to say hi to cybershell and see if he'll say hi back

1867
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:56,860
And I just jumped into the chat and made a some fucking stupid observation about how sonic the hedgehog has gone downhill as a franchise or whatever

1868
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:59,260
some asinine nonsense

1869
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:03,020
And uh cybershell noticed me and he was like, oh hi Ben and I was like, yes

1870
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:08,860
Fuck that means running shine. That means running shine has has now noticed me as well

1871
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:11,980
My influence

1872
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:16,220
The notice spreads like a plague in the stream

1873
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:22,300
Yeah, whenever you like stream like do a heckles for shackles and I'm like in the chat and you go, oh, hey, cybsie. I go. Yes. Yes

1874
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:24,220
He knows what you're on

1875
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:27,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. I get that

1876
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:35,340
But I was like it feels great. I've tried I've tried so many times to be like cool in a germa stream

1877
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:38,940
But there's too many people. Oh, yeah, it's like it's impossible. You have to

1878
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:42,540
I tried to be the one guy would be incredible

1879
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:44,220
I tried to be funny

1880
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,740
I tried to be funny in that chat

1881
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:48,300
But I was like on the train and I had to get off in a minute

1882
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:53,740
And I had like 30 seconds to look at the chat and I just like I tried to type a couple messages

1883
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:56,540
But like autocorrect fucked one of them up and I was like dammit

1884
01:47:57,740 --> 01:47:59,740
Um, so whatever

1885
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:03,260
Whatever I got what I came for

1886
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:06,460
I got noticed. That's all that's all I wanted

1887
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,260
Uh based based as hell

1888
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:14,700
It's worked for me. I got on this fucking podcast by fucking bullying you on your twitch streams

1889
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:18,460
You fucking we just commiserated. We just commiserated about

1890
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,420
Being aggrieved about Trixie

1891
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,740
Uh

1892
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:31,740
Oh, it's just is that and the fact that uh, you have more twitter followers than me and that means that I I need to uh

1893
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:35,740
I need to steal your cloud. It means you'll get a chubby little retweet from me. So

1894
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:45,420
You scratched my back I scratched yours. If you know what I'm saying, that's the how you play the cloud game, baby

1895
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:52,140
I mean, I like I like no simsie from from the art discords and stuff

1896
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:57,100
And baby we use mummy milkers and it's like yeah simsie's a cool person. Thank you

1897
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:02,300
You're you're both cool people uh, too. I've been a fan of you guys for a few years and I'm

1898
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,540
Overjoyed

1899
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:09,420
I get to talk but not but not from the pony days apparently. No, uh, I was I'm a lecture

1900
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:12,300
Bastard I'm the worst kind of pc a pc p fan

1901
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,340
Where I came in I came in with the big lectures

1902
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:20,460
The worst child the worst now the worst kind are the are the old digi heads

1903
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,420
Oh, I mean I I think I mean I was kind of that

1904
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:30,780
And um, and I'm I'm not why did you come from the uh, the dick show lecture? No the the first thing I

1905
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:36,140
Saw was your sonnet you think because I found out about you from the frederick nukeson video

1906
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:39,500
Which I showed my friend and I was obsessed with it and I was like, I think that's one of fred's

1907
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:45,100
I think that's one of fred's worst videos. Yeah, definitely. I would agree like he's improved so much since then but um,

1908
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:48,860
Yeah, like I watched your sonnet you video. I was like, oh, this is cool. Hang on. There's a king hearts one

1909
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,940
Hey, is that digi bro in the background and then

1910
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:57,180
I'd listen to podcasts that went into all your solo stuff and watch lots of gipsy videos

1911
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:05,740
It's not it's not my new it's not my new and and more sour grapes talking when I say that the like the hardcore digi heads

1912
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:13,180
Are though are the worst are the worst faction of the pcp fan fan base? Uh, the lecture the lecture. I mean, that's fine

1913
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:17,980
Uh, no, that's good. That's good. Um, I have gone back and listened to every episode

1914
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:20,220
So I feel somewhat validated

1915
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:26,220
But only the pony only the pony only those who were listening in the horse cast days are the true

1916
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:31,500
The true core audience you can never if you weren't there, you don't understand man

1917
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,060
You'll never really get it

1918
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:36,300
Yeah, it really was like a secret

1919
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:39,180
Society that like a lot of people just

1920
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:42,140
You know because bronies were cringe at the time

1921
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:43,900
It's like oh god

1922
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:47,180
You were either in or you were out and if you were out you had no idea what they were doing

1923
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:51,180
But you you just had a vague idea that they were strange if you were in

1924
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:53,660
Uh, it's a it's a whole world

1925
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,540
There was solidarity. There's brony solidarity

1926
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:04,620
We all we all had each other's backs, you know, you've you mess with one of us. You mess with all of us spider-man. I mean goblin

1927
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:06,620
Uh, yeah

1928
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:10,460
It's like works though because there's there's so many people connected to your little community

1929
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:16,220
Like like there's so many discord servers and offshoots of the pcp and like pcp adjacent things

1930
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:18,460
They don't even know us anymore. There's like no

1931
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:22,220
There's people there's people that like play rfck now that like don't even know

1932
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:27,740
Yeah, I was I was on endless war the other day and like some like some guy was like, hey, are you doing?

1933
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:32,460
Yeah, and he was like, do you want to go fishing? I was like, okay, and then he died and then he died

1934
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:34,540
I was just waiting for him

1935
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,620
He I was waiting for him at the pier

1936
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:40,940
I was waiting for him at the pier and he was like, hang on. I'm all by over and then I fell asleep

1937
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:42,780
Oh my god

1938
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:47,900
So we had this weird little interaction. He was like, hey, uh, type go to jrp. I was like, okay, and I did it

1939
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:51,420
And then he didn't even DM me. I said, I died lol

1940
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:54,220
I was like, okay, cool

1941
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:55,340
You know what?

1942
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:58,780
Endless war is like a great like physical location online

1943
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:04,940
Like if you wanted like set up a secret meeting with another person and then another internet person you go to endless war

1944
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:07,500
You go to a specific street and meet you at this time

1945
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:10,140
And it's yeah, you would you would never find it

1946
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:13,980
Like it would be so hard to find like a record of what was said there

1947
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:18,540
You would have to know like what what town what town in endless war

1948
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:22,860
Do you need to navigate to and then like check the history and yeah to find those records?

1949
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:28,780
So what i'm saying is if any if you want to do it, but endless war is funnier endless war is yes

1950
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,940
DMs are first

1951
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:34,780
If no, it was interesting because I wasn't even typing anything on the server. No wait actually

1952
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,340
Oh

1953
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,660
Yeah, this would be worse because uh

1954
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:43,580
The other person would have a record of it if you both have a conversation in a place

1955
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:47,900
Neither of you will be able to remember where the fuck it is or to scroll back to it

1956
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:49,980
and then well

1957
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:55,580
Yeah, you got to go and do your shady dealings in endless war and then get yourself banned from the server

1958
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:59,740
You both got to get banned from the server so you can't find it again. It's the only way

1959
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:02,060
I

1960
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:06,380
True cyber security. That's the only way to make your nfts secure

1961
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:13,660
I've been money laundering through endless war for years. I should just I should just I should just sell an nft of endless war

1962
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:18,880
No, just of the game. No, no, no make make an nft of like a sly moid

1963
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:22,220
No

1964
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:27,580
I because I don't have to do anything like if I just sell I don't need to make like a model or like a picture

1965
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:31,580
No, fuck it. Like just sell an nft of the game. It doesn't mean they own the game

1966
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:37,100
It doesn't mean anything. It's just the nft represents the game and you own the nft

1967
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:42,460
And uh, you know, I've burned down like 20 acres of forest to make this happen

1968
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:46,940
I'm I'm gonna

1969
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:53,020
What if what if it was an aft like an automatically fungible fungible token like no matter what you did

1970
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:55,980
Someone else would have it you couldn't have the rights to it

1971
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:02,060
It would be impossible to have the unique article. Isn't that just like a computer virus?

1972
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:05,180
Yeah

1973
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,940
I'll make I'll make a like a I don't know

1974
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:16,620
The image of frisker as a aft and then she would infect the internet and she would be everywhere

1975
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:19,020
Would you dances or something?

1976
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:22,460
And she would eat bitcoin if she stays on your computer

1977
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,900
It's just a little desktop friend that eats all your bitcoin

1978
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:31,980
She she people are mining bitcoin and she would grief the miners. She would like poor lava on them

1979
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,820
Dude bitcoin is down bitcoin is fucking dying

1980
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:41,420
Bitcoin has been dying for a little while. Yeah. Oh, it's no it's it's down even more

1981
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:49,340
It's down even more now like it like just today. It's having another like big crash today. It's down to 44. Holy shit

1982
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,180
I don't know what I got. This is tinged. It's tinged for me though

1983
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:57,180
It's who the who the fuck just left the call. It was craig

1984
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:59,660
Craig you

1985
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:05,980
It was a old friend craig. He's a fucking dog. Shit craig just fucking hates when we talk about bitcoin. You can't stand

1986
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:10,540
Yeah, he's like he's like I don't want to hear this. He's like, no, I've got so much invested. I'm like

1987
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:17,180
I don't want to hear this right now about it. Um, I'll have to get him back into record. I guess but uh,

1988
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:19,820
I feel

1989
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:24,860
Tinge of this because I want to celebrate when I see bitcoin go down because I sold

1990
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:29,740
Uh near the top not quite at the top, but I sold like pretty high

1991
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:34,220
You know, I made back like some of the money I lost on gme

1992
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:38,940
So I was like pretty happy with that and now it's going down. I'm like, haha. Fuck it. Fuck you

1993
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:44,860
um, but it's going down at least partially because elan musk said like

1994
01:55:45,740 --> 01:55:52,140
It's bad for the environment and like we're not going to trade in it until like it's less bad for the environment and I'm like

1995
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:56,460
That's kind of a good reason for it to go down though. Damn it. Fuck

1996
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:01,180
He took this. I can't I can't I can't be 100 happy about this anymore

1997
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,980
I wanted to go down because it sucks

1998
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:09,580
You want people to lose faith in it. You mean I wanted to go down because it sucks

1999
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:13,260
Not because like someone is like doing like the right thing with it

2000
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:15,820
You're just a very bitter man, aren't you?

2001
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:18,780
Shut up

2002
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:21,660
No, um

2003
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:27,420
I I I I feel like it would be easier to feel happy that it is going down

2004
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:30,460
It'd be nice setting a precedent

2005
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:36,620
The that it might actually get green energy. It would feel better to be happy involved. No, I wanted to go down

2006
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:39,180
because people see like oh

2007
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:46,060
It's like it's stupid. It's stupid and it's and it's bad. Oh, bitcoin's bad. So

2008
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:52,700
Let's not use it. Right. That's what I wanted. It is but instead it's like, oh, they're gonna. There's a problem with bitcoin

2009
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:59,100
Okay, we need to address it and fix that problem so that we can re-adopt and I'm like, no

2010
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:05,100
This like this is I don't want I don't what I don't want to see is like short-term

2011
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:09,020
losses for bitcoin in the name of like, you know

2012
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:15,660
Greenifying it or like, you know pretending to greenify or you know greenifying it enough that like people will stop complaining

2013
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:20,860
Whatever only for that to like then become long-term gains. I don't want long-term games. I wanted to die

2014
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:27,980
I feel like unfortunately it is too established to actually die

2015
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:31,980
I mean

2016
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:34,060
I mean, you never know

2017
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:39,340
I mean, who knows? It'll go down. Obviously. It'll it'll have crashes, but it'll always be there as a thing

2018
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:44,380
I'm too stupid. Maybe some of the less known coins

2019
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,100
Will die out but bitcoin is

2020
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:53,500
I mean, maybe maybe it'll like change hands. Which one is the most impressive? Bitcoin could be overtaken by a number

2021
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:57,820
Another coin. Yeah, but I feel like that becomes more widely adopted

2022
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:00,300
I think

2023
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:07,660
I don't know. I don't think I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that crypto is just gonna be a thing that like people use in daily life

2024
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:10,700
Why I don't think that I don't think that's inevitable

2025
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:15,100
I think um that the uh

2026
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:19,900
The trading investing and then buying low settling high all of that crap

2027
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,780
That's short term in like interest

2028
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:26,860
People will be like hype about making a quick easy money

2029
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,500
uh, but eventually I think

2030
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:32,380
it'll have to or

2031
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:37,260
It'll have to become more usable in the real world for like just selling stuff

2032
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:42,460
Well, yeah, that's buying stuff. But in order to do that it would need to like

2033
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:45,260
Level out and not be as volatile

2034
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:52,540
Yeah, so I'm like, I guess if if it can like if the investment hype

2035
01:58:53,500 --> 01:59:00,220
Can stick around long enough for it to mellow out and then I think it'll stay for I don't know

2036
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:02,460
Well, it needs

2037
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:10,700
It needs like wide adoption in the way that like everyone has access to getting it and like every and like

2038
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:17,980
You know lots and lots of vendors, you know, accept it as payment and there's a convenient way of doing those transactions

2039
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:25,100
And if that happens, I think then that will drive its value further up because now it will be more useful as a currency and therefore more valuable

2040
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:30,220
So if one I think there's a lot of companies like investing into crypto

2041
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:32,860
because of it's not being like

2042
01:59:33,740 --> 01:59:40,140
Regulated exactly. So there's there's an incentive for companies to get their hands on the sorts this sort of currency

2043
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:43,420
Which I think is because it's like, um

2044
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:51,020
Oh, I don't know much about finance, but I in my head I'm thinking like, oh, yeah offshore bank accounts like they don't have to pay tax

2045
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:56,940
They're doing shady things all the time. Cryptocurrency is very easy to do shady things with that might be part of it, of course

2046
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:58,940
They're gonna want it that might be part of it

2047
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,620
um, I mean, I think it's also the idea that

2048
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:06,540
It has not reached its peak value yet because

2049
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:15,100
It has seen like some adoption lately, but it still hasn't seen like truly like universal adoption like if that

2050
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:18,060
if it were to happen like tomorrow that like

2051
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:25,500
Amazon accepts bitcoin and then like, you know mom and pop retailers all install a fucking scanner that lets you

2052
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:29,180
You know pay for your fucking groceries in bitcoin

2053
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:37,340
Then like it would fucking shoot up to 100k because that would like suddenly it's something that like everybody wants and it's not like

2054
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:42,380
It's it's it's less niche now than it was before but it's it's still a niche thing

2055
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:45,100
Um, yeah to to and to an extent

2056
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:46,700
um

2057
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:47,740
Yeah

2058
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:52,620
So I think that's the like speculative part of it that like people are betting on

2059
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:56,300
It eventually becoming more widely adopted which

2060
02:00:56,940 --> 02:01:01,820
Will make it more valuable which makes the value go up which makes getting in on the ground floor, you know

2061
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:05,660
An investment that will pay dividends in the future

2062
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:13,580
Uh, although it's the market seems to be looking a little bearish a little bearish for the moment, but uh, maybe just in the short term

2063
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:16,540
Who knows

2064
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:19,020
who fucking

2065
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:21,340
knows

2066
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:25,180
Yeah, no one you guys okay. Yeah

2067
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:27,740
wowy

2068
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:32,380
Man being being on the pcp is just save as listening to it. I zone out whenever benton. I was talking about

2069
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:36,700
No, no zone out and starting muffins

2070
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:43,180
It's time it's time to zone out even harder because I feel like we're at a point where maybe it's time to move on

2071
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:45,180
To voicemails. Yeah

2072
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:46,540
Yeah

2073
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:51,340
By the way, ben we're at two hours right now. I don't want to be here for five hours

2074
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:56,620
So no no smells go on for too long. I will kill my I

2075
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:59,500
I'm still thinking I'm thinking we can

2076
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:02,220
Hustle through these in an hour

2077
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:06,780
We go quick. If we just don't react to them at all. We just play them in a string

2078
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:12,700
I do try that's the strat. We go. I can try to keep it under three hours. I feel like that's a good

2079
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,940
guideline

2080
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:17,820
Yeah, let's see. Where do I where did I save this?

2081
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:21,100
shit

2082
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:27,020
Looking at speak pipe. Okay, the first voicemail

2083
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:29,820
is from

2084
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:33,980
It's called bleach fan 17 exposes the retards

2085
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:39,980
So, uh, sorry. I'm I'm I'm pulling it up. Okay. I think this is

2086
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,940
Dischord please

2087
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:45,500
Okay, posting it in the general chat right there

2088
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:50,940
Bleach fan 17 exposes the retards three two one go

2089
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,100
Today instead of regaling you with the scripture

2090
02:02:55,820 --> 02:03:02,060
That is tight Kubo's bleach palms tight Kubo. I will be reading to you something a little bit different

2091
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:05,100
Let me begin

2092
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:07,820
Bleach is trash

2093
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:10,940
Compare it to something like vagabond and tell me the characters have

2094
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:14,620
Compare it to hunter hunter and tell me it has plot

2095
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:18,220
It compare it to one piece and tell me it has world building

2096
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:23,660
You're fucking delusional if you honestly believe bleach is good comparatively to any of those series

2097
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:26,060
She got asked for a reason

2098
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:28,620
Only series that big to be asked so far in

2099
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:34,460
Literally never happened before or since but i'm sure you die hard idiots actually believe

2100
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:37,100
When jump when they see you

2101
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:43,100
I don't care. Uh, next one is called no anime analysis. No watch

2102
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:45,740
Uploading it there

2103
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:47,740
three two one go

2104
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:54,620
I thought this was supposed to be digi bro's anime podcast. What the fuck aren't you talking about anime? Not anymore

2105
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:57,340
baby, uh

2106
02:03:57,580 --> 02:03:59,980
Bro, we've cast off the yoke art

2107
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:03,980
Bleach has good art in it. I like the drawings sometimes

2108
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:12,220
This is no longer that uh, the anime podcast. Duh, thanks. Thanks for the

2109
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,780
Cryptocurrency and trouble in israel

2110
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:23,660
Yes, yes, yes, we're moving in a bold new direction. Uh, uh, uh, we don't know what our content is but we're gonna

2111
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:30,380
We're gonna start color coding. Yeah, we got we're gonna have a blue and white border for israel palestinian

2112
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:35,580
Conflict videos and we're gonna have yellow for bitcoin related videos

2113
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,540
It's gonna be great. You're gonna love it. I have all the colors

2114
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,340
For gib is dying corner

2115
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:48,300
That's that's every video that's every video

2116
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:55,660
Next next one is uh, no no next one is called motivation. There it is

2117
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:58,460
three two one go

2118
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:02,060
Hey pcb monotone jones here. No relation

2119
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:07,740
I recently finished my first semester at uni and I'm pretty happy because now I have more free time to work on art and stuff

2120
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:12,620
Nice. The issue is that I never have any motivation to do so. This is specifically withdrawing too

2121
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:15,740
I never have any problem with making myself write my silly little books

2122
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:19,340
I don't know if i'm adhd or what but I really do love making stuff

2123
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:21,980
So there shouldn't be any reason that I can't force myself to work

2124
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:27,500
You guys have some of the best worth work ethics i've ever seen and I don't know if it's because that's not true

2125
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:31,820
Not if you could share some tips on how y'all stay motivated. I would appreciate it

2126
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:36,540
Ben congrats on your game. I hope you feel better soon and tom. You'll never die

2127
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:39,580
um, okay

2128
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:48,620
Yeah, I mean if you if you love doing it then why can't you motivate yourself to do it would be my question like why

2129
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:53,820
A lot of the time with um motivation like if you're thinking of something to do

2130
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:56,220
uh

2131
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:59,580
You might be thinking too big and that is like paralyzing you

2132
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:04,940
A lot of the time you you end up like having a thing you do on the side just for fun and that becomes

2133
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:08,860
Your main thing because you you're doing it more and the thing that you want to do

2134
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:14,220
Uh that you keep thinking about doing and you're not doing it. It's because you're thinking too much about it

2135
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:17,180
You just gotta yeah

2136
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:20,860
Draw some stupid crap

2137
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:22,460
It will suck

2138
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:26,460
And then draw some more it sounds to me like he's just got art block and he just needs to wait

2139
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:32,860
And keep trying until suddenly it goes. Oh, I can I can work again. Keep trying and wait. Yeah. Yeah

2140
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:38,700
Keep trying and wait. That's the best way to put it try for like 20 20 minutes at most and then if it's uh,

2141
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:43,740
Oh, oh, I can if it's not if it's not coming. Just yeah try again tomorrow. Yeah, exactly

2142
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:50,460
Yeah, it happens that happens to me fucking on a monthly basis. We'll just be like an entire week where I'm

2143
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:52,700
I'm my job. I'm not gonna do it

2144
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:59,900
Just can't I mean you're you're quite quick with the the art and it's you are quality

2145
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:04,700
So it's it's I think you can uh, you can afford yourself a few moments like that. Yeah

2146
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,100
I mean

2147
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:12,060
People just don't there's always an upper limit. There's always an upper limit to how unbelievably

2148
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:18,140
Um, uh, productive a person can be and it's impossible to like be the most

2149
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:20,860
You just do what you can. Yeah

2150
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:23,340
Everyone works at a different rate and stuff

2151
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:26,380
Uh

2152
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:28,060
I I feel

2153
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:33,900
I don't know. I sometimes I have the same thought as this guy like why can't I focus on the thing I want to do

2154
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:37,100
I want to be working on this thing and yet I'm continually

2155
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:43,500
Finding myself doing something else. Do I have a problem? Do I have ADHD? Should I get diagnosed?

2156
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:48,220
I have that thought a lot. I think Ben. Well, I think it's it's it's like what you want

2157
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:52,540
Is maybe the thing to be completed and the doing it is not the thing you want to do

2158
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:56,860
Ben you're like I want to have the game be made. I don't want to make the game

2159
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:03,100
Ben your show is called The Procrastinator's podcast. I know I think you forgot

2160
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:11,020
It's a it's a big problem. It's a big problem. Uh, yeah, uh, I just I just uh, I don't know

2161
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:13,660
Sometimes I wonder sometimes I wonder like am I

2162
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:21,020
Am I operating and like am I am I am I operating irregularly?

2163
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:25,020
Do I have like is there something like is there some issue?

2164
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:30,700
Is the could be chemically resolved for me that would make me a more efficient at the things I want to do

2165
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:32,700
Do you never think that am I crazy?

2166
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:39,020
I mean if well, I guess I guess I do but I feel like if somebody says

2167
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:43,100
Yes, you actually do have a ghc. Oh, yes, you do actually have autism

2168
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:48,060
I I don't know what I would do. I guess I would just continue the way I was because well, no, I would

2169
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:53,420
You're missing the point the point is if that happened and they were like, oh, yes

2170
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:59,980
The reason why you don't uh work as efficiently as you wish you did is because you have ADHD

2171
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:04,940
And we have you know, uh treatments. We have medication that is you know

2172
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:09,100
Can treat some of the symptoms of ADHD and then what if I was like, oh, okay cool

2173
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:12,060
And then I took some and then I found like oh wow

2174
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:15,100
I'm way more able to focus on the things I want to do and I get a lot more done

2175
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:18,780
I it's possible. I don't think I have

2176
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:25,020
A medical issue though. I feel like I'm just most of the time. I don't have good discipline

2177
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:28,460
I do but then every now and then I'm like discipline up when I was younger

2178
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:33,420
But every now and then I'm like I'm procrastinating even though I really want to be

2179
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:41,180
Getting that thing done and it's yes, it's it's clearly irrational. I'm clearly pursuing an irrational course of action. Why?

2180
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:43,980
you know

2181
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,980
I guess I guess that's human

2182
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:47,740
I mean

2183
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:53,100
It just comes down to like what are the things you could do playing video games or doing the other thing and that you

2184
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:59,100
Choose the video games because you find more short-term pleasure in it and it's very easy to go to those sorts of things

2185
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:01,260
Oh, I don't think it's indicative of you

2186
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:04,860
It's just it's just how how things are so

2187
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:08,780
Good and satisfying and video games. They give me that dopamine

2188
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:11,020
So engaging

2189
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:13,820
Yeah, I mean, it's true. I could be making money

2190
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:18,380
Not really though

2191
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:21,180
Not really because I don't get paid for anything in particular

2192
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:23,980
Yeah

2193
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:29,180
I just have I just have a vague sense of obligation that I need to be putting things out into

2194
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:31,980
The world and I hope

2195
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:37,820
That I will be correspondingly met with appreciation which in some cases might

2196
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:42,620
congeal itself into money, but I have no guarantee

2197
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:45,980
Uh

2198
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:47,660
Just a kind of

2199
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:51,580
Just a kind of vague sense that maybe sums up the artist experience

2200
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:53,660
Yeah

2201
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:55,180
Yeah

2202
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:57,180
Uh next voicemail

2203
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,660
is called uh

2204
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:02,220
Gibbs pancreas

2205
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:04,220
3 2 1 go

2206
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:07,740
This is a message from Gibbs pancreas

2207
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:10,620
Hey, Gib. I'm real hurt man

2208
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:17,820
I've been making yo insulin for over 20 years and you go and credit all my hard effort to the kidneys

2209
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:21,500
I'm ashamed of you Gib. I'm actually so so mad

2210
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:23,820
You know what?

2211
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:29,020
How about I stop how about I stop making your insulin bitch? Yeah, take that you diabetic now

2212
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:33,180
Sorry, not sorry savage, but well-deserved

2213
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:38,380
Damn, it doesn't sound as evil and vile anymore without funny boys. It's small

2214
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:46,140
It's a small little thing. Yeah, it's so small so insignificant. You understand that I'm bigger than you pancreas mine

2215
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:48,940
Okay, I could beat the you up

2216
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:52,140
Keep in line

2217
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:54,140
I'm going to beat up my own pancreas

2218
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:58,860
You should do it just to teach him a lesson. You can't you can't you can't let him get uppity

2219
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:03,340
You gotta keep him in their place. You got a squash rebellion when it starts to form

2220
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:08,700
Who put a microphone to my pancreas? Hey, that's what I want to know

2221
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:12,700
I didn't notice next next voicemail is called uh

2222
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:18,300
Oh, it's jean s. Uh, it's from jean s three two one go

2223
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:22,300
What do you think is the biggest problem in the universe?

2224
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,580
Capitalism

2225
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:33,420
Uh, um scarcity, uh, I mean, I don't understand capitalism is probably

2226
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:39,580
So I'm gonna let decay think bigger. Yeah, you know universal entropy universal entropy

2227
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:42,220
Um

2228
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:48,300
Biggest problem for the existence of the universe, but I don't care about it. I'll be dead

2229
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:53,420
Well, when you when you when you can feel your toes touching each other in your shoes, that's the biggest problem in the universe

2230
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:59,740
Um the biggest problem in the universe is just uh

2231
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:09,100
Is just uh the the the finitude the finitude of of existence of of a discrete uh being

2232
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:13,740
Just the the yawning the yawning gulf of void

2233
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:23,020
Uh, uh that extends in every direction. I like that up down left right forward back and front and back and that inspires cool

2234
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:28,140
Things that I see that I watch. Oh, I fucking hate you. I hate that shit. I hate that shit

2235
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:33,100
Oh, you know, actually if you didn't have the abyss you wouldn't have dark souls more more talent

2236
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:37,980
You wouldn't have dark souls if you didn't if you weren't all gonna die. We wouldn't have dark souls

2237
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:43,420
That's yeah, the notorious best you'll see happened. You gotta fucking you gotta accept that then

2238
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:49,900
Uh, it's mortality is good because it makes us sad and that makes us make video games to cope

2239
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:52,380
like dark souls

2240
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:58,060
Jesus fucking christ. I didn't say that I just said that like the the concept of thinking about the abyss

2241
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:01,900
Gives you the thought to like, hey, what if I should put it out in a video game?

2242
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:04,300
Yeah, I just

2243
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:07,580
I

2244
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:11,900
You sure now you're right. Yeah, it's true. I'd like to submit an argument

2245
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:16,140
Uh, the biggest problem in the universe is when my uh drawing tablet pen disconnects

2246
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:19,020
I have to move it a few centimeters away and then back again, and then it works again

2247
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:23,340
That's the biggest problem in the universe. The biggest problem in the universe is when

2248
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:27,180
Uh, sometimes my tablet does a thing where

2249
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:31,660
For no, I I don't know why it will just

2250
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:37,180
I'm not pressing any buttons, but I will I will hover my my mouse over

2251
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:42,780
Like something and like over like a slider and the slider will just creep up

2252
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:48,220
And like and like like a like the volume on a youtube video will just creep up to the max

2253
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:54,140
Or like if I hover over like my my pens my pen tip size in like manga studio

2254
02:14:54,460 --> 02:15:00,780
The size will just creep up and I don't know why it's like my fucking mouse wheel is like

2255
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:03,340
Nudged in a direction or something

2256
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:09,660
And I have had times when I have had that for like weeks and I have like I've tried disconnecting my mouse and I've tried

2257
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:13,100
Like fucking reinstalling my mouse drivers and stuff and like

2258
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:17,660
I don't know. I think I think a broken mouse is the problem back then, but I got it again the other day

2259
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:21,260
I was like, oh my god. This is gonna be a weeks long problem. I'm doomed

2260
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:23,980
But no, I just like

2261
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:29,740
Un I just unplugged my mouse dongle and re-plugged it in and fortunately that fixed again, but it was the scariest

2262
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:35,900
I was so scared of having to deal with that because I really threw a wrench into a lot of fucking shit like

2263
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:38,780
Fuck it. Let's destroy Israel

2264
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:44,860
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Israel is the biggest problem in the universe

2265
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:49,420
Israel, you know what? It's really it's a pretty big problem. No

2266
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:52,460
America is the America is worse

2267
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:57,660
If Israel is a problem, it's only because America is empowering them to do their shit

2268
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:00,860
So I guess America is the big supposed to just all comes back to capitalism

2269
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:05,180
Yeah, cool. Come on. You know what capitalism it all comes back to capitalism

2270
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:07,820
Again, I was right the first time money

2271
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:11,420
Money money dough

2272
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:13,980
But me like money

2273
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,980
I do like money

2274
02:16:15,980 --> 02:16:19,180
I like money a lot. It's really great. You should try having some

2275
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:25,180
Sometimes what are you fucking poor? Are you fucking poor? I don't like poor people. I like you live in a Prius. Come on

2276
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:29,820
No, I got an RV. I stole it

2277
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:35,100
Next voicemail. Let's move on. We're done. Yeah, next one. Next voicemail is uh

2278
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:37,900
2021 Ben

2279
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:40,940
Wait

2291
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:25,900
I look at them. I look at them. I saw on there though

2292
02:17:26,460 --> 02:17:30,540
I saw I've never posted on there. I would never I would never fucking do that. I'd like

2293
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,940
God um

2294
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:37,580
Uh, oh next one is called

2295
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:42,940
What the fucking number are we on next one is called cross. Don't worry Ben

2296
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:46,300
Okay, three two one go

2297
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:50,860
I just got my second vaccination yesterday and I am totally fine

2298
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:55,180
My arm was a little bit sore when I woke up this morning had some general flu symptoms

2299
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:59,900
But took some tile at all. I'm feeling totally fine now. So yeah, don't worry ben

2300
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:05,180
Some some people say it makes them feel pretty pretty out of it and sick for like a day or two

2301
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,780
I

2302
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:08,780
After I got my first one

2303
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:12,060
uh, I was like literally nothing happened and then

2304
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:15,180
Like five or six days later

2305
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:20,860
Uh, I suddenly got like a little bruise like a like a bruising around the injection

2306
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:24,060
And I'm like, why would that happen like five days later?

2307
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:25,820
Uh

2308
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:27,820
But like it's fine, uh

2309
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:35,100
I'm pretty I don't know. I'm pretty hearty. I think I think I have like a pretty

2310
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:40,220
Naturally like high constitution score and resistance to disease and illness

2311
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:44,940
So I think I am probably not likely to feel much

2312
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:47,020
From it

2313
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:51,100
So thanks cross. I won't worry vaccine. Good

2314
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:55,420
And if I do get a little sick, well, whatever it doesn't matter

2315
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:57,260
Um

2316
02:18:57,260 --> 02:19:01,820
Next one is called vaccine. Good. You know in my opinion in my opinion vaccination

2317
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:03,820
Works

2318
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:05,820
Probably at least I hope so

2319
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:08,140
I hope so

2320
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:13,740
Fuck it. I'll get both shots. Hell. I'll even get a fucking third booster if they want to give me one to fight some

2321
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:16,860
Weird strains or whatever. That's how dedicated I am

2322
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:18,380
All right

2323
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:23,980
Uh, yeah, all right. Next one is called based joker three two one go

2324
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:26,780
You know Batman

2325
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:31,020
They say that one bird in the hand is worse two in the bush

2326
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:36,780
But like, you know, I think that one turd in the hand is worse two in the tush

2327
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:40,140
Ah

2328
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:41,580
It worked

2329
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:43,340
He did it

2330
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,340
He fucking did it

2331
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:48,860
I am a big fan of based joker. I got to be honest

2332
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:52,220
He's got some staying power

2333
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:53,820
he

2334
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:58,140
You you don't think you think he's got to be out of material. How long can he keep this up?

2335
02:19:58,300 --> 02:20:03,500
He's can't possibly do it again. He's got a full week in between each one to come up with them

2336
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:05,740
No

2337
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:10,940
I like to imagine he sat there with holy quinn just fucking writing notes for 20 hours a day

2338
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:14,220
He's like work shopping it

2339
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:17,820
What if I said something about feet? No, that's not funny

2340
02:20:20,380 --> 02:20:26,300
He's showing up to like open mic nights like reading like reading like a huge list of them out and just like

2341
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:29,180
And he only gives us the one that gets the biggest laugh

2342
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:31,740
Look at the cream of the crop

2343
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:34,460
Absolutely

2344
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:38,300
He's like front-lining for snl and then he takes that to us

2345
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,500
He says

2346
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:46,460
Did you did you watch the the elon snl?

2347
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:49,260
I watched a clip of

2348
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:54,460
A bit of it. Did he did he say i'm a stupid. Did he say that? I don't think so

2349
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:57,100
I I mean maybe I I literally

2350
02:20:58,060 --> 02:21:04,300
Just hearing about it and thinking about it. I saw I saw some people posting clips of the zoomer

2351
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:07,980
What was it hospital? This is the gen z hospital and I

2352
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:15,100
I I saw the thumbnail for the video and I I couldn't even click on it like I I was so embarrassed even

2353
02:21:16,060 --> 02:21:19,660
I was so embarrassed even thinking about like what could be in this video that like

2354
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:24,540
I couldn't even bear to start watching it. So I just didn't and I watched a bit the mario

2355
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:25,980
I saw that

2356
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:29,740
And it was it was like cringe, you know, like they

2357
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:35,340
They're just saying things that they've heard zoomers say but like not all of the things and mostly from twitch

2358
02:21:35,740 --> 02:21:37,740
They said poggers

2359
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:38,540
um

2360
02:21:38,540 --> 02:21:41,740
Bass but it was like I didn't even know what that it was

2361
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:43,980
like surprisingly

2362
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:48,220
I mean it wasn't surprisingly bad. It was obviously bad like

2363
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:53,420
I did it wasn't so bad that I was cringing out of my skin. It was just sort of like

2364
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:55,660
You know

2365
02:21:55,660 --> 02:22:01,820
Yeah, I all right. Yeah, maybe I'm back into the retirement home. You go. It's just sort of sad

2366
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:04,140
Hmm, I see

2367
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:09,660
Yeah, but it's also like the biggest comedy show in the world and you gotta you gotta expect something more from that

2368
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:12,140
You have to laugh. You have to laugh. It's the biggest

2369
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:19,900
Well, it's like it's like if if this is if these people aren't delivering something that's fucking funny and impress me then like

2370
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:25,500
What is the then like where am I to go? Where am I to go for amusements?

2371
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:28,060

I'm gonna throw up

2379
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:06,060
I'm not actually gonna throw up. Oh, I just burped and it tasted like butterscotch. That's pretty cool. That's great

2380
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:08,140
Don't you just love that? What a man you are

2381
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:11,500

Wait, I think I already put it there spork more like dork three two one go

2384
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:28,780
This is in response to spork's voicemail last week, uh bitching and moaning about uh been using gendered pronouns

2385
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:34,140
Whatever, uh, don't say the n word spork. It doesn't matter if you're black. It's not cool. No one should say it

2386
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:36,300
Okay, negga

2387
02:23:36,620 --> 02:23:38,620
Uh

2388
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,780
Fuck you

2389
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:51,580
I'm tempted to cut that. I don't know. I should I keep it or should I the spork thing from before so

2390
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:54,460
I don't know. Well, the this guy sounds like he's in

2391
02:23:55,340 --> 02:23:58,940
spork's voicemail was bad faith spork's voicemail was just uh

2392
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:01,180

2393
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:05,180
I mean, I don't even think she was fucking that's she's not it's not that serious guy

2394
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:09,260
It's not that serious. I don't think she was what a prick. Fuck

2395
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,780
Next voice we won't cut it. Just this is fucking

2396
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:20,060
Don't send bad voicemails. The number one rule of voicemails is don't send them if they're bad. They're not funny

2397
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:21,900
Uh

2398
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:28,460
Next one is called, uh based saint. Yes, three two one go

2399
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:31,180
Oh

2400
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:38,780
I don't know man. Well, is it been after the game. I know where it is after the game

2401
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:44,300
Yes, the game after the game's done. Then I'll you need to finish your third finale. This is like been punished, but

2402
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:52,060
Uh, that's only the second one. Oh, it's only the third time's the charm. Yeah, they can finally end and finally die

2403
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,620
Uh

2404
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:59,420
Next voicemail is called the three two one go

2405
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:02,940
um just to add on to like the um

2406
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:07,580
weird interactions with dug walker stuff. Um

2407
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:10,300
He was at my local comic con

2408
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:15,980
Uh, like a few years ago and um, I didn't know he was gonna come so I was like damn. This is the guy

2409
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:18,860
Um with the glasses

2410
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:25,820
The guy with the glasses. Oh my god. I like had a dollar and I asked him to sign it. Um, and he was like weirdly

2411
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:29,740
Offended and I could have been misreading his reaction, but

2412
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:34,220
Weirdly, uh, it definitely seemed to me as though he was sort of taken aback by this

2413
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:36,940
And I don't know like is that is it that weird? Um

2414
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:43,660
I I don't think so. Um, but yeah, you defaced the the president. It's like a crime, isn't it?

2415
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,620
No, who cares?

2416
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:49,740
Yeah, I know who cares, but like it's a it's a piece of paper. I can see

2417
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:55,100
I can see Doug walker being the kind of guy who would be worried about that sort of thing. You know what you're right

2418
02:25:55,260 --> 02:26:00,380
Yeah, I can see him being like, oh, you can't fucking write on united seats currency

2419
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:05,580
I could totally see that maybe that's it. Yeah, or maybe or maybe it's like a

2420
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:12,540
Or maybe it's like an ego thing where it's like this guy's seriously just taking some random junk and like asking me to fucking

2421
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:14,700
Like give him my signature

2422
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:20,300
No, I don't think it would be like that. I feel like I feel like the the him not wanting to

2423
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:23,500
Like anger the american gods

2424
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:30,380
Is is more likely really not I wonder say what you like about Doug walker. He's really not very mean spirited

2425
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:34,540
A lot of the time. No, I don't ever see it. I don't think he's mean spirited

2426
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:38,060
I don't think he's mean spirited, but I do think he's he's pretty conceded

2427
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:42,860
I don't think he's pretty like self-absorbed and seems like kind of a narcissist. Oh, yeah

2428
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:46,860
Yeah, I feel like I don't I'm a convention though. He

2429
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,660
Do you think I'm do you think I'm reading him wrong that I think he would be like

2430
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:55,340
He would be like do you gotta wait in line like everyone else for a signature?

2431
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:59,740
I've only heard um good things about him in personal interactions

2432
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:00,940
so

2433
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:06,060
Like by actual people meeting him. I mean regardless of business practices and shitty videos

2434
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:09,020
Yeah, yeah sure

2435
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:11,340
Okay, I'm a huge fan of it

2436
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:15,340
I was a huge fan of him. I don't want to think of him as being mean

2437
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:19,260
Well, sure

2438
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:27,420
Next voicemail is called thought slime. Okay, there it is three two one

2439
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:33,500
Hey, it's me thought slime. Did you know that you're actually sexist and racist?

2440
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:35,500
Uh

2441
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:39,660
Let's know what he sounds like. That's not true. That's uh, that's uh

2442
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:44,220
What that's not you you could say that you could make this

2443
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:50,300
Impret you could do this impression of like anyone you could be like, hey, I'm I'm big Joel

2444
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:56,140
Do you think did you know you're really sexist? Hey, I'm I'm fucking contra points. Did you know you're really sexist?

2445
02:27:56,220 --> 02:28:01,580
Like you could say this about fucking anybody terrible insane. Did you know that you don't have an RV?

2446
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:05,420
Uh

2447
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:13,660
Terrible this is awful. This is awful. Sometimes you just don't know what your unconscious biases are and you need them pointed out

2448
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:15,900
You fuck

2449
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:20,540
Sometimes that is true. Sometimes that is true. Give do you think me and ben are racist and sexist?

2450
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:23,260
I definitely am

2451
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:25,740
Uh, I don't know

2452
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:30,540
Who knows it's it's it's everyone's a little bit like biased

2453
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:35,580
Towards their own race just because they grow up around, you know

2454
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:39,660
The same skin color and they're like, huh, what's that? It's someone different

2455
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:46,060
I said I I always manifest in different ways, but like no not everyone is literally like the worst possible

2456
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:51,100
Of anything I heard necessary. I heard a youtuber the other day

2457
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:57,100
Who was a a black british person and I heard his voice and I said

2458
02:28:57,740 --> 02:29:04,300
This guy sounds like nino and someone was like it's kind of racist and I was like I thought about I was like, you know

2459
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:06,460
It kind of is

2460
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,940
It kind of is and then everybody

2461
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:14,700
But like I mean, I don't know. I'm not I don't like feel bad

2462
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:21,100
It's like, yeah, it is. I just think like like black people in

2463
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:27,420
Well in the london area that have like a voice that white people in the london area do not have

2464
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:31,740
So I could see why they would be like, oh, this is a similar sort of thing

2465
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:34,380
Yeah, yeah

2466
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:36,380
but but it's um

2467
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:41,660
I mean, I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I think you could probably yeah, it's kind of like a

2468
02:29:42,300 --> 02:29:43,740
racist

2469
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:48,220
Thing to be like, oh these these these two people sound the same because they are the same

2470
02:29:49,180 --> 02:29:52,620
I don't know maybe I'm the accusation of racist as like

2471
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:57,900
Oh, you're trying to ruin my life. You're a bad person throw me in jail. You're being malicious. You're a bad person in harry

2472
02:29:58,220 --> 02:30:04,380
You'll never be good at anything. Yeah. Um, and it's not always that yeah, I mean some people do act like that

2473
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:08,220
And that's your you know what you're right racism is good actually

2474
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:12,700
No, oh no, I've been don't clip that don't clip that

2475
02:30:13,340 --> 02:30:15,340
Don't clip out of context cut it out cut it out

2476
02:30:15,580 --> 02:30:17,340
All right

2477
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:19,340
Eleazar double down

2478
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:20,860
Put a reverb on it

2479
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:25,900
Eleazar play the guy who said the n word again play that one again. Yeah. Yeah, let's go back to that one. That was my favorite

2480
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:29,660
Next no double censor it censor everything

2481
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:32,460
Next voicemail is called

2482
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:37,500
Uh, wait a second. Hold on. You've pushed it too and we haven't listened to one of them

2483
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:43,500
Oh, I'm stupid. Okay. Do the one that's called 3170. That one is Henlo Corgo

2484
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:45,500
Three two one go

2485
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:47,340
Hey

2486
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:48,060
Ben

2487
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:49,580
Yo, um, what up?

2488
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:54,940
I was just wondering after spending roughly 10 minutes or so in your discord

2489
02:30:56,060 --> 02:31:01,820
How like often you hatefully masturbate to the dumb shit that Riley says

2490
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:07,420
And how you compare the quality of those orgasms to normal orgasms

2491
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:10,060
Because I myself have been interested

2492
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,580
in

2493
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:13,740
hateful masturbation for some time now

2494
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:18,220
And I'm trying to like get into the craft and was wondering if you had any tips

2495
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:22,460
I have been I have been seething particularly hard

2496
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:28,060
Since the since the oaky interview. I mean, I've been doing it and I've got no investment in this shit

2497
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:30,780
I have I have been thinking of

2498
02:31:31,340 --> 02:31:34,700
That guy says shit that really pisses me off. I hate him

2499
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:39,980
I hate I hate her you Riley's you up. He does he really

2500
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:43,820
I admit it. He I

2501
02:31:44,380 --> 02:31:48,140
I guess that's I guess that's a win. I guess that's a win for him. He's like a successfully

2502
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:54,380
He makes me mad when he says dumb shit about like making fun of poor people and stuff. I'm like, he's a funny guy

2503
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:56,060
Who isn't funny?

2504
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:58,060
Sad. Yeah

2505
02:31:58,140 --> 02:32:05,260
Um, it's like yep. He's success successfully trolled me. I guess. Uh, it's it sucks and yeah, I've been yeah, I'm seething

2506
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:07,740
So to answer your question, uh

2507
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:09,740
I've been

2508
02:32:09,980 --> 02:32:14,780
Usually only once a week or so. Um, but this week multiple every day

2509
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:23,020
Next voicemail is called roguelike recommendation three two one go

2510
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:28,460
Hey, Ben. I have a roguelike recommendation for you since you cannot seem to be enjoying that genre a lot

2511
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:31,340
So it's called synthetic

2512
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:34,380
Subtitle is legion arising. I think

2513
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:37,180
It's a top-down tactical shooter

2514
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:43,180
Kind of a roguelike. It's pretty good. It has has like some really solid shooting mechanics

2515
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:49,900
Um, I recently got its final update. So all of the content that will be in the game is in the game now

2516
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:56,940
It's hard as fuck. So, uh, I think I beat it like four or five times and with the final update

2517
02:32:57,020 --> 02:33:00,540
They added kind of looks like a twin stick shooter, but I'm not sure not new game plus

2518
02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:04,220
But like a final ending after the ending that I got a couple times

2519
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:06,460
Um

2520
02:33:06,460 --> 02:33:11,820
Yeah, it's pretty good. If you want to try it out for free. There's the arena version of synthetic

2521
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:17,100
You can like try out just uh, just the mechanics against like hordes of enemies

2522
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:19,660
But that's not the roguelike. Uh

2523
02:33:20,220 --> 02:33:26,700
Yeah, also that that's sef guy who made a video on kenji. He also made a video on this. So yeah, check it out. Oh, yeah

2524
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:30,940
Seth Seth Seth seniche that guy

2525
02:33:32,300 --> 02:33:38,300
Seth like barlin. Uh, I'll check I'll check this out. I'm gonna check this out. I like video games

2526
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:40,460
Ben when you're gonna play hades

2527
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:43,660
Oh

2528
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:48,380
Hades nuts. I don't think I don't think you would like hades that much, but I really like it

2529
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:51,020
uh, honestly

2530
02:33:51,020 --> 02:33:52,620
Yeah, I think

2531
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:55,100
I just heard I started so many people gushing about it, but

2532
02:33:55,900 --> 02:33:59,580
Yeah, I mean I talked about this last the isometric gameplay. It doesn't look like

2533
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:04,700
It doesn't look like you're blown away, but I don't know. I'm sure it's fun. I'm sure it's fine. It's very addictive

2534
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:09,580
Um, the character is nice. Music's really good. I really should give it a I really should give it a try

2535
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:12,380
It's just very satisfying to play. It's one of those that's you just sit and

2536
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:16,700
Chill and runs are only like 20 minutes. So it's nice to jump in. That's good

2537
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:21,740
A noida run a successful run is like 16 fucking hours. So

2538
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:25,580
I've never made it past the hasty base in noida. I suck

2539
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:28,140
Oh

2540
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:30,140
You fucking idiot

2541
02:34:30,220 --> 02:34:32,220
Fucking dumbass

2542
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:36,220
Here's what you do. Yeah, fuck you. No, here's what you do. No, no, no

2543
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:41,020
You just you all all you gotta do is you go to the mines and you go to the left

2544
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:45,020
And you just you just dip into the you dip into the fungal caverns

2545
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:49,420
Because that's where the good wands are you dip into the fungal caverns and you get a good wand

2546
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:52,220
You look for you look for a high mana regen

2547
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:57,980
Uh, uh, and and you know low low reload time and cast

2548
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:00,300
Castile and reload time

2549
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:06,060
And if you can find all what you gotta do you need you need a mana you need the mana

2550
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:08,700
Rebooster or fuck. What's it called? Um

2551
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:14,220
The the the mana the one that like gives you 30 extra mana. I got your coach. I'm writing this down coach

2552
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:19,420
We're writing it all down if you get that if you get that you're fucking done if you get that it's game over

2553
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:23,180
You just fucking you just stack that you just stack that in the right wand and you just

2554
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:26,860
And that's it. You got a fucking chainsaw wand and of course

2555
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:31,420
And of course I get that all the time because I know what to look for and I still fucking die in the heesey base

2556
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:34,460
because I fucking because I shoot bullets into a

2557
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:38,380
Liquid nitrogen canister that I didn't see under a pile of snow

2558
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:42,780
But if I was being smart and playing more patiently I would never die

2559
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:50,940
Uh, so that's how you do it. Cool. Yeah. Now you know not it is a good game. I just I've barely scratched the surface with it though

2560
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:54,060
So it's so fucking good dog

2561
02:35:55,100 --> 02:35:59,420
You got you you haven't been to a pair if you haven't been to a parallel worlds

2562
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:01,980
Forget about it. Okay. Um

2563
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:03,980
Yeah, I haven't

2564
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:07,660
Next next one is called, uh clarity

2565
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:10,620
three two one go

2566
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:17,820
I benched on to clarify a couple things. I wasn't entirely with you about autism last week

2567
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:23,660
I wasn't correcting you on anything. You just sounded kind of unsure the first time you talked about it

2568
02:36:24,140 --> 02:36:30,940
So I thought hey, I'm autistic. I'm diagnosed and everything so maybe I can give them some first-hand insights into what it's like

2569
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:33,500
I guess I couldn't uh

2570
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:37,740
Maybe it's fine that it's an increments of a minute and a half at something

2571
02:36:37,740 --> 02:36:43,820
Your voice this okay, that's it. Thank you. Nope. Thanks for the voicemail. Uh, sorry your other voicemail wasn't great

2572
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:48,780
Uh, keep them shorter. Thank you. Uh, next one is called

2573
02:36:49,500 --> 02:36:51,500
Dolos

2574
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:55,100
Uh, there it is three two one go

2575
02:36:56,060 --> 02:37:00,380
So, um, like um, this um question. Um, is maybe um, uh,

2576
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:05,900
Directed uh, um at uh Tommy, but the rest of y'all can answer too. No

2577
02:37:05,980 --> 02:37:11,180
Especially because you know, he's not here your roster changes every five seconds on the podcast

2578
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:14,460
Sorry guy. Don't know if he'll even be here. Nope

2579
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:18,780
Uh, Ben said to keep these short. So, you know, uh, how are the kids?

2580
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:21,500
Okay, how's the life?

2581
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:24,140
Uh thoughts on the guilty gear beta though

2582
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:27,100
Cheers. I'm sorry

2583
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:31,980
I've been seeing a lot of guilty gear posts on twitter. I post about yesterday

2584
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:36,460
But I I don't know what to think about them because I don't play. Yeah, I don't play that shit

2585
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:38,540
I think the the girl with the wolf is hot

2586
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:42,860
Um, is she is she now? Yeah, she's like the new character

2587
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:47,820
She's just like a girl in like a like business casual attire and she's got like a cool wolf that she summons. She's nice

2588
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:51,500
Cool. She's the most normal looking guilty character

2589
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:56,220
To me guilty gear is a guilty ignore

2590
02:37:56,380 --> 02:38:02,380
Hey, it looks like something cool. I just I just keep ignoring it. I just can't play fighting games

2591
02:38:02,700 --> 02:38:05,740
I just can't do it. I can't even play the dragon ball. Yeah, also

2592
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:09,340
Hmm, are you just following for the

2593
02:38:10,220 --> 02:38:12,220
Cute girls. Yeah

2594
02:38:12,220 --> 02:38:15,980
Just look at the art of the characters and go. Yeah, that's cool. I'm just waiting for the game to come out

2595
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:21,820
So I can watch all the animations on youtube basically. That's fair. All right, that makes sense. They do they do look great

2596
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:23,900
That game looks fucking great. Yeah

2597
02:38:24,700 --> 02:38:27,500
Uh, sorry tom wasn't here to answer your question law

2598
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:30,300
um

2599
02:38:30,460 --> 02:38:33,020
The next voicemail is called. Where is it here? I?

2600
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:35,980
Oh god, I found it. It is called. Uh

2601
02:38:36,620 --> 02:38:39,180
SF2 is base not that one

2602
02:38:39,740 --> 02:38:41,740
three two one go

2603
02:38:42,700 --> 02:38:47,100
Saka frontier 2 it says obscure ass square soft rpg for the ps1

2604
02:38:47,740 --> 02:38:50,940
And it's got these kooky characters brights, but the most gorgeous

2605
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:57,900
Watercolor backgrounds the soundtrack is amazing. It's like the pinnacle of how to speak motif in music

2606
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:01,180
The combat system is pretty fucking wonky

2607
02:39:01,900 --> 02:39:05,580
But once you really experiment or research into it, it's really sick

2608
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:09,740
The only blight on the game is that it has these hideous

2609
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:12,940
3d backgrounds when you get into battle

2610
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:15,580
And they are just dot awful

2611
02:39:15,980 --> 02:39:19,500
So truly, uh, tom is wrong for once

2612
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:23,500
2d over 3d. Thank you. Thank you very much

2613
02:39:23,980 --> 02:39:30,460
Check out this game. If you really like old s rbgs. It is really fucking saga frontier

2614
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:33,820
Oh, I thought he said soccer frontier

2615
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:39,020
I would type that in and I just got soccer

2616
02:39:40,860 --> 02:39:43,340
Saga I'm looking at screenshots

2617
02:39:43,420 --> 02:39:44,540
Saga

2618
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:50,620
Oh god, I guess they did like a fucking it looks like they did like a hideous chibi remaster of it

2619
02:39:50,860 --> 02:39:52,860
Oh, that's what this is

2620
02:39:53,500 --> 02:40:00,140
Like one of those fucking uh, like final fantasy the old final fantasy like phone remakes. Yeah, like a psp remake of it

2621
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:05,020
Yeah, oh, yeah, that looks like like it's 2000s mmo

2622
02:40:05,740 --> 02:40:09,820
So I I can't tell what's the original game here and what's like some shitty remake

2623
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:13,020
I just don't know was it too. They was talking about

2624
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:17,420
It's I it's a 2d game, but I think it has 3d

2625
02:40:18,220 --> 02:40:20,780
backgrounds only which is like a weird

2626
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:25,740
Design choice. This looks really nice. Honestly. I might watch it. Let's do it

2627
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:29,180
Um, I

2628
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:33,100
I don't know some of these

2629
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:37,180
I want to

2630
02:40:37,740 --> 02:40:41,740
I don't I don't think I like the look of it very much. There are bits that look okay

2631
02:40:42,940 --> 02:40:47,980
Uh, I would have to see it in motion. The one on steam is definitely like a shitty remake of the first one

2632
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:50,860
Yeah, it looks really bad. Yeah

2633
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:56,940
Okay, next one, uh, there you go. It is called. What is it?

2634
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:03,100
Based veggie tails three two one go

2635
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:05,180
Oh

2636
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:11,100
Have I ever told you about the israelite? I know this one. Hmm the israelite

2637
02:41:11,740 --> 02:41:19,260
Oh, yeah, I remember those guys weren't they supposed to be god's chosen people? That's what the bible says

2638
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:25,980
Oh, I bet they always followed god's directions. Oh, you'd think so, wouldn't you?

2639
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:28,780
Yeah

2640
02:41:30,380 --> 02:41:32,380
You would think so

2641
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:36,700
Jelly beaner posted that in the rad con

2642
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:43,740
In the rad con server and I I really cracked me up

2643
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:47,100
Oh, oh, you'd think so

2644
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:53,980
Is veggie tails a christian show right? Yes. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yeah, okay. You've never seen it

2645
02:41:54,540 --> 02:42:03,980
I've seen the one where they predicted memes and people like oh, wow, I see the one where they all turned to look at each other

2646
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:10,300
Wait, were they predicted? I saw the one where there was an orange and he yelled. What do you mean? Were they teeth?

2647
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:12,380
What do you mean where they predicted memes?

2648
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:19,340
Uh, it's that clip that keeps going around where they say in the future comedy will be randomly generated and

2649
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:22,060
They have like a like a shit post spot

2650
02:42:23,020 --> 02:42:25,020
Wait veggie tails has that

2651
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:28,460
Yeah, it was a clip

2652
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:31,260
Uh, I okay, that's

2653
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:36,380
It's strange. I'll have to look that up later. It's really weird. Okay

2654
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:42,460
Um, why would why would they have that? What? I don't understand. I I no idea. I've never watched it

2655
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:50,780
Next voicemail is called ben read one piece, please three two one go

2656
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:55,500
So I was just watching munchies video he put out

2657
02:42:56,140 --> 02:42:59,580
And I just wanted to say that he is a good boy. Yeah, and

2658
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:03,100
I am proud of him even though

2659
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:08,620
He didn't need to do any of this and it really shows

2660
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:13,020
Massive growth on his part to do all that stuff. Um

2661
02:43:14,060 --> 02:43:15,420
um

2662
02:43:15,420 --> 02:43:17,420
Munchie a good boy

2663
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:19,500
um, I

2664
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:21,020
I think

2665
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:23,100
I think he went

2666
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:28,700
I mean, I would say he went a little overboard. He used some flowery language like and

2667
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:33,020
Said some things that like, you know, I think he's

2668
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:36,700
I think he's correct in what he was doing

2669
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:41,100
But I think definitely what he isn't saying is that he doesn't like the limelight either

2670
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:43,740
So like I just want to not be here anymore

2671
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:47,740
And also things I've said were bad if if he yeah

2672
02:43:47,820 --> 02:43:51,660
If he just doesn't want to be online anymore that I mean, I guess fair enough

2673
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:55,180
I don't think it was really necessary to delete

2674
02:43:55,900 --> 02:44:02,220
Everything that he deleted and I I think it's a little cringe to delete stuff for no reason and some of that stuff

2675
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:04,140
I feel like was fine

2676
02:44:04,140 --> 02:44:07,900
But at the end of the day, it's it's his stuff and he can do what he wants with it

2677
02:44:08,780 --> 02:44:10,380
Uh

2678
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:11,660
Yeah

2679
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:17,420
Good good good for him. I saw I saw a few people criticizing him on the podium discord where they were saying like

2680
02:44:17,900 --> 02:44:21,660
Oh, it's clear that he's lying about uh, not doing this just because uh,

2681
02:44:22,460 --> 02:44:27,980
It all affects his job prospects in the future. I was like, oh, okay. That's none of your fucking business. Who cares?

2682
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:30,940
I uh

2683
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:33,820
I mean

2684
02:44:33,820 --> 02:44:40,700
Even if that were true, would that not be a great? Yeah, that that would be a great reason. Yeah, exactly. That would be

2685
02:44:41,820 --> 02:44:43,820
That's really weird

2686
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,820
Like like that

2687
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:50,620
If you're like, hey, I want to get a maybe fucking get a job in an industry one day

2688
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:55,420
And like if I have videos of me saying the n-word then I won't be able to get it then like

2689
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:57,180
Yeah

2690
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:59,180
Take your fucking videos down

2691
02:44:59,420 --> 02:45:02,620
Take note pcp voicemailers you dirty people

2692
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:05,420

02:45:05,420 --> 02:45:07,420
Okay, next one is called um

Episode 260 battle scroll scenario explained

2695
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:13,980
Three two one go

Hey, hi, it's your boy Dolos again. Uh, sorry for leaving a second voicemail on the same day. Fuck you ben

2697
02:45:20,220 --> 02:45:20,940

02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:27,180
I'm catching up on the podcast and an episode 260 samurai sama calls talking about him and all the boys and mr

02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:28,060
T shout out to mr

2700
02:45:28,060 --> 02:45:29,100
T

2701
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:35,420
Uh, they're pissed because the the scroll that ben stole from them is battle plans. It's true and ben insinuated and

2702
02:45:35,980 --> 02:45:40,220
In fact blatantly stated that the battle plans were for them to fight each other

2703
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:44,700
No, if you would listen to samurai sama shout out to samurai sama read that scroll

2704
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:50,940
He said the battle scroll was for them as enemies to come together and take over japan with mr

2705
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:51,180
T

2706
02:45:51,180 --> 02:45:52,220
I see

2707
02:45:52,220 --> 02:45:53,740
So, yeah, shout out to mr

2708
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:54,220
T

2709
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:57,740
Fuck you ben tom will never done continuity maintained

2710
02:45:58,460 --> 02:46:01,980
Ben does not fear his nemesis so much that he doesn't even listen to his words

2711
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:05,500
I don't really you know, I have a

2712
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:11,900
Yes, it's the thing sun sue said if you have your enemies battle plans just leave it just don't it's just like

2713
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:18,540
It's just like listen. It's just it's just like listening to the pcp. You know when samurai sama starts talking

2714
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:20,540
I just kind of tune out

2715
02:46:22,700 --> 02:46:24,700
Disrespect at all costs

2716
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:28,860
Next voicemail is called uh

2717
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:33,260
The two three two one go

2718
02:46:33,580 --> 02:46:35,580
Um

2719
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:38,940
By the way, I I was the person that talked about the uh

2720
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:41,660
The weird dug walker interaction

2721
02:46:42,300 --> 02:46:47,260
Um, yeah, I'm not sure if I mentioned this but like the one you saw it at like a tech

2722
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:52,620
Uh a booth for like specifically for autographic things. So it's not like I just

2723
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:55,420
Approached him and was like

2724
02:46:55,900 --> 02:47:00,700
Signed my dollar like he was he was there to sign things. Okay. Well. Yeah in in that case

2725
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:03,980
It can only be that he had a problem with the dollar

2726
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:11,740
So he must have just been like he didn't want to sign a dollar. Yeah, I can't sign at the holler. That's the greatest in the law

2727
02:47:12,460 --> 02:47:17,740
Isn't that illegal and legal tender though? Yeah, that's totally what he needs to use that

2728
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:23,580
Seems like dug seems like dug god bless that sweet sweet man

2729
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:26,460
absolutely

2730
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:31,100
Next voicemail is called ben to-do list three two one go

2731
02:47:32,140 --> 02:47:37,740
All right, ben. It's time to get down to the real shoes the real bids. Please. No play isaac

2732
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:44,300
Okay, they added a few new characters and doubled the characters because they all have alternate versions now

2733
02:47:44,620 --> 02:47:49,820
As well as tons of new content alternate routes new endings all that shebang

2734
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:53,500
Also, please catch up on one piece. Thanks. Yeah, man

2735
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:59,900
I'll probably check out Isaac again. Hey, Ben. Where where where were you last when you were reading one piece?

2736
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:02,940
I was uh

2737
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:04,220
kind of

2738
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:08,060
Early on in wano like I was a little ways into wano. Okay

2739
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:12,780
I would say wait until you hear that wano's over because it's

2740
02:48:13,900 --> 02:48:18,940
We're in the yeah, we're in the thick of it now and captain. It's a little bit like oh fuck reading it

2741
02:48:19,900 --> 02:48:27,180
Oh, like like if I caught up now, I would be on a cliffhanger. No, you'd I don't reckon you'd enjoy the week before that

2742
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:29,180
you'd be in

2743
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:34,380
In no, I don't I don't want there's a lot of action happening and not a lot of plot furthering

2744
02:48:34,620 --> 02:48:39,020
It is a lot of panels of cool shit happening. But there's only so many

2745
02:48:40,060 --> 02:48:42,860
Only so many things you can show in that many pages

2746
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:48,540
We're deep in what is known as clash piece at the moment where it's just every chapter is just the different clash between characters

2747
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:54,460
I mean, I'm I'm really enjoying it. It's cool. But I am if you want to binge it. Maybe after it's finished

2748
02:48:54,780 --> 02:48:56,780
Yeah, yeah

2749
02:48:56,780 --> 02:49:04,140
Yes, I do want to binge it. I'm not interested in getting back into reading weekly. There's some great stuff in wano. So yeah

2750
02:49:05,660 --> 02:49:07,660
Uh, oh, it's incredible

2751
02:49:08,540 --> 02:49:10,540
Hmm

2752
02:49:14,380 --> 02:49:17,340
I do I wish I was caught up, but I don't want to spend the fucking time

2753
02:49:17,420 --> 02:49:22,700
Ben it's got actual trans characters who are actually cool and do things. Isn't that nice? Um

2754
02:49:23,580 --> 02:49:29,420
It already had it already had those had the okama. Yeah, but now it's got like a pretty girl one

2755
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:36,140
Well, that's nice. It's it's still I love I love that for her that character is

2756
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:42,700
Trans or is just a man that looks like a she refers to herself as she she gets everyone else to refer to as yeah

2757
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:49,980
I've always seen her in all in all the ways that that matter. It's yeah. It's a trans character. Talk about kiku not Yamato

2758
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:55,180
I don't know who these people are. Yeah, don't worry. They're lame. They're okay

2759
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:59,340
Uh next

2760
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:02,060
Wait

2761
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:03,580
Wait, what?

2762
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:07,340
That was the bend to do oh wait, I uploaded to okay the next one is 3 180

2763
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:13,900
Okay, uh, the this one is why the Ralph thing makes no sense three two one go

2764
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:19,500
The the Ralph video was not uploaded like to start a fight and to get clout

2765
02:50:19,740 --> 02:50:26,140
The Ralph video was uploaded out of spite because it's motivated by fucking Trixie not by uh by fox's face

2766
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:31,980
Vizier dickhead, uh, it's motivated by Trixie because it's spite at uh fucking may and Ralph

2767
02:50:32,140 --> 02:50:37,180
That's why that video went up. It has nothing to do with fucking money at all. That's just like why can't it be both?

2768
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:42,860
A neat side effect that was completely like a missed opportunity for them to fucking get clout with it

2769
02:50:42,860 --> 02:50:47,580
But no that I don't I don't I don't these are all good relationships fight bullshit

2770
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:54,380
That's why it went up on the fucking channel to the fucking piss me off. That's the only reason why I I don't think you're right

2771
02:50:54,620 --> 02:50:57,340
I think that might be a reason. I think it's absolutely both

2772
02:50:57,340 --> 02:50:58,860
I

2773
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:03,980
Yeah, I think it's both and probably hundreds of all reasons of insanity that we we can't comprehend

2774
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:07,020
Probably yeah, yeah

2775
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:09,100
Sorry sucker, but you're

2776
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:11,100
You fuck you

2777
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:15,420
Sorry, you're a fucker. I rhymed it. Sorry. We've decided that you're wrong with no evidence

2778
02:51:15,740 --> 02:51:17,500
clarification

2779
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:23,020
We we know what those guys were thinking. You don't know shit

2780
02:51:23,980 --> 02:51:30,140
Oh shit, I posted another one whatever next one is a three one eight one. It is uh the deepest lore

2781
02:51:30,620 --> 02:51:32,620
Three two one go

2782
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:39,900
I want to hear the fucking Tobuscus deep lore somebody should figure that shit out because like quentin reviews already did

2783
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:45,900
I don't fucking know who that guy is. He would brag about it on like his channel. Sometimes I don't know anything about

2784
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:52,620
Players and shit like that. So there has to be this some like that guy with the glasses pro jared game

2785
02:51:52,780 --> 02:51:56,940
Yes, like style. Yes, like deep lore quentin reviews story about this person

2786
02:51:57,260 --> 02:52:02,060
And I've never heard it told from a like reputable source before so it's got to be out there somewhere

2787
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:04,460
Yes, someone figure it out. It'll be funny

2788
02:52:07,100 --> 02:52:13,740
If you had type if you had typed that into fucking youtube I think you would have come up if you typed Tobuscus drama

2789
02:52:14,060 --> 02:52:18,620
If you took Tobuscus drama or history or something like that, then fucking you'd have it

2790
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:23,580
There's probably more. Yeah, there's probably plenty more videos that I haven't seen. I've just seen the the quentin

2791
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:28,300
I know who I made a funny scorum song whatever and he was a sex pervert

2792
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:31,420
I had only I had only heard the name

2793
02:52:32,380 --> 02:52:37,340
I had never heard I isn't tabuscus is the diamond sword sword sword sword is that that guy?

2794
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:42,860
I know that from munchie knowing that song. I had never heard the chicken in a biscuit song

2795
02:52:44,460 --> 02:52:46,460
Before I found out

2796
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:49,740
I watched that quentin video and I was like, okay

2797
02:52:50,700 --> 02:52:51,660
uh

2798
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:53,020
Yeah

2799
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:57,340
Do you see a sex pet? I don't even I don't even remember I watched that video. I don't remember anything from it

2800
02:52:57,420 --> 02:53:02,380
He was like an emotional abuser and sex pest and all that all the easy hard like nasty stuff

2801
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:05,340
Nice nice

2802
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:08,700
Groomer was he a groomer? No, I don't think so. I think it was all over

2803
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:10,700
All right

2804
02:53:10,700 --> 02:53:15,500
Well, no, dude that makes him a fucking that makes him a hero in my eyes

2805
02:53:16,140 --> 02:53:17,740
Fuck yeah, dude

2806
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:23,500
He's cleared but he's cleared the bar. He's clean. He is so much better than his contemporaries

2807
02:53:24,780 --> 02:53:26,780
uh

2808
02:53:27,020 --> 02:53:35,020
Next voicemail is called uh taking it too far three two one go

Hey, Ben. Hey, Gib. Hey, uh

2810
02:53:39,580 --> 02:53:41,580
God this tome's still alive even

2811
02:53:41,740 --> 02:53:46,220
I was wondering what you guys thought about the fact that games journalists like I don't know what you mean

2812
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:51,820
I could talk you are being more supportive of the palestinians in the ongoing genocide against them

2813
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:57,020
Than our own fucking government who barely even spoke out about the fact that the Associated Press was

2814
02:53:57,580 --> 02:53:59,580
Hit by a fucking missile

2815
02:54:00,060 --> 02:54:01,580
Earlier today

2816
02:54:01,580 --> 02:54:03,580
Anyway, uh free Palestine

2817
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:07,020
I

2818
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:19,580
I

2819
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:21,500
I

2820
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:24,060
I'm glad I'm glad you liked

2821
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:29,100
I'm glad you liked when I trolled chris with the slime and punishment

2822
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:31,420
uh

2823
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:36,140
I believe I believe that the slime and punishment finale that the game

2824
02:54:37,340 --> 02:54:40,540
The game will be the ultimate act of trolling chris

2825
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:47,580
Uh by by making uh mind-blowing mind-blowingly high effort content

2826
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:49,820
Uh

2827
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:53,420
So look look forward to that that that's coming

2828
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:56,780
Uh other than that, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about

2829
02:54:57,260 --> 02:55:02,380
You remember you remember in sonnet you 101 when you said that you follow the prime directive when it comes to christian

2830
02:55:03,740 --> 02:55:09,420
Ben you said that one thing the one time and you didn't do it

2831
02:55:10,140 --> 02:55:13,980
That's not what I sound like. That's not what I sound like in you know, that's what you fucking sound like

2832
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:19,580
Everyone says oh ben ben used to be cool, you know

2833
02:55:20,060 --> 02:55:24,780
I want I want so bad for all those racist fucks on kiwi farms to like me

2834
02:55:24,780 --> 02:55:31,100
But then they say oh ben said he follows the prime directive, but then he didn't and I and I and I cry I cry

2835
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:33,180
I've lost their esteem

2836
02:55:34,380 --> 02:55:36,780
Damn, so what you're saying is you're a liar

2837
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:39,100
I am

2838
02:55:39,100 --> 02:55:41,580
I am a liar. Okay. That's right

2839
02:55:45,900 --> 02:55:47,660
Yeah, okay

2840
02:55:47,660 --> 02:55:54,700
Shit the next one's the last one. Oh really wait. I think so. Yeah. Yep. Okay. This is this is the last one

2841
02:55:54,780 --> 02:55:56,780

2842
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:59,180
three two one go

2843
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:08,060
So I noticed that uh, there's a certain number of people left on the pcp that are uh

2844
02:56:09,260 --> 02:56:11,260
Very talented artists false

2845
02:56:12,460 --> 02:56:14,460
Maybe we could bring back a certain

2846
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:17,660
draw cast

2847
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:21,020
Wink wink kiss kiss

2848
02:56:21,180 --> 02:56:23,180
Oh my god

2849
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:26,700
I mean, I guess there's no reason why we couldn't you know, it's funny we

2850
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:28,940
Yeah

2851
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:33,420
That we made that quick draw server because we wanted to branch off from the pcp and

2852
02:56:33,980 --> 02:56:41,020
And make it our own thing but munchie. Yeah, mostly spearheading that and now munchie has left that and um, yeah

2853
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:43,980
We can do what we like with it. So we could that was a munch. That was a

2854
02:56:45,340 --> 02:56:50,940
Yeah, that was the quick draw saloon was like a munchie thing and then munchie's gone. So

2855
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:55,340
It's whatever. Yeah, and he's been gone. It's a great server still

2856
02:56:55,900 --> 02:57:01,660
We have lots of cool artisans. So, you know, I haven't just we could just like have that server and then make the show and put it on

2857
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:03,180
the pcp channel

2858
02:57:03,180 --> 02:57:04,540
I guess

2859
02:57:04,540 --> 02:57:09,980
