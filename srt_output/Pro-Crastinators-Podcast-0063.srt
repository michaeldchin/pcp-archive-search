1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
If you're interested in changing your gender, then you are considered a transgender person.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
That means you are either biologically a man who identifies as a woman, or a biologically

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,800
born woman who self identifies as a man. Some transgender people have expressed

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,680
feeling uncomfortable with their biological body. For example, a biological woman wishing

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
she didn't have breasts. Reading and hearing about the experience of transgender people

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,760
might connect with you or help you understand your own internal feeling. Some transgender

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
people have felt like they were transgender as far back as they can remember. Others

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,360
started identifying as transgender later in life.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,760
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,560
an intimate small session today with me, your favorite guy, the best guy ever, and Mumkey Jones.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,880
Hey, finally an episode where I can actually say I respect all of the cast members of the podcast.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,400
I wouldn't go that far myself. And also, Endless Jess is here.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,880
The only episode where I can say I respect one member of the podcast.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Congratulations, Nate. You did it.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,760
I did it, guys. I did it. Well, and that's it, everybody. That's it. Just the three of us today.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,880
Everybody else is off doing more important things. We're left in the trenches to carry

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,840
the sink and ship as far as we can. I was going to say with the three amigos,

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,800
but based on this topic, we might be the three of me guzz.

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,800
Impressive. You're welcome.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,280
And if you can tell from that extremely cryptic hint, we're talking about gender swapping today.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,880
Gender swapping. You can only refer to me as my new name on this episode, Estrogen Jess.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,720
Good. Okay, I'll be Mumket, I think, is what we decided.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,320
Yep, that's a good one. And I'm going to be Best Gal Ever, which is short for Best Gal

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,560
Godot Ever, because I identify as killing two Palestinian children in the Israeli defense

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,280
force. There you go. The one true meme has returned. The only funny joke from that overly

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,440
long, terrible Marvel DC podcast. Yeah, but it won't really hit. I won't really fucking hit.

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,800
Munchie did it again. Okay, let's fucking get into it, I guess.

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,720
Speaking of Mumket, remember when the Alvin and the Chipmunks, they had the Chimpettes,

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
and they were like, yeah, I do.

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,720
This is where we're going. Just the excess pre-edit side, when I mentioned the Chimpettes.

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
That's all I need to say. That's all you need to say about the Chimpettes.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
The only good thing about that film franchise was that Jason Lee played the main guy, and then

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
in the second movie, he was like in the hospital the whole time. They wrote him out of the movie,

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
but not for the first 10 minutes, and I don't know why they made that choice.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,520
Maybe they just only had so much money to pay for his time.

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,160
Yeah, because Jason Lee is so fucking expensive. The guy from My Name Is Earl is a hot ticket in

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Hollywood. No wonder they called the squeakwell, because without Jason Lee, it's just a tepid

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,800
little fart of a movie squeaking through the butt cheeks of Hollywood's tight sphincter,

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,160
too tight to dish out that money for Jason Lee.

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:23,360
So this topic is so shit that I could find nothing related to it on Urban Dictionary.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,920
Like, I tried searching gender-bending, gender-swapping. Let's just read gender.

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,720
Isn't it rule 63? Is the internet rule about gender-swapping?

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,400
That's true. That's true. Okay, let's see. Okay, rule 63. All right, that works.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Rule 63 is a rule of the internet that reads as follows. For any given male character,

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,440
there is a female version of that character. This rule's exceptions are only in-oh,

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,320
this is fucking-who gives a shit for whatever. Only in the instance that A,

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,640
the male character is already so androgynous that a female version would be basically the same,

48
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,840
or B, the female version hasn't been drawn yet. Well, why would you even write that?

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,440
Just fucking-this is shit. This is terrible. This is absolute garbage.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Hey, so the chimp bets, those Alvin and the chipmunk girls, they remind me.

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,480
What they remind me of is how incredibly hot female versions of characters that you already

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,880
like are. That's what you guys agree. I'll buy this premise. That's true. Would you say it?

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,680
I mean, like when I see a female version of Kymina, for example, I find that extremely arousing.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
Oh yeah, like the girl from that cosplay girl who yelled at you. That's the hottest

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,760
comment I've ever seen. She's great, dude. 10 out of 10. It's because you got all the great

56
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,640
things about a character, but then you also can sex them now, which is just great.

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Which is just great. It works the other way as well, I guess. If you've got a cool female

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,120
character, that's nice. But when you gender swap them, you can project all the things you like

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,960
about them from their, I guess, female version. And then also, now they can be-they can drive well.

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,560
Now they can drive-got them. I've got to say, when me and Mage did our Naru cast,

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,520
she drew a picture of me as Naruto and her as Sasuke. So we have this female Sasuke.

62
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,760
It's pretty much Sasuke with purple hair and tits. And like you're saying with the chimp

63
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,960
bets, I jerked off to that picture Mage drew probably 30 times in one day. It's just-it makes

64
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,160
the character so much hotter. I agree. Well, okay. That's one-

65
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,400
The podcast, everyone. We'll be collecting our fat three-person check now. Goodbye.

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
That's one facet thoroughly explored. This is what happens when you got three people. Okay,

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
but here we go. There's another facet, and it's the personally gender swapping thing, right?

68
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,240
So there's wanting to be the little girl, as it were. The Digi Bro complex.

69
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Yeah. Yeah. Which, can you say why Digi's not on this episode? Because I imagine a lot of people

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,360
in the comments are angry that of this topic, of all topics, Digi should be here.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah, that's true. Here's what happened. So we said, hey, Digi, do you want to come on?

72
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,800
He said, fuck you guys. Fuck the PCP. I'm too big for that shit. I have 300,000 subs now.

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
You're all beneath me. And that's why he's gone on. Did he cross that? Did he get the 300,000 now?

74
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,000
By the time this is out, he probably will. Okay, well, Greg, congrats, Digi, congrats.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,280
Also, we hope to Voo. I hope to Voo would be here too, but he's busy as well. So this is what

76
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:46,560
you left with folks. Enjoy. The table scraps of the PCP. So I want to be the little girl.

77
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,640
And by that, I mean, I would definitely, I see a lot of perks. There's obviously some negatives,

78
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:01,040
but I see a lot of perks in being a sexy girl. I do have friends though, because if I was a girl,

79
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,480
you'd know I'd be a 10 out of 10 goddess, of course. It's a given. It's just a mirror image of

80
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,360
yourself, but with tits. That's right. That's right. So there's a lot of good things about that.

81
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
I guess I'm making, I'm taking this literally, I'm taking this like real, like if I was just

82
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,800
suddenly a girl in society, there's a lot of good things about being a girl, but there's

83
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
definitely some negatives. For example, wait, wait, time out. There's negatives to being a girl

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,520
in society. I don't think that holds any water, Nate. Name one. Well, I've got a friend who...

85
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,760
Okay, too far. Again, you're saying crazy things. I know. I've got a friend who's super hot and she

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,960
works in like customer service and just like, she was just telling me the other day, all the time

87
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,760
people will come up to her like, you know, men and they will, you know, want to have sex with her.

88
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,920
So what that manifests as... What a tragic life she must live. Being attractive.

89
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Well, imagine if all the dregs of society kept coming up to you with the clear intention of

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,800
wanting to fuck you and it's like, yeah, okay, cool. Appreciate the compliment, but...

91
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Not to get off on a gender dynamics tangent here. I think it's unavoidable, but I mean,

92
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,640
what the hell else are we going to talk about on this shitty fucking topic?

93
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,800
You know, I get that complaint of like why women would feel objectified and feel shitty if like

94
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
just like you said, the dregs of society are always wanting to fuck them. But like,

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,480
from my point of view, it's the same thing, except the dregs of society always want to

96
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,720
fight me. So what's really worse? Well, like people's dads. Yeah, like people's dads.

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Uh, yeah, that's true. That's true. Can we talk about that for a second,

98
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,680
that Jess is trying to fight every dad on earth? Yeah, I'm making that a... I'm gonna make it a

99
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,000
patron reward tier for a certain amount. I will fight your dad. I will... I'll fly out. I will

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
have a real fight. It'll be on YouTube and everything. You're gonna go to them. They don't

101
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,200
even come to you. Yeah, it's gonna have to be a high reward tier because I'm gonna need a lot of

102
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,240
money to pay for these endeavors, but it'll be worth it. If I can... If I can go down in history

103
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,680
as like the YouTube guy who fights dads, that's a good legacy. This is great. Munchie goes out

104
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,680
and captures them, you know, sets them up and then you fight them, you know. He sex them up and

105
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,240
you knock them down. There you go. I think this is the first feature film in the PCP Cinematic

106
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,360
Universe is that instead of Rocky, it's called Daddy, where Jess just beats up people's dads.

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Endless Jess versus the dads. Yeah, yeah. Okay, well...

108
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
Instead of the kid catcher in Chitty Chitty Bing Bing, Munchie is the dad catcher.

109
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,400
Of course. Is that a reference that's lost on this generation?

110
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,640
By the way, I do want to say about that, about what you're saying here about the being annoyed

111
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
by the dregs, I'd be like being objectified. I mean, I'm sure that's annoying for women to

112
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,520
be objectified by people, but even putting that aside, even if you're not objectified,

113
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,520
I'm just saying just the fact that people ever come up to you at all and, you know,

114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,280
it tried to talk to you like people are boring and they're gay and I don't want to hear from them

115
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,440
ever. So just on that level, just on that level, like, yeah, you know, there are definitely advantages

116
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
to being women, but that's definitely something that would annoy me because as a man, no one in

117
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,720
my life has ever approached me with any proposition of any kind. Nobody gives a fuck about me.

118
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:35,040
No, as a man, I just constantly get approached with hostility and mockery all day everywhere I go.

119
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,160
Like women complain about catcalling, like, hey, you're hot and you're pretty and I want to fuck

120
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,360
you. Like, yeah, that would be annoying. But I walk outside every day and I also get people catcalling,

121
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,240
except they're saying like, hey, faggot, out of a moving car and like, fuck you buddy, screw you.

122
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,120
And it's like, that's way worse. Well, when you walk around in your your brony t-shirts, Jesse,

123
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,040
a little bit of that is to be expected. I do not know. I do not dress provocatively. I dress as

124
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,680
like I try to like hide my my my strength as much as I can. I wear like overcoats, like a

125
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,080
teenage mutant ninja turtle, like I hide my fucking shell when I go out wearing wearing a turtle mask.

126
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,920
That's why, dude. I like that Nate is suggesting that Jess was asking for it based on what he was wearing.

127
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,800
That's exactly right. Hey, how could you fucking fascist. Nate is that guy who's driving by in like

128
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,040
cars with open windows going, hey, faggot, fuck you. I got that horn that's

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,640
Oh my god. It annoys me so much. It happens to me every time I go out. It's like, I really do dress

130
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,000
like as normal as possible to try and avoid people looking at me. Like I wear like a baseball cap and

131
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
like just a regular t-shirt and jeans and guys will like yell shot. And like, I get so mad when

132
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,960
people fuck with me that like, I will fucking go out into the middle of the street as they're like

133
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,080
peeling away and like, like called Drogo like stomping around like, the fucking most fucking

134
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,520
the fucking shotgun. I'll fucking fight all you. I'm like fighting random cars that have nothing to

135
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,480
do with it. I'm jumping in. I'm jumping through other people's windows and like driving after them

136
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,800
and a whole chase breaks out. It's an adventure every time. You know, that's interesting, Jesse,

137
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,160
but I have to say I have never been in any kind of serious fight in my life, nor have I ever even

138
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
been close to that level. So I just wonder, do you think it might have something to do with

139
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,440
your aura or perhaps just the place you live? Perhaps that place is just more hostile than the

140
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,880
world that I grew up in and existed now. I think I'm just too, I'm just too handsome and strong.

141
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,920
People hate me for it. The world can't handle this. You know, there was a, in part six of JoJo,

142
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,640
there was a particular stand called survivor and its unique ability was really shit. Nobody liked

143
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,640
it, but its power was that it made everyone around it a little more on edge, just a little more

144
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,320
pissed off than they were normally. And what happened was like during the part where like

145
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
that thing was going around, like everyone in this entire jail where the thing took place,

146
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,840
they all started fighting because they were all just a little bit pissed off and then someone

147
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,160
did something and then they all had a massive fight and it's a huge riot inside the jail.

148
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,200
And I think that might be you, my friend. You might have, you might have some sort of superpower

149
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,240
here. Yeah, I might. I definitely do. I definitely get people to a certain point somehow without

150
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,960
without doing anything. Have you guys ever done any sort of drive by cat call either to a man

151
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,320
or a woman just yelling something at somebody on the street as you drive by?

152
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,960
I've never done anything like that though. I have done, you know, numerous like more like

153
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,680
approaches, you know, and shit in my, in my heyday. Well, I don't mean like hitting on somebody.

154
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
Like the example I wanted to give was that back when I lived in Iowa, my friend Biggs,

155
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,400
the only thing you would ever yell at people as we drove by them, they'll be walking on the

156
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,520
sidewalk and he'll just yell, get a car! And that's it. Over and over again to these lowly creatures

157
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,680
without people. We don't know if they don't have a car. They're just walking. So that's what I

158
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,640
guess he strongly disapproves this. Well, I've never, I've never cat called anybody. I don't think.

159
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,040
I feel ashamed. I should have cat called somebody by now. I should do it. I should go out and say,

160
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,720
hey baby, give me that pussy! You know, one of those. Does it work? One of those, yeah. I mean,

161
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
of course, why do men keep doing it? Because it gets results, right? I would assume that's the case.

162
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
No, what we need is a wingman. So you got to drive and you got to like be holding action giraffe

163
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,640
out the other window like, hey baby, I got AIDS! I got AIDS! But this guy doesn't over here and then

164
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,160
he comes to you. I look like a hero by comparison. I look like a real catch. That's true. That's

165
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,840
true. Or just a guy to, just to like, you know, be the guy in the dark alley where the lady turns

166
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,360
down and like, she's like, hey baby, I'm gonna get in that. I'm gonna get in that now. And she's

167
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,840
like, no, please. And then I come in and I beat up my friend and then I take her home and we do the

168
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:09,520
sex. That's a pretty solid plan. Wait, you want to be like an alley man? Yeah, I want to be an alley

169
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,080
man. My goal in life is to be like the mugger at the beginning of the superhero movie who gets

170
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,760
beat up by the hero first, before he has to fight the supervillain. Oh my god, you know what?

171
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,320
That reminds me of, this is sort of relevant to what we're talking about, what are the greatest

172
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,040
moments in all of anime, of all time, is from, it's called like, something something Nietzsche Joe,

173
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,360
it's not Nietzsche Joe, it's like the high school boy version, it's got like a longer name, it's like

174
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,320
boys, something Nietzsche Joe, everyday lives of high school boys. So there's a moment in that,

175
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,120
in that fucking manga, sorry, anime, where, so like, there's just like a bunch of dudes,

176
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,840
like a bunch of Japanese high school kids are just hanging out in an alley. And they're just like,

177
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,440
they're like talking about like homework or like science, like they're being like responsible,

178
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,440
mature students. And then all of a sudden, like a girl walks in, right, like a girl walks in and

179
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,240
she sees these three like, slightly rough looking dudes hanging out at this alley. And she's just

180
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,400
like, she steps down, she doesn't notice them, she sees them and she's like, oh, uh, uh, uh,

181
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,680
and they're just like, what are you doing here? And like, they're not, they're just like, hey,

182
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,240
what's going on? Like, what's up? But she's like spooked just because she didn't know what she was

183
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,400
walking into. Then all of a sudden, like another dude walks into the alley, like and sees the

184
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,920
situation, he sees like this girl spooked by three guys. And she said, and he says to it like,

185
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,800
he assesses the situation. And he's just like, I know what I have to fucking do. He steps up and

186
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,080
he's like, Hey, you three ruffians, quit hassling this lady. And all of a sudden these three guys

187
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,280
who were just like super willing, they were just going to like help her get directions or like

188
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,280
guide her out of there or whatever. They just look at each other and they know what they have to do.

189
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,840
They're like, Hey, man, fuck off. We were going to play with that bitch. She was going to be ours.

190
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,160
We were just going to have a little fun. And they all began aggressing towards the guy. And so

191
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,760
the guy is just like, Yes, this is my chance. He proceeds to beat them up as they allow him to

192
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,080
beat them all up. And they're just like, Yes, this is what we have to do. They allow themselves to

193
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,560
be beaten up. And then the lady is like, Oh my God, thank you so much for saving from those ruffians

194
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,640
as the dude like escorts throughout like, haha, I'm the fucking hero. And the guys just get up,

195
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,280
they nod each other like, Yep, we did it, man. We really, we were, we were what society needed

196
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,240
today. That's really inspirational. I want to do that. I want to set up a fucking heroes like a

197
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:34,240
like a like a slip and jimmy wingman scam where I can pretend to be a rape boy. And if the plan

198
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,560
goes wrong, I just accidentally end up raping the girl because the guy didn't get there in time.

199
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,840
Where were you? You gotta commit. You made me you made me a bad boy.

200
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,040
Okay, so we've talking about how great it is to commit rape. But let's talk a little bit more

201
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,280
about how great it is to be raped. Well, we need to backtrack Nate, because we were listing all

202
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,040
the negatives of being a woman and the things you would face and we lost in the catcalling world.

203
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,200
So what are the other disadvantages? Okay, well, there's a real okay, this is a real thing, right?

204
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,800
Women are right because we just talked about that. Well, not really, but like women are objectively

205
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,880
on the whole, not every single person, but they're generally weaker than men. So when you got a woman

206
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
walking outside alone, and like you're just doing whatever, you know, you're just walking home or

207
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,920
whatever. And I feel the same fear whenever I'm walking out alone, I'm like, Oh, God, everyone's

208
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,360
going to fucking murder me. But when you see just like any person, you know, there is a pretty good

209
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,400
chance that they are stronger than you and could overpower you. There's at least a 50% chance,

210
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,760
because you know, men or whatever. And if you know it's a man, then you know this guy could be you.

211
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,120
So like, in that situation, if you're like unprepared, you don't have anything to defend

212
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,680
yourself with, like that person could push your shit in if they wanted to. And I don't know about

213
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,440
you guys, but I don't trust anyone ever. Whenever I see a cop, I assume he wants to kill me. I assume

214
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,360
he wants me dead. So I will just do whatever the fuck he, yeah, serial killers, like just just as a

215
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,880
cop has like infinitely or you know, a more than enough advantage over me to kill me if he wants to,

216
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,160
because he has a gun, like to a woman, most men just have that advantage, because they generally

217
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,480
are just stronger. They could take you down if they felt like it. So just like, it's a little

218
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,560
bit spooky, you know, being a woman out there, just, just being out there doing whatever you

219
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,480
want. So like, I, my female friends will generally tell me like, and I've had some people, I know

220
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,520
I've had some bad stories with this shit, they'll just be out walking. And they're scared, because

221
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,480
they don't want to die. They don't want to get raped. They don't want bad shit to happen to them.

222
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
So just on a physical level, you know, that's a disadvantage, not to mention the fact that of

223
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,000
course women have a vagina, which is a desired thing by most men. So like, it's like a guy walking

224
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,960
around, has nothing to offer, like there's no reason to like be women have those. I've been

225
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:59,440
looking in the wrong places. Women. Yeah. So like, it's like women like have a diamond whenever

226
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,680
they're walking outside that every man really wants. And like, if a guy is pushed over the edge,

227
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,600
he might go for it. You know, it just, and I'm not trying to say men are demons or anything.

228
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,600
It's just like, I don't trust anyone. I have no faith that anyone will do the right thing at any

229
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,360
point. And so I totally feel why women are spooked by this shit. All right, Nate, I got the ultimate

230
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,840
solution for this problem. If we become women, here's what we should do. It's a new invention.

231
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,720
You might have heard of it. It's called the gun. You get one of these bad boys, and you're stronger

232
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,960
than anybody else because then you just shoot them. Yeah. That's true. That's true. But you keep

233
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,160
using the word spook to describe women who are about to get raped. Like a rapist comes out,

234
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,600
and they just do the standing in place scooby-doo run before they fucking flip the book top.

235
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,600
You're oversimplifying the spectrum of spook right now because there's,

236
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
it's really a spectrum. It's really a spectrum. Jess, I got a question for you.

237
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,480
We know you can beat up any dad on earth. And on the subject of female physicality, I want to know.

238
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
Who wins in a fight? Endless Jess or Ronda Rousey?

239
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,280
I'm gonna have to say Endless Jess. Oh, fucking shit. I'm surprised. What's your case there,

240
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,840
dude? She wants fucking kill you. Bullshit. Shut up. I'm just sick of that fucking,

241
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,160
that like, that any woman in any sport could beat any regular man ever. It's all bullshit.

242
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,640
You take the fucking, you take fucking the black widow from the Avengers and a regular

243
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,160
fat guy off of from like a video store and the guy from the video store will win every time.

244
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,840
I hate movies. I hate fucking this. Just people just wanking themselves off about strong women.

245
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:54,560
It's fake. There's no such thing. Fuck Ronda Rousey. You can take the world's most honorable

246
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,480
Bushido woman. You know, she's got her katana. It has been folded 20,000 times. So she's 20 times

247
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,960
stronger. Jesus Christ. And all I do is I say hold, I put on 250 pounds. I become a fat piece

248
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,560
of shit. I say hold my beer, bitch. And then I've won. I have defeated her. I have defeated her. Yes.

249
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:23,200
Okay. You know what pisses me off? Like if a guy did fight Ronda Rousey and he won,

250
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,560
he'd get no credit. They just like dismiss it as beating a woman. But if he lost, that's true.

251
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,680
He'd be even doubly mocked for it like, oh, you lost to a woman. So which is it? Is she on an

252
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,960
equal playing field or not? Well, she has a disadvantage, you know, there's a disadvantage.

253
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,080
Nate, have you listened to biggest problem in the universe? I know Jesse was only seven episodes of

254
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,000
me to finish it. Was there one of the episodes or was this a different podcast where they talked

255
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,920
about like a trans woman. So like a guy who becomes a woman was in mixed martial arts and he

256
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,080
like won a tournament and how that was bullshit. So that's, is that kind of the same thing?

257
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,920
Yes, it's related. It's like the practical way to achieve this. Okay, so the practical way to beat

258
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,480
up women and still get credit for it. Hey, wait a minute. Go to think of it. Why am I fighting

259
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,840
Ronda Rousey? The deal was that I would fight Ronda Rousey's decrepit father. That was my thing

260
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,040
from the beginning. Well, yeah, I mean, Frank, you probably have a bigger trouble with her body.

261
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,960
Jess versus Frank Rousey.

262
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,240
Well, okay, so on that topic, because I always thought that was interesting. So, okay, so like

263
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,000
there's, what is in fact the difference between men and women physically, right? So there's,

264
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,800
there's a bunch of stuff. There's like hormones, the presence of testosterone. More like the

265
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,400
building muscle. Oh, you nailed it, dude. You nailed it. There's like bone density differences.

266
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,640
Obviously, there's like, there's anatomical differences, right? That's real shit. That's

267
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,400
real shit. So, so right now we know that we're not looking at the same thing. So if a man wants

268
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,080
to compete with women and say that it's totally even, like he's got no advantages,

269
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,520
like what we would say now, what they do now is like they have them going like hormone therapy,

270
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,160
right? To even the playing field. So they, they haven't taken estrogen and shit and, and

271
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,440
don't take testosterone. Are you talking about the transgender AMA fighter or MMA fighter?

272
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I don't think it goes on hormones to even the playing

273
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,400
field. It's because he wants to get a woman's body. It doesn't have to do with his job.

274
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,960
Well, but if we were trying to make it fair, you would have to do something to address the real

275
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
differences just from there. If we wanted to make it fair, we'd say you don't get to do this because

276
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,320
you were born a man. Okay, but there might be a way. Go fight in the men's league.

277
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,560
Yeah. I mean, it's okay. So with this point, we got a couple of categories now. So you've got

278
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,360
men who are just men. You got women who are just women. But then there's, I mean, there's some

279
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
clear gray area here. If you're going to be transitioning or whatever, there's, there's

280
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,960
got to be a way to account for that difference. Well, what it is, there should be a tranny

281
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,200
league. Well, like it's, it's, it works like Pokemon. There's three stages. Like you go from

282
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,360
like a man into a trans woman. And then with the help of a thunderstorm, you become just a woman.

283
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
Yeah, it makes sense. Why a thunderstorm?

284
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,600
Um, I don't know what a moonstone make more sense. I think so.

285
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,160
A moonstone. Well, if you're trying to become a man, uh, yeah, you need a thunderstorm to become

286
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,120
a man so you can become Chad Thundercock. Right. Yeah. That's the one. That's the one.

287
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,800
Have you guys been seeing these memes incidentally recently that have been poking them and popping

288
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,640
up of like, uh, how like the virgin stands versus how the Chad stands or how they sit?

289
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,280
Yes, it turns out I'm a virgin. I don't know, whatever. I fucking love them. Chad is my hero.

290
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,760
Uh, but anyway. Oh, we'll get into that later when we talk about if we were women.

291
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,080
Oh yeah. That's exciting. That's exciting. Um, I don't know. Uh, that's, that's been addressed,

292
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,280
I guess. Oh, it's, it's crazy, man. I don't know. Uh, like we could talk about like, so,

293
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,360
so if you're actually transitioning from a man to woman IRL, uh, it's, it's complex. You know,

294
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,520
you would have to really restructure your whole fucking anatomy and like your bone structure

295
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,760
and you have to install a vagina, which I think they do now at least to some degree. Yeah, they do.

296
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:28,080
Um, but, but, but, uh, Caitlyn Jenner still is a penis. Just, um, just throwing that out there.

297
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,720
What do you think about that, monkey? What does that put her on the? I think that's,

298
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:38,000
that's none of your business, what Caitlyn Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner? Yeah.

299
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I just want to say though, what is my business is what pronoun I'm forced to use for someone,

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,960
that if they're going to tell me I have to refer to someone some way, then it becomes my business

301
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,040
what, what they are forcing me to do. And, um, I'm just, is it insensitive to say like,

302
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,960
you know, if you're going to make me say he or she or whatever, like, let's see some documentation.

303
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,560
Let's see some proof that, uh, you know, I just don't like being forced to do something on the

304
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,200
other person's word, because I don't, as I've said, I'm consistent on this. I don't trust anyone.

305
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,160
Uh, if you just look like a woman, if I saw Caitlyn Jenner on the street,

306
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,440
would absolutely call her female because she looks that way. No problem with that at all.

307
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,360
But if somebody who looks male comes up to me and just says, hey, call me she, call me whatever,

308
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,080
then I don't think it's crazy to say like, okay, uh, but why though? Like what's,

309
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,960
what's, what's the situation here, dude? What am I, what am I looking at here? What are we

310
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,320
dealing with? Here's an example of this that happened to me recently. Uh, as we've discussed

311
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,200
in the previous couple episodes of this show, there is a recent, uh, the, the Tranny Phantom

312
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,840
massacre that the guy, Randy Stair, who shot up the thing, he wanted to join Embers Ghost Squad,

313
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,400
but Randy is, or was transgender. So my friend, Bedhead Bernie, love him to death, but I think he,

314
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,840
he made a tactical error on this. He wrote up a script about the, the, the whole thing

315
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,600
and I had to narrate it. And when we referred, or when he referred to Randy in the script,

316
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,120
he would use they, them pronouns, which is very confusing because we're talking about one person.

317
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,160
So the comments were just, it was a firestorm of who the fuck is they, uh, and like, why are you

318
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,280
respecting the preferred pronouns of a, of a mass shooter? Like, why would you do that?

319
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,720
That's a tough one. That's a tough one. I think a lot of, okay, now finish your point.

320
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,960
Well, yeah. So like Bernie's, Bernie said he wanted to do it professionally because he's making all

321
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,800
these videos for his portfolio so we can get into college and all this shit. But like in that case,

322
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,960
fuck Randy Stair. Fuck their preferred pronouns. I don't care what you think you are. You think

323
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,080
you're a fucking ghost. I don't give a shit. Randy's a guy.

324
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,560
That's like an ethical quandary, like, um, yeah, like, uh, how like it's our generations

325
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,160
crucible to decide like what bathrooms, uh, trans people should use. It's like our generations

326
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,920
crucible to decide should you respect the pronouns of a killer. You know what that reminds me of?

327
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Should you like not punch Nazis is another question on the table for our generation.

328
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
That's a big thing happening right now. Okay. But, but that aside, you know, okay,

329
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,840
just I think like any trans activist or whatever, any person in the know would probably argue that

330
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,600
like, okay, yes, this guy is a bad person. You know, he could kill people. It's objectively wrong.

331
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,600
But like, I think what they would say is like, we should segregate, uh, to use the inappropriate

332
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,640
word separate, but equal. We should. Okay. We should separate like a person's like gender

333
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,360
identity from any crimes they commit. And we shouldn't lump in like their, their murderous

334
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,920
tendency, mental illness shit with their gender fluidity or confusion. Uh, that's probably the

335
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,800
case they would make. What do you, what do you think about that? I think I'm still thinking

336
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,880
about Ronda Rousey and how much. When she fucking, when she comes on like a talk show

337
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,520
and like, like Conan O'Brien or, or whatever, or like Jimmy Kimmel, whatever, like,

338
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,240
loser talk show host will like pretend to be like afraid of her. Like, oh, Ronda Rousey is

339
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,920
going to beat me up. Come on, Conan, you're like six foot five. What are you doing? What are you,

340
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,160
all right? I was, I was joking before, but Ronda Rousey would definitely beat your ass and would

341
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,240
definitely beat most men's ass. Like I was just kidding before. She would easily. I don't believe

342
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,280
you. I don't care what anyone says. She's a trained killer. She's a trained killer, dude. She will

343
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,120
fucking kill you. I'm a self-trained killer. I've been shadowboxing for 20 years like fucking

344
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,080
old boy. What the hell is shadowboxing? I've been killing on the streets of fucking,

345
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,280
probably. Like Jess, I get that you're strong, but she has, she knows how to fight.

346
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,120
If it works for old boy, it works for me. That's how I approach every situation in life.

347
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,560
You don't get a hammer in this fight. Hey, you know, on this issue of gender identity,

348
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,440
I did want to say though that. Look, if I can't beat Ronda Rousey, then at least Conan O'Brien

349
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,080
could definitely beat her. Conan O'Brien's like 10 feet tall. He's got that Irish boxing stance

350
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,280
from the 1920s. Yeah, he does. You can't step to that in an MMA ring. They outlawed that from

351
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:18,560
MMA because it was too powerful. Look, he is an untrained twink fuck boy. He would get his shit

352
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:28,640
pushed in. Nobody on earth is stronger than Conan O'Brien. We're working on Invader Zim logic

353
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,760
right now. Like the tallest man is the most powerful. It has dominion over all he can lay his

354
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,000
eyes on. So Jeff would beat all of her asses then? Is that why we kicked him out of PCB because he

355
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
can kill all of us? He was too much of a threat. He was too strong. Can we get serious and talk

356
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,720
about how we would fuck all the guys in high school if we were girls? Yes, but in one second,

357
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,880
I just want to say about this. I really want to talk about that. We will get, we will certainly

358
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,840
get there. I've been joking about this a lot, but I do actually feel like, okay, so gender is

359
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
actually pretty crazy and there's legitimately people out there who feel weird about it. I

360
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
definitely think that it's kind of a meme that people who wouldn't necessarily be into it are

361
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,360
just kind of, are just like, yeah, that sounds fun. Let's get into it. I mean, I have no idea how

362
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,720
rampant that is, but I'm sure that's there to some degree, just like any trend or craze would be.

363
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:31,920
But on the, just to address this, I feel like it's a little bit of a, it's problematic. It's a

364
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,880
little bit problematic that in English, I know we don't have any real good way of addressing people

365
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,880
that don't adhere to the binary of male or female. So I'm just saying like, I feel for people, you

366
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,800
know, the fact that we have men and female bathrooms that, you know, that kind of sucks for

367
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,280
people who are floating around somewhere in the middle. So I have legitimate sympathy for them,

368
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,760
but here's where, here's my red pill and comes in. On a practical level, these people are the

369
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,440
vast minority. How much effort are we really going to put in to worrying about their specific

370
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,760
interest? And I know in a perfect world, we would just bam, put like an extra bathroom for everybody,

371
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,920
for everyone fucking gender identity there is, have an extra bathroom just for them so that

372
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:19,440
everybody feels safe and at home. But practically, can we really be doing this guys? Can we really be

373
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,880
fucking around with this? I think the solution is that we don't need more bathrooms. We need one

374
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,280
bathroom for everyone. It's fucking hard that we have two bathrooms in the first place.

375
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,840
You know, you're absolutely 100% right on that. I mean, think about it. When you were three years

376
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,120
old, your mom would take you into the women's bathroom because you're too fucking young to

377
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,760
go by yourself. When I was a young boy, my mother took me into the women's bathroom to take a

378
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,640
Mando shit. Yeah, right. I mean, I didn't get traumatized walking into the women's bathroom

379
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,720
when I was three. So, I mean, realistically, what's the worst I can have? Like everyone in the

380
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,320
world, you live in a house with women and you usually have one bathroom and nobody gets raped

381
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,840
usually. Why the fuck didn't I think that before? The problem, the problem isn't that we don't have

382
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,800
enough individual bathrooms to segregate everyone into. The problem is that we segregate them at

383
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,400
all right now. That's the problem. You know, we should have co-ed everything. It worked in

384
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,200
Starship Troopers. You know, that's my other thing. Got my first little baby boner to Starship

385
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,720
Troopers so we know it's good. That's my other philosophy in life. If it doesn't work like it

386
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,280
did an old boy, then it must work like it did in Starship Troopers. Well, thank God we just

387
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,960
solved this massive issue for everyone. Yeah. Honestly, if I'm going to rape somebody, it's

388
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,520
not when they're taking a shit. It's probably when they're not taking a shit. You know, I like the

389
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,120
rape after the shit because like the passageway that I like to use has already been stretched a

390
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,760
good way. So, you know, that works for me. That works for me. Wait, if I'm going to rape somebody...

391
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,920
With diarrhea every time they go to the bathroom, they're stretching them all?

392
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,960
That's lube, dude. And that's lubing it up just the way I like it.

393
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,600
If I'm going to rape somebody, it's going to be jumping out in a monster mask in that Scooby-Doo

394
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,520
hallway with all the doors so that even if they try to fucking run away, they'll just come through

395
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,240
the other door and I'll catch them. It's perfect. I've been studying those Scooby-Doo running in

396
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,240
and out of doors chase sequences my whole life. I have cracked the code. I become the master of

397
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,560
them, of these portals to different dimensions and now I can catch anyone during them.

398
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,920
All right, monkey. Let's get into it. How much you want to fuck our male

399
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,760
high school classmates? So, here's my problem with Digi Bro's approach. He wants to become a

400
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,800
60 year old girl and then fuck himself. You know, I might not be as traditional as most,

401
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,600
but even I'm thinking like, okay, Digi, you can do better than that. If I'm going to become a girl,

402
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,960
I want to be fucking Yamada from Yamada's first time. I want to be a hot, buxom,

403
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,560
blonde, 15 year old high school girl and I'm going to fuck every single boy in school. I'm

404
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,880
going to get the reputation of the cock-sucking queen, my friends. I'm going to go to fucking

405
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,640
college parties when I'm 15 or 16. I'm going to fuck seniors in college. Fuck it. I'm going to

406
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,000
fuck every chat. I want to know because us as guys, we only get to feel sex from our point of view.

407
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,240
Oh yeah, I'm plunging my dick into your puss, whatever. But it looks like she's enjoying that a

408
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,200
lot more than I am. You know, I've always thought the same thing. Yeah, I think it's better for them.

409
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,320
Of course it is. I think it definitely is if the guy is like at all paying attention to what the

410
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,840
girl wants. Yeah, yeah. I need to know what sex feels like as a girl and I need to abuse it by

411
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,680
being one. At the very least, it's definitely a different experience and I would absolutely love

412
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,800
to experience it at some point. Yeah, I don't think about it. If you woke up, I mean, regardless

413
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,240
of what gender you are now, if you woke up tomorrow morning just as the opposite gender, you could be

414
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,720
like the only person in history who gets the true experience of both. You cannot squander that

415
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,440
opportunity. That this is for all of humanity to know this information. This is your responsibility

416
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,120
to go out and fuck. That was like a problem with your name. He wakes up and grabs his tits

417
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:07,280
instead of rubbing that little clit bean all fucking day, baby. Yeah, it's true. It's true. I

418
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,360
would definitely do that if I woke up in somebody else's body. Absolutely. Are we talking about

419
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,400
gender switching or body switching? Because if you wake up in a different girl's body and you start,

420
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,880
you know, fiddle in your diddle, is that rape? You know, I was just going to bring it down to be

421
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,880
like, okay, guys, we got to talk about the whole respecting someone else's body. Okay, but first

422
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,760
of all, if you wake up and just it's your body only female, then go hog wild, dude, do whatever

423
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,360
you want to do. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. But if you are in someone else's body and you know this,

424
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:44,800
that raises some concerns. And I guess I would have to say, don't do it, man. I would have to say

425
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,080
don't do it. I don't think I could resist. If there's no way they're going to find out, you better

426
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,960
believe I'm doing it because it's a victimless crime. That's true. Well, I mean, that's entirely

427
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,800
true. And I don't hate, victimless crimes are as you said, victimless. So it's not really a problem,

428
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,520
right? But like the objective, if you're going for what's objectively the most moral situation,

429
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,680
I would have to say like, really beyond like masturbation, like doing as little with that

430
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,200
body as possible is like the objectively most moral thing you can do, because it's not yours

431
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,400
to use really. It's not like, I mean, like, what are you going to do? Lay there and poop your pants?

432
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
If you're in someone's body, you're going to have to see their pussy eventually. You're going

433
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,040
to have to take care of it. You know what? If you wake up in a woman's body, some other woman,

434
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,880
you wake up in her body, you have a responsibility to play with your pussy first thing because

435
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,200
you've got to figure out like where the tampon goes. You got to figure out like how to wipe it

436
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,600
when you pee. You got to know these things, okay? You can't just get to the bathroom and not know

437
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,680
and spray and spray fluids everywhere. I don't know. Maybe I assume they dab or at least or something.

438
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:03,120
Yeah, girls only have one hole. They have the cloaca. I'm just like a spider.

439
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,160
Yeah, or like a chicken, right? They just have the one hole that spews out everything they

440
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,040
don't need anymore, right? That's how I understand it.

441
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,960
How do the things we can learn when we become women?

442
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,480
Yeah, because you know what? That really is, on the other hand, on a practical level, that really

443
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,360
is something no one in history, like every guy in the world, every woman in the world,

444
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,120
has to like take every guy's word for it. Like what sex for him is like, what the orgasm is like,

445
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,000
like no one ever has crossed the boundary to experience the other side for historical

446
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,600
documentation. It would behoove you to get in there and do that shit just so you can really

447
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,600
say like, okay, they're different in these ways. This is better in that way. It would be better

448
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:54,320
for everyone. It would be a public service. I like that Nate's taking a very scientific discovery

449
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,880
approach and I just want to fucking flick my bean. I always got to come back to what's objectively

450
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,840
right or true, because that's the way I like to operate. Well, you know, if Nate's taking the

451
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:13,520
scientific approach and and Mumki's taking the base animal physiology approach, then I'm going

452
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,400
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to take the emotional approach, the spiritual approach,

453
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,440
because you know, we mentioned the movie Your Name recently, a couple minutes ago,

454
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,400
which you know, I did a review of that movie in my hit series, The Plebe and the Weeb, which

455
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,880
comes out every week. Everyone loves it. It's every week. Hold on. The most consistent show on the

456
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,680
internet, they call it. Not my words, it's everyone else's words. Consistent in quality, maybe not

457
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,120
upload schedule. Yeah, every single week, you know, every twice a week, Monday and Wednesday,

458
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:54,480
every week, random shine. You know, the movie Your Name is like, it's like my dream scenario,

459
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,880
because like, the guy wakes up in the girl's body, the girl wakes up in the guy's body,

460
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
they wake up in each other's bodies, and because of it, they become lifelong friends,

461
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,640
they become, they form a genuine bond, they learn about each other, and it's just an unbreakable

462
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,720
union of love and friendship and camaraderie, and that's beautiful. They can't even remember their

463
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,920
names. Well, they're out of the other shit though, whatever. Yeah, I think they figured out at the

464
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,160
end, I don't really remember. Well, they just like find each other, we don't know if they become

465
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,320
friends, all we know is he stopped her village from getting killed by a meteor. You can see

466
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,920
everything you need to know from the look they share at the end. When you've been in another

467
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,680
person's body, you've been taking those poops, you've been taking those peas, that's a bunch for

468
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,960
life, nothing can break that. I get in my body back and like, dude, you wore this asshole out

469
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,920
with all that pooping, come on, save some for me, my dude, save some for me. You know what,

470
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,680
I like that approach, Jesse, what we really got here, we've got, we've really got a triforce

471
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,800
of approaches here, we've got me, the triforce of wisdom, monkey, the triforce of courage,

472
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,560
and Jesse with the triforce of power for sure, just feeling that shit out.

473
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,800
Nate and Jess, if we can switch topics real quick, I want to hear your day in the life from

474
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,240
wake up to go to bed if you are a girl and you're like a teenager. How many cocks do you suck in

475
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,480
that day? Do we know that it's only for one day? No, no, you're a girl now, so what's the

476
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,080
day? Oh, I'm just a girl. A typical day in the life. But we should, no, we should also do,

477
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,520
like, you're only a girl for one day, what do you do with it? That'd be probably better. Because

478
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,200
like, if I was a girl for one day, then you'd know I'm slutting it up as much as possible.

479
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,960
Oh, hell yeah. Of course, without a doubt, without a doubt. Well, you know, I really have to wonder,

480
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,560
I have to ask, because this is a variable that to me matters quite a bit in this situation.

481
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,520
Am I waking up like in a random girl's body, or am I waking up in the body of a girl that I

482
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,240
personally know? No, it's gonna be like a girl version of you. Oh, it's just a girl now?

483
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,400
Well, first thing I do is I'm figuring out, you know, how the clam works, you know, I'm getting

484
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,880
down there with a fucking, with a microscope and a fucking magnifying glass. I'm going, you know,

485
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,000
how do I work this thing? How do I make a profit off of this thing? And then I go out into the

486
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,200
world. And then I, and then I assume I just go out into the front lawn and go, hey, world, I've

487
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,280
got a vagina. And then I just get money and fame and attention and love just showered

488
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,320
upon me for the rest of the day. Your YouTube channel will have like an extra 100,000 subs.

489
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,480
Oh my God, that's the first thing I do. I make a fucking vlog with my Ted Sound. Holy shit.

490
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,760
Dude, you know what you do? How do you set for life? You know what you do? You make a men's

491
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,600
rights channel as a woman. That's what you do. That's how you fucking win the game.

492
00:43:51,680 --> 00:44:00,320
That is going to be $3,000 in the first day. She won ahead, baby. Just spend the entire day

493
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:06,240
making nothing but like low top, low cut top vlogs and then set them out on your YouTube

494
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,560
channel like every couple of days for the rest of time. And then you can profit off that one

495
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,800
gender swap day for the rest of your life. Yeah, that's smart. That's thinking. That's thinking.

496
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,680
And also you can finger your pussy between videos. Yeah. And you butthole too. I mean,

497
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,880
you can do that as a guy, but I mean, that's totally gay. No, but that's gay, dude. Totally gay.

498
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,400
All right, so we can all agree it's not gay to get fucked if you're a girl, but what about kissing?

499
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,600
Would you kiss a guy if you're a girl? I would absolutely not know it. I mean, okay, well the

500
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:44,400
thing about like, okay, so the thing about like, sex in general is a lot, a lot of the gratification

501
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,720
comes from pleasing the other person, right? So like, if you're kissing the other person or if

502
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,920
you're like, let's give a guy a bloge, you know, you give him some bloge, like what, what is enjoyable

503
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,280
about that experience that a lot of women, you know, like a lot of women legitimately do enjoy

504
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,600
doing that, it's that they're making the other person feel good. So like for, for, for us in this

505
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,960
situation, that's us, like a guy who's now become a girl, like what we're getting into right now

506
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,240
is pleasing a guy, which is gay. That's gay. Okay, well, super gay. I just want to get my

507
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,600
I don't care if he feels good. Okay, well, in that case, yeah, I mean, in that case, it's,

508
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,960
it's, it's whatever. In terms of kissing, though, you know, you probably got to,

509
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,080
that's the thing that you do to ease into it, you know, because like, you can't, you really,

510
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,040
you really cannot just come up to a guy and say, I want to fuck, because every guy will assume that

511
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,160
you have an ulterior motive, but that you got something going on with you, like you're a weirdo,

512
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,360
you got STDs, something's fucked up with you, you got to, you got to pretend like you like are

513
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,160
into it for some bigger reason, which is true. Hey, I'm actually a guy, I'm in a woman's body

514
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,440
this is for science, we have to do this right now, and he'll be like, my God, if it's for science,

515
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,160
he'll be into it, he'll be into it. This will be who the human race, we have to do this.

516
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,000
That's a better case than just saying I just want to fuck, because I, I don't know, I don't know.

517
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,160
Guys listening at home, if you ever wake up as a woman and you want to fuck, go to Nate and just

518
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,800
say it's for science and you'll be down. Yeah, say it's for Starfleet. I would definitely do that.

519
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,400
I would without a doubt do it. If I knew that shit was true, of course, of course. Here's my

520
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,800
problem with kissing a guy. If you close your eyes, you could probably pretend it's a girl,

521
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,640
but if they got any facial hair, I don't want that itchy shit rubbing up against me while

522
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,400
we're kissing, no way. You know, ooh, that's a tough one. There's no way, I couldn't be horny,

523
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,120
my pussy would be as dry as the Sahara Desert. Okay, well, we gotta address this fact. We gotta

524
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,800
address this fact, like have we become attracted to men through the gender swap? Yeah, are we now?

525
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,760
No, I'm still me, I have my brain, I just have a girl's body. Okay, okay, all right. Yeah, I was

526
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,080
gonna ask, like, how much of my brain has become girl? Like, no, I thought about this a lot.

527
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:49,440
Would boys still be gross to me? I assume they would. Well, okay, you know what, this is gonna

528
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:56,400
make me sound 100% gay, but I have, I've always had a sincere appreciation for the male form.

529
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,480
And I do think that if I was all of a sudden a girl, I could probably get myself into the head

530
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,880
space where if I find just like some really attractive guy, I would just enjoy being around

531
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,400
him. Oh god, I'm fucking gay. I'm literally gay. I'm literally gay now.

532
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,360
I mean, don't you guys have a list of male celebrities who you would fuck right now as a guy?

533
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,160
I do. If Jake Gyllenhaal came knocking on my door, I'd be gay with him for a night, fuck it.

534
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,520
Yes, my list is Paul F. Tompkins and nobody else.

535
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,560
You love those mustaches.

536
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,840
Mine's mostly anime characters. I'd fuck Rance, I'd definitely fuck Rance. He wouldn't want to

537
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,840
fuck me, but I'd fuck him if you wanted to. You know, I think if I were a girl, if I were in it,

538
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:48,320
like I had a girl by it for a day, what I would do, you know, I would wait until like five minutes

539
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:57,520
to midnight and then I would challenge Rhonda Rousey to a fight. And like she'd be beating me up

540
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,080
because I'm a girl, like she'd think she had it in the bag, but then midnight strikes, I turned

541
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:08,800
back into a strong boy and I'm like, no, I've got you where I want you. To coob. Bam, bam, bam, bam.

542
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,560
And then I'm punching her. I'm throwing her like over the cage wall. I'm so strong now. My man strength

543
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,160
is out of control. And I just get the trophies. I get the trophies and the gold, the belts. I get

544
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,360
all the MMA awards ever. Joe Rogan comes out and personally congratulates me. He puts his arm around

545
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,440
me like, how'd you do it? And then in the second round, you turn into a guy and you're really beat

546
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,720
up that bag, Rhonda Rousey. And I'm like, that's right. That's right, Rogan. I did it. Praise me.

547
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Bow. You've got to get a millennium puzzle and pretend that you're Yugi transforming

548
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:46,880
Yugi halfway through. Oh, that's good. Oh, man, that's good. That's good. I've always had a fear,

549
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,600
though, about this, that what if you're, you know, you just get lost track. You're just orgasming

550
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,600
over and over. You're getting fucked by, you know, every Tom Dick and Harry up the block. My biggest

551
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,560
fear. Well, it's, it's that you're, you transform back at midnight, right? But what if some dude is,

552
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,320
you know, balls deep at that moment and you transform and now you got, now you got a dick

553
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,200
permanently fused up inside your body, which is definitely gay. You'd be like attached at the

554
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,720
dick like Siamese bros. Exactly. Yeah. Isn't that the plot of the movie stuck on you?

555
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:28,400
I hope so. Is that true? How true is that? Go watch that movie. Yeah, with Matt Damon and Drillbit

556
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:35,440
Taylor. Was that Matt Damon in that movie? I don't know. The special guest appearance,

557
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,720
special guest appearance by Ron's arousy as the bitch who gets beat the fuck up by the two,

558
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,400
by the two conjoined at the dick man. She thought she was fighting a woman, but midnight struck and

559
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,840
the woman turned into two conjoined at the dick men, one played by Matt Damon and the other played

560
00:49:51,840 --> 00:50:00,240
by the character Drillbit Taylor, not Owen Wilson. Oh shit, it was Matt Damon. What the fuck? Wow.

561
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,640
I don't remember that being Matt Damon. That's crazy. You have to rewatch that shit. It actually

562
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,560
has positive score on Rotten Tomatoes. What the hell? Does it really? Yeah, 61%. The other guy was

563
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,320
Greg Kenyer. I don't know who that is. I wonder what Bubble Boy has in Rotten Tomatoes. I'm going

564
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:23,840
to look that up. Yeah, let us know. Who could forget Bubble Boy? Fun fact, Bubble Boy is Zach

565
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:30,240
Galifianakis' first movie. He plays the bus ticket guy. That's fascinating. You know what I always

566
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:38,720
loved in the movie Juno? What's his name? Michael Sarah? Not Michael Sarah. Neither of them. It's

567
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,560
a bit character from the very beginning. You know the guy who played the nerd? Fuck, I can't

568
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:49,280
remember his name from the office. The American office. You know what I'm talking about? Ryan?

569
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,920
Not Ryan. Who's the fucking weirdo creep? Dwight, of course. Dwight. The actor who plays Dwight

570
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,200
is in the very beginning of that and as Juno is getting her pregnancy results, she's just

571
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,000
standing at the counter. I guess she just pissed on in the bathroom and is looking at it and he

572
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,200
just says, your ego is prego. Okay. It was the grayest line of all time. That's pretty funny.

573
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:16,640
Pretty good, dude. Pretty good. Oh my god. Would you get pregnant as the girl? That's the fear

574
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,360
because I want to slud it up for that day but then like am I pregnant as a man the next day?

575
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:28,320
Are my eggs finalized? Oh my god. What happens? I always have that fear of spiders crawling in my

576
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,800
ear at night and then laying eggs and like feeling my brain with eggs and I am the spider boy under

577
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,280
their control forever. Same situation, you know? Wait a minute. Terrified. Terrifying. I think what

578
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,080
would happen is if you got impregnated as a woman and then turned back into a boy, I mean you would

579
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:49,760
now have the fertilized egg inside you but it would be like in your dick or ball sack region.

580
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,320
Which means that you would be shooting out the fertilized egg. You could theoretically

581
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,240
fuck a hole in the ground and grow children from soil.

582
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,520
I was hoping for a more, what's that Arnold Schwarzenegger movie where he gets pregnant?

583
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,600
Daddy Daycare? No, that's not the one.

584
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,440
Junior. I think it's called Junior. I believe it's called Terminator 2.

585
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,120
In case you were wondering, Bubble Boy has a score of 30% on Rotten Tomatoes.

586
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,120
Sorry Jake Gyllenhaal.

587
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:35,520
Now 30% doesn't mean that it's only 30% good. 30% means that 30% of people gave it like 10 out of

588
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:43,200
10, 100%. Oh really? He ends the movie by falling down Niagara Falls in a bubble. How can you not like

589
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:52,640
it? I'm definitely all 30% of those. When I was a kid, I had three VHSs that mean

590
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,360
my brother watched over and over again. We had Bubble Boy, we had Max Keebles, Big Move,

591
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,040
and we had Rat Race. Two of the three we should not have been watching. Rat Race is a masterpiece.

592
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,240
Hell yeah. We could do a whole episode on Rat Race. Any movie that ends with an actual smash

593
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:18,160
mouth concert is a certified fucking masterpiece. Fuck yeah. Get fucked John Cleese. There you go.

594
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,360
Is it said that my only exposure for the majority of my life to John Cleese was fucking Rat Race

595
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,720
and not like Monty Python or anything? Is that true? Oh no, that's sad. I didn't know he was in

596
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:34,480
anything else. I thought he was just the guy from Rat Race. That is sad. Fucking good Monty

597
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:42,480
Python. Good, good movie. Good Holy Grail. Upvoted. Top, top, top pick on Reddit. Shut the fuck up.

598
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,640
I don't know what I'm doing. Okay, here we go. I feel like we've exhausted this. Are we done?

599
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,440
We got any closing points to make about this whole gender swapping thing.

600
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,800
So I guess if you wake up as a girl and you want to fuck, go fuck Nate and also carry a gun and

601
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,920
don't try to fight Ronda Rousey, I think that's what we learned today. Which you can do immediately

602
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,760
when you change back. Anyone can beat Ronda Rousey. Any woman who wakes up tomorrow as a man,

603
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,440
the first thing you'd better do for science is go fight Ronda Rousey.

604
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,640
Shit, you know, I felt like we didn't really talk enough. Maybe we should right now,

605
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,400
just about the whole thing about being a woman turning into a guy and what you can expect.

606
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,000
What can your average woman expect when she wakes up as a guy the next day? You know,

607
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,400
because we're gender inclusive here. I think get ready for all the attention,

608
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:39,440
all that people giving a shit about you, gone. It's gone. Don't expect any person to ever do

609
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,720
anything for you ever again. Nobody gives a fuck about that. Do not try online dating. You're not

610
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,760
going to get any results at all. That's correct. That's correct. Zero messages. In fact, don't

611
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:56,480
leave the house because the world is a nightmare now. Yeah, every woman becomes a man for one day

612
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,440
and like halfway through it, she's already like on all the MRA boards and all the like men going

613
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,200
their own way boards. She's done. She can't take it anymore. She hasn't at the years of training

614
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,200
that we have to get to this point alive. Be excited women. When you go to work as a man,

615
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:18,000
you'll get an automatic 30% raise. I was going to say that. God damn it. Yep. Yeah. 23 cents on the

616
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,480
dollar. Bam in your pocket. Day one. They're like, Oh my God, we've made a huge mistake. We didn't

617
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,640
realize you were a man all along. Didn't realize you had a dick. Here's the extra cash. That's how

618
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:33,280
it works. It's just that easy. That's why I really feel for the transitioning community from male

619
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:41,040
to female. It's tough enough. It's tough enough. Just going through the process of all that,

620
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,000
but then when they just walk into work one day and they're like, my pay, oh no, 277 cents on the

621
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,640
dollar. It sucks. Sorry, dude, that's corporate policy. What can we do? That's just how it works.

622
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,520
That's just how it works. Obama wanted it. Here's some benefits. Going P, it's going to be kind of

623
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:01,120
fun now. You don't have to get your butt on that dirty toilet seat. Sometimes in a restaurant

624
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,840
or a bar, they'll put a little fly sticker in the urinal, so you can try to aim at that. That's

625
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:13,200
kind of fun. What else we got? Sometimes you get to go pee. It's easier now. Yeah. You get to go

626
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,160
pee in a trough sometimes with all your buddies. Put your arms around each other and sing songs

627
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,960
while you do it and sway back and forth. That's fun. I don't know if that's a positive. You get

628
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,920
to hold each other's dicks. That's what we do at the old trough.

629
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,880
If you jerk off in the shower, you can see how far you can shoot your common market with a sharpie

630
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,280
and see if you can beat your last record. The projectile come thing, yeah. That's a big one.

631
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,120
That's a big one. What else we got? What other benefits are there to being a man in American

632
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,440
society today other than having a dick? This is a big one. This is a big one. You can be fat

633
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,960
and Nate won't hate you intensely immediately. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's

634
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:02,960
pretty good. Yeah, no joke though. Fat women, they have way worse than fat men and that is

635
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,960
kind of shitty. Yeah, for sure. On the one hand, that's kind of true, but women, okay, what does

636
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,680
it matter if you're an unattractive woman? Well, okay, I mean it does to some degree because it's

637
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,040
all about whatever, being attractive or whatever. You want to fuck somebody, right? You want to

638
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,520
catch yourself a high quality man, but there are tons of men who will still fuck you even if you're

639
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,360
fat, but if you're a fat guy, I would say that it's harder. Well, I would say that it's harder.

640
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,800
There's tons of fat guys who have who have hot female wives. There's Peter Griffin,

641
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:39,040
there's Homer Simpson, you know, there's a King of Queens. Yeah, don't forget King of Queens.

642
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,880
The greatest man who ever lived. Kevin James, I don't know what it is in the show. You know what

643
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,640
it really is, it's that women are, because men are visual creatures, like our appreciation of

644
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,400
women has more to do with their physicality than a woman's attraction to a man, which is more

645
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,960
about personality and confidence and shit. Yeah, you're all shallow. Yeah, you know, I guess in

646
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,040
that way, yeah, you can be, if you're a woman, you can be fat now and it won't be as big a deal.

647
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,720
That's true, that's true. What the fuck else you got? Oh, you will be expected, here's a

648
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,600
negative, you will be expected to carry shit for people who are smaller than you or all women,

649
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,920
you'll be expected to carry their shit now or hold doors. I mean, that's less prevalent these

650
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,560
days. Oh my god, you will now have to deal with the nightmare of feminism in general, hating you,

651
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,960
hating you in every way, so that sucks. You can be elected president no matter what you say

652
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,120
over a woman. You can grab pussy freely now, you know, it's the door, carte blanche for grabbing

653
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,320
pussy as we've learned. I think that's about it. I can't think of any other benefits of being a man.

654
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,480
Yeah, me neither, dude. Oh, oh, oh, you can have sex without personally getting pregnant,

655
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,360
so that's that's a nice one. You don't have to worry about that at all anymore. You might still

656
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,640
get STDs, but you will not be the one who gets knocked up for months or have to deal with the

657
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:08,480
whole work. You will be the one who knocks. Yes. And yeah, I think that's it. I think that's it.

658
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,400
Oh, wait, I forgot the most important one. You can now become a Catholic priest. That's

659
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:18,160
checkbox. Oh, you can now be in God's in God's corner. That's a good shot's fired.

660
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:24,560
Nate versus the Catholic Church. Look out. Not a fan. Not a fan. Oh, wait. Oh, you can now move

661
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,520
to Saudi Arabia and drive. You can now drive in Saudi Arabia. I forgot about that. You can now

662
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,240
move to Saudi Arabia and not wear a fucking scarf on your head. Well, I mean, that's a

663
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,400
I mean, we're we're down with the hijab now. That's a feminist icon thing now. So it is.

664
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,800
Yeah. Why? Why the fuck? It's very confusing. I don't know. All right. I think that's it.

665
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,720
YouTube is lucky that they banned me from uploading on my main account for two weeks,

666
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,640
because I got this Mumkey's Declassified Sharia Law Survival Guide video and I'm going to take

667
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:06,960
the Internet by storm. Here. Here's hoping for 10 billion views and and and a glorious new Caliphate

668
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,160
in the West. All right. So there you go. All right. Let's go to the questions already. Let's

669
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:19,200
let me only do the search thing. Okay. Hashtag as PCP. By the way, you guys can feel free to do

670
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,560
this as well if you want. I know Mumkey does sometimes. Yeah, you tagged me in the tweet.

671
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,720
So now I'm getting all these notifications. So thanks for that. You're anytime, dude.

672
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,320
Okay. Here's a question from Shade. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of this guy.

673
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,800
No. A little known guy. He wants to know, why does Jess hate spiders so much?

674
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Oh, what am I tweeting about this this morning or something? That's probably why he's asking.

675
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,800
Oh, these people are so fucking unoriginal and reactionary, you know, just because that was Shade.

676
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,720
Who fucks Shade? That's didgy's little brother. That's MC Shadu. Yeah, that's MC Shadu. This

677
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:59,360
must be a different shade. Oh, how many shades are there? I don't know. 50 shades of gray,

678
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,240
you could say. I hate spiders because spiders are fucking ugly. They're monstrous. They're

679
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,800
hideous. They're gay. They're cretins. They're scum. They have no fucking backbones literally

680
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:16,880
and figuratively. They're weak. And, you know, people say they're not dangerous,

681
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,600
but that doesn't mean they're not evil. If you take the smallest, most harmless spider,

682
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,400
if they were bigger, if they were big enough to eat you, it would. So, you know, spiders are evil

683
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,200
and they're ugly. They've got too many eyes and too many legs. They've got tiny little hairs,

684
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,680
and they crawl on you. They get on you. They get in your hair. They spin webs. The webs are gross.

685
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:43,360
Do I really even need to justify this? Fuck spiders. You know what? Even Ronda Rousey could

686
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:49,280
beat a spider. That's how much I don't respect spiders. People always make the case that like,

687
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,400
yeah, but spiders eat other bugs. They eat mosquitoes and they eat flies and they eat other

688
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,720
shit. I'll just kill them myself. I'll just kill them myself. Yeah, well, what kind of defense is

689
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,040
that? They're worse than the things they eat. I would rather have a mosquito on me than a spider.

690
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:11,440
You know what? That's actually a tough one because I hate mosquitoes so much. I hate them

691
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,600
more than spiders for sure. I want every mosquito in the fucking world destroyed. They are,

692
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,120
they are going to kill us one day. Mosquitoes are going to be the downfall of humanity because

693
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,400
they're going to suck blood out of some fucking super AIDS boys. They're going to transport it all

694
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,800
over the fucking world. I don't care if they revive the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. I don't care.

695
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,320
That's not good enough. That's the only thing that a mosquito has ever done that was even a slight

696
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:42,000
positive. They're evil. I fucking hate mosquitoes. So I'm on Team Spider, I guess. I respect mosquitoes

697
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,560
a little bit more because when a mosquito lands on you, like, yeah, it's annoying, but you only

698
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,520
have to feel it landing on you. When a spider lands on you, you have to feel every leg crawling up

699
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,560
you slowly. Like, it's just, it's just touching you a thousand times as opposed to a mosquito,

700
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,360
which touches you once. I mean, that's true. I'll say touching a spider web is worse than

701
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,200
touching any of these things. I'd rather fucking die than walk through the forest and get a big

702
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,680
spider web in my face. And if there's bugs in there, then you're even more fucked. Well, the,

703
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,360
the only reason that I get freaked out by that because of the, is because of the presence of

704
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,320
the bugs in the spider web. But I guess that's kind of your point. So yeah, yeah, that's pretty

705
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,160
shit. Like, I freak out because I'm like, assume there's a spider on me now. So really, the problem

706
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,440
is the spider. Spider web is cool. I just think the spider, the web itself feels all silky and

707
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,960
gross and sticky on your face. And I just, I just wanted to walk through the woods and,

708
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,280
and peek on this bath house over there. And now I got to worry about this shit. And you know,

709
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,680
all the spider fags are always like, oh, spider silk is a thousand times stronger than steel.

710
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,560
But how come I destroy it effortlessly with every fucking, checkmate, checkmate,

711
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,120
mother fuckers. Fuck, fuck, fuck all, fuck all spiders, fuck that slut Charlotte.

712
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:54,560
Fuck that fucking, fuck that French bitch in James and the Giant Peach. I don't even care.

713
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:59,120
I would. I don't care how sexy her face is. The rest of her is an abomination.

714
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,720
Yo, you know who's hot rock, rock and arrow from Monster Musume? She's the best girl. She's

715
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,640
fucking, I would sex. The only good spider is spider man. And the good part of him ain't the

716
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,240
spider part. It's the man part. It's the man. The muscles and the dong.

717
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:21,200
Spider dong. No, it's. All right, Justin, I got another question for you. I'm glad you two are

718
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,560
here because you tour the, the PCP experts on this subject. Mark Morella wants to know,

719
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:33,280
what is the bare minimum age to count as sex with the young? The minimum age. It's not,

720
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,400
it's not a, it's not an age. There is no minimum. It's a state of mind.

721
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,680
That's true. Like when you got, when you got your choice as, you know, 45 year old milk,

722
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,280
if you got her dressed up in her baby bib and her diaper, that my friend is some,

723
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,080
is some old school sex with the young right there. That is the official,

724
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:58,000
fucking the, the non-incriminating stance. It's all in the mind. Just like, just like,

725
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,520
just like my hero. Just like my older person who is retarded. Does that count?

726
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,160
Yeah, that'll count. You know, if they act like a baby, if they look like a baby and they act

727
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,320
like a baby and they smell like a baby, then it's sex with the young. Just like my hero,

728
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:15,760
chop, chop, master onion said. Yeah. Sex with the young. It's all in the mind.

729
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,320
What a hero. My hero. I've got a question here from a Theo at pterodactyl says,

730
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:30,080
should entertainers bring their girlfriends along for the ride? No. What are you guys?

731
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,640
Absolutely not. And that might seem hypocritical coming from me, but here's the thing. I gave her

732
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,040
her own channel. Now I only put her on my channel when I need a woman and she's like the closest

733
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,120
one near me. I'm not bringing her along for any ride. I'm giving her her own platform on

734
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,400
Sheepover. Go check it out. I'm going to post a link down in the comments.

735
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,120
You ain't going to give your girlfriend a ride. I'll give her a ride. You know what I'm saying?

736
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,000
You know what I'm saying? My dude. Now, yeah, I pretty much think that's totally appropriate.

737
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,800
Yeah. If you're, if you're already doing something and you're just trying to like,

738
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:05,440
like the whole Yoko Ono situation is like the classic one. You don't just insert your bitch

739
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,400
into like the thing that's already going on. If you want to make something new,

740
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,240
like what Ben's doing with his new channel, with his girlfriend, that's a okay. That's perfect.

741
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,680
That's exactly the right thing to do. If you, if you got two creative people and they want to be

742
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,680
doing stuff, just, yeah, just don't fuck up the shit that's already there. I will only time

743
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,760
defend my use of girls and my videos thusly. Sometimes I need to go outside and I need a

744
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,400
cameraman. I need someone to film me. That's the first reason. And the second thing is that when

745
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:36,880
I do like stuff like my panel cast, you know, uh, the, the, my girl is like, she knows about

746
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,680
comics. So I at least keep her where she belongs on a thing that is in her field.

747
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,120
You know, I, I assumed that she was not going to be any kind of expert when you first started

748
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,440
the panel cast and said she was going to be on. I was like, Oh boy, here we go. But then she was

749
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:57,920
like more knowledgeable than you in some ways. And uh, that was, yeah, she's a solid asset.

750
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,120
She's reasonably vital to that endeavor. And I was just going to clarify. The only time you're

751
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,160
going to see a girlfriend on my main monkey channel is when I need a woman to be used as a prop.

752
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,800
That's all she is to me is a fucking prop. Excellent. Excellent. And you know,

753
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:18,640
uh, what Jesse was saying, uh, yeah, like, uh, I hate that I have to make all my shit by myself

754
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,600
like, cause I always want to do live action stuff and it's really fucking annoying and I've

755
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:27,120
adapted. So it's not a big deal now, but like, uh, God, I would fucking love to do more live

756
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,400
action shit. Like you, like you're fucking Zelda video, Jesse, which I assumed you filled with,

757
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,560
with flusie all over the place. It was great. It was, uh, it was awesome. If I had a, if I had a

758
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:39,200
person around to do that with, I totally would. God damn our, our let's plays just a whole lot

759
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,760
easier to make when you've got someone to bounce off of and converse it with. You know what? In fact,

760
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,200
I take back my whole stands. You should always have a second person. Put all your girlfriends,

761
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,200
all your boyfriends, all your friends in there, put your whole family in your videos, make a whole,

762
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,560
a whole production out of it. That's how you get the real good content. That's how you get the

763
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,960
YouTube success and the YouTube bucks. You got to have a bunch of people working for you,

764
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,440
for nothing, for peanuts. Yeah, you trip them into it with relationships. That's what you,

765
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:11,200
that's what relationships for. You seduce someone into helping you work. There you go.

766
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,680
The main issue people have is when, like with the Beatles, you get your girlfriend in there and

767
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,920
then like Nate was saying, they completely change the content. Like for example with,

768
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,640
with AVGN, he got his, his wife involved as a producer on the movie. And then the movie ends

769
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,760
with like the other guy getting the girl for no reason. Yeah. It should have been fucking James,

770
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,840
right? Why the fuck didn't he fuck that bitch? The girl didn't even talk to the black guy,

771
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,840
the whole movie, and then they're kissing at the end. Well, okay. The movie should not have had the

772
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,920
girl or the black guy at all. They were totally worthless characters. That's a given.

773
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:48,080
I did not see it, but I mean, you know, for all we know, I mean, I don't know shit about these guys

774
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,600
or about the production of the movie, but like from what I've heard, it sounds like, like, like

775
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,320
Bumpy was saying, the, the wifey here, she had some input. She had some like, she made some changes

776
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,240
along the way and who the fuck knows exactly how drastic those were, what they were at some point.

777
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,640
Yeah, you really, if you're a creator, do not let, but it's kind of inevitable because like,

778
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,280
whatever people you hang around are going to change the way you think. Like your, your friends,

779
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,560
to some degree, define how you think and like, what do you think is acceptable. That's why we're

780
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:19,680
all so angry all the time. That's right. We always talk to PCP guys all day. So if, like, if you're

781
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,920
just like some dude from the Midwest or whatever, and you move to California, like you're gonna adopt

782
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,640
that mindset over some, it's gonna happen. Like, like Tim Heidecker, I think is kind of an example

783
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,120
of that. He's just getting more and more, you know, he moved to Hollywood and he's just getting more

784
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,040
and more, you know, liberal. And yeah, I don't, I don't really begrudge him. I disagree with him

785
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,360
on some of his points, but you know, that's fine. But you can see his mind changing. You can see

786
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,240
those changes happening. And like the thing with Yoko was like, she actually wasn't really,

787
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,520
as far as I know, I'm no expert on this, but she wasn't like forced into like the Beatles or anything.

788
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,080
It's not like Lenin was trying to bring her in to like change the Beatles. But what she definitely

789
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:01,920
did was change John himself. And so like he, and like, it's, it's hard to say like, what are you

790
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,920
gonna do? Like tell your friends, like break up with his girlfriend? She changed him from a serial

791
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:11,680
wife-beater into a guy who respected his spouse. What a fucking bitch. How could she do that? That

792
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,560
was a big problem. If he ruins the music, then it's a terrible thing on the face of mankind.

793
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,240
Yeah, yeah, can't disagree with that. But you know, Yoko Ono makes some good stuff, dude.

794
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,800
I loved her, her latest album, which I believe was called like,

795
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,520
do you ever listen to her perform live? She's a fucking nightmare. But anyway,

796
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:37,200
you know, it really grinds my gears. You know, when it's just really gratuitous and transparent,

797
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,280
how like guys will be like, oh, I'm, this is my show, and here's my girlfriend now. And it's like,

798
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,760
it's almost like they're using her as like, like a sports car or a trophy to like show off.

799
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,160
Dude, not to- I can have sex with girls. I've got a hot girl.

800
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,920
You know, to some degree, there's always going to be a little bit of bullshit. Like,

801
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,880
if you get a girlfriend and for whatever reason, you're talking about something

802
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,640
where it's relevant. And even when you do that little mention, because it's pertinent to what

803
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,160
you're talking about, there's going to be some people who are like, oh, here we go. We're shoving

804
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,560
in the whole girlfriend thing. But to some degree, it's unavoidable. That's the takeaway. Just keep

805
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,720
it relevant. Don't be gratuitous and transparent and gay with it. Don't be gay in general. If you've

806
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,200
got, you know, nobody wants to be that couple. Just don't do it. You know, you know what this

807
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:27,360
reminds me of? Did you guys ever see probably not fucking Jeff's videos where he started having

808
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:34,880
his girlfriend wear his merch and shit? I'm just saying. Yeah, he was playing it off as a joke,

809
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:42,320
but still. I've never watched a Jeff video ever. And I think I can- You gotta take the monkey

810
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,800
approach. Only put your girlfriend in the video if the whole joke is that you're abusing her and

811
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,360
that she's too stupid to think of groceries. That really is like the funny way to go. Like,

812
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,440
nobody is- if you're a comedy boy, nobody's laughing if you're showing off your girlfriend,

813
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,560
just like, just showing her off. Like, that's not funny. And people would be like,

814
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,160
what the fuck? You're wasting my time bragging about the shit. So yeah, you got to make it funny

815
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:08,720
like Mumki did, which was great. The wife abuse thing was wonderful. Okay, here's another question

816
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:15,120
at GregBerryAnt asks, how do you keep yourselves motivated enough to work for more than a few

817
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:21,840
hours without taking a break? I constantly get distracted. And I have a- This is a question that-

818
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,640
So it's really funny to me, this question. Like, motivation questions. When I was young,

819
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:32,800
I had such a hard time focusing. And I was never able to concentrate very long on anything. And

820
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,040
even when I was in college, and I was starting to do things that I sort of liked, which was game

821
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,800
design, even then I found it agonizing to force myself to like, oh fuck, okay, I'll try to do

822
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,240
a puzzle design today or whatever, or program this thing. So things were getting a little better.

823
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:55,040
But what I found is, like, I didn't level up or- or increase my skill at this at all. The only

824
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:00,800
thing I ever did to get better at this was just find things that I inherently liked doing. It was-

825
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,280
I basically cheated the system. I just kept looking around until I just found out like, you know what?

826
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,440
I fucking love making videos. And like, during the TBAP days, when me and Ben would just like,

827
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,680
bust one out every week, and they were pretty fucking great. Like, it was so easy to just do

828
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,400
that because I really wanted to do it. So unfortunately, I don't have any practical advice

829
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,480
for this, but I would say just find something that you actually like doing. And maybe it's just a

830
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:27,120
like a variation on what you're trying to do now. That's all I got. Maybe you guys have some more

831
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:33,840
useful answers to this. How do you stay motivated? It was basically like, how do you stay motivated

832
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,040
without fucking getting distracted or taking a break? Oh shit, I'm the wrong fucking guy to

833
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:45,360
answer that one. I think what helps me is that I am a bit of a fame whore. And the whole time

834
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:50,400
I'm thinking, oh man, if I put this up, it's gonna get seen by at least 5,000 people, baby,

835
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,360
gotta get this sucker out. So if you're like an up and comer and you have no audience, I can imagine

836
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,000
it's very hard to be motivated to work because you feel like you're doing all this work for

837
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,560
literally nobody because nobody's watching. So if that's this guy's case, which I don't know who

838
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,280
he is, if that's your case, I can't help you. I have no idea what you can do. Well, you know,

839
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,120
I think it makes it keep your eye on the prize is what you're saying, right? You just just imagine

840
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,800
even if you're not like immediately getting, I guess what you're talking about like instant

841
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,360
gratification, right? You put it up and bam, 5,000 people see it feels good. You get those responses,

842
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,920
get those upvotes. It's nice. Like get those down votes if you're doing a podcast with Psy,

843
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,040
which is better than an upvote because that means it's not that they're supporting me with a little

844
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,840
click is that they're going against Psy with a click, which feels much better. You know what I

845
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,240
would say? I would just say like, you just got to value what you're doing. Like when I started

846
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,600
like my current channel best guy ever, like the the current login videos like literally six months

847
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,200
each to make them or no, the first one was three months, second one was six months and like at the

848
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,920
time at the time they got like way fewer views than they deserve. And now that I'm like growing a

849
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,360
little bit, they're starting to get more views. They're like basically 100,000 views, which is

850
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,400
like a healthy amount of views for like a lifetime. So I'm more happy with that. But at the time, like

851
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:09,120
what kept me going at the time was just how much I needed to complete this project. The project

852
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:14,800
itself is what made me want to keep going. And I felt there was an inherent value, a need that was

853
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,360
served by me creating this thing. And I feel like it did that. And I feel like that's why people like

854
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,320
it. So like at later on, you can just do it for the for the views and for the clicks. But at the

855
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,440
very beginning, at least you have to have some sort of artistic vision, which which I would recommend

856
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,880
going for something like that. I don't know, that's work for me. But I'm sorry, totally cut Jesse off.

857
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:39,440
I never really feel like unmotivated. I think in terms of motivation, I'm always like, yeah,

858
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,600
I'm going to do what I want to do. Because that's I'm cool. And that's what I do. But I definitely

859
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:51,680
do get distracted a lot. I always am a working on like a like a dozen things at once. I've always

860
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,640
got a bunch of Vegas windows open. And there's always like, like a like a new episode of a show

861
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,960
that I want to watch or like a podcast. And then you once you start watching something,

862
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,720
you fall into a hole and you start watching, you know, you just fall into like a YouTube hole,

863
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,960
or like you lay down on the couch once, once you're on the couch, it's fucking over. The day is

864
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:17,600
over. That's a trap. So um, you know, it's hard to stay focused sometimes. So a couple of months

865
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:24,560
ago, I tried Adderall for the first time. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That worked out. Yeah. Like,

866
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,760
and I was sold at like, Oh, this is a, this is a, is a, is a drug. It's not for you. It's

867
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,120
illegal that I'm selling you this. It's, you know, you should be taking this, but it will make you

868
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,720
like super focused and super, you know, into your work. And I'm like, okay, I'll take it. And I took

869
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:44,320
one. And like, it definitely worked. But like the thing is, it didn't feel like I've achieved

870
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:50,240
like a, a different state. It felt like maybe I'm supposed to be on Adderall. Maybe this is how

871
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:55,840
I'm supposed to be working. So that's my advice is just take Adderall. Take Adderall. Yeah.

872
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,000
You know, I mean, Nate, you're laughing, but I, I'd back up that recommendation. I took

873
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,160
Adderall once in high school and I was in pre-calc and I couldn't figure out this

874
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:11,760
fucking pre-calc shit. I took one Adderall and I taught myself that, that whole chapter in less

875
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,640
than 20 minutes. Is that true? Is that actually true? I could, I could feel like my brain was a

876
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,680
fucking locomotive. I could feel the engine of the train revving in my brain. I could physically feel

877
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:27,520
it. And it felt great. I laughed just cause it's funny. But no, I'm actually, I'm totally on board

878
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,440
for any of these kind of like, like treating the human body as like an engineering problem to be

879
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,560
solved with like fixes or drugs or like, but yeah, you start like, you start speed forcing and burst

880
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,200
slinking. You can like, you can do anything when you're on Adderall. It's a miracle, Drake. You

881
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,760
know, we've done, we've done so many episodes of this show, like giving advice to up and coming,

882
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,880
like aspiring creators who look up to us, but all our advice was wrong. The only advice that

883
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:58,480
matters, if you take anything from this podcast, just take Adderall. Yeah. The only reason I don't

884
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:04,880
wholeheartedly agree is because, because I'm, I'm, I'm engineering focused. If the Adderall

885
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,920
perhaps introduces other issues, for example, just one that's possible is if taking Adderall

886
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,640
gives you this high of ability to create stuff, that there will follow, of course, a subsequent

887
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,200
low where you're off of it. And will that make you like unable to function without it at that

888
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,880
point? Or like, yeah, I know I'm not being fun. I'm being serious right now, but like, um, yeah,

889
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,240
you know, I didn't take it enough to get addicted. Yeah, luckily, I'm so, if it's possible to just

890
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:33,520
be on, if it's possible to just take Adderall, I can only afford like two pills a month. So,

891
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,000
well, that's good. If it's possible to like, for everyone to be on Adderall all the time, and

892
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,800
literally all it does is make everyone better at everything, then I would be 100% on board. But

893
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,360
yeah, I just got to watch out for those consequences. That's all. Yeah. That's all. Well, I mean,

894
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,160
like, I, every time I write a script or record a let's play, I'm drinking. Am I going to be dependent

895
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:57,040
on drinking? Probably. But do I care? No. Well, I mean, if you don't care, that's fine.

896
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,320
I'll just keep drinking. I mean, rolling rock, I got it because I was like, oh, AVGN, he's pretty

897
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:08,320
funny. Maybe this is magic funny juice. And it actually takes, it tastes exactly like water,

898
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:14,800
but has all the benefits of alcohol. So I really, I endorse rolling rock. If you can't afford Adderall,

899
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,760
go get some rolling rock. It's great. And if you can afford them both, then yes, definitely mix them,

900
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:26,400
mix as much as you can. Just grab everything from daddy's medicine cabinet, throw it all in a big

901
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,160
tincture and mix it up. Just mix depressants and narcotics together all the fucking day.

902
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,960
Don't do that. Don't die. If you want to die, at least pledge to our patreons before you do.

903
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,120
That's smart. That's smart. Just be responsible with your money. Invest in your future.

904
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,960
All right. So there you go. That's that. Is there any other decent questions here? Let me see.

905
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,040
Oh my God. Here's one. Okay. This is actually very personal to me.

906
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:00,400
At Mozilla Fendicand. Hey, dude, what's going on? I asked, so what are good ingredients to put in

907
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,240
oatmeal? I'm trying to become more of a healthy boy. Dude, I eat oatmeal every breakfast of my

908
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:10,240
fucking life. I am a fucking oatmeal expert. And I know exactly what you need to put in your oatmeal

909
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,400
to make it delicious. Okay. Here's what I'm doing right now. I'm so, I'm so happy. I'm so excited.

910
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,600
He asked this question. Yes. I'm all about oatmeal. Okay. You get yourself a big bowl of you get,

911
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,480
you get the big thing from, from Quaker oats, the old fashioned oats. You pour a fucking cup

912
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:31,120
into a bowl. And here's what you do. You put frozen strawberries from the grocery store.

913
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,520
You just pour a whole, like a fucking, fuckload of those in there. You cover that thing. You want,

914
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,440
you want to have a lot because it's going to be, the taste is dependent on those. You just cover

915
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,960
that thing with water. You fucking, you pour the strawberries, pour water. It doesn't matter how

916
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,160
much. Just put a bunch, experiment until you get the right amount. Maybe you do a cup or whatever.

917
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,760
The strawberries have water in them already. And then you just microwave that. You do that for two

918
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,160
minutes. You stir it up. You put it back in and do another two minutes. And then bam, you got perfect

919
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:58,640
oatmeal. Now, if you are a weak boy, what you can do is you can just put some sugar in. I would

920
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,440
recommend like one tablespoon of sugar. That might be a little bit too much, but something like that.

921
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,280
And then you just mix it up and bam, that's immediately delicious and perfect. If you want to

922
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,200
be an even more of a madman, what you can do is you can put brown sugar in and butter. You could

923
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,960
just put brown sugar and butter. If you don't care about like, it's going to be more fatty this way,

924
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,800
more, more calories and shit. Brown sugar, butter, do all the same steps. Just don't put in the

925
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,800
strawberries. Or you can put the strawberries in. I guess that'd be fine too. Bam. There you go.

926
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,640
That's perfect. That's all you need to know, folks. That's the best way to eat oatmeal. I do it every

927
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:33,920
single day in my goddamn life, the strawberry one. And there you go. There's your solution. There you

928
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,640
go. All right, we're done. Do you guys have any oatmeal suggestions? No, I'm the kind of the little

929
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:45,280
dinosaur eggs in it. Yeah, that's really, fuck what I said. Just get the dinosaur eggs.

930
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:51,200
Okay, we're done. No more good questions. Thanks for the questions. Yeah, everyone's

931
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,800
going to piss out all this rolling rock I've been drinking the whole time. Wait, what is this?

932
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,040
No, this is a shitty question. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm going to ask this last question. At

933
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:08,480
Artmark88 asks, about the Wonder Woman film, do you think the area's reveal should have been

934
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:12,880
an end credit scene? No, it shouldn't have been in it at all. Yeah, it was terrible. Yeah,

935
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,000
it, yeah, I didn't, yeah. We already talked about this in the last episode, didn't we? Did we?

936
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,200
Did we talk about this? Fuck it? I don't, I don't know. Okay, fuck that. I don't know why I felt

937
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,520
like answering that. All right, forget it. Abort, abort question. Mark, you're dead to me. Okay,

938
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,360
here we go. We're all done. Thanks for listening, everybody. Make sure you send us more questions

today, Jess was offering to beat up people's dads. If you want your dad beat up possibly from

945
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,640
Discord, throwing a buck or two. Those people, they contributed to the podcast. And if your dad

946
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,840
is Ronda Rousey, you get into the Discord free because I really, I really want to crack at that

947
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:17,040
dad. If your dad is Ronda Rousey. So if Ronda Rousey wants to be in the Discord, she's in for

948
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,320
free. All right, Ronda, you're in, buddy. Okay, thanks for listening, everybody. We'll see you next

949
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,920
time. Bye.

950
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,920
Bye.

951
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,920
Yeah. Yeah.

952
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,920
Oh.

953
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:37,920
I'm supposed to be working right now. I'm supposed to be working right now.

954
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:49,120
But I'm not working. I'm doing nothing. My dick, I'm jerking. Myself, I'm sucking.

955
01:23:49,120 --> 01:24:04,000
I am an asshole. I am a stupid. I've got a deadline. Don't want to do it.
