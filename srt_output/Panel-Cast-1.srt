1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Come on, you fuckers think that just because a guy reads comics, he can't start some shit?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Aw, fuck it, take all you want!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Levi, you ready?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Home again, home again.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Gibbontake, the love!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Class is paying 101.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I guess one person can make a difference.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Greetings, true believers.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It is I, Endless Jess.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Here with the very first weekly panel cast.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I haven't actually decided what to call it yet.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can't decide between panel cast or amazing comics weekly.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Maybe I'll use them both.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know, I'll put a straw poll. Everybody vote.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Everybody vote for the title of this new weekly podcast here on The Pro Crastinators.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The motherfucking panel cast, baby, starring Endless Jess.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm talking about comics people.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The most important thing in the fucking world besides wrestling.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Those are the only two things that sustain me.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am a life form powered by wrestling and comics, and that's it.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The same way that Digi Bro is powered by, like, lollies and pajama pants.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And Ben is powered by money and depression.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And Nate is powered by being wrong all the time.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am powered.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I take two AA batteries right up my ass.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And those two batteries are labeled wrestling and comics.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't have a weekly wrestling podcast yet, but at least we're getting there.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We're halfway there, living on a prayer.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We're halfway to the promised land.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Who knows, maybe someday I will have a wrestling podcast too.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But at least right now, I finally have this outlet for me to spew all of my undying,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
unbridled devotion to superheroes and comics

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and all of that goofy man-child bullshit.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know, if only I had some kind of man-child-centric YouTube channel.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know. I don't think I do. I can barely remember. I don't know.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But this is the podcast-centric YouTube channel.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And that's what it's all about, baby, because I am excited to be doing this.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I recently posted the very first edition of my new series, Amazing Comics, on my channel, Endless Jess.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And you can all go watch it right now if you haven't.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a video about Judge Dredd and why I think that he's a cool guy.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And his comics are awesome and everyone should read them.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's just me explaining the appeal of Judge Dredd as I see it in this first episode of my new series, Amazing Comics.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And in addition to that, I'm also doing this weekly podcast about comics

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
just to ease people into it and teach people, educate people about comics.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I'm excited because this is something that I've been wanting to do for years and years and years.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But everything I do takes me roughly 11 years of planning before I can actually get it off the ground and actually get it done.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's the creative process of me.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Everything needs to stay in, like, a metapod state so that it has time to grow from a fledgling idea

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
or a flight of fancy in my brain, a little seed in the back of my mind.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It needs time to sprout and evolve into an ill beedrill.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As the great poet me once said,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm a cocoon wait until I burst to an ill beedrill gonna kill with words.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I was thinking about this new thing I'm doing, this new avenue of making comic book videos,

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
this dream that I've finally achieved in my life of making comic book videos.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I was thinking that, you know, in addition to the Amazing Comics series on my channel, Endless Jest,

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that you should all go watch right now.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not sure if I've said that before, but I'm saying it right now for the 300th time.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You should go there right now and watch it and come back here.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In addition to that, I'll also be doing this weekly podcast to educate people about comics

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
because every comic book fan, here's the thing about comic book fans.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Every comic book fan secretly wants everyone else to be a comic book fan.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't think people realize that.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think people assume that comic book fans are gonna be elitist and not want anyone in their club like how most fandoms are.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I don't think comic book fans are like that because every time that you walk into a comic book store,

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I swear to God, the cashiers, they all light up like it's fucking Christmas Eve and Santa Claus just came into the chimney to get his comics.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Every comic book store in the world, when you go in there, everybody in there looks like they're happy to see you.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And me especially, my greatest joy in life is sharing the things that I love.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sharing cool stuff with everyone.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm like the end of the movie Ebenezer Scrooge of cool stuff, right?

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I started out as this crotchety old man, all miserly, hoarding my stuff like the dragon smough.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm totally, I'm mixing my analogies here.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm combining them into this grotesque, amorphous Akira blob of metaphors and analogies and references.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I try to keep up. I'm in a Akira blob made up of Ebenezer Scrooge and also the dragon smough.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I'm sitting under my lonely mountain slumbering on top of this hoard.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm a hot mess hoarder baby, I'm referencing myself now.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've got so many references inside me about cool stuff, the spew out at people, that half of my references are just me because I'm the coolest stuff of them all.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So I'm sitting on this pile of cool stuff that I've been hoarding for decades.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I killed the dwarf king, I took all of his cool stuff and I'm just sitting there in the mountain and nobody can have my cool stuff.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's my cool stuff.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know the joys of sharing yet.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm like the guy in the Barney movie where they went to the island and the guy was living in the tree house and he didn't want to share his cool inventions.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And Barney and friends taught him about the joy of sharing.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm also that guy in addition to being like smog and also like Ebenezer Scrooge.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's all the same metaphor, it's all the same basic idea.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's the same basic thing that I'm getting at here but it's three different stories, all of them at once happening, all at the same time in my brain.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm as miserly as all three of those guys put together and the lesson that I learned at the end about sharing is ten times more heartwarming than any of their lessons because it's all of them at once combined into a fusion.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Like Dragon Ball Z, like all of that like smog, you know what I'm getting at.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I'm that guy and I'm the dragon smog and I'm also the guy on the island in Barney and friends and I'm also Ebenezer Scrooge.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And then the ghost of Christmas, no, no, no, no, then Marley, Marley shows up.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Marley and Marley, they show up first and then the ghost, you know, how the story of a Christmas Carol goes, you know what happens, you get it.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The point is I learned the lesson about sharing and I run into the streets of London on Christmas morning with a bundle of gifts in my arms, all the cool stuff, all these things that I've loved throughout my life that have made me who I am,

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that have influenced me into becoming this unstoppable mass of nerd rage and pop culture knowledge that makes up the entity known as Endless Jess.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've got it all under my arms and I'm running out into the streets of London on Christmas morning and I'm throwing it at people.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm throwing my cool stuff. I'm not even asking if they want it. I'm fucking chucking it at their heads.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm taking a box of comics and I'm throwing it at some orphan's head and it's hitting him in the temple and knocking him over and he's bleeding on the ground and twitching and convulsing and dying.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But I don't care because he's got comics now and that's all I care about.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't care if you live or die. I just care that you understand and appreciate why all the stuff that I love is great and amazing.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
All the stuff that I love needs to be appreciated by everyone and I will beat you over the head with it until you learn, until you either learn or die.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I will beat you over the head with a box of comics and wrestling boots and controllers and video games and sexy naked girls, all of it.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's all the stuff that I like.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hamburgers, I'm gonna beat you to death with a fucking hamburger and a hot dog until you learn to show respect, until you put respect on the name of all the stuff that I like.

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Anyways, let's talk about comics. I think that's enough of an intro.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, so here's the format of this show.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Real laid back, I read comics every week and I'm just gonna go through all the comics that I read this week and kind of review them, I guess, and go over my thoughts and probably spurred out and go on a bunch of wild impassioned rants and tangents because when you really love something, you also really hate it.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know, I love comics just like I love wrestling and just like with wrestling, I know how good it's supposed to be so when it's bad, this nerd rage just boils inside me like a thermometer that's about to pop and cover the world with acid.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And everybody melts and dies like that guy at the end of Robocop.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's horrible, it's brutal, it's violent, it's grotesque, you don't want that, you don't want to see it man.

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So this first episode of the podcast is actually going to be a giant sized episode because I'm covering two weeks worth of comics here.

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I was all set to record this last week and it took me a week, I had to do other stuff, the idea still needed one more week in the idea cocoon.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And now it's finally ready so I'm gonna go over last week's comics and then this week's comics.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So here we are for the week of Wednesday, October the 11th.

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I mean 12!

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, so the first comic that I want to talk about that I read last week is Deadpool number 20.

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is a one shot, one shots are always cool.

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That means it's not a part of like an ongoing arc or a story, it's just an issue that anybody can pick up and buy.

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
One shots are usually fun, I always like checking them out, picking them up, buying them.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because there's no commitment, you know.

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Nowadays every story is an 8 issue epic.

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A huge fucking universe sprawling event with 11 core issues and 50 backup issues and sticking its tendrils into every other comic in the company.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And if you buy one fucking comic you have to buy the whole goddamn story and end up spending $500.

121
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So thank god that once in a while you can at least get your hands on a nice, succinct, compact one shot that tells a complete story in 22 pages.

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's an art to that.

123
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There is an art that is being lost nowadays when it comes to brevity in comics, especially superhero comics.

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's ridiculous because some of the most beloved comic book stories of all time were stories that were one shots or two shots, you know.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Either one issue or two issues.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Days of future past from the X-Men.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This revolutionary story that everybody remembers, that everybody looks back on fondly, it was made into a fucking movie.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's like two issues.

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a short fucking story.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The killing joke, one of the most influential Batman stories ever written.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's like what, 40 pages, maybe less?

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
One shots are cool.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Keep that shit to the point.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't waste my fucking time and don't waste my fucking money.

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So this is Deadpool number 20 and it's a one shot.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I think right from the cover of the book, you know exactly what the story is going to be.

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The cover of this issue is Deadpool sitting on a rooftop with a girl immediately just from looking at it.

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you're genre savvy, if you're comic savvy, you know exactly what they're doing.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is a parody, a Deadpool version of one of the classic superhero tropes.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Which is the superhero having to talk a person down from suicide.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think eventually every superhero deals with this story or has to contend with this premise.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because it's sort of an inherently interesting premise.

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know, you take these larger than life fictional superheroes who are usually punching aliens

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and fighting super villains and robots and all this fantastical stuff.

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
All this outrageous out of this world conflict.

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And you put them in a very down to earth realistic conflict.

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Like having to talk someone down from suicide.

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And it's a premise that if the character is good, if it's a superhero that the writer understands

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
or is, you know, a three dimensional character with a very strongly defined personality,

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
then the premise sort of writes itself.

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You just take character A, sit them next to suicidal nobody B, and you just let them talk.

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You let them, you see what happens.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You see how I talked about this on the plebe and the weave.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
One of my favorite things about fiction is just seeing the tropes.

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I love tropes because I love seeing, I love characters.

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And I love seeing how all of these different characters and different personalities interact with

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and resolve the same tropes.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think that tropes get a bad rap.

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think people say all this stories cliche or, you know, this has been done before.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, yeah, everything's been done before, but I think that sometimes the most basic reusable stories

161
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
are the ones that you can get the most mileage out of if you're a skilled writer

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
or if you have a really strong character at the center of them.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So this is that for Deadpool.

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And it's obviously, you know, any comic that does this trope

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
is more or less directly pulling from Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman,

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
which is probably the most famous example of this in comics.

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You know, it's that famous, it's just like one page out of the comic

168
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
where Superman is dying, he's got like poison, he's got kryptonite poisoning,

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and he's on his last legs, but he's still going around the world

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
solving crimes and doing good deeds and helping people out.

171
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And it's just one page where he, you know, he zooms up behind this girl,

172
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
this young teenage gothy looking girl who's about to jump off a building and kill herself,

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and he just fucking supermans his way right up behind her,

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and he says this perfect, brilliant little quote.

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let me see if I remember it correctly.

176
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I believe it was,

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
your doctor really did get held up, Reagan.

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's never as bad as it seems.

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Which is such a fucking perfect quote because it's just vague enough.

180
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It like implies this whole story that you as the reader don't know about,

181
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
but you don't necessarily have to know about.

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It gives, like in two sentences,

183
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Grant Morrison gives this character that we've never seen before

184
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
an entire history and an entire personality

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that you can sort of fill in for yourself as the reader,

186
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
just based on what Superman says in like two sentences.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And it's so effective and it makes you feel for the girl

188
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and it builds up Superman as like this amazing guy who just knows everything

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and he's always listening and he's always there for you.

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And you just read those fucking lines and you just look at that panel,

191
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
that one page with no other context behind it except for what's on the page.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And you read it and you just fucking instantly tear up every time.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's the most touching thing in the world.

194
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And in like even though it's part of an entire graphic novel,

195
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of like an entire 12 issue story,

196
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
all of that is almost totally superfluous

197
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
because right in the middle of it,

198
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
in the span of all of like two or three panels,

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
he tells the ultimate Superman story,

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the greatest most important Superman story ever told

201
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that you ever need.

202
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Pretty much the only Superman story that you ever need

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is told in those two or three panels in the middle of the book

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
of just Superman, he's flying around the fucking world helping people

205
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and he sees a girl about to jump off a fucking building

206
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and he gets behind her and he says some stuff

207
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and he comforts her and he fucking saves her,

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
not even with his superpowers, not with super strength,

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
not with X-ray vision or super speed,

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
with super compassion, motherfucker.

211
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's Superman's real power.

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's why Superman fucking rules

213
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and it's the most amazing thing in the world.

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You read it, it makes you cry every time.

215
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's a fucking tear-jerker for sure.

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And that's probably the most famous example of this particular trope.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So of course the whole hook of this book right here,

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Deadpool number 20,

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the whole hook of it,

220
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
sort of the satire or parody element of it

221
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
is, you know, let's take that incredibly touching Superman story,

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
let's take that trope that was so famously,

223
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
incredibly touching in Superman

224
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and let's apply it to cynical, apathetic,

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
crass and stupid Deadpool.

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a perfect recipe for instant comedy.

227
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You know, like I said, it writes itself.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You take a trope that works for one character

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and you see how it works with a completely different character.

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's the magic of tropes and that's why I love them.

231
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So you see this book, you know,

232
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
you walk into the comic book store

233
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and you see a book and it's a Deadpool comic

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and the cover of the comic is a girl,

235
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you know, standing on a rooftop with Deadpool sitting beside her

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and you take one look at the cover of the comic

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and you instantly know what kind of story it is.

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know what they're doing

239
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and you're instantly hooked because yes,

240
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of course I want to see how this trope applies to Deadpool.

241
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Deadpool, the, you know, the wisecracking cynical jerkass,

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the merc with the mouth, the regenerating degenerate,

243
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
this ugly perverted bastard with a heart of gold.

244
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Who wouldn't want to read that?

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Nobody, that's who. Nobody wouldn't want to read that.

246
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And so now you've heard me gush about the premise for 10 minutes.

247
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You probably want to know what I actually thought of the comic.

248
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How well did it deliver on that premise?

249
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Was I entertained by the final product

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
as much as I am entertained by the premise inherently?

251
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The answer is yes.

252
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It was a good-ass comic.

253
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It was funny and it felt true to the character of Deadpool

254
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and it even succeeded in being a little bit heartwarming.

255
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You know, it starts out, the girl's on the building,

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
she's about to kill herself.

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Deadpool comes up, he says,

258
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
no, don't do it.

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And, you know, she immediately says,

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
ah, shut up, don't try to talk me down,

261
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
don't pretend like you care.

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And immediately Deadpool, being Deadpool,

263
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
just totally throws her off guard

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
by saying like, hey lady, don't put words in my mouth.

265
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't say I care.

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm trying to care, but you're making it difficult.

267
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So that catches her off guard

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and they start having a conversation

269
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
a little bit of a back and forth.

270
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Deadpool's trying to talk her down,

271
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
but he doesn't really know how to do it exactly

272
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
because he's not that kind of superhero.

273
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Deadpool is not the guy who inspires people.

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Deadpool's the guy who kills people

275
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and makes dumb jokes about Mexican food.

276
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So that's what he's doing.

277
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He's making dumb jokes about Mexican food.

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He's sort of awkwardly trying and failing

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to talk her down from suicide.

280
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
His dumb jokes aren't really impressing her.

281
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So finally he says, you know what, fine,

282
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
why don't you just hang out with me for the night

283
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and we'll go have some fun.

284
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And if you still feel like jumping off a building

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
at the end of the night,

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
then I'll let you jump off a building,

287
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
but Parker Industries is down the road that way.

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, jump off of somebody else's building.

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't jump off of my building

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because I don't need the bad publicity.

291
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So she says fine and they're going around the city

292
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and they're doing stuff

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and basically Deadpool is taking her

294
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
on his wacky, mercenary errands.

295
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So he's breaking into like drug lords' apartments

296
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and hoodlums and beating people up

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and shooting people and killing bad guys and all that.

298
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And she's sort of tagging along

299
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and sort of being his sidekick for the night.

300
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And the whole time he's cracking jokes

301
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and he's playing on his phone

302
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
like he doesn't give a shit and you know, all that stuff.

303
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Then at the end of the comic,

304
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
she goes, she says like, oh, you know,

305
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that was fun and all, but you didn't change my mind.

306
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I still am depressed and I still kind of want to kill myself.

307
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know, maybe, maybe I'm not totally sure

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that I want to kill myself,

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
but you didn't exactly cure my depression, buddy.

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And Deadpool's like, shut up, baby. I know it.

311
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's why I'm taking you here.

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And Deadpool takes her to the fucking hospital.

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And it turns out that the entire comic,

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
when he was playing on his phone,

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
what he was actually doing was texting the hospital

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and letting them know that he's bringing in

317
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
a suicidal person later that night.

318
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So they're ready for her.

319
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And he has this speech at the end.

320
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Of course I'm paraphrasing because I read it a week ago.

321
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But um, so I don't remember the exact quote,

322
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
but you know, he has this little speech tour

323
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
at the end where he's like, you know,

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I try to be a good superhero,

325
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but we both know that I'm not the kind of guy

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
who can help you with this problem.

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So I decided to take you to people

328
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
who can help you with this problem.

329
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And she goes off and then Deadpool,

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
you know, he goes out of the hospital.

331
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He's feeling a little bit better about himself.

332
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And then he steps in a pile of poop.

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And that's how the issue ends.

334
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And a cute little joke of Deadpool stepping in poop.

335
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So it was a very in-character and very clever way

336
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
to handle this premise where Deadpool

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
has this self-awareness.

338
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And he understands that this is not where his strength lies.

339
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
His strength lies in cutting people's heads off and stuff.

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He has a great quote in this where he's like,

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
where he's sort of sized to himself

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
as he's watching here get taken away by the hospital staff.

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And he sighs and he goes,

344
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
unkilling someone is way harder than what I usually do.

345
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, that Deadpool.

346
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And so yeah, you have a character

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
acknowledging his weaknesses and his flaws

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and finding a clever way to solve a problem

349
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that he did not expect to have to deal with

350
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
by working around those flaws.

351
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's a great little character moment for Deadpool

352
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
of just acknowledging his weakness as a superhero

353
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and making an effort to resolve the problem

354
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the way a non-superhero would resolve the problem.

355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It was very down to earth and it really is like a special...

356
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It says a lot about Deadpool in the same way

357
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
that the Superman story that it's parodying

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
says a lot about Superman.

359
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And that's why I love tropes

360
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because how these different characters react to the same problems

361
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
is a great device for exploring those characters.

362
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So that's Deadpool number 20.

363
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I highly recommend it. Everybody should go out and buy it

364
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and read it or whatever.

365
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I know I spoiled the entire comic,

366
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but you know, fuck it, I don't really...

367
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't think a spoiler like that is going to hinder

368
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
your enjoyment of the comic if you pick it up.

369
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, if you're in the comments

370
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
pissing and moaning about spoilers,

371
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
shut the fuck up.

372
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Go fucking cry me a river somewhere else.

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Go sit in the fucking corner with a dunce hat

374
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and eat your own shit like the diaper-wearing baby you are.

375
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I ain't got time for that shit.

376
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I ain't got time for people...

377
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
For any spoiler cry babies in the comments section.

378
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Look people, I will use my own discretion

379
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
on this podcast when it comes to

380
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
what I think is a harmful spoiler

381
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and what I think is a negligible spoiler

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
because there is a difference, okay?

383
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
There are some things that are technically

384
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
spoilers of what happens in the story,

385
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
but they will not affect your enjoyment of the story

386
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
in any negative way.

387
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Obviously, if there's a comic

388
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that hinges on some huge reveal

389
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
that's supposed to be a big surprise,

390
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
then that would be a spoiler that I'm not going to spoil.

391
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But I don't want to hear any fucking people

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
crying that I spoiled this fucking one-shot Deadpool comic

393
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that you ain't never even heard of before this podcast anyways.

394
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
God damn it.

395
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You weren't going to buy it anyways,

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but now you are going to buy it because I'm telling you

397
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that it's fucking great and you can suck my dick.

398
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay, that's that.

399
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The next comic that I picked up last week

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
was Gwenpool.

401
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We're going from Deadpool to Gwenpool,

402
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the unbelievable Gwenpool number seven.

403
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Gwenpool is a new character.

404
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
She was created last year, late last year.

405
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
She's been a little bit divisive.

406
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Some people see her as just a, you know,

407
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
an unoriginal premise

408
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and a corporate marketing gimmick

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and they don't like her.

410
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But those people are stupid

411
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
because even a corporate marketing gimmick

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
can have heart, damn it.

413
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Even an unoriginal idea

414
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
can lead to good storytelling.

415
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You dummies, you dumb stupid idiots.

416
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So if you don't know who Gwenpool is,

417
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
she is a normal teenage girl

418
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
from our world who loves comic books

419
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and has found herself in the Marvel Universe

420
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and is using her comic book savviness

421
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and genre savviness to navigate

422
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the fictional universe of Marvel Comics.

423
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So a very tropey story.

424
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Once again, you've seen this a million times before.

425
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's one of the oldest, most overdone premises there is.

426
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You know, audience insert character from our world

427
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
gets zapped into the fictional world

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and their only power is that they've got nerd knowledge

429
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and their genre savvy about what's going on.

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And a lot of people see that kind of overdone

431
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
sort of hacky premise

432
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and they just kind of write it off based on that.

433
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I just reviewed an anime called Re Zero

434
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
on The Pleeve and the Weeb over on Digibro's channel

435
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
where we both shit on that show

436
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
pretty relentlessly for having

437
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
the same hacky, tired premise.

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But the difference was that that show

439
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
wasn't well written.

440
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We didn't do anything interesting with that overdone premise.

441
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's why we didn't like it.

442
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Like I said, I'm 100% in favor of tropes.

443
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I love them.

444
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And any trope, any premise, no matter how hacky

445
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
can be entertaining

446
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and worth reading

447
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
if it's expounded upon in a captivating manner.

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If it's written well.

449
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And is Gwenpool written well so far?

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You better believe it, baby.

451
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This series does do interesting things

452
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
with the premise.

453
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It utilizes it

454
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
in creative and clever ways.

455
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Like for example, her name,

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
right off the bat, is a clever little in-joke.

457
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The joke is that being genre savvy

458
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and being knowledgeable about comics,

459
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
the first thing she does

460
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
upon getting zapped into the comic book world

461
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
is she fashions herself a little Deadpool knockoff costume

462
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and she starts calling herself Gwenpool.

463
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because she figures

464
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that the only way to survive in the Marvel Universe

465
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
is to become someone important

466
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
so that people will want to read her adventures.

467
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So if she names herself

468
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
after the two most eye-catching names

469
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
in the Marvel Universe, Gwen Stacy and Deadpool,

470
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and combines them into a portmanteau of Gwenpool,

471
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
then people will be interested and they will buy her comic

472
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and she will survive and be a successful character

473
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
in this universe.

474
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So the name Gwenpool is a totally shameless marketing ploy,

475
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but they make it a part of the narrative

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
where she picked that name

477
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to be a shameless marketing ploy

478
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
as a means of interacting and surviving the Marvel Universe.

479
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You know, people see the comic and they go,

480
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
who the fuck is this, Gwenpool?

481
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What did they bring back Gwen Stacy

482
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and they made her a Deadpool clone now?

483
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What the fuck is this shit?

484
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Goddamn stupid, I have to read it.

485
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I have to buy it.

486
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And then they buy it and they read it

487
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and they go, oh, it's not what I thought it was.

488
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's actually a clever little twist.

489
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
She named herself that on purpose

490
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
to get me to buy it.

491
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
She rused me.

492
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It was a clever ruse and it worked.

493
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And now that I'm reading the book,

494
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I see that it's clever and entertaining and interesting

495
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
and I'm gonna keep reading it.

496
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's brilliant, it's genius.

497
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I like it.

498
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And there's all kinds of little things like that

499
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
throughout the series.

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Little clever utilizations of the premise.

501
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Like for example, in this issue,

502
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
this issue starts with there's these

503
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
like octopus aliens coming down

504
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and shooting up the place and wrecking up New York

505
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and you know, it's an alien invasion

506
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and Gwenpool is able to fool them

507
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
by putting her costume on a little pig

508
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and sending it off into the city

509
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and they mistake the pig for her

510
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
because they don't know what humans look like.

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
They can't tell humans apart from pigs

512
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
because they're stupid aliens.

513
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And somebody asks her,

514
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
how did you know that that ridiculous

515
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
cockamamie plan would work?

516
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And Gwen's answer is,

517
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I have never seen those particular aliens

518
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
before in a Marvel comic.

519
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Therefore, I knew that they were created

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
specifically for me to deal with.

521
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Therefore, I knew that my cockamamie

522
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
asinine plan would work.

523
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So unlike a lot of shows like Re Zero, for example,

524
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
which utterly fail to deliver on this

525
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
genre-savvy protagonist promise of a premise,

526
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Gwenpool actually does consistently deliver

527
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
on that premise.

528
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And it's even a little bit feelsy at times.

529
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It does manage to have a little bit of pathos

530
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
at certain points.

531
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Because Gwenpool, of course, she comes to this universe

532
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and she's very arrogant

533
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and thinks she knows all the answers

534
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and thinks it's going to be a walk in the park.

535
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This is going to be all fun and games.

536
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And because of that, she screws up a little bit.

537
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
She makes some mistakes.

538
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
She gets a friend of hers killed at the beginning

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and is very sad.

540
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And she slowly realizes that while she may be

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
zapped into a fictional universe,

542
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
while she's there, for her, it's real.

543
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So there are consequences to her idiotic actions.

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And there are some moments where she makes mistakes

545
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and has to become sad.

546
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's good.

547
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
She's a good character.

548
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
She's, you know, this character could have easily been

549
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
one-dimensional and stupid and utterly worthless.

550
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But they've succeeded in making her likeable

551
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and three-dimensional.

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There was one issue where she teamed up with Spider-Man.

553
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Not the real Spider-Man.

554
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm talking fucking Kmart brand Miles Morales Spider-Man.

555
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Don't get me started on that shit.

556
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But she's teaming up with Spider-Man

557
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and they're trying to catch this, like,

558
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
would-be school shooter.

559
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And of course, Gwen doesn't take it seriously

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and she's talking all this, you know,

561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
fourth-wall breaking genre-savvy comic book trash.

562
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And it's all going totally over Spidey's head.

563
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And she tries to kill this kid.

564
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
She flat out just tries to kill him because fuck it.

565
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
She's in a fictional world.

566
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
She can kill people who cares.

567
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
They don't matter.

568
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
They're not real, right?

569
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So of course Spider-Man freaks out.

570
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He's like, what are you doing?

571
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You can't kill people.

572
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And she starts talking all this shit.

573
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like, no, you don't understand.

574
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I remember this guy from the Ultimate Comics.

575
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They brought him back to the mainline Marvel Universe.

576
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The only reason that they would bring him back

577
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
is because somebody remembered him.

578
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
He was created just for you.

579
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He doesn't matter.

580
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He's not a real person.

581
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He's not even an important villain.

582
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
He's just some random dropped plot line

583
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
from an old comic book series that somebody remembered

584
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and decided to bring back to finish off here.

585
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
He's not important.

586
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
He's not even real.

587
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I can just kill him.

588
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And of course, Miles Morales freaks out

589
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and fucking punches her in the face

590
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and ties her up and says,

591
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
holy shit, you're a crazy person.

592
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You can't go around killing people.

593
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And she's all sad because she likes the superheroes,

594
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but the superheroes don't like her

595
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
because she's basically a fucking maniac

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
because she has a hard time accepting

597
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
that anything around her is real.

598
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's all fictional.

599
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And she's just kind of amoral because of it.

600
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And she's basically just Subaru, but done right.

601
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I mean, all of you little anime faggots out there,

602
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
you turds who pissed and moaned

603
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that me and Digi didn't give a high enough score

604
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
to fucking re-zero.

605
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Well, this is why, because re-zero didn't deliver

606
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
on its premise in any interesting ways,

607
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
whereas you have a series like Gwenpool

608
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
over here in my American comics, a superior medium,

609
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
you have a series like Gwenpool,

610
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
which is the exact same premise,

611
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
but done right, done correctly,

612
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
done interestingly and entertainingly,

613
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and they actually succeed

614
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
in making a likable, decent protagonist

615
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
who is arrogant because of her genre-savvyness

616
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and does make mistakes,

617
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
but actually learns from them

618
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and still manages to be somewhat relatable

619
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and fun to read about despite those flaws.

620
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So, Gwenpool number seven, highly recommended.

621
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The entire Gwenpool line so far,

622
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I say is highly recommended.

623
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I think everybody should be reading Gwenpool.

624
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's a really good comic.

625
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And re-zero gets a zero out of ten.

626
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Fuck you all.

627
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You're all a bunch of stupid whiny babies.

628
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You don't know shit about fuck.

629
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I hate weeaboos.

630
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't respect you.

631
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Go to hell and die.

632
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Next up, we have My Little Pony,

633
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Friends Forever number 32.

634
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So, the My Little Pony,

635
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Friends Forever comic series is a spin-off

636
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
of the regular My Little Pony,

637
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Friendship is Magic comic series,

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
which itself is a spin-off

639
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
of the My Little Pony,

640
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Friendship is Magic TV series,

641
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
which itself is the fourth iteration

642
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
of the My Little Pony children's cartoon franchise.

643
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So, it's like, you know, turtles all the way down.

644
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's just My Little Pony all the way back,

645
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
stretching through history to the dawn of man.

646
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
When the first Neanderthal stepped out of his cave

647
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and was brutally murdered by the first Homo sapien,

648
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
ushering in the age of man,

649
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the Homo sapien he bashed in the Neanderthal's skull

650
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
with a rock and he stood over his blooded corpse

651
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and he beat his chest

652
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and he howled into the sky

653
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
a mighty cry, a mighty roar

654
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
that sounded like this.

655
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,860
So, the premise of the Friendship Forever series

656
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:47,660
basically just taking two characters who normally don't get to interact with each

657
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,740
other as much and pairing them up for little adventures. Again, another trope

658
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,260
that I love. Futurama did this a lot, especially in like the first Comedy

659
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,340
Central season when it first came back. They had a lot of episodes that were

660
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:08,180
this premise of teaming up Bender and Amy or Bender and Hermes, you know, or the

661
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,020
Professor and Zordberg and going into their history together. You can get a

662
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,100
lot of interesting stories that way by just pairing up characters who don't

663
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,620
normally pair up together and seeing how they interact. You can get a lot of

664
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,580
clever little stories out of a premise like that and you can get a lot of clever

665
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,780
little character moments out of a premise like that. So it's always

666
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,780
interesting to see and this one, issue number 32 of Friends Forever, struck me

667
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,060
as particularly interesting, so I had to buy it. The cover leapt right at me, right

668
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,620
off the shelf. I immediately took one look at it and said, well I got to read

669
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:48,820
this. It's Fluttershy and Daring Dew on an adventure together. You should see, you

670
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,180
gotta see the cover for this. It's beautiful. It's, they're flying through

671
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,300
like a, an exploding like the inside of a volcano it looks like or some cave with

672
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,980
lava. This is cool. She's got like, it's awesome. It's dynamic and it's

673
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,500
pretty and it's beautiful and it's cute and it's a character team-up that you

674
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,860
never see. So I had to get it, had to check it out, had to read it, see for

675
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,820
myself. If it was as cool as it looked and let me tell you people, it was

676
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,860
exactly as cool as it looked. I'm not gonna say that it totally blew me away but

677
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,300
it certainly didn't disappoint me either. It's pretty much, it's a My Little Pony

678
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,740
comic. If you, if you like My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, the show, if

679
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,860
you're a brony kind of person or if you're into it, if you like My Little Pony then

680
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,340
you know exactly what you're getting when you pick this up. It's very funny. It's

681
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,340
well written. Just the first page is sort of instantly sets the tone. It's

682
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,260
fluttershy. She's in her cottage and she's going over her calendar and she's

683
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,700
all excited. She's like, oh boy, I finally have a whole week off with no

684
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,700
adventures. I don't have to save Equestria this week. No, you know, annoying, stupid

685
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,540
bullshit. I'm just gonna take it easy and have a nice, relaxing, adventure-free

686
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,180
weekend. And then Daring do just burst into the door and she's like, we gotta go

687
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,180
on an adventure. Rainbow Dash told me that you're good with animals. Let's go

688
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,020
fucking fight animals or save animals. We're going to the jungle. Let's go

689
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,740
fucking yeah. And she, and she, and she sort of looked at the camera and she

690
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:29,780
winks and she goes, not again. The studio audience goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, great

691
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,180
stuff. Classic. Can't wait to see how this adventure is going to pan out. So they

692
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,900
go on this adventure and so the main gist of this adventure is that there's

693
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,700
this species of spider that has like a map on its back. It's got markings on

694
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,980
its little spidery abdomen in the shape of a map. And if you find all the

695
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,700
spiders together, then their little butts will combine to form a map to some

696
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,180
treasure or some shit. And Daring do needs Fluttershy's help because

697
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,420
Fluttershy is an animal expert who loves little spiders and this was a very cute

698
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,340
little touch, a very enjoyable little detail because the reason that she needs

699
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,740
her in particular is because Daring do is afraid of spiders the same way that

700
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,700
Indiana Jones is afraid of snakes. So that was clever. That was nice. I like

701
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,340
that. Until they go and they have a funny little cute adventure. Who is Odle is

702
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,780
there. He still sucks. He's still a really shitty character design guy. Why is

703
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,980
his face on the end of his nose? I hate that. It's terrible. He's the worst guy.

704
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,780
I think Daring do needs a new villain seriously because that guy sucks. But

705
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,900
anyways, they fight them. There's spiders and there's, you know, it's

706
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,660
Fluttershy. It's cute. It's funny. It's my little pony. What is there

707
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:58,580
to say? It's just a nice, cute, fun little adventure. Yeah, cute and fun. Just

708
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:05,140
like the show before fucking season six came and ruined it. Season six isn't

709
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:12,100
that bad. It's pretty bad though. Hey, we're not talking about that. That's the

710
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,860
past. You got to put your behind in your past. You got to look forward to the

711
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:20,740
future. I'm a comic spoi now. Not a horse boy. I'm still a horse boy. Get out of

712
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:29,420
here. Nobody wants you. Go to the furnace room. Yeah. Okay. Sorry for that.

713
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:38,460
Little spat roommates quarrel that you all had to witness. Fucking Colt

714
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,020
Corona. He's still a horse boy. Man, I can't blame him. He's literally a horse

715
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:54,420
boy. Anyways, onto my comic of the week for last week. Teenage mutant ninja

716
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,780
turtles number 63. So right off the bat, I got to talk about just this whole

717
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,660
modern turtles series in general. It's been going on now for, I don't know, maybe

718
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:12,220
four or five years. I mean, it's on 63. So do the math yourself. How many months is

719
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:17,180
that? 63 months is a couple years. It's been going strong. It's been very

720
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,700
consistently high quality from the first issue pretty much. It's been a great

721
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:28,380
series. I've been shouting its merits from the rooftops for a while. It's

722
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:35,060
probably all together my favorite incarnation of the turtles. Definitely up

723
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,860
there because the turtles have had so many different incarnations and re-

724
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,540
imaginings over the years. It's a franchise that just never dies. It's

725
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:52,900
always evolving to fit its era. The original comics in the 80s were sort of

726
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:59,060
a satire of gritty, dark 80s comics like Daredevil and Dark Knight Return. So

727
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,900
they were very dark and then from there the cartoon series that came out in

728
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,980
the late 80s and early 90s was very lighthearted and cartoony. It was a

729
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,940
show for kids and it was marketing all the toys and stuff. Then the

730
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,580
movies that came out, the movie was sort of a nice middle ground between the

731
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:24,780
serious comics and the cartoony cartoon. It was pretty good. The movies are

732
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:31,180
and then there was more. There was a live action TV series. There was a

733
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:37,100
second cartoon series in the early mid-2000s. There was a whole new terrible

734
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,940
Michael Bay movie franchise. Out of the Shadows wasn't that bad. It was okay.

735
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,940
Bebop and Rocksteady were pretty great. The Turtles just keeps on surviving

736
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,860
because it keeps on changing and adapting and it's always different. What I

737
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:57,100
love about this current incarnation from IDW is that these comics have

738
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:04,140
achieved this fantastic balance of every incarnation of the Turtles ever. They've

739
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,820
taken elements from the original comics and from the cartoons and the

740
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,540
movies and the 2000s cartoon and all of these different elements from all of

741
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,420
these different incarnations of the Turtles and they've blended them

742
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:27,740
together into this cohesive continuity and this cohesive narrative that is

743
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:34,540
like perfect. It's just a perfect, it's the perfect Turtles saga. A

744
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,820
Turtles stew, if you will. They've done a fantastic job and I love it. So issue

745
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:46,420
number 63, which is my comic of the week. This is setting up a very interesting

746
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:53,380
story with the Turtles that I have not seen done before. A little backstory

747
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:58,740
going into this issue. Shredder is dead. They've defeated Shredder. They've

748
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,980
defeated the Foot Clan and in the aftermath of defeating Shredder, Master

749
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:10,020
Splinter has become the new head of the Foot Clan. So this clan of ninjas who

750
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,580
were their enemies, now Splinter is in charge of all of them and he's, you know,

751
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,100
trying to make them a force for good in the world and having to deal with their

752
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:25,340
responsibility of leading this massive army of ninjas. And in this issue in

753
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,140
particular, it gets really interesting because Donatello has this scientist

754
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,340
friend named Harold and Harold gets kidnapped by this gang called the

755
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,540
Street Phantoms who are like a rival gang to the Foot Clan and they go to Master

756
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:47,100
Splinter about it and Master Splinter goes, yes, all according to plan. I used

757
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,980
Harold as bait so that the Street Phantoms would kidnap him and reveal their

758
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,980
location so that the foot may strike. And so of course the Turtles are like,

759
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,140
wait a minute, that's kind of fucked up. You used our friend as bait and Master

760
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,140
Splinter is like assuring them. I knew that nothing, I knew that they wouldn't

761
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:11,020
hurt him. He's too valuable. His scientific mind, they needed him. I knew that he

762
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:15,220
would be okay. Trust me, this was all for the greater good. I knew what I was

763
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:20,220
doing but it's like a Ken, like what's going on here? Is Master Splinter

764
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,580
being corrupted or compromised by his new position? And that's so fucking cool and

765
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,780
interesting. You know, I've been a fan of the Turtles forever. I've never seen

766
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,460
them tackle this story before. I've never seen them come at it from this

767
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,540
angle before where suddenly Master Splinter is in charge of the fucking

768
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,020
Foot Clan and he's trying to make them good guys but you have to wonder if he's

769
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,100
changing the Foot Clan or if the Foot Clan is changing him. You have to wonder

770
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:55,140
if Master Splinter really knows what he's doing or if he's slowly being

771
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:02,660
corrupted by his new job. This is so fucking cool. Oh god, it's so awesome!

772
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,220
Like how often do we see like any character development for Master Splinter

773
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,820
at all, right? Like how often does he even factor in as a character? He's usually

774
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,060
just like the wise mentor, but these fucking comics have been so good. Like

775
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:26,780
Like every character in this series gets fleshed out and has arcs and changes to their personality.

776
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,040
Every character matters.

777
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,040
Everything in this series, oh god it's so good, it's so fucking good, oh god!

778
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,800
So yeah, and there's a part where Leonardo is talking to Master Splinter.

779
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:46,080
He says, um, look, uh, the other guys are concerned, you know, Leonardo is basically

780
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,800
confronting him about these concerns.

781
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:57,060
And Master Splinter has this talk with Leonardo and it's so fucking well written where Master

782
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,100
Splinter is justifying his actions to Leonardo and he's kinda right.

783
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,140
Like it's sort of, it makes Leonardo step back and wonder like maybe I was wrong to

784
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,560
confront Master Splinter even though like his gut feeling is telling him that Master

785
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,100
Splinter is making a mistake and you the reader, your gut feeling is that Master Splinter

786
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,800
is being corrupted, but at the same time he's kind of swaying you.

787
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,960
You're like, you know that does kinda make sense because Master Splinter is um, he's

788
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:35,520
bringing up a scenario from like a little while ago when the turtles went over his head and

789
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,920
didn't involve him in the full extent of their plans and kept him in the dark because they

790
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,440
had a plan to sort of like, you know, re-kajigger the techno-drome without his knowing of it

791
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,460
and he would've disapproved so they went over his head and didn't tell him their full plan

792
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,440
and he's bringing that up and he's like, you know, Leonardo, my son, at the time you

793
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,780
left me out of your plans and you kept me in the dark because you thought I would've

794
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,580
disapproved and you were right, I would've disapproved at the time, but only because

795
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,140
I didn't know what you knew and I would've been wrong so you were right to go over my

796
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:16,200
head and so now I need you and your brothers to trust me that I know things that you don't

797
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,880
and trust me when I'm leaving you in the dark about the full extent of my plans and trust

798
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,080
that I'm doing the right thing and it's like, you know that using the guy as bait was a

799
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,400
pretty shitty thing to do, but you also, you can't really argue with Master Splinter's

800
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,320
logic there, he's totally right, so Leonardo just kinda shuffles off to his brothers kinda

801
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:41,820
defeated like, you know, I talked to Master Splinter, I don't know, he kinda has a point

802
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:47,380
I guess and you're reading it and you're like, yeah, I guess, I fucking shit, so it's so

803
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,300
good, it's presenting this conflict that is so interesting and it's presenting it well,

804
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,700
you know, you could've easily done this badly and had it fall flat and just come off as

805
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,580
try hard and shitty and, but they didn't, it's really well written and it's really great

806
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,000
and so then, so the turtles are going to attack the street phantoms, right, they're going

807
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,360
to rescue their friend Harold and while this is all happening, it's also cutting to Harold,

808
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:17,200
the scientist tied up to a chair being interrogated by the street phantom guy and Harold's a great

809
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,840
character too, he's like this sardonic, cynical, rude sort of doctor house type character,

810
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,160
like he knows he's a genius and he doesn't have to put up with any shit, he's just some

811
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,920
weak guy in a lab coat, he can't defend himself, but he's tied to a chair being interrogated

812
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,900
and he's just being a huge dick, he's just not cooperating, he's like, shut up, you can't

813
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,820
threaten me, I'm fucking smarter than you, my fucking turtle friends are gonna come over

814
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,660
here and kick your ass, it's great, all the scenes of Harold being interrogated are great

815
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:51,180
and so then it's the turtles and they're going to, you know, they're gonna break in there

816
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:57,020
and rescue Harold and all of a sudden they're surrounded by street phantoms, they're surrounded

817
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,160
by all these bad guys and you know, master splinter's there, he's got a couple like foot

818
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:07,200
clan ninjas as backup so it's, you know, it's the turtles and master splinter and a bunch

819
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,040
of foot clan ninjas like together as a team and they're, but they're surrounded, they're

820
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,520
still outnumbered by these street phantoms, there's too many of them and they're like,

821
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,120
oh god, master splinter, we're surrounded, what do we do, you gotta tell the foot ninjas

822
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,320
to attack, you gotta give them the goat to charge forward and master splinter's like

823
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:31,100
not yet, wait a minute, we don't need to and then it reveals, it looks up, the fucking

824
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:38,100
cavalry arrives and who is it, motherfucking Casey Jones, the last page, Casey Jones comes

825
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:46,140
to back up the turtles but it's not just Casey Jones, oh no, it's Casey Jones and the purple

826
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,980
dragons, in this continuity the purple dragons are like another street gang that like Casey

827
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,360
Jones's father was in control of and they used to be bad guys or whatever and Casey

828
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,680

00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:11,040
army of dudes in hockey masks with purple dragons painted on the hockey masks and so Casey Jones
