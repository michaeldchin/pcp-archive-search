00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters, and God said,

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, you are. Pause. You guys ruined my dramatic pause.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, you want me to clap?

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes, that's what I wanted.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Best guy ever!

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Good. Let's do this every time. Let's see, who's here today? We got Mumkey Jones.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey, what's up everybody? I'm Mumkey Jones. I am the monkey with the Jones. The Jones is the monkey. The monkey is the Jones you ever know.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What's up, Munchy?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They said I couldn't fit all my electrical wires up my urethra.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hippocrit, once again is here.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Nothing's worse could cause me physical pain.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, hey, you interrupted the man's interest at Baron right there.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now it's depressed given. No intro for me.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And back after a long hiatus, Lethal Aurora Mage graced us with her presence.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello, I'm here again.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wait, Mage, you brought us all presents?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can I have my present first?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're not listening to me. You're not. Things are going out of control.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So today, we're going to talk about creators. Creators that we love and hate.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hate.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, I forgot about hate.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm too full of love, you see.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, I mean, you've got a podcast full of creators you hate, so you're covered right there.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, alright.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How many Christmas podcasts are we just going to say that we hate each other?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, I mean, that's most of them.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have a list of four and Ben is one of my four.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Of course. Let's just go round Robin style, I guess, and everybody's got their things.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We did homework this time, actually, right?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, everyone's ready.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I have a huge list in front of me.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So here's a huge list. Why don't you go first, Munchie? What do you got?

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So first of all, what I look for in creators...

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Enough!

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Excellent.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What I look for in creators is how similar you are to Andrew Hussey.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The more similar you are to Andrew Hussey, the more I like you.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So meaning that I look for comedy and class.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The more like Andrew Hussey you are, the better I like you.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So vaguely kind of an asshole, pretty funny, conducting yourself with an air of mystery and class and being gay,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
like fucking over your fans, not having any respect for the people who support you.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dude, let me tell you, I love the level of class he showed by pausing his work for a year to get work on a project.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They got totally fucked.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, fantastic work.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, and it's still not out, even though he said it was going to be released.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Love that.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
First of all, he said it was going to be released in 2015, then it was going to be in January of this year,

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and it's still not out yet.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Class.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Class.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Class.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Class.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who is Andrew Hussey?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Andrew Hussey is the creator.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He undertailed. He made Undertale.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He didn't make Undertale. He did not.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He's the creator of his finest work, Riska Circuit.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Andrew Hussey is on both my love and hate list for this.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Of course.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Sometimes.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He made Homestuck and the MSPA website, where he just posts a bunch of comics.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He used to be really good at art, now he doesn't do anything.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And he's also just a fucking hack in every way.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's a regular, bensome, mashed.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Max revive problem sleuth.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Bring it back, it's time.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The people need it.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Believe me, I have another property we need in Max Revive later.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Good.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I wonder what that could be.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Should I go through my entire list?

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,620
I think we're gonna do one at a time just to mix it up. We're gonna go around definitely

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Okay, so Andrew Hussie my favorite guy his use of colors as being garish and weird and awful

78
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,760
And and his general aesthetic is is everything that I love

79
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,800
I told that informed your art a lot. Yeah, definitely the colors. Yeah

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,920
Everything in Homestuck like like if I didn't read Homestuck, I would be I would be like I would be just like George Washington

81
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
So it set me on the right path

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,360
Hero a creator of nations a nation-builder. That's bullshit dude a white supremacist a racist

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
All right, and I just like it was pretty good

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,680
There you go. It's pretty good. Okay, monkey. You're next on the thing. I'm looking at here. What do you got?

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,640
Folks I've noticed an unfortunate new trend on our little website. We lovingly call YouTube

86
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,560
Thanks to the popularity of people like nerd writer one. We have a whole new wave of these

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,760
analytic genius 16 year olds

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,240
Who want to show us just how smart they are by analyzing like a Marvel superhero movie and shit?

89
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,400
It's disgusting, but from this new wave of filth

90
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,840
There is one there. There's a there's a piece of cream that rises to the top. Is that what that saying is?

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
Yeah

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Like cream I think what it would be in this situation would be a poop a turd rising to the top like a

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,660
Not a turd. I think he's really good. Oh

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,840
You can't touch them if they're if they're littler than you're then then like five feet tall. That's eat

95
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
That's the same you can't touch it

96
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Don't know about that

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,320
So there's this YouTube channel called lessons from the screenplay as have any of you seen this one

98
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,360
No, no, I don't know that one. So what I really like about it is it's not just he's not just gonna watch a fucking movie and say now

99
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,040
I think that this is just he actually does a little bit of homework and work

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,200
What he does is he'll read the original screenplay to the film and compare it to what the final film is

101
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,840
So between writing a screenplay and then the final cut of a film

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,760
There's a thousand hands to go into it and fuck with the movie and it

103
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,480
Max Landis would be all about this shit. Oh

104
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah, and what I really like about it is that of he's only done like nine episodes so far

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,060
It's a fairly new channel, but like half the movies he's done are some of my favorite movies

106
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,000
So it's really great for me

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,480
He's done like nightcrawler and X machina and what's really interesting is how he'll show how

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Changes made from the screenplay to the final cut. He'll explain how they improve or

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,800
Are less than the value of the film ultimately for example with exposition and X machina at the beginning

110
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,920
What's great about X mocking on the first 15 minutes is you have no idea what the hell is going on

111
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,440
But in the original screenplay, it's just fucking exposition city

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,060
So as a writer and somebody who likes, you know, how films are made

113
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,360
It's really interesting to me and I'd say of all these weird new trend, you know analytical faggots. He's one of the good ones

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,360
That's pretty interesting. So an X mocking his case the actual director or whoever was in charge improved upon the screen absolutely by just

115
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,360
Cutting 90% of the beginning out. That's a very good movie. That's pretty cool. Yeah, I

116
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,240
Do like a lot of some of those. I mean, I think no writer is actually still quiet kind of one of the better

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,360
I

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Still think he's pretty good. I think he means

119
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
That's true, that's true

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,840
But yeah, yeah, I agree the most most of that that crowd is just

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,840
And it's nice to know that there are some good ones

122
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Yeah, so that's mine like

123
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:56,320
Your guy. Yeah, okay. Yeah, let's go to the next one then mage is next up. What do you got for his mage? Oh, okay

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
Okay, um

125
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:06,120
So I have a little artist and giving out that I absolutely adore the arts of and it's kind of like rare for me to like

126
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Be really into someone's art. Just like so so much. I am right now. Like I haven't had like a little

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
genuine

128
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
As you put it

129
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:26,200
They're called unknown spy and I have found they're giving a target like all a long while ago back when I was into ponies

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,200
But it's only like in the last year or so. I really went through their gallery and

131
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,480
So I'll how really creative the their characters are and the designs and they have like this comic

132
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,200
That I absolutely adore when I read it like all in one go for one day and I'm just I was just like oh

133
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Man, I need more of this

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,360
How how do I cope with the lack of this?

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,600
It's just like absolutely amazing just their style is kind of like cartoony

136
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,200
It would really work like as a as an actual cartoon on TV show and stuff like that and it's just oh man

137
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,960
I can't even put it into words. Just how much I adore

138
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:13,040
They're just so creative. I just look at each one of their character and design and just stories and personalities

139
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,880
I just just so do they do primarily like OC stuff or is it specifically for comics?

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,240
They they they do

141
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,480
They do a lot of original art, but they have a few fan art stuff in their gallery

142
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,680
Yeah, they have like a comic and they have like this concept thing called media controls

143
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,720
It's basically personified media controls and they're kind of like set in a world

144
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,680
That could be like a fighting game or something like that and it's like it's quite popular a lot of people are quite into it

145
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,180
And they're making their own characters

146
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm included and the people who made their own characters for the universe and they don't even have the comic for that

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,680
Yeah, they just had like the few characters and the few characters were so a well made that they inspired other people to

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,720
Make characters and in that universe like remote controls or like that's what I was wondering. Yeah

149
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,440
Okay, you know copy paste play cuts is like those

150
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Interesting. Yeah

152
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,800
It's really really good. I could link a few

153
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,080
Okay

154
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,720
Things weird, but also quickly cool. That's right. You have neptunia a little bit

155
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,360
nepotog

156
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
leon

157
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,660
I

158
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,420
Linked in the press me. Oh, okay. Let's see here

159
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:44,420
Save okay, okay incognito. Hey, that's cool. I like the guy. I was just gonna say cuts the coolest one bar

160
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,940
Incognito reminds me of metaton for some reason

161
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
Believe a ball

162
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,980
Seriously like like fuck dude

163
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,740
Fuck you up not joking

164
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,500
This shit is just a reaction

165
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,500
Real alright, did you learn this from the Undertaker?

166
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,740
No, I just I just was raped by metaton

167
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Oh

168
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,700
Okay, let's move on. That was it cool

169
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,580
Okay, hippo crits. What do you got for us? Oh, yes, I have

170
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Anish Kapoor who is a is a modern artist sculptor kind of guy you may have seen

171
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,420
The thing he made in Chicago this giant mirror bean thing

172
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,900
Sort of that people can walk under it. It's like a massive. It's called the cloud gate if you Google that and

173
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
the thing about this guy is

174
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,060
that he

175
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,500
like he is the guy that set me on the path of being cool because

176
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,420
You know, I was just I was in art school

177
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,260
You know doing stuff and the teachers always said now you need to look up some artists and get some inspiration for the thing

178
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,300
You have to have inspiration. Fuck you and I'm like, oh

179
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,060
Whatever and then I looked in this book and there's this thing and they had all these cool pictures

180
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,740
And it was an ish Kapoor and he had and basically what he does is he makes sculptures and their big weird shapes the huge colors mirrors

181
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,220
You know huge metal monstrosities, but they're always like really nice looking and you can you know

182
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,740
I've been to a few of his art exhibitions to see them up close and it's like whoa like you just build a huge big weird

183
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,620
Curvy metal thing and it's great and the thing that I really like about him is that in this book. I was reading

184
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,340
People say to him, you know, he was he was saying the the the way he he approaches meaning

185
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,340
And he says I just make stuff because I like the way it looks like it's something to that effect

186
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,140
like he makes these cool amazing sculptures and he's such a talented craftsman and

187
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,980
He doesn't have any of the pretension that you would have expected of a you know a modern artist sculptor sort of person

188
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,220
And he's sort of like I didn't realize that you could be

189
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,340
making

190
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,020
Loads of money being a famous sculptor artist modern guy and

191
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,780
Also, just just do it because it looks cool and for no other reason

192
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,660
And I just really love that about him and his ethics and his work ethic and is

193
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
I was just gonna say what are his yeah

194
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,660
That's what really really need to talk about he's an old guy, so I doubt he's played any game

195
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
That's

196
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,060
We can only talk about

197
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,740
I had a good old

198
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
No

199
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
And you got a you got a gamer

200
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,740
Gain is the most heartfelt topic there is dude. Come on. Okay. Okay. Well, I Google this and this is sick

201
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,620
This is sick. I I understand like like

202
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,860
Like like like you always just think the artists are just like weird fucking assholes

203
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
But when you find like did you like like yeah, obviously

204
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:25,860
And then we find someone that's like genuinely cool. You're like you're like me. Oh, I can keep my soul when I when I when I make

205
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:33,020
Yeah, like that the the reason I get mad when like the general consensus on the internet among like basically everyone is that modern art and

206
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,980
Artists are pretentious and stupid and everyone gets overpaid and they're all bad and lol

207
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,940
Let's laugh at modern art as a whole like like that's a meme. It's basically it's basically yeah, it really annoys me though

208
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:52,060
It's literally a trigger. I get I get all worked up because it's like saying, you know film lol so gay

209
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,140
Can you name one film that isn't gay though?

210
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Like broke back Mountain

211
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Yes, American Psycho

212
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Yeah, that's pretty straight

213
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Yeah, that was definitely gay dude

214
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
Okay, well that was a great suggestion

215
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,020
Go look this guy up. What was his name again? Could you say over time? Anish Kapoor if you type in cloud gate

216
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,720
You'll you'll get the image of that that famous

217
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,780
Or just type in Gamergate and go to the important shit, but okay

218
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,300
Albrillo prince up. He assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand since the world in World War one. I really like his work

219
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,180
I really like that all those people died. I'm for it. Hey, you cut I have a thing

220
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,780
I want to say I have a creator. Okay, so so okay, so there's this guy

221
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,620
I don't know if you've heard of him. His name is Richard Spencer

222
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,500
He's an American writer and what he's creating is a future for the white race

223
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,000
That's what he's working on and I gotta say I'm a big fan of his work

224
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,380
Nate to live I'm glad I'm glad we started up a council and allowed him to prosper

225
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:16,420
Okay, let's move on a bunch. Yeah, it's you again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay back on like analysis thing

226
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,940
Cuz I think we're all kind of in that circle

227
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,220
There there's there's a guy that that that he was talking shit on in the chat

228
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,940
And I agree that he's pretty bad, but also I like him a lot his name. You know a little birdie

229
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,740
named my night mind his name is night mind and like he keys like

230
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,900
He's like kind of long-winded and has it like super eyepatch wolf dr. Wolf whimsical weird delivery

231
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,580
That's like that's gay

232
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:51,780
But but but he's cool cuz he talks about like like horror internet ARG things like like marble Hornets and shit and

233
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,180
No one that I know is doing that and I just like to learn about horror

234
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,780
They are like I really like ARG is just in general and so just to learn about like like like really

235
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,780
It's just like a jumping off point like like he'll analyze something then I'll be like, oh, that's a thing

236
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
I'll go check that out and then that's

237
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,540
He's good. What's the guy's name night mind night mind

238
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,780
I don't remember shitting on a guy called that

239
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,700
Did he do a did he do like a video analyzing the Zanya cat

240
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,220
Which was prefaced by I literally don't want to do this, but everyone's asking me for it shut up

241
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,980
Oh, well, that's my favorite kind of video. I just don't like the fact that it's a thing. Oh, yeah

242
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,940
I agree. I think I think I would rate. I would rank night man as like a six

243
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,660
six to a seven

244
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,460
By the way, I while you were talking I just made the connection that

245
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,580
Dr. Wolf and super I patch wolf are the same guy. That's probably dr. Wolf's anivate channel. Okay, glad okay

246
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,140
By the way, I just want to throw out my favorite content creator of all time is dr. Wolf. Yeah

247
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,260
Retarded obvious shit, all right, I'm sorry to waste everyone's time with that. Okay, let's let's move on monkey

248
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,300
What's up? Let me take you back to a simpler time

249
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:19,180
Way back before, you know, 9-eleven way back before World War two we're talking the economic crisis of 2008

250
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:27,660
Love it. Monkey was a young child and he was really into a in a YouTube series called stupid Mario brothers

251
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:35,100
Has anybody heard of this? No, I love it already remember that. Yeah, so it's actually quite I love quite good

252
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,780
It's by this guy named Richard Michael Alvarez where it's like they had these cosplay Mario costumes

253
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:47,500
And they decided to make skits out of it which branched off into entire episodes and seasons with like an overarching story line

254
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,420
And it got really intense towards the end. There's there's tons of cool fights with like really good special effects

255
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
It was crazy for a YouTube series

256
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,780
but then but then this is when Richard Michael Alvarez goes down the road of

257
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:08,220
Disgust the road of fuck you see supply person for the first person because he

258
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,060
This is the type of guy, you know, it's the story that we've seen over and over again with your your bojaks and your

259
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,660
Your best guys ever as you know these types of people

260
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,620
Yeah, where they were once really big and popular and then they made a change or their show ended and now they live in obscurity

261
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:31,700
And they're sad about it and they they thirst to regain the fame and the love that they had before

262
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,820
So like six years after the the stupid Mario Brothers show ends rich

263
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,620
Alvarez comes back because he'd been doing shitty stuff on YouTube for six years stuff that nobody wanted to see he has like

264
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:50,060
120,000 subs in his videos on average get about 600 views. So I'm guessing it's all dead account baby. Yeah, so it's like, okay

265
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,740
I should have monetized this shit when it was popular. I'm gonna try it again

266
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,460
So what he's doing now he made two new seasons of the show and now he now he's putting it up on a ransom

267
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,820
He says listen up fans. If you want me to make season three. I have to hit this

268
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,260
$1,000 patreon goal per month. Okay, so instead of doing a Kickstarter to fund this season

269
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,940
He's using the excuse. Here's a patreon pay me for content that I'm not making and you'll only get the content if I hit this

270
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,140
Goal so pretty much throw your money away for no reason

271
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,420
Forever because I'm never gonna hit this fucking goal and you're just gonna keep paying me for nothing

272
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,900
I didn't think that went through so is this a creator you like I used to when I was a kid and now I hate him because he's

273
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,340
He's doing this bullshit on patreon if you need money to film the season do a kickstart

274
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:47,180
So let me ask is he right now like getting paid money. I assume as a you know as a part of this campaign and it's just not making anything

275
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,740
Yeah, yeah, he's not do he's getting money for the stupid Mario Brothers series that he's not making is he making other shit

276
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,140
I'm just wondering he he's making like let's plays with his girlfriend. They get 500

277
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,780
Quality that's the saddest thing I've ever fucking heard for my entire

278
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,780
No, I haven't checked this channel in the last month, so maybe something's changed

279
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,460
But this went on for like six months and then I got that's a long time. Yeah

280
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,620
Somewhat related monkey. Have you ever watched Super Mario brosie?

281
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,340
Hell, yeah, no, what is that? Yeah, it was an ant worm dude. Come on

282
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,300
Come on. It was like it was like a retarded like flash animation

283
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,660
Where it took fucking like the Mario sprites from the RPGs and like Sonic sprites

284
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,140
You just had them like duke it out and this weirdly like overly complex plot that was

285
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,980
Fucking sick. Yeah, okay. All right. It was

286
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,240
Well, yeah, that's my guy actually seen it you should you Google it

287
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,100
It's still around and then like the guy came back and he's like making new ones now, right? Yeah, I

288
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,120
Haven't kept up with that though

289
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,020
Same are they still I mean they were still good like the first I watched like the first of the new ones that were coming out

290
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,860
And I think they were still like just as good as they always had been

291
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,800
It's just that like it's not as fresh a formula because it's been like ten years or something. I

292
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Don't know

293
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,980
We just hijacked monkeys though. Oh, yeah, he's gay. No, I was done

294
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,740
Please feel free to take the reins

295
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Okay, mage you're up

296
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,620
Okay, so this is my second and last creator that I like and there's no creators that I hate

297
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,420
So I'm probably gonna stay silent after a new van. You can take my Ben from me

298
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,780
No, it's okay. I'm not greedy. I'm fine. Well, like mage says she doesn't like to discuss people that she hates

299
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:43,460
Okay, so the second one is a youtuber kind of

300
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,140
Like they do animation memes and they're probably one of the people who actually influenced me to make my own

301
00:22:51,100 --> 00:23:00,820
And I wish I wish I guys I could like tell you the full saga of the banana goat because it's like it's it's it's just the best thing

302
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
So this guy scotchy

303
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:10,580
He he he uses this purple gay goat for for his animation videos and there's there was one

304
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Where people were really complaining about

305
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,100
The goat being too sexy or something like that or too gay

306
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,660
And so in response the guy made a video

307
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,660
Where he kind of interacted with his

308
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:38,300
Goat persona and he was like, hey, dude, you need to be more heterosexual and and that that kind of that that kind of backfire

309
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,820
I should link you guys the actual video because it's just absolutely priceless. I got removed from you too hot for YouTube

310
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,620

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,540
The amount of fucks this person does not give is just

312
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,060
Amazing and they have the talent to back it up. They're actually a quite talented animator as well

313
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,460
They have some original content some memes and stuff like that and it's just

314
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,620
Everything they do like some of these like little shitty posts. They're just like the best

315
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:15,180
I I just I just want to link everyone some of the videos because they're just priceless and I just adore adore this creator

316
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:21,220
Just for their attitude for their for their art and for for their talent and just everything

317
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,400
Sick sicker than syphilis

318
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
I

319
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,820
Save me or save him. I forget whose meme is who's these days. I don't even remember a save me

320
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,940
Max I'll do that. I'll get there. I'll get I'll get to write we're building up to a me because I am one

321
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
We always

322
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,900
Shut up everyone shut up. Have we even like introduced why we're talking about just random people

323
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:14,220
Is that is there a reason I feel like we've just started talking about people and we've gone in a circle like people watching like

324
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,220
Are they talking about like creation?

325
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,580
What I look for in creators and and and and shit

326
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,300
I'm looking for a future for the white race, which is why my list is as it is so all right

327
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
I just feel like the

328
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,700
Why you chose the people you did please feel free who are my senpai's that's awesome. Yeah, that's true

329
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:43,100
Well, I mean the the the thing is I've always had like a problem with recommendations. Yeah

330
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:51,500
In that I never ever look at anything anybody ever recommends me unless they do it for like months and months and just fucking just

331
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,380
Just do it. Yeah, like I I didn't I refused to get into Game of Thrones until

332
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,260
Season five was long over because

333
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,100
I don't like being into the hip things that everyone is talking about so I just

334
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,780
And it was just it was just one of those things like a whole podcast of like. Oh, yeah

335
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,140
Look at this. Look at that. Go google this and and stuff. You know, you know what I feel like for someone like me

336
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,100
I would just

337
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,780
Hippo, I hear what you're saying, but I don't think this is a recommendation podcast

338
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,660
I think if there are creators in the audience, we're explaining why these ones are good and why these ones are bad

339
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
So people know what to do

340
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
Well, that was you munchy. Well, yeah

341
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,820
I suppose so but I suppose so but like and

342
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,900
I guess we'd have to be very specific about why these fucking sheeple will listen to anything we put out who cares

343
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
That's true. That's true

344
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Okay, well, uh

345
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,380
Hey, if the naru cast got 3000 views, this one's gonna hit 10,000

346
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,300
Yeah, I'm really mad. Well, actually, I'm not really mad, but that's it's did we beat the podcast?

347
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,420
Absolutely. Well, potty cost the potty cost gets uh from a thousand to a thousand

348
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,700
Major we did it a moment to point out how you guys made an ironic parody of the potty cast as soon as we moved it off

349
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,460
The pcp channel and you immediately like doubled the viewership

350
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,580
To say about that

351
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,260
I think part of it was people knew what the potty curse was and knew not to click on it because they knew they didn't like it already

352
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,460
This new thing this new thing with mage and monkey like whoa, what?

353
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,620
Everyone's gonna click on that major good friends people don't really they don't realize that because we're never on the podcast together

354
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,620
But me and mage go way back. We've actually I was talking to her before the pcp even started

355
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,620
We hung out a few times over in uh, slovakia or wherever the fuck she lives

356
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,780
Nice

357
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Major's our token black

358
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,620
The token black and the token girl. Yeah, we did it other than did you I'm all of the tokens

359
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,500
I'm gonna take you to an arcade. Can you give me some shucky cheese tickets in exchange for those tokens?

360
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,980
I want to get I want to get some gum and and melt it all right

361
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,700
I want to be taffy and melt it all over my body so I can turn into a clay monster. No, they're my tokens

362
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,780
No, they're fucking mine. Give him here. I want to get a tiny finger trap. So I never have to leave ben ever again

363
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,260
Do you think

364
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,460
All right, my next my next guy my next guy is is a youtuber

365
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,500
He's very funny not any of us and he goes way back to he goes way back to to newgrounds days where he did nox's corner

366
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,460
Which is a plasticine stop motion animation

367
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,220
Comedy thing which is still hilarious. It's sort of like an adult swim sort of strange comedy sort of thing

368
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,820
And he has a youtube channel. His name is robert benfer

369
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
and he

370
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,620
does uh skits and music videos and it's it's all weird comedy that is like very

371
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:14,780
Very dry very awkward like cringy sort of like, you know awkward pause sort of comedy, which I really like and

372
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,460
Yeah, he does he does a bunch of cool things that he's good and I like him. Oh, yeah

373
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,140
That's my in-depth. Yeah in-depth analysis of robert benfer

374
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,540
He's he's he's awkward and clumsy and uh his adult swim humor there. That's what he is

375
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,700
People got me into him by posting animation. It's really good. Yeah by posting bbw lover in the chat. It's quickly become my favorite song

376
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,780
lover

377
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,780
That's my license plate number

378
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,420
Okay, um, okay, I'll take one next. Um, so this one, uh, I I'm not

379
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,380
I do like their work. I wouldn't say that I absolutely love it

380
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,140
But what I kind of love more is their lifestyle and this person might be contentious. This is shad man

381
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,940
Shad man the porn artist. You might be familiar

382
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:17,100
Come on munchy. Get get with the times. This is shad man's time. Okay. Oh, is he the guy who draws violet from the Incredibles over?

383
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,100
I'm sure he does. Yes, among many other things. Well, what literally I was I literally have a huge ramp playing for shad base

384
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
Really?

385
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,460
Here's what I like about shad man. Shad man is not afraid to make like

386
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:39,500
The most disgusting like guru loli porn just because he feels like it and he is continuously hounded by like the the internet police

387
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,020
To like take down his website and like demonetize everything he does

388
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,620
And fuck with him on every single level and he had to like go out of his way to like build an independent website

389
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:55,260
Which you know these days is really hard and it's just been like a really long journey for that guy to like be a viable content creator

390
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,100
Of the porn that he loves so much that I don't even really like that much

391
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,260
But uh, you know kind of like in general and I he's just kind of uh

392
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,020
He's like an internet pirate and that he went out into the world and he made his own way doing what he really cares about

393
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,980
And he has fucking succeeded. He's got a huge following now

394
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,820
And I just really respect that and I'm also big into uh people being able to make whatever kind of porn they want

395
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,300
So he checks that box too. So shad man that this one's for you, buddy

396
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:31,900
Uh, I okay sure respectable respectable that that he carved his own uh, yes his own part of the internet

397
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:39,340
He's the most god-awful person. I've ever had the displeasure. I'll make your case viewing what what so ever

398
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:46,860
Is it because he made hill loli clinton? Yeah, well, that's my favorite thing he's ever done because I love hillary clinton. Yeah, me too

399
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,100
obviously

400
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:54,300
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. The the main. Oh, he's the guy that made that thing. Oh my god. Sorry. I'm a bit

401
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,180
That's him. He made some really hot art of the uh pokemon trainers from uh pokemon go. Okay. Okay. The main the main problem

402
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:09,820
This is a good issue that his art is fucking abysmal. It's not. Why does everyone say that? Why does everyone say that?

403
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,380
No, it's not

404
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,020
Then why is he the most rich man in the world based solely off everyone?

405
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,820
What I would say what I would what I would say about shadman's art style is he's like the narrow hoe

406
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,580
Yes, and I love narrow everything. That's right. Yeah, and you love narrow. I don't like narrow hoe. It's it's sort of like

407
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Let's just draw the

408
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,780
Let's just draw the boost like way bigger and just round and that's right. It's not it's not artistic

409
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,260
So I mean it's not artistic. Oh, fuck yourself. It's not as artistic as something else. That's so stupid

410
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,380
It's it's it's not I don't I don't dislike it. It's like in the mcdonalds of porn. It's like eating

411
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,860
You're looking the mcdonalds of my dick. Fuck you. You don't know

412
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,060
It's like you took mcdonalds and took out all the mcgriddles and you just relived with all the greasy horrible shit

413
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,620
The thing about it. All right. I'm not even defending yourself. Is that I have

414
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,100
None. Well, I mean the art is like like I've I've enjoyed some of his art though

415
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,220
It's it's it's just that I can recognize that man

416
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,420
You know, I like other things that like have a bit more anatomy to them

417
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,900
Okay, you know what? That's totally fine. You guys can hate his art

418
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:24,700
But the the thing I like most about him is his like campaign to survive and struggle to make it during what he's doing on the

419
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,340
I that that's what I really like. Yeah, I do. I do like he seems like he's been on the the sleepy cast

420
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,340
which is like a podcast for

421
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,740
for um, you know, uh psychic pebbles and

422
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,500
And like all those and yeah animators and he's been on that podcast and he seems like a really funny cool guy

423
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,980
Um, so I like him as a person. He's German. So I know he also cares about the arian race. So, you know, we've got

424
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,940
You know, there's a theme here. There's a theme. I just don't like the attitude that comes through like his art

425
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,780
I've never listened to him and I don't want to but just like I I I hate I hate

426
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,700
I I hate porn artists in general who did like who just draw porn and and because why

427
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Because okay, it's like this every piece of art. You hate sex, right?

428
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:14,700
Sure, sure, but but but but more over it's because every every one like every piece that they make

429
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,140
Just feels like like they they just really really want you to get a boner

430
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,900
And there's well, yeah, they're really really pushing for it and it feels so forced. It feels like great. That's great, dude

431
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,260
Most porn artists suck

432
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,700
This is my problem. Let me ask you this munchie. Are you do you allow yourself to touch your own dick when you're taking a piss?

433
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
Is that allowed in your house?

434
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Is that too gay?

435
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,940
I have to open up my pants with my teeth and then and then use my teeth to aim. It's hard. Okay

436
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
I can understand that struggle. Okay

437
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,260
Okay, it should have been just like a tryhard edgy asshole. What does that mean?

438
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,940
Oh, he tried so hard to give me a boner with his porn that he draw to make me jack off try hard in the sense of like

439
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
It's gonna be Hitler guys

440
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,340
Yeah, I love that. I love Hitler porn

441
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:10,060
Like like what if it was like, all right, I I get what munchie is saying though. It's it's like, um

442
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,860
You know every sort of drawing is basically the same. It's just with a different character

443
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,740
In in a sense like he's not he's not like creating an an art piece

444
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,300
He's just like taking something that already exists and giving it big tits. Yeah for the most part

445
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,100
I mean, I'm not gonna say that's all he does and and and yeah

446
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,620
It's all to for the purposes of giving people, you know a stimulation is porn

447
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,300
That's what it's for but I guess that the munchie is having a problem with

448
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,460
Being a porn artist as opposed to being an artist who can do porn

449
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:47,820
Not not like there's a difference to me for from like an artist who does porn exclusively and a porn artist

450
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,740
But the man is

451
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,660
Okay, go ahead. Yeah, like like like an artist who does porn is like, okay

452
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,500
How do I make this like like a visually cool image? How do I make this look nice?

453
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,020
How do I make this look stylish?

454
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,460
But he's just how do I get to manipulate people's emotions the best sounds?

455
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,700
Please let me know it's porn. You're trying to achieve the same thing every point. I get it

456
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,940
I don't like cold. I don't like shitty products, huh, Nate? How about you?

457
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Twiddle my clit, huh?

458
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,940
I maybe I will munchie. Maybe I will twiddle your clit

459
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,420
Uh, okay. Well, yeah, the case has been made people. There you go. That's that's why I like the guy and there's there's he's a he's a hot topic

460
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,300
Just like we're a favorite store. Yeah, that's right. Okay, munchie. What's next?

461
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,900
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

462
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,900
Uh

463
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,620
We're gonna have a guy who who who Gibbon knows to and he's probably

464
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,340
Like like like youtube was once dominated by like by like gaming gaming channels where you would talk over a game

465
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,380
Beedly funny jokesmith right and this is

466
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:58,540
The only jokesmith from that era that that I genuinely like still like the dark side film

467
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,580
Yeah, it his name is germa nine eight five. Oh, yeah

468
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,980
Yep, uh, he's a youtube guy that does like video game commentary videos

469
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,700
Like like it's basically like a like a let's play but he edits it like edits it down to like the best moment

470
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,420
Since it's like seven minute video and all of them are fucking gold like like all of them are great

471
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,180
I was going to recommend star because he was like his friend who like it wasn't a bunch of videos but start like

472
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,100
Just streams over watch like like that's all he does

473
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:32,780
Yeah, and he doesn't like make videos anymore. And well, I mean, I think he does occasionally, but it's overwatch

474
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,780
Uh, oh, yeah, yes star star is germa's friend who I used to like more because he was like

475
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,020
Exactly, but but then he just it became very obvious that germa is the only one that's actually funny

476
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,980
I think star is funny, but it's just he has to like have a game to riff on

477
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,940
Yeah, germa is a comedian with a gaming channel. That's basically

478
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,300
That's you know, he knows how to make it make you make you just so that the all the pcp fans out there

479
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,620
No, germa's the one who inspired the multi-man pcp world. Yeah. Yeah. He's the guy. Yes

480
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,940
germa rumble is is a series of videos that he's made which are

481
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,820
Basically him just commentating as a wrestling, you know pundit over his shitty characters that he made in a wrestling game

482
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,300
And it's it's really really good. And he eventually made like a live-action version

483
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,340
Which was crazy. He gets used to all the characters from his like videos over the years and have them duke it out such as the

484
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,740
bad boy

485
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,340
Man, I have my t-shirt. I think I roared. I think I worked red con. That's yeah, you did. It was awesome

486
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,580
Yeah, okay, okay

487
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,900
He used to post all that stuff on like on on germa germa 985

488
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,100
But he's since done that weird thing that some youtubers do where he like

489
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,140
Saves his main channel for like big content and then you post like his normal content on the second channel

490
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,660
Which I don't understand at all

491
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,500
But so if you want to find his like actual normal content go to second germa

492
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,140
Is that the name of the channel second germa? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, second. Okay. Yeah

493
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,380
He named it that like temporarily and couldn't think of anything and now it's just cool

494
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
I

495
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:13,420
It's great. I reckon I recommend him if you want to get started go to like like the recent past

496
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,940
And and there'll be something like like the shortest cowboy in the land or some shit like that. It's fucking hysterical

497
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
That sounds like my aesthetic. Yeah

498
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
Cowboys and short people he's down

499
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Uh, and yeah, it's pretty good. It's a compact. He's come back. He's come back

500
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,980
Uh, take it away from me. Take it away from me. It's gonna bite me

501
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Munchy it's your okay, monkey your turn. All right, folks

502
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,220
Here is somebody who does not need my praise

503
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,380
Somebody who we should all know and love somebody who I am convinced is

504
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:53,420
Impossible to hate as a human beings donald trump say what you will about some of his recent content and his movie

505
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,900
But as a human being I think it's impossible to dislike james rolf

506
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
Yeah, I do it. Oh, yeah

507
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,740
And here's why you know, even if you don't like, you know

508
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,380
Video game shows where the guy just screams cuss words and that's you know, most of the jokes

509
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,460
His passion as a filmmaker is what makes me so enthralled by him as a person and a creator

510
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,860
And I'll watch I mean, I don't watch lots of his let's plays

511
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,740
But anything that he puts out that was made with you know

512
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,300
A modicum of effort. I'll watch he makes weird little projects sometimes like he made a short

513
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,180
Film trailer for dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde the game the movie

514
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,460
And he's not even in it

515
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,380
But I love it because I can tell are all the hard work and the craft he put into it

516
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:42,060
And he has the behind the scenes any behind the scenes video he does you should watch even if you didn't watch the original thing

517
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:49,260
Because watching this guy makes stuff makes me want to make stuff so bad because he loves it so goddamn much

518
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,140
Yeah, yeah, I will say the if you've watched uh the avg in movie

519
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,500
I haven't watched it because I've heard that it's bad and I don't really want to ruin it

520
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,300
For myself the idea that james could make something bad

521
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:07,980
But his making of vlogs of the movie was so cool. So I I assume those are like better than the movie itself

522
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,860
The vlogs of just him going through like the process of writing and making it and buying like

523
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,540
Hiring a tank or whatever like it. He's such a charming guy. I love James Rolf

524
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
And his his basement is like my favorite character

525
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,740
Is that better than jesse's basement? Oh, can we compare them? I would say yes

526
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,180
Even jesse's basement is very characterful, but james rolf

527
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,820
Avg and basement is probably I I feel it has better

528
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,620
You know, I I am not uh, I have not seen a lot of avg and content just for whatever reason

529
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,780
I just haven't really stumbled into his shit though. I like I got into jon tron who I know is like inspired by him

530
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,860
I really love his content. So I mean to go back

531
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:53,500
Um, but just like today I went to youtube and saw that he uploaded a video yesterday james rolf of like episode like

532
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,820
I don't know like 150 of uh, you know angry video game nerd show or whatever

533
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:03,180
And it had like 800,000 views and I just thought like how cool is it?

534
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,420
This guy's still making this fucking series and so many people still love it

535
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,060
And he's successful at and he's like being able to keep doing it for selling and he's made all these other projects

536
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,820
And like it's gone past the point where I don't some people feel like demo has uh, he's made content

537
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,540
It's getting kind of samey and it's dipped into like the boring part

538
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,940
But like if you persevere and making something like that for like, I don't know 10 years or whatever

539
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,380
And you just keep doing it at that point you come back to like totally

540
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,460
Respecting that kind of effort and dedication to the craft and uh, that's what I feel for him

541
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,700
Even having not seen a lot of his content. My committee is better. He is a huge dick

542
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Mike mate does have a huge cock. It's true

543
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,260
My fair thing to do is to build brown bricks in minecraft

544
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,460
Minecrafty

545
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,860
I think one thing that really makes james stick out to me is that I spend a lot of my time now

546
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:59,660
Just talking to you pcp people and you're all artists who who hate what you do

547
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,340
And you complain and bitch about it all day. So to see james

548
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,660
Be happy and to enjoy the art that he's making it's a new turn for me

549
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,540
And it's nice to see somebody who isn't a whiny bitch

550
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,060
You just don't get to see him whine and bitch. He presents himself in a certain spin as we all do

551
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,500
We all wear different faces a certain hedgehog spin video

552
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:27,020
So that's my I used to like his I used to like his content a lot back back in the day

553
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
I used to watch it quite often

554
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,020
Funny like the what the first video of his that I saw was about like, um

555
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:42,620
These video games that were sort of kind of not fit for children. I think or something like that. I don't remember the exact time

556
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,500
Yeah, yeah

557
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,460
I stumbled on that video and that was the first one

558
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,260
You just stumbled upon it insert clip of major feverishly googling pornography video games

559
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,300
I know what happened. I understand

560
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Yeah, that's a real

561
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
It gets real, please

562
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,340
Okay, well mage, uh, doesn't I think she's there tapped out. So let's just skip to get to hippo, I guess

563
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,220
Oh

564
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
I like james rar

565
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,420
Well, I guess we've said enough about him. He's got something else. I want to hear

566
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,020
Well, I just I just love his his

567
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,460
Is charming like if you've watched like some of his recent videos like about power rangers

568
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,660
He does like a like a 20 minute take and he does the entire video just standing there just talking

569
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,220
Supernaturally like he's so good at it. He's like the best a lot of time

570
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,580
He he's he's the funniest. Well, he's I would say he's uh debatably the funniest

571
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,420
But he's definitely the best video maker in the gaming review circle. What about peanut butter gamer? Come on?

572
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,740
What about necrus?

573
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,940
Peanut butter gamer and catechorus are

574
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,020
Real quick, that's all I will say about I forgot one thing about james rolf is that on his channel

575
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:08,860
He has these weird documentaries of like there's one from 2002 where somebody made a documentary about him as a college student

576
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,060
Who is like

577
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,020
In aspiring movie guy and he's he's very shy and he's like his teeth are kind of fucked up

578
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,980
And you can tell he doesn't really have like a lot of friends and he talks about that all the time

579
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:25,020
So it's really inspirational to me that like this guy who just had a dream of being a movie maker and had like

580
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,540
You know little prospects in college is now one of the biggest internet pioneers of all time

581
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,900
Yeah, yeah, I think in terms of like internet pioneering. He's bigger than

582
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,460
He's probably bigger than ara hanson who is also pretty big. Well, sure

583
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,700
I think he was like he's up there with maddox is one of the guys who started a whole new

584
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,540
Genre of of thing on the internet. That's right. Oh, yeah. Yeah

585
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,540
Like

586
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,460
Nostalgia critic was kind of around but he's he's not as good in any way. That's true

587
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,620
Though he did inspire a lot of people. I'm the nostalgia critic. Welcome to the new episode of the pcp. I'm

588
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh, he should be our new the pcp membrane fit right in

589
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,340
He said the same we will deign we will we will deign to give him an invitation

590
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:20,380
And he will he will accept. Hello. I'm a nostalgia critic. It's not true. I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't hit her

591
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
I I'm I'm innocent

592
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,820
Did he turn into tommy we so

593
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,060
Okay, so munch. I mean I mean gib. I mean hippo

594
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,380
Oh, yes, yes

595
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,700
Tommy we so well tommy was out for sure

596
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,700
I

597
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,180
I guess I have a few but I don't know. I mean I have I put Andrew hussy on here, but

598
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,060
His soul. I already said this thing. My joke for that was that he made brisket. That's it

599
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:58,140
Oh, I got elbow, which is a band a british band who I like and liken to a modern day Beatles in the term in the

600
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,020
Sort of like late later Beatles sort of experimental cool

601
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:09,180
Sort of interesting melodies and the lyrics and stuff if you listen to a lyrics on an elbow song, you'll be like

602
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:16,220
It's like real good like pros going on there like real thought went into every fucking syllable that guy's really smart

603
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,020
I like him. He's good and the the the songs themselves are very like

604
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,100
uh

605
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,220
It's hard to describe, but they're very they're very um, well, you know in a way. Yes

606
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Because they're they're they're not like heart

607
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,340
they're sort of like uplifting

608
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,340
and um somber it's very emotional very emotional music

609
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,780
uh, lots of slow builds and and uh, you know, not a lot of like

That's true. Kneecap and the superior band. Nya nya nyan cat. Nyan cat is that what you said?

614

Stop touching me. I'll unleash that

619
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,860
Oh, is he done?

620
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,300
Well, I mean there's not really much I can say because it's music and you'll have to listen to it

621
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,020
Sing us their entire discography real quick if you would just

622
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:53,260
Hamtaro when we work together. It's much better my best friend. He likes sunflower. So he's grub grub grub

623
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,540
I'm so glad you guys know the words. I'm not the only one

624
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,740
I fucking grew up on hamtaro that was my favorite show in the world

625
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,140
I'm not I'm not gonna sing

626
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,020
When we work together it's much better my best friend

627
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,340
You have to sing little hamster's big adventures

628
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,500
Uh, that's uh, when I was a young boy

629
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:21,500
My father took me into the hamtaro to see a

630
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
Son of a man

631
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,780
He said son when you grow up

632
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,980
My father took me into the city

633
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,300
Enough

634
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,300
In enough enough

635
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,460
I'm trying to think of the lyrics that I make of skipping between songs

636
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:47,820
Uh, one will we be singing? I can't do it. It's just bad. Let me let me google the limit

637
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,380
Cut my life into pieces. This is my last resort

638
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,100
Suffocation no breathing

639
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,180
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm pleading

640
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:02,060
I think we're gonna get a lot more comments about munchies ear raping this episode. I think that's true

641
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,100
I've been working on a cocktail called grounds for divorce

642
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,660
Whoa

643
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,660
I already like this start

644
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,380
And that's part of it. That's already a good line

645
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,580
Yes, I think that makes them a 10 out of 10

646
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,980
Okay, good. Let's move on. I don't want to embarrass him. I'd be singing on live streams

647
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:28,540
I know munchie wanted to go but he's gonna have to wait because he uh, interrupt it and it's very rude. Um

648
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,940
Uh, okay, I've got one. Uh, this is a real life one that a lot of people will probably know uh, elon musk

649
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:42,140
I am a big fan literally a big fan of elon musk and I actually are you are you a fan of his musk?

650
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,220
Absolutely, I would I would sniff that man all day. What about his elon? Do you like his elon?

651
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,900
It's just pretty good. I mean I'm more of the musk guy than the elongated

652
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,900
Well, let me tell you why that's his full name elongated penis month musk

653
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,500
I was not actually a big fan of this guy. Uh, I don't know the big level until like I believe two days ago

654
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,260
Might have been yesterday. I want to happen to read this article. Um, I don't remember the like I retweeted on my twitter

655
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,260
So you can go see there if you care. Um

656
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:17,100
And uh, so it's this article about so he's starting a new company. So, you know, he's got uh, tesla

657
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,380
And which is like an electric car company and spacex, which is like spaceship program company

658
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,660
He he just made a new one. Um, or maybe it's been around for a little while

659
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,300
But like they're they're starting to get things rolling. It's called neural link

660
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:36,380
And what neural link is doing is they are developing a bmi technology and that is uh, body machine interface body mass index

661
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:42,540
Not quite. Uh, it's it's uh, sorry. It's actually brain machine interface. So these things already exist to some extent

662
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,140
They're like, um

663
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,300
They're like chips you could put in someone's brain

664
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,380
Uh, if like you're an amputee and you can give them a prosthetic to make them gay not to make them gay

665
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,100
But to make them uh able to be gay fully as they would have been if they hadn't lost their limb or whatever

666
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,740
Uh, and that's that's just like one example of what you can do with these

667
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,980
Wait, what?

668
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,020
You put a chip in their brain to make them think they have you put a chip in their brain, which uh, you know, which uh

669
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:11,900
Can read your brain signals and can like send information to like electronics that are contained like a prosthetic. That's cool

670
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,780
Yes, I do like yeah, that's like would bmi's are in general

671
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,380
but so

672
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,540
So what's what's most fascinating to me about this is elan musk's intentions in doing all these things with all his companies

673
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,460
And the way he's going about doing them and I had a whole I had a whole

674
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,260
Time the other day thinking about this and and I realized that he's the smartest man in the world

675
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:37,020
For by for by a lot and it's it's because of the way that his uh company

676
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,860
Like is structured what it's designed to do and in the article go check out the article really because it's absolutely fascinating

677
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:49,580
It talks about the way he sets up like his business model how there's like a uh, like there's a goal of the company

678
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:57,740
And uh, he sets up the like he realizes that he wants to achieve something like elan musk's goal is to uh live on mars

679
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,620
He wants to colonize mars and you know live there and die there. That's his goal for his personal life

680
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,660
So elan musk wakes up in the morning. Yeah, it is pretty cool

681
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,140
So he he wakes up in the morning and he thinks to himself

682
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,700
How am I going to achieve this goal of not just me personally getting to mars and dying there

683
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:18,140
But starting a colony on mars and realizing that he lives in america in a capitalist system

684
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:25,500
He then he realizes the only way to do that is to create corporate entities and incentives for average people to get involved

685
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,820
So what he does as his solution is he forms a company called spacex

686
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,820
Which is going to do all the hard work and get government grants in order to do so and shit by by figuring out

687
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,300
How to make this happen how to make this easy to get people to mars, you know relatively easy

688
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:47,580
And uh, and he's going to do all the work of establishing the base setting up trade routes to mars because he knows once there are trade routes

689
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:53,740
After that it'll be much much easier to make people even think about the idea of actually living on mars once we are

690
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,820
Are doing shit there period

691
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,580
But who are we trading with them?

692
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:02,700
We're not trading with anybody. Well, if there's anything there, we'll fucking beat them up because we're america. Um, but uh

693
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,900
We'll we'll just you know mine for resources or do whatever set up, you know, maybe we'll find that

694
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,180
It's fucking the arc of the covenant or something. I don't fucking know

695
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,340
Uh, but we'll go there and we'll do cool stuff, but he wants to live there because it's like

696
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,420
Step forward to space travel

697
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,380
So what i'm trying to say is like so he founds a company, right?

698
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:27,180
As a way to establish trade routes because he knows that's the only way to get people convinced in their own minds

699
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,020
He knows already that this is a reality

700
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,900
But in order to convince the stupid sheep out there in the real world

701
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,900
You have to do all the hard work for them present them with a plan as to like

702
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,020
Hey, I did all the work involved in making this thing happen

703
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:44,140
All I need you guys to do is agree that it's cool and then you will just want to be involved

704
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,740
And that's when people will start doing things that are in line with what he wants

705
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,340
And that is how he is a genius who is manipulating people to get things

706
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,180
They didn't even know they wanted by giving it to them almost for free

707
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,860
But doing all the hard work and that's the same shit with this neural link thing

708
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:05,100
People don't even know that what what what would be great for humanity is to be able to interface our own brains

709
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,340
with things like external memories or

710
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:12,780
You know super computers that can do the intense calculations that human brains aren't really well set up for

711
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,260
So what he's going to do is he's going to start this company

712
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,660
He's going to go figure out everything and eventually in like 20 50 years or whatever

713
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:25,420
He's going to present people with hey, I did all the hard work to make this wonderful thing that will revolutionize the world

714
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:30,140
Are you interested and as people realize that it works and they're getting great results

715
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:37,180
They'll say absolutely and that's the way that elan musk is fixing the future and making the world better for everyone

716
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,060
By just doing everything and then people will realize later how awesome it all is

717
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,660
and uh

718
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,660
And it's like ghost in the shell neural link is like ghost in the shell. So that's cool. So there you go

719
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,820
It is sugoi, isn't it? He deserves a clap

720
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,740
He deserves the clap

721
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,580
First one first one first one for one clap for elan musk. There you go now. Nate

722
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,580
Here's my problem with elan musk. Okay, sure. I read that he is an immigrant to the us

723
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,740
So he's probably a terrorist

724
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,500
You're right, dude. I didn't anticipate this twist. Why didn't we build a wall to keep him out?

725
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,260
We should have built that damn wall. God damn it. We should build a wall to keep him in

726
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,820
Build a wall around earth so we can't go to mars. Yeah, I hope we do

727
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:33,100
Uh, that reminds me of an anecdote about elan musk actually. Yeah, I was calling up the other day and he says

728
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,860
It's it's just like what you guys are doing online

729
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,780
You make one false move and everyone turns on you even though you made a great product

730
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,340
And then and then I says to him I says

731
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:51,580
Listen elan. I I know we gotta do I can support you if you just back me my nigga

732
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:56,780
You my nigga and he looks at me and he looks at me and says, you know what much you're my nigga

733
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,820
I've been with you since day one dog. I fucked with you heavy

734
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,940
That's how we started together called uh, space x

735
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,980
Nice more like space. It's it's it's space x right. Yeah

736
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,940
Fantastic. All right. Thanks

737
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,020
I didn't realize

738
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,580
Well, okay. Why don't you tell us uh creator yours?

739
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,500
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

740
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:31,580
Uh, another lee analysis legai is is is text talks and I think I think you subscribe to this channel

741
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:38,060
Oh, yeah him. Okay. He's a friend. Oh really fuck. I want to be a friend. Oh, well, no, no wait

742
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,540
No, no, he's his his his his his a thing munch munchie

743
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,420
Text talks is the name also of another person who used to be a brony analyst

744
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,740
So you're thinking of someone you're talking about someone

745
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:56,140
Good thing you explained I I I I know both of them. I don't know both of them, but I know of both of them

746
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,380
So I I got okay. Are you sure they're different people? That just seems weird. There's two people at the same name

747
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:06,380
Yes, the text talks. Uh, the brony is the guy with the the red oc and he's like angry talk and and

748
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,020
Oh, I remember him now. Okay, right. Yeah. All right. Yeah, it used to be called text

749
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:16,860
It was the guy who had the the fake unicorn horn that uh ben ripped off that ben stole the idea from I remember that

750
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,860
Yeah, yeah

751
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,100
And and and then and then yeah

752
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,020
I'm talking about specifically a guy who who makes who made a like like a homestuck analysis series

753
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,740
That's huge and and and great and super in death

754
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,180
One episode hasn't come out in a while, but it says he's working on so so I trust them. They're super cool. They so far

755
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,460
They've covered uh

756
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,740
Like the relation between computer science and like the world beginning of homestuck and they have also talked about how like

757
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:46,140
Gamze's character is bad on purpose. So it's like it's okay guys. Do you agree with that muchy?

758
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,580
Do you agree? No, no, I think he's a fucking sheep and I hate him. Okay, okay

759
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:58,780
But but but other other than his like bootlicking to hussy I I like him a bit and

760
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,060
I think is I think he's a smart guy and I like his content

761
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,940
He recently came out with like like an analysis of like doda2

762
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,300
And uh, I I don't give a single fuck about doda2

763
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,580
But he talked about tf2 for like three seconds and I and therefore yes

764
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,460
nice

765
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,540
One interesting thing about that guy

766
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,780
Uh, I linked his well, I I noticed that he

767
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,420
I think he talked to me about it or

768
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:30,780
Or sent me a message saying please show this to Nate because Nate your your analysis of grun lagann is like what inspired him

769
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,260
I think I hope I'm remembering that but yeah, he's like he likes your stuff

770
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,940
Which video are you talking about is like, uh, is the one you want me to show

771
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,060
No, no, I mean which of his videos, uh, did you did like he say to show?

772
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,020
No, he uh, I think I

773
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,660
I liked it

774
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,940
I linked it in the chat a while a long time ago when he posted it. So

775
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,060
Well, cool. I think yeah, he's he was doing good work

776
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,180
And I just wanted him to make more because I'm sure he'll improve like everybody does

777
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:04,220
I forget whether he made the the episode about risk or being important

778
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,660
I think I watch I'm looking at a channel right now and I see risk in a thumbnail

779
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:13,900
What yeah, probably probably I only only I remember is the one with rocks in the thumbnail the computer science one

780
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,900
Which was oh, broxy

781
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:21,100
Yeah, oh my oh my god. Nate. Did you see that one tweet? I said that was completely serious

782
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,540
We're one night. I just dreamed that I was fucking rocksy all like all night

783
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:30,140
It was great. Did you wake up and like, uh, you know skin yourself raw because you thought of that. Yeah

784
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:36,220
Yeah, that is a sin. It was awful. I went down like like two levels of crazy conscious and I think but but I made

785
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:40,540
I made it back. I I drank like 50 cans of of nick loading gag. So that's

786
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:47,340
That's great, dude. Seriously though. I love rocksy. She's the only thing good about homestack. Uh, yeah, she's she's pretty good

787
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:52,620
Uh, but yeah, uh, text talks pretty good. Like like it go good. Good job. Good. Okay. Yeah

788
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,980
I I can't remember whether he actually made that episode about brisco. He was going to and I was excited

789
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,340
Maybe he has made it and he's just not like titled as brisco

790
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,980
I don't know. I I watched all his videos

791
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,780
Worst anime ever brisco. That's gonna be good

792
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:13,500
Oh, yeah, I'll watch it. It has the the the right word in the

793
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,260
He's got the key word. Yeah the key word anime. Fuck. Yeah

794
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:22,700
That's what I type in I type in key words the key word ever because I want to live forever because i'm afraid of death

795
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,620
What hashtag don't let me die. Okay, uh

796
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,620
monkey

797
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,820
Let's move on

798
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:35,100
Okay, folks. You ready for a real problem? No. Yeah, biggest problem in the universe this week

799
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:41,100
Toe nail clippings. No digi bro. No, okay. I got I got somebody, you know, I

800
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:47,020
I don't remember the username, but that's not what's important here. We're just gonna talk about what they're doing wrong

801
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:53,020
Because we're here to learn a lesson. We're here, you know, you me us in the viewers want to know

802
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,900
How do I be a good content creator rather than a bad one?

803
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,420
And here's an example of one of the worst ones I've ever seen

804
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:06,220
So he makes these pokemon let's plays. Oh fucking. Oh, okay. All right. They're not very good

805
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,740
Because here's the problem. Sai has suffered enough. Sai has suffered enough

806
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:14,940
Come on. If this podcast could go on for three hours, I would include Sai, but it's not

807
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:22,300
So what this guy does instead of doing, you know, the typical let's play format like a 10 to 15 to 20 minute video

808
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,780
This fucker thinks, you know, I'm gonna put out an hour and 20 minute video once a week

809
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:32,860
Because everybody has time to watch a full movie instead of like watching it a couple times a week on their lunch break

810
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,540
But then

811
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:40,380
Then this is when this faggots laziness comes into play because it's not enough that he just records himself

812
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,700
And throws up an hour long video once a week

813
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,940
He'll get busy or sidetracked or forget and the fans will have to go

814
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,940
Two or three weeks without a new episode now when you're playing pokemon

815
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:55,980
It's important to know what the pokemon are and to feel attached to them so that when they die, you know

816
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,780
It's sad

817
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:02,380
But if you haven't seen an update in literally two and a half or three weeks and suddenly a new one pops up

818
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,620
I don't remember what fucking pokemon he had. I don't remember when he caught that. I don't give a shit when it dies

819
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,860
It's a shitty format. He's a lazy

820
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,100
Content creator and I really hope he actually suffers a painful death and dies

821
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,460
And his name is monkey jones

822
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,180
It's a gaming expectation

823
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:24,620
Well, you know, uh one one thing I noticed about that is uh one one thing that I do like about that

824
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:30,860
Is that he didn't lose and die in his pokemon sun nuzlocke? You know that I gotta say that's a strength

825
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,740
That's a strength of the series. That's because he cheated. I mean if you want to watch him, you know, look up everything

826
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,020
I'll blind nuzlocke

827
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,340
Max revive ben saint. So, you know, we're we're over that hurt. He's cheated in two different nuzlocke

828
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,340
So I think it's okay that I lost one

829
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,740
I don't think he's cheated at all. What is he?

830
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:51,580
Except for the max revive. I saw on the max revive episode. I saw some weird comment that said oh

831
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:56,940
Oh, these nuzlocke's are like professional wrestling. We know it's fake. I'm like, what the fuck you talking about

832
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:01,020
My heart's fucking fake. What the hell are you smoking pokemon? Not real

833
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,620
I don't know why he would say that but some some weird retard

834
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,340
As far as I remember it the the max revive thing was because he was the max revive thing was a bit of a meme

835
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:15,500
It was not real. It's not. Yeah. Yeah, it's not really like an actual cheat

836
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:18,700
But he did make his pokemon faint on purpose. So it should have been

837
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:20,780
discarded

838
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:26,700
I I guess I was I don't know for training purposes. I mean I for me. It's perfectly acceptable and I have no problem

839
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,700
The thing is the thing is

840
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,860
Uh

841
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:37,260
I do agree that the episodes are spaced too far apart and too long for me to keep invested in the pokemon themselves

842
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:42,860
But that is also probably because I just don't like nuzlocke's in general and I can't watch them

843
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:49,020
Well, let me well as somebody who loves nuzlocke's and somebody who sort of revived it in this little small gay community

844
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,940
I hate his long ass videos

845
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,780
I have to open another tab because I can't sit there staring at it for an hour and a half like a movie

846
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,780
I can't even watch movies in here. I mean

847
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,260
Okay, well, let me raise this point

848
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:04,540
I find ben's nuzlocke about a thousand times more interesting than yours and I watch both of them

849
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:09,100
And I think it's because a I actually really love how long the episodes are

850
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,380
I watch all I watch everyone's because I love all nuzlocke's

851
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,900
But uh, ben's are by far my favorites and I think it's because a I really like

852
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,500
How long the episodes are I I actually enjoy that and I it is annoying

853
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,460
I watch them all

854
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,460
It is annoying not to get them, you know frequently

855
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,260
But I understand it's a consequence of this and you could argue what's more effective in terms of like audience

856
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,180
You know retaining your audience

857
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,020
But for me I look forward to them more than any other video every week

858
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,980
I mean every month every well when they come out

859
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:44,860
They're my favorite thing and it's because of the gravitas that uh, he puts into them with the with the little artwork and the

860
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,020
I don't and I think the length of the video actually has a lot to do with it because you know

861
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:54,780
You're getting so much, you know, and I really get invested in I will I will say that I liked I liked the last nuzlocke

862
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,300
He did especially by the end because it was like oh look at all those drawings

863
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,900
He did all those drawings and next to him. It's like all those all those guys

864
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,140
The

865
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:10,060
I I I paid like zero attention to like what was going on because I had in the background just listening to it

866
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,740
But by the end I was like, oh, that was a nice

867
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,620
Remember when Ben went out with bananas and took bananas on that death date. That was like the coolest thing ever

868
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:20,860
I love that. It was the greatest fucking thing ever. He cares. He cares. Oh, that was good

869
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,740
There's a lot of classes a lot of attack. There's a lot of attack

870
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:28,300
He's going to attack me because I'm a terrorist and I'm going to bomb his city

871
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,140
And I mean Ben Ben has been working on this Pokemon hell angle for a while

872
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,300
And I I just I know that there is something to come at the end of it

873
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,260
And I'm like I'm really excited about that as opposed to being a normal nuzlocke

874
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,100
You know, I'm always excited for the elite four

875
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:45,180
But there's something extra going on here beyond and you could argue if it's worth the effort

876
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,300
But I do I gotta say it's my favorite nuzlocke. I've ever seen

877
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:53,980
I mean, I would argue in my original fire red nuzlocke. We put in lots of live action skits

878
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,420
That's probably the same amount of effort

879
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,660
He's putting those were great and I absolutely loved all of them, especially the manual stuff

880
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,460
That's true. That's true

881
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,940
Now they're shit. Well, yeah, I don't have an animal anymore

882
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,060
I don't really want to like compare you guys. No, I do. I want to compare myself to Ben. I do it every day

883
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,540
Well, if that's what you want to play I would just have to say that I think Ben's

884
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:21,340
Has a little bit something extra and it you know, you are way better in terms of getting them out on time

885
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,460
which is like kind of the most important thing I guess but uh

886
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:31,820
His his are his are I just think it shouldn't take anybody literally six months to play one game of pokemon

887
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,020
I agree. I agree

888
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,820
Well, ben and I you see you don't understand because ben and I spent a year doing let's plays of this game called

889
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,460
What fuck equestria bound. Oh my it's fucking god. I everyone's

890
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,180
No, let's play of all time. I need to maximize something. Max delete

891
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,940
Max delete t-bat. No t-bat plays will never die

892
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,660
We're still going the episodes are coming for uh equestria about

893
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:01,500
Oh, well, okay. I mean, you know, I don't want to criticize you in your opinion about

894
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:06,460
I want to say I want to say as someone who just generally doesn't care for no

895
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:11,260
I did a nuzlocke on on my given gaming thing and I blew through it in like five

896
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:16,300
You know 10 minutes. Everyone was dead. I was like, oh, well who cares and um

897
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,700
I don't like nuzlocke's I find them annoying and difficult to watch

898
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,460
And I have only watched ben's one. I couldn't watch anybody else's

899
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,900
So like as a person who by default hates a nuzlocke's

900
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,700
The fact that I am still watching ben's is is probably indicative that he's putting something

901
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:37,580
Something little little extra into it that makes it good. I like ben's nuzlocke's too

902
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:44,300
I kind of like I like the idea, you know drawing the the pokemons and and stuff like he's on little art

903
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,860
The main reason why I want to do a nuzlocke is because I want to do art like that

904
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:55,820
Well, you're welcome ben. I turned my hate circle jerk into a love circle jerk. There you go

905
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,460
patreon.com slash ben's

906
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,780
Oh, what have I done? I should have brought it in like a real thing. You fucked up, dude. You fucked up

907
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,500
Hey, who wants to bring in a creator? They like named monkey jones. I want to hear monkey jones one

908
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,380
Like I went to Africa. I saw black person. I left

909
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:25,820
That's why I don't like monkey jones content. Not a fan. Oh real quick before we move on

910
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:31,260
I am contractually obligated to say my favorite content creator is sheep over go check out sheep over on youtube

911
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:37,660
True everyone go play. Uh, what's that game called the sheep over the game game sucks game sucks

912
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,380
It's not a real gamer game

913
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:45,020
Gamer girl, dude, you don't even go have sex at kfc. You're fucking pathetic

914
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,660
Game

915
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:53,580
Yeah, we should we should start into a pcb speedrun of the sheep over game. We should I beat it but game

916
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:59,740
Hippo, what's the point of telling a person who's a huge fan of you and who was hoping you would like the game

917
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,580
Just spouting off that their game sucks. It's kind of mean

918
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,420
He wants to break spirits

919
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:12,060
Silly evil. She made the sheep jumping sound this the sheep from spiral because she thought you would like it

920
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,980
That's why that's why and you're sitting here shitting on the fucking game

921
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:22,060
You are a monster game. I just got frost. No, you're a bad person. I don't actually hate it. I just got I just got

922
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,700
This hole is just getting bigger and bigger

923
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,340
Um, no, I don't actually hate it. I just died a few I died a few times

924
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
I died a few times. I got annoyed

925
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,660
Then I beat it. Well, he didn't beat it. That's a something sheep over pcb race one

926
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:48,300
Sheep over pcb race to kill her sheep over race war. Ah, you said it first guy

927
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,860
So fucking racist

928
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:57,820
Come on. All right. Speaking of speaking of speaking of gamers. Yeah, cool gamers. I have another good guy

929
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,180
Um

930
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,180
Gamers tavern. Yeah. Yeah

931
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,780
Gamers tavern. Gamers tavern is a let's player who

932
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,780
Uh, is the most uh underrated word. Um

933
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:15,180
No, well, he's underrated, but you know, uh, he's the very the the word to describe his

934
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,860
The way he talks is very uh monotone monotone. He's the most monotone

935
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,020
Uh

936
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,340
Punmeister gamer in the world better than me at puns

937
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,060
He just he just he just

938
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,420
his let's plays consist of him playing a game and then

939
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,900
Uh, either I don't know whether he records it during or afterwards. Maybe afterwards

940
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:45,900
But he just recites puns about what's going on on screen one after another with no, you know, just long awkward pauses in between

941
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:51,420
Like no emotion in his voice. Just the same tone like it is absolutely masterful dry humor. It's the greatest

942
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:55,020
It's the greatest the dryness of the humor is so good. That's the word dry humor

943
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,780
The driest humor you will ever find on youtube so good

944
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,460
I love him. You guys brought quite the list of artists. I only had two

945
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,460
I I really I have like five more. I yeah, I've got a couple. I'm gonna

01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:14,380
I I assume I assume we're all gonna just like, you know, two or three and so not to prolong this but you guys

947
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,540
Yeah, me and maids don't have

948
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,140

01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:21,260
Yeah, me and maids are gonna go hang out and wait wait wait wait

950
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:26,220
I I I have I have another one like right right now. I have I need to say it

He it's got like 17 billion views and it's just mario kart and he says fuck you and there's peaches tits everywhere

954
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,180
It's the worst video I've ever seen

955
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:50,540
I hate I hate animators that are just super successful and awful at the same time

956
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:52,860
You know what?

957
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:59,420
You know what? I'm gonna throw another one. I just thought about youtuber. They're called jaden animations

958
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:05,820
They do little animations while they talk about their life and they're kind of like she's kind of like a like a dork

959
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:11,500
But a nice dork. I like her a real gamer girl at last. Could she be my future wife?

960
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,420
Ha ha ha ha

961
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,260
heart heart a fair maiden who plays li games

962
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,300
My god. Look at her mouse control truly mlg

963
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:35,100
Those are the genes. I want to pass to my son. Okay. Yeah. She's gelatin. She's she's quirky. She's funny and and I like her content

964
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:35,980
Gorky

965
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,260
What's her name?

966
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:40,540
Jaden animations. She's quite she's quite popular. Is she single?

967
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,540
I don't know.

968
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,540
That's what I want to know.

969
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,540
I'm not going to get caught by watching the video.

970
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,540
I'm not going to get caught by watching the video.

971
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,540
Monkey, just send her pictures of your ears.

972
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,540
That's your turn, Zemon.

973
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:54,540
I know gamerheads, dude.

974
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,540
Okay, but, uh, give what's saying.

975
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,540
Speaking of, uh, sick animators,

976
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,540
I just like to give a big shout out to my most beloved, uh,

977
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,540
YouTube animator of all time.

978
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,540
Zoe Quinn.

979
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,540
Uh, close.

980
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,540
It is, uh, Aaron, quote,

981
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:11,540
if I ever make a let's play, please kill me, Hanson.

982
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,540
My absolute favorite.

983
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,540
Uh, you know, that's really all there is to say.

984
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,540
I hate people.

985
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,540
Do you actually like him?

986
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,540
I actually, uh, as a businessman, I respect him greatly.

987
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,540
I think he's done all the right things.

988
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,540
Yeah.

989
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,540
As his opportunities have come along.

990
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:28,540
But every day I lament that he is spending so much time

991
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,540
on Game Grumps content I do not enjoy very much,

992
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,540
uh, as opposed to working on just like anything else

993
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,540
that I like more.

994
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,540
Well, the thing.

995
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,540
And I get business wise why he doesn't.

996
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,540
I just, okay, go ahead, go ahead.

997
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,540
He does have that, that business, like the business side.

998
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,540
I actually like that.

999
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,540
Um, I, I, at the time when he just, it was like clear

1000
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:50,540
that he was not going to do animations anymore.

1001
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,540
It became a bit sad for a while,

1002
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,540
but then I remembered his animations were pretty good,

1003
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,540
but it's basically just the stuff he says on Game Grumps.

1004
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,540
But even Sequelitis is like a thousand times better.

1005
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,540
If he just kept doing those.

1006
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,540
Well, yes, Sequelitis I would like more of.

1007
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,540
Sequelitis I would like more of, but I,

1008
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,540
I don't begrudge him for, for making Game Grumps

1009
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,540
a huge thing.

1010
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,540
I just find it sad that also now Game Grumps

1011
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,540
is not as good as it used to be and is boring.

1012
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,540
Well, hey, there you go.

1013
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,540
So now there's no reason for me to watch anything that he does.

1014
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,540
On the PCP topic, please.

1015
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,540
Don't we have Aaron Hansen as its own topic?

1016
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,540
I believe we do.

1017
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,540
I believe we do.

1018
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,540
We need it.

1019
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,540
We need a cooler.

1020
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,540
I guess I'll save that for later.

1021
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,540
Okay.

1022
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,540
Uh, needless to say, he's not even a dinosaur.

1023
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,540
What the fuck?

1024
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,540
You go raptor?

1025
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,540
Oh, I want to, I want to quickly,

1026
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,540
I want to quickly plug two of my favorite

1027
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,540
actual animators who are still animating animations.

1028
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,540
Okay.

1029
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,540
I mean, yes, ma'am, you have made animations,

1030
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,540
so that counts.

1031
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,540
But I'm thinking more of a hot diggity demon.

1032
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,540
I don't know what that means, but.

1033
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,540
A butt plug, I would assume.

1034
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,540
Yeah, right.

1035
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,540
Sure.

1036
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,540
Yeah.

1037
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,540
Of course.

1038
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:02,540
Hot diggity demon and, uh, Yotam Peril,

1039
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,540
who are, who are buddies, who are animators.

1040
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,540
Hot diggity demon recently has been doing.

1041
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,540
Brain dump.

1042
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,540
Brain dump.

1043
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,540
Yeah.

1044
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,540
Which is like a little review show,

1045
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,540
which is way over produced, animated.

1046
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,540
Yeah.

1047
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,540
And the thing I love about Max is he,

1048
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:19,540
he works way too hard, but it's great.

1049
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,540
The product that comes from,

1050
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,540
from how hard he works is like really like

1051
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,540
the best animation on YouTube at the moment.

1052
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,540
That comes out semi-regularly.

1053
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,540
Or regularly at all.

1054
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,540
It's just like really good.

1055
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:32,540
And Yotam Peril is just an adorable,

1056
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,540
um, animator guy who's very funny,

1057
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,540
and he does like really adorable voices

1058
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,540
and has a really cute art style.

1059
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:41,540
And he's just, but it's like cynical content as well.

1060
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,540
Like he's, he's, he's a cynical guy,

1061
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,540
but it's just like really happy little,

1062
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,540
little guys going, oh, oh no, I'm really sad now.

1063
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,540
You know, it's, you know, I can't really do stuff

1064
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,540
in that sort of.

1065
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,540
He's ironic, cynical, a nerd, and a lesbian.

1066
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,540
Deal with it.

1067
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,540
He's a, he's a nihilist.

1068
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,540
Wait, wait, let, let me, hang on.

1069
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:04,540
I got a, I got a wholesome, it's wholesome cynicism

1070
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,540
is what I would describe as, is that guy.

1071
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,540
Yotam.

1072
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,540
Now do you think that, do you think that the ghost

1073
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,540
on Brain Dump is funny?

1074
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,540
Not funny at all.

1075
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,540
It's the worst.

1076
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,540
I hate that fucking ghost.

1077
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,540
I hate him.

1078
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,540
Yeah, but the, the, the grandma's

1079
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,540
chunker, bunker, wonker junkers,

1080
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,540
that, that, that was great.

1081
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:23,540
I love that.

1082
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,540
That's the coolest.

1083
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,540
I unironically think he has some cool opinions.

1084
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,540
I know that's a dumb thing to say, but like he,

1085
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,540
he has some angles in his brain dumps

1086
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,540
that I wouldn't have thought of.

1087
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,540
And I'm like, oh yeah, he's got a good point.

1088
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:34,540
Yeah.

1089
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:35,540
He's a sweet cookie.

1090
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,540
I, I, I like hot diggy demons animations,

1091
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,540
but I don't like bring them for the most part,

1092
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,540
but it's fine.

1093
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,540
Oh well.

1094
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,540
I enjoy it.

1095
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,540
I enjoy it.

1096
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,540
I, I, I just, I, I like that.

1097
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,540
I like his talent, but I'm not really

1098
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,540
so sorry to his sense of humor.

1099
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,540
Yeah.

1100
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:52,540
Everyone, everyone seems to say that.

1101
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,540
Like, I think his humor is hilarious.

1102
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,540
When it's on point, like in the fucking

1103
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,540
invaders in one, fucking love the invaders in one.

1104
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,540
But who's the sassy cat?

1105
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,540
Who's the sassy cat that I really enjoy that part?

1106
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,540
Oh yeah, that was great.

1107
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,540
Oh, where's the Spyro video?

1108
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:12,540
Wasn't he like a little hell once?

1109
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,540
He went to BronyCon conventions,

1110
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,540
that's what you're asking about.

1111
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,540
He was, yeah, he went to those.

1112
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,540
Speaking of which, a quick shout out

1113
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,540
to Isle of Compossible a lot,

1114
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,540
my favorite YouTuber.

1115
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:20,540
Oh my God, my favorite.

1116
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,540
My favorite.

1117
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:25,540
Hark, a true gamer girl, over the horizon.

1118
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,540
Yes.

1119
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,540
Can I just give a shout out to every gamer girl,

1120
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,540
every real gamer girl out there,

1121
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,540
just the best, just the best.

1122
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,540
Please bear with me.

1123
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,540
My dear same maiden, may I fancy you

1124
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,540
a candy that shaped like a Nintendo

1125
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:39,540
entertainment system.

1126
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:42,540
I keep them to my breath, minty fresh.

1127
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,540
Would you like a shirt that says

1128
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,540
I heard Star Wars?

1129
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,540
Yeah.

1130
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:49,540
My other car is a millennium falconess.

1131
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:54,540
With a Batmobile scrapper.

1132
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,540
I want to give out one last real shout out,

1133
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,540
and this is very different from what you guys,

1134
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,540
what we talked about so far.

1135
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:07,540
So I am actually a huge fan of ASMR in general,

1136
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,540
and I watch it like all the time.

1137
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,540
Yeah, I know it's weird, right?

1138
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,540
But I'm big into it.

1139
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,540
I'm literally gay.

1140
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:16,540
And furthermore, I don't even like female ASMR,

1141
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,540
I only like male ASMR.

1142
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,540
Yeah, not a joke, not a joke.

1143
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,540
It is so gay that he's straight.

1144
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,540
It has a lot to do with the fact that I get a boner

1145
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,540
when I listen to female ASMR and have to jack off,

1146
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,540
so that's just annoying.

1147
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,540
So I listen to mostly males.

1148
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,540
This one guy is by far the favorite,

1149
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,540
he has proven himself over the years

1150
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:35,540
as the standout champion of the ASMR community,

1151
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,540
and his name is Ephemeral Rift.

1152
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,540
He is very popular, and he is the best.

1153
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,540
He does all these weird creaky-cookey things

1154
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,540
that some of them are hit, some are miss,

1155
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:47,540
but in general, I love most of what he does,

1156
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:50,540
and he's consistent, and he's fast, and he's great,

1157
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,540
and he also does, I don't know,

1158
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,540
he just talks about his views on life,

1159
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,540
and they're pretty in sync with mine,

1160
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,540
so I don't need to hate him,

1161
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,540
like I do every gamer girl who I marry.

1162
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,540
So there's that.

1163
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,540
And yeah, he's cool.

1164
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,540
So if you like male ASMR,

1165
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,540
Ephemeral Rift is by far the champion.

1166
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:07,540
Everyone else is shit.

1167
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,540
I used to love...

1168
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,540
Is it legal to be married to two people at once?

1169
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,540
Is that legal?

1170
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,540
In Utah, I think.

1171
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:15,540
Oh, shit.

1172
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,540
Yeah.

1173
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,540
That's Polly Ganey.

1174
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,540
Polly Ganey, yeah.

1175
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,540
Hello, my honey.

1176
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,540
Pollo Gamy.

1177
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,540
It's it.

1178
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,540
I'm a fucking asshole.

1179
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,540
Polly Propylene.

1180
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,540
Yo, let me tell you real quick, just one,

1181
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,540
just because I'm sure nobody who knows

1182
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,540
who the fuck Ephemeral Rift is.

1183
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,540
Like, here's an example of one of the things he would do.

1184
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,540
So like, he'll do like these role plays.

1185
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,540
Just get close to the mic.

1186
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,540
Well, yeah, he'll be fucking close to the mic.

1187
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:40,540
I mean, that's always assumed.

1188
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,540
Like, this guy, he does ASMR,

1189
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,540
which is all, you know, kind of the same shit,

1190
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,540
just like quiet talking and shit.

1191
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:50,540
But Nate, though, isn't it a separate topic on the list?

1192
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,540
Yes, but I just wanted to tell people

1193
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,540
what I like about this specific guy

1194
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,540
in regards to this.

1195
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:58,540
And it's so like, just one example is,

1196
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:01,540
he did one video where it's like him

1197
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,540
in the post-apocalyptic world, right?

1198
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,540
And he is like, he is pretending to his son,

1199
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,540
which is you.

1200
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:09,540
You're like his, or I guess his kid.

1201
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,540
It's gender non-specific.

1202
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:14,540
And he is like pretending that in the apocalypse,

1203
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:17,540
no, he's pretending to like be a fancy restaurant.

1204
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,540
Okay.

1205
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,540
And so like, he's got like cans of spam

1206
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:23,540
and he's pretending that it's like really high quality food

1207
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,540
and he's eating it and like,

1208
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,540
like the premise here is that he is pretending

1209
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,540
that it's really fancy and nice and delicious.

1210
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:32,540
And he's also talking about how like,

1211
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,540
like your mom died and she,

1212
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,540
or she like ran off when the apocalypse struck.

1213
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,540
And like, this just gets woven into this like ASMR video.

1214
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,540
And he's talking about like, yeah, you know, son,

1215
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,540
I loved your mom, but she was dumb as a stump.

1216
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,540
And she's probably out like fucking a,

1217
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,540
like a warlord right now.

1218
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,540
That's just what your mom is doing right now.

1219
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,540
I hope that, you know, if you weren't here,

1220
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,540
I would have blown my brains out long ago,

1221
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,540
but you know, I care about you.

1222
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,540
And that's just the kind of shit he talks about.

1223
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,540
And that's, that's very much my aesthetic.

1224
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,540
I like spam.

1225
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,540
He's deep as fuck.

1226
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,540
Yeah, spam.

1227
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:05,540
I like watching many spam.

1228
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:06,540
That's what I'm trying to say.

1229
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,540
I'm gay. I'm literally gay.

1230
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,540
Welcome to the Munchy ASMR.

1231
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:13,540
Today I'm going to be cleaning up the remains of my ex-wife.

1232
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:18,540
I, I, I, she, she's all over bits in my room.

1233
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,540
I'm going to have to clean her up before the police call.

1234
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:23,540
That's not even, that's not even unrealistic for things

1235
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:24,540
that some of these guys would do.

1236
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,540
I want an ASMR of Munchy peeing on, on his face.

1237
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:31,540
Someone may, someone needs to go out there.

1238
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,540
A piece of defense needs to go make the Munchy peeing supercut

1239
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,540
and put together all the fucking piss shots.

1240
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,540
Please.

1241
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,540
The piss shots.

1242
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,540
The money shots.

1243
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,540
The piss shots.

1244
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,540
The piss shots.

1245
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,540
Oh no.

1246
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,540
Okay. Well, I'm, I'm done.

1247
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,540
I got more, but that was all the important ones.

1248
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:46,540
Let me go.

1249
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:47,540
Okay.

1250
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,540
Okay. Okay.

1251
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:50,540
Okay. This is another guy that, that, that hippo,

1252
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,540
the hippo knows.

1253
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,540
Uh, trainer tips.

1254
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,540
Oh yeah.

1255
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:56,540
Train, trainer tips.

1256
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:57,540
He's pretty cool.

1257
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,540
Is, is a vlog of a guy named Nick.

1258
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,540
And he really, really fucking likes Pokemon Go.

1259
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,540
Like, like really.

1260
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,540
He really likes Pokemon Go.

1261
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,540
Like, like faithfully.

1262
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:09,540
Like, basically every video on his channel is about Pokemon Go.

1263
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,540
But it's like, like, like, but it's not, it's like,

1264
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,540
a lot of people like come like to him to like,

1265
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,540
oh, how do I learn the strats?

1266
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,540
But it's like, his channel is really just like a vlog.

1267
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,540
Like, like, like most of the video is just like,

1268
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,540
like him, like doing his, his, his normal day stuff.

1269
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,540
But he also just happens to like Pokemon Go a lot.

1270
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,540
So he's, he like, he gets into mechanics and shit.

1271
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,540
And he like teaches the kids, but it's mainly a vlog.

1272
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,540
And the reason I like him, most, most of all,

1273
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,540
he feels like a cool guy and shit.

1274
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:42,540
But you know, the main reason is that his editing is fucking,

1275
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,540
it's great.

1276
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,540
It's, it's really great.

1277
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,540
It's super high production.

1278
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:50,540
And, and, and the way he like, the way he cuts his like,

1279
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,540
the way he cuts his scenes by like, like,

1280
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,540
like I'll put his hand over and it'll fucking take it away

1281
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,540
and it'll be in a new scene.

1282
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,540
All his transitions are great.

1283
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,540
Everything about him is fucking cool.

1284
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:00,540
He has like drone footage in.

1285
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,540
So he'll like, he like lives in like Long Beach.

1286
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:06,540
It was like the prettiest fucking city ever made in humanity.

1287
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,540
North Side Long Beach.

1288
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,540
Yeah.

1289
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,540
He'll just like fly like his drone over and get like a cool

1290
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,540
shot of like above Long Beach.

1291
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,540
He's, he's, he puts way too much effort in shit.

1292
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,540
And he releases videos every day.

1293
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,540
So he's like Nate, but better.

1294
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,540
He's like Nate, but every day.

1295
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,540
Yeah.

1296
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:24,540
But every day.

1297
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,540
Every night.

1298
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,540
Every night.

1299
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,540
Every day.

1300
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,540
Best Nate ever.

1301
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,540
Number nine.

1302
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:30,540
Get out.

1303
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,540
Oh, by the way.

1304
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,540
Okay.

1305
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:36,540
I like, I like trainer tips editing as well.

1306
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,540
It's, it's that he used to be like, I mean,

1307
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:43,540
he still is like inspired heavily by Casey Neistat.

1308
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,540
If you've ever seen Casey Neistat vlogs,

1309
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,540
where it's like, you just going around,

1310
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:51,540
I'm rich and I got a electric skateboard and I'm going to woo.

1311
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,540
And that, you know, that's Casey Neistat.

1312
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,540
I'm on a plane again.

1313
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,540
It's stuff like that, except intercut with Pokemon Go footage

1314
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,540
and him talking about Pokemon Go and saying,

1315
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,540
Oh, look at this catch.

1316
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,540
And recently the other day, which is like really cool.

1317
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:08,540
He went to Australia to catch a Kangaskhan because he has money for that now.

1318
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,540
That's awesome.

1319
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:16,540
And, and he, the whole video was basically literally a documentary of him as a,

1320
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:21,540
you know, like a, you know, that famous Australian guy that would go up to.

1321
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,540
Guy who like finger and punch rain died.

1322
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,540
Yeah.

1323
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,540
Yeah.

1324
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:27,540
Yeah.

1325
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,540
Yeah.

1326
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,540
Yeah.

1327
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,540
Steve Irwin.

1328
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,540
He did a whole like video where he was like sneaking up on a Kangaskhan to try and catch

1329
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,540
it.

1330
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,540
And he, and you know, he edited it.

1331
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,540
So yeah, he had the, the, the accent go in the whole thing.

1332
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,540
And it was like, it was like a real like production, like a, like a little,

1333
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,540
and he was just him with his camera and Pokemon Go.

1334
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,540
And he did all this in Australia.

1335
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,540
Yeah.

1336
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,540
Australia is like, it was really cool.

1337
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:51,540
It was really good.

1338
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,540
Even though the action was kind of cringy, but it was a good job.

1339
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,540
I like him.

1340
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,540
He's good.

1341
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:59,540
And you know, just speaking of Pokemon Go, I'd like to give a shout out to my favorite

1342
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,540
meme creator of 2016.

1343
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:01,540
That would be Hillary Clinton.

1344
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,540
Pokemon Go to the polls.

1345
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,540
There you have it.

1346
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:04,540
Now, I don't know who made this shitty joke.

1347
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,540
I want to figure out how to make them fucking die.

1348
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,540
Okay.

1349
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:07,540
I do have one serious actual YouTuber.

1350
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:08,540
I just, I just thought of this person as a side note.

1351
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,540
The, the biggest problem with them is that they haven't uploaded and got almost three

1352
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,540
years now.

1353
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,540
It's, it's, it's really shitty.

1354
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,540
Yeah.

1355
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,540
Best guy ever.

1356
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,540
No.

1357
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,540
Yeah.

1358
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:17,540
Yeah.

1359
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,540
Yeah.

1360
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,540
Yeah.

1361
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,540
Yeah.

1362
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,540
Yeah.

1363
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:22,540
Yeah.

1364
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,540
Yeah.

1365
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,540
Yeah.

1366
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,540
Yeah.

1367
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:26,540
Best guy ever.

1368
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:27,540
No.

1369
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:31,300
The, the last one they called was something about how life's really unfair about being lonely

1370
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,300
or something.

1371
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,700
Big shout out to Elliot Roger, my favorite YouTube, YouTube content.

1372
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,020
I hope, come back soon, brother.

1373
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,020
Come back soon.

1374
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,020
Make more.

1375
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,020
Nate.

1376
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,020
Nate, didn't you hear what happened to him?

1377
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,020
No.

1378
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,020
What?

1379
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,020
No, he got a movie deal.

1380
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,020
He's not doing YouTube anymore.

1381
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:48,100
I mean, I'm happy for him, but I feel like it won't be the same as the content that we've

1382
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,100
come to expect from him.

1383
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,100
Yeah.

1384
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:54,540
They're making a, they're making a Columbine retribution movie and he's starring in it.

1385
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,540
Mix feelings, dude.

1386
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,540
Mix feelings about that.

1387
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:00,300
It's, it's a revolutionary film technique because they're actually going to kill real

1388
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,300
people.

1389
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,300
Yeah.

1390
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,300
No, no.

1391
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,300
Yeah.

1392
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:05,300
They're just going to record him shooting people.

1393
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,300
It's going to be cool.

1394
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,300
That sounds good.

1395
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,500
I was actually sleuthing around myself because, because I'm a big fan of his work and like

1396
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:13,820
I, I found like a YouTube channel that's like basically I didn't come so it's a little

1397
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:17,540
bit of conspiracy theory, like a little bit of elite, but I think I found like like a secondary

1398
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,540
channel of his.

1399
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,540
It's called like Monkey Jones.

1400
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,940
I don't know if you've ever heard of it, but, but I think.

1401
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,940
Wait, Munchy Jones?

1402
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,940
You see Munchy Jones?

1403
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:24,940
Yeah.

1404
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:25,940
Yeah.

1405
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,940
What I'm saying is you guys should subscribe to Munchy Jones.

1406
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:28,940
It's a real channel.

1407
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,940
Look it up.

1408
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,940
Yeah.

1409
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:31,940
It is.

1410
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,940
And I think, I think he's doing God's work.

1411
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:34,940
I think he's doing the Queen's work.

1412
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:35,940
Yeah.

1413
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:36,940
All right.

1414
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:40,940
I have, I have, this is the last one that I actually have any preparation for.

1415
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:41,940
Okay.

1416
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,940
Niga Higa is, is a YouTuber.

1417
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,940
Oh, I remember him.

1418
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:46,940
Yeah.

1419
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:53,460
He was like way back in 2005 making videos, vlogs and stuff and he grew huge and, and

1420
01:27:53,460 --> 01:28:00,620
stuff, making funny videos, funny skits, you know, comedy stuff and yeah, how to be a

1421
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:04,460
gangster, how to be a nerd, how to be an injured video, I think.

1422
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:05,460
Yeah.

1423
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,900
And maybe that was somebody else.

1424
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:16,140
But the thing about him, which I feel, I feel among all the like 100, like billion trillion

1425
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,660
subscribed channels, like he's really high up there.

1426
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:25,540
The thing that I think compared to everyone else is just that he, he deserves it more

1427
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:31,500
than anyone else because his videos are just so consistently well done.

1428
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:39,060
Like he writes so much, like twists and turns into his scripts and executes them every time.

1429
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:44,060
Like really like, it's funny because like every video just looks like, oh yeah, it's

1430
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:47,820
just another big video from a guy who's a big YouTuber and it's like whatever, it's

1431
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,980
just him saying, hi guys, I'm gay.

1432
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:53,300
Like, you know, it doesn't look like it's going to be good.

1433
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:57,140
But every time I watch it, because I know by the end I will be smiling.

1434
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:00,100
It's always, it's always got something good in it.

1435
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,100
And it's nice.

1436
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:06,940
He does, he does some things that like, he made a Rube, a Rube Goldberg machine.

1437
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,340
I think what, that's what it's called, right?

1438
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,340
Yeah, a Rube Goldberg.

1439
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,340
Rube Goldberg.

1440
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,340
One of those, yeah.

1441
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:15,940
He made one of those just for a short like two second clip of a thing in a video and

1442
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:21,700
it was like a really extensive, like in his garage, garage, garage, like a whole big thing.

1443
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,220
And the, you know, he had like bloopers of it not working the first time and he had to

1444
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,820
reset it up.

1445
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:31,860
And it's just, I really appreciate the amount of work that must go into every video he does

1446
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,860
because it's good.

1447
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,860
Thanks for reminding me of him.

1448
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:39,740
I want to watch some of his videos now, then it's going to, yeah.

1449
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:44,660
But also watch his new stuff, like anything, anything he's made is like, it may seem like

1450
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:50,100
a dumb thing that's like, you think, oh, well, the obvious joke is this, he's going

1451
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,100
to make something that isn't the obvious joke.

1452
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,220
That's how I would say about all this stuff.

1453
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:56,220
Tee hee.

1454
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,220
Tee hee.

1455
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,220
Yes.

1456
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:59,220
Yep.

1457
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,260
Well, with that, are we, are we done with all our creators?

1458
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,260
No, no, why?

1459
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,380
Oh, please, can we go to questions, please?

1460
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,380
No.

1461
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,380
Okay.

1462
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:07,380
You got, you got one more, dude.

1463
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,380
You got one more.

1464
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:09,380
Like a cow.

1465
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,380
Like a power round.

1466
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,380
Like a power round.

1467
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,380
It's a trio of people.

1468
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:15,620
It's like the Eric Gontrich show, it was just the skits and also better and it has really

1469
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:19,900
tight editing and it's really like fucking like crazy, weird comedy skits, but the new

1470
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:23,980
shit is like weird, like political and like kind of weird.

1471
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,640
Their old stuff is like it, like if you had like a fever dream, but instead of taking

1472
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:30,180
Nyquil to treat it, you took a black pill, green pill, and down it with some Nickelodeon

1473
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,180
Gac.

1474
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,180
It's pretty good.

1475
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:36,260
Watch, watch all the stuff around Charles bombshot 9-11 video and before that, then we

1476
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:40,180
have Wisdom Gun, that's that's Parkour dude 91's creator, Ran Runkowski's new channel,

1477
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,580
after Fall of the Eagle Nation.

1478
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:45,140
It's pretty similar to old, like millionaires extreme stuff, except like more Parkour dude

1479
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,140
91.

1480
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,140
Pretty good.

1481
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,580
I haven't followed Wisdom Gun very, very often, but it's, it's, it's, it's pretty,

1482
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,580
it's pretty good.

1483
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,580
Go, go there.

1484
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,780
The last real one, Temple of Rigs party.

1485
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:54,780
It's a really good band.

1486
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,780
It's like, it's like 80s.

1487
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:59,740
It's like, it's like a vapor wave was like good and not a horrible, awful dribble.

1488
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,580
It's like 80s rock synth wave.

1489
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:09,580
And now the thing we've all been waiting for, hashtag, say it with me folks, Max Revive T-Lag.

1490
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:14,580
We need to get T-Bap back on the front lines.

1491
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:16,580
We need to get them back.

1492
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,580
All right, all right, all right, you kids don't, you, you guys don't even fucking know.

1493
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,580
There's these two horses, right?

1494
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:24,580
And they're getting all their sludge on when suddenly these bitches come up and their

1495
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:25,580
motherfucking grill bitch.

1496
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:31,580
So they have to ward off these smelly, extravagant bitches while still doing their horse homework

1497
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:32,580
on horse time.

1498
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:34,580
What the fuck?

1499
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:39,580
Get them on the phone.

1500
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,580
They need to come back to you.

1501
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,580
Hang on.

1502
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,580
I'm going to call cake standard right now.

1503
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,580
That guy's a busy man.

1504
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,580
Who knows if I'll answer.

1505
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:50,580
All right, say something for this stream.

1506
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,580
What?

1507
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:52,580
Who's calling me?

1508
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:53,580
Who is this?

1509
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:54,580
What's going on?

1510
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,580
Is that you, Gibbon?

1511
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:58,580
Yeah, Keg, fucking where are you dude?

1512
01:31:58,580 --> 01:31:59,580
What happened?

1513
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,080
Oh, you know, I went back to college.

1514
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,580
I dropped out for 20 years and then I went back.

1515
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:07,080
It's, you know, that's just, I'm trying to get my GED.

1516
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:11,080
Oh, did you go to the college where KP did that song like you were in the background?

1517
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,080
No, I can't afford to that.

1518
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,080
I had to make my own college in my own house.

1519
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:19,080
It's cake standards, a university of Puss.

1520
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,080
The UP, yeah, that.

1521
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,080
That's where I go.

1522
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,080
I'm learning how to sex myself.

1523
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,080
I'll have my degree soon and then I'll have a lucrative career ahead of me.

1524
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,080
Thank you, UP.

1525
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,080
Thank you, UP.

1526
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,080
Do you know what the phone is?

1527
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,080
I'm sitting in a drone.

1528
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,080
I'm sitting in a drone.

1529
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,080
He's going to be gone in a couple of seconds.

1530
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,080
Get him off the phone.

1531
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,080
Okay.

1532
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,080
Goodbye.

1533
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,080
All right.

1534
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,080
Bye.

1535
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,080
That was the last thing we ever made here.

1536
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,080
Keg's fucking done.

1537
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,080
Keg's done.

1538
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,080
That poor bastard.

1539
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,080
Keg is over.

1540
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:50,080
Now he's got a fine phantom on wherever he is.

1541
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,080
Is it like Siberian caves?

1542
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,080
We've got to send us a drone his way too.

1543
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,080
I'm looking forward to that.

1544
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,080
Okay, let's do the questions now.

1545
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,080
Okay.

1546
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,080
Here we go.

1547
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,080
I got a couple assembled here.

1548
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,080
Okay.

1549
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,080
What was the first one I saw?

1550
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,080
Okay.

1551
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,080
Here we go.

1552
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:11,080
At Spacko 306 asks, if Kirby absorbed you, what power would he get?

1553
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,080
Depression.

1554
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,080
Good one.

1555
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,080
Very good.

1556
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:18,080
That's similar to like the sleep power where he's just immobilized for a while.

1557
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,080
No, no, no, no, no.

1558
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,080
When Kirby has depression, you can't help.

1559
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:28,080
But whenever you press any direction, he walks closer to the edge.

1560
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,080
Yes.

1561
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,080
And he's about to break.

1562
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,080
He's one step closer to the edge.

1563
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,080
Oh, you got it.

1564
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:41,080
And the only difference between Kirby's depression and Mumki's depression is that Mumki's never

1565
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,080
goes away.

1566
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,080
Mumki can't just press a button and make it turn to a little star and get rid of it.

1567
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,080
Well, no.

1568
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,080
Has he ever tried it?

1569
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,080
No.

1570
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,080
Press select.

1571
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,080
Press select.

1572
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,080
I haven't tried using the Mumki cheat codes yet.

1573
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,080
I'm trying not to cheat.

1574
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,080
Okay, that's fine.

1575
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,080
Well, then you're not like Ben Stain at all.

1576
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,080
No.

1577
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,080
Okay, let's see.

1578
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,080
I'm not like Ben Stain.

1579
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,080
No, no, no.

1580
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,080
If Kirby nailed me, hmm, let me think.

1581
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,080
Well, here, here.

1582
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,080
Jack.

1583
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,080
Kirby's right next to me.

1584
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,080
Kirby's right next to me.

1585
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,080
Why don't you inhale me?

1586
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,080
Get on the ground!

1587
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,080
You fucking nuisance!

1588
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,080
That's like the megaphone power.

1589
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:14,080
You have like a racist variation of the megaphone power.

1590
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,080
Yeah.

1591
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,080
That's perfect.

1592
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,080
Oh, you know what he'd get?

1593
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:21,640
He'd get the Ku Klux Klan hat and a megaphone and would just, you know, go to town with

1594
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,640
that shit.

1595
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,640
Perfect.

1596
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,640
Perfect.

1597
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,640
Yes.

1598
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,640
It's like, you know, you know how the megaphone power gives him like, first he's got like

1599
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:30,280
the radio announcer with like the headphones, then he gets like the one with like the Mohawk

1600
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,120
with like the guitar or whatever.

1601
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,360
And then like the other is just like a little megaphone.

1602
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,560
Like you would have the fourth step.

1603
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,000
That's like the Ku Klux Klan hat and a big megaphone shouting at a Black Lives Matter

1604
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
rally.

1605
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That would be, uh...

1606
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Exactly.

1607
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Guys, okay.

1608
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Take this voice apple right here.

1609
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,480
Mission body and like make a mod of Smash 4.

1610
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,800
Make the end place high with that.

1611
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,080
Just replace Kirby with that.

1612
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,080
Make that Kirby Smash 4.

1613
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,080
Wait, we say it again?

1614
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,920
Like mission body.

1615
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,400
Take that voice slip right there.

1616
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,400
Like isolate.

1617
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,400
Download this video and isolate that.

1618
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:01,800
Then make a Smash 4 mod where instead of Kirby saying hi, he says listen buddy.

1619
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:02,800
Oh yes.

1620
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,800
As is taught.

1621
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,800
That's that's genius.

1622
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,800
Somebody do that.

1623
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,800
Uh, monkey.

1624
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,800
I mean, sorry, Mage.

1625
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,800
Go on, go on.

1626
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,440
If, if, if, if Kirby inhaled me, he'd get an edgy OC.

1627
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,440
Oh, shit.

1628
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,440
Are you as Sasuke?

1629
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,440
No.

1630
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,440
No.

1631
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,440
Like edgy.

1632
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,440
Don't you know lethal?

1633
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,440
Lethal, Mage?

1634
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:21,440
Yeah, exactly.

1635
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,160
Make a personification of self-loathing, which is a very edgy OC.

1636
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,160
Yes.

1637
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,160
Nice.

1638
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,160
Uh, what about you, Gib?

1639
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:33,160
It'd be the power to shit on somebody who made a game for you.

1640
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,160
Yes.

1641
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,160
Uh, yes.

1642
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,160
I'm sorry.

1643
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,160
Oh.

1644
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,160
I'm sorry.

1645
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,160
No.

1646
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:50,160
Kirby, Kirby would get the ability to, um, not make main channel videos.

1647
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,160
Exactly.

1648
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,160
That's, that's absolutely perfect.

1649
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,320
Um, God, I don't know what he would do if he ate me.

1650
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:03,120
Uh, he get like a thousand, he get like a sunglass to, you know, generating and throwing

1651
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,120
power.

1652
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,120
Yeah.

1653
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,120
Yeah.

1654
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,120
I was going to say something with sunglasses.

1655
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,120
Yeah.

1656
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,120
Yeah.

1657
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,120
I'd do it.

1658
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,120
Uh, okay.

1659
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,120
Here we go.

1660
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,120
Before we go to the next question, can I make a clarification real quick?

1661
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,120
Sure.

1662
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,120
Uh, okay.

1663
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,440
I don't want to, I don't want to make it seem weird.

1664
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:20,320
So earlier in this podcast, I was very hard on Ben and I just want to clarify that I do

1665
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,440
actually hate him and I hope he dies.

1666
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:28,120
I didn't want anybody to get confused by, you know, kind of the jokey nature earlier

1667
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,120
on.

1668
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,120
I'm not kidding.

1669
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,800
I actually hate him as a human being and I want him to be suffering, being pain.

1670
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:34,800
That's understandable.

1671
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,440
Monkey, you have never not ever, you've never like gone back on that.

1672
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,920
Like even like one-on-one conversations, you stick to it.

1673
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,280
I don't know how, how jokey it is.

1674
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,920
It's too real.

1675
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,440
We made a few vlogs when I was at Digi's house last time and I was at least civil with Ben

1676
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,600
in those videos.

1677
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,600
Okay.

1678
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,800
So he's able to package his, you know, his hatred away at least temporarily at times.

1679
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,640
I'm only nice to people when they're within distance of hitting me.

1680
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,640
Understandable.

1681
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,640
Makes sense.

1682
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:04,640
Okay.

1683
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,640
Next question.

1684
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,640
Here we go.

1685
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:12,040
Uh, at Janiz Makudomaru, our old buddy says, uh, I'm getting a new comp in a few weeks.

1686
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,640
Should I get the protection plan with McAfee or not?

1687
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,960
Um, I'm gonna have to go with a, I'm gonna have to go with, yeah.

1688
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,520
You want to protect your shit, dude?

1689
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,120
You should get McAfee and Norton and have them fight.

1690
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:28,920
See, make them both claim that each one of their, like each other is a virus.

1691
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,920
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1692
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,840
Yeah, you compete to see which is more powerful and you take the winner.

1693
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,840
That makes sense to me.

1694
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,560
Well, they, they should get a vast because it annoyingly likes talking to you.

1695
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,720
So you'll never feel alone.

1696
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:45,240
I just want whatever plan has that little paper clip come up is like, Hey, uh, can

1697
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,240
I help you?

1698
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,240
Uh, how do you use Windows?

1699
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,240
You don't seem to know what the fuck you're doing.

1700
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,240
Let me help you.

1701
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:52,000
I have a really great, uh, antivirus program.

1702
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,320
It's called Bonsai Buddy.

1703
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,320
I use it all the time.

1704
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,320
I have a couple different versions of this all right now that they're talking to me.

1705
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:00,880
They're trying to sell me like hamburger helper right now, but it's just really helpful

1706
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:01,880
because I often buy it.

1707
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:02,880
Do you actually have that?

1708
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,880
No.

1709
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:04,880
No.

1710
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,880
Okay.

1711
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,440
I would have really loved you to actually have it.

1712
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,440
Serious suggestion.

1713
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,200
I use AVG because it's free and it's kind of okay.

1714
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,160
I actually have no idea if it does anything at all.

1715
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,640
I don't even know.

1716
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,920
I have no answer to this.

1717
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:20,280
I use spy bought search and destroy.

1718
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,360
I just go to download more word.com.

1719
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:25,360
Whenever I have any problems and just hit a couple of minutes more.

1720
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,360
All right.

1721
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,360
Fucking.

1722
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,360
Oh, Nate.

1723
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,360
Can I pick a question?

1724
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,360
Yeah, go for it.

1725
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:33,440
Uh, at monkey away wants to know, and I wanted to ask this because me and did you were too

1726
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:38,880
scared to talk about it, uh, who of the PCP, who likes the insufferable social media debate

1727
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,480
podcast and who hates it?

1728
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,720
Cause we said half you hate it and half you love it.

1729
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:44,720
I like it.

1730
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:48,760
I, I, I, I, I think, I wouldn't, I wouldn't pay for the bonus of doing right now.

1731
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,760
I, I enjoy it, but I wouldn't pay for the bonus episode because I don't pay for things,

1732
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,760
but I do like it.

1733
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,760
It's, it's fun.

1734
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,760
It's like, it's like a new dynamic that I've never seen Digi try to be and succeed at being

1735
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,760
funny ever.

1736
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:08,200
Like he's actually funny and I, no, no, no, it's a backhanded compliment.

1737
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:12,840
Digi is generally not funny, but in this podcast, he is very funny and I like it.

1738
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:16,600
I, it's one of those things that I actually liked the idea of a lot, but I never watch

1739
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,600
it.

1740
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,360
I've seen like one, I think, and, and liked it.

1741
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,720
And then when there was a bonus episode, I like had an instinct to want to see it.

1742
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:26,440
But as soon as there were any impediments to doing so, uh, lost all interest.

1743
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,840
So, uh, yeah, that's, that's where I'm at.

1744
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:29,840
That's where I'm at.

1745
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,840
We didn't have any of the real haters on that podcast is how good the person who made

1746
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:39,600
the thumbnail spelled in the first episode fucked up and changed it.

1747
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,600
Yeah.

1748
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,600
He didn't raise.

1749
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,600
It's fucked up.

1750
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,600
Dude.

1751
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,800
Nobody seems to dislike it though.

1752
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,800
Nobody seems to dislike it.

1753
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,800
Well, I think the people who dislike it aren't here today.

1754
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,800
That's probably true.

1755
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,840
Uh, let's see here.

1756
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:53,840
Digi.

1757
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,840
Uh, okay.

1758
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:01,160
How about, um, Digida, oh, at DSI Benji says, this isn't a question, but says this isn't

1759
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:06,080
a question, but I want you guys to talk about giving to raise amazing rap rap dog.

1760
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,040
And I also want to talk about rap dog.

1761
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,040
Yeah.

1762
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,040
It was awesome.

1763
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,040
Yeah.

1764
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:15,840
I was in one day because I felt like I've always wanted to make music and I don't know

1765
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,840
how.

1766
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:17,840
So I just did that.

1767
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,840
It was great.

1768
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:19,840
Your dad was successful.

1769
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,840
Yeah.

1770
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,840
Wasn't your dad in that?

1771
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,840
Yeah.

1772
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,840
Yeah.

1773
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,840
My dad was in there.

1774
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,840
Your dad was the main character.

1775
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,840
You got a dad.

1776
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,840
You seem.

1777
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,840
Uh-oh.

1778
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,520
Uh-oh.

1779
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,520
Shouldn't have mentioned it.

1780
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,520
Oh, no.

1781
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,520
Yeah.

1782
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,680
But you see, Munchy, you're implying that it would be easy to steal my dad.

1783
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,680
It's not.

1784
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,680
It's in fact very difficult.

1785
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,680
He's unstealable.

1786
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,680
We'll see about the unstealable dad.

1787
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:42,680
My worst nightmare.

1788
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,680
My worst nightmare.

1789
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,680
He has like sticky shoes.

1790
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:45,680
He could stick to the floor at any time.

1791
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,680
Oh, no.

1792
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,680
That's the one thing I didn't account for is goop.

1793
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,680
Even though all I think about every day of my fucking life is goop.

1794
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,680
That's the one thing I didn't account for is goop.

1795
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,680
That's the one thing I didn't account for is goop.

1796
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,680
Even though all I think about every day of my fucking life is goop.

1797
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,680
No.

1798
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,680
That's the one thing I didn't account for is goop.

1799
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,680
Even though all I think about every day of my fucking life is goop and sludge and ooze.

1800
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,680
I didn't account for it.

1801
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,680
Shit.

1802
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:57,680
You know, I meant to actually mention this question in response to Munchy's last one, but I forgot

1803
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,680
to.

1804
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:13,440
And it was just, um, by At Admired the Tire said, uh, thoughts on Munchy thinking his

1805
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,400
opinions are worth $1?

1806
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:19,000
No opinion is worth spending on money on, in my opinion, especially people just spewing

1807
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
shit.

1808
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,720
Any, any response to that, Munchy?

1809
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:22,720
Yeah.

1810
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:25,560
I think he doesn't know what the show is if he thinks it's my opinion show.

1811
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,560
That's fair.

1812
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:32,200
He might just be retarded as most, uh, as, well, I mean, to be fair, as everyone paying

1813
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,080
money for that show, if I could say something, it's really weird.

1814
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:39,080
All these people are commenting, complaining as if it's a big surprise that there was a

1815
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,080
bonus episode.

1816
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:45,360
But in the previous free episode, we talked about the bonus episode the whole time.

1817
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,560
So they're complaining about content that they don't have access to, even though they're

1818
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,080
not utilizing the stuff that's free and right there for them.

1819
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:57,880
I'm curious how many people, like how many money do you have from that so far?

1820
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,280
So far today, this is the date it came out, we're rounding up, I think about a hundred

1821
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:03,280
right now.

1822
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,280
So about 50 bucks each.

1823
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,280
It's pretty good.

1824
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:10,160
So a hundred people out of how many, like a 10, how many people usually watch the podcast

1825
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:11,680
is like two, three thousand?

1826
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,680
I don't know.

1827
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:16,780
The first one has like 11,000 and then the second one has like eight.

1828
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:20,060
So they're rounding up about like seven or eight.

1829
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:21,060
So yeah, yeah.

1830
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,060
It's not bad.

1831
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,060
It's not bad.

1832
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:26,180
It's like a very small amount of the eight thousand, but still that's a hundred bucks.

1833
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:28,340
I feel like I should do this.

1834
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,340
And I think I can.

1835
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,340
Yeah, we should all.

1836
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:36,460
I looked into it while we were setting up and I think I can charge for something.

1837
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,460
I don't know.

1838
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:39,020
That's a lot dollar once.

1839
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:43,660
Maybe I should put up a video that says don't buy this and if people buy it, I will laugh.

1840
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:45,860
I can see that on the Gibbon Take channel.

1841
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:47,260
Of course.

1842
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:48,260
That would be good.

1843
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,260
Okay.

1844
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:50,260
Here we go.

1845
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:56,180
By at stewing in Susumu says, what is really the worst pizza topping because they're sick

1846
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,180
of this.

1847
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,180
Well, okay.

1848
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,820
They say, do you believe in pineapple being seen as the worst is a meme that needs to

1849
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,820
die?

1850
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:04,780
I think pineapple is fine.

1851
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,780
Pineapple is fine.

1852
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,780
It is a shitty meme.

1853
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:07,780
I don't know where this meme started.

1854
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:11,220
It probably comes from that one, you know, picture that girl from like her yearbook.

1855
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:14,780
That's like, if you like pineapple under pizza, then your bloodline is weak and you will

1856
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,740
not survive the winter.

1857
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:17,740
That's good.

1858
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:18,940
That's a good meme.

1859
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:24,580
But at this point, it's drifted into real life where people actively don't like pineapple

1860
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:28,020
because the meme's gotten too real, but pineapple didn't do nothing.

1861
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:29,020
Pineapple's good.

1862
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,020
Yeah.

1863
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:31,700
What are we talking about?

1864
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,300
The worst pizza topping is probably Doritos.

1865
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:40,980
There's like a taco pizza and it's like 100% Dorito fucking chips in its dispensers.

1866
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,340
It might not taste the best.

1867
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:43,500
Stealing your dad.

1868
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:47,060
It might not taste the best, but it does elevate your Christ consciousness substantially.

1869
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:50,100
Who here likes olives under pizza?

1870
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,100
I like it.

1871
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,100
I do.

1872
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,100
I do in general.

1873
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,100
Why?

1874
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,100
Why not?

1875
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,100
Because I like olives.

1876
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,020
Olives are, you know, like little salty things.

1877
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,420
You know what I like about olives?

1878
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:02,900
I like that they're kind of a vegetable and I can eat them and feel slightly better about

1879
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:03,900
the pizza I'm eating.

1880
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,900
That's on my mind.

1881
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:05,900
I think about that.

1882
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:11,660
The only pizza I can get is meat lovers because it's the best I want pizza.

1883
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:16,460
The only thing I like about pizza is when the bread is nice and tasty and fluffy and

1884
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,580
squidgy and not too thin.

1885
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:20,820
If it's thin crust, get fucked.

1886
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:22,660
I love thin crust.

1887
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,380
Thin crust is fucking sick.

1888
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:25,780
Thin crust, get fucked.

1889
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:26,780
Thin crust, get fucked.

1890
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,780
That's what I say.

1891
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:28,780
No.

1892
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:29,780
We're going to have a problem, Jim.

1893
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,780
B-B-W, like crust.

1894
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:31,780
B-B-C, crust.

1895
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:34,780
I like bread more than I like pizza.

1896
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:36,780
And pizza is like mostly bread.

1897
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,780
Thin crust for life.

1898
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:41,620
In fact, in fact, I would eat a pizza which is just bread.

1899
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:42,620
Bread and nothing else.

1900
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:43,620
What about cheese?

1901
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,620
That's just called bread.

1902
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,620
No cheese.

1903
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,620
Just the...

1904
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,620
Okay.

1905
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:48,620
No, I get it.

1906
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:49,620
Okay.

1907
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:52,580
I like it when pizza has like nice like stretchy cheese.

1908
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,380
That's the best kind of cheese.

1909
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:56,580
Except for when it stretches down your fucking throat.

1910
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:57,580
Yeah.

1911
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:58,580
That is gross.

1912
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:59,580
That is nightmare.

1913
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,380
There's like a semi-local place near my house.

1914
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,660
It's like California, a thing.

1915
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,020
It's called Fleet Bay's.

1916
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:10,220
And the cheese, they put like seriously like three normal amount of pizzas on the cheese

1917
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,700
and they put clogged your heart.

1918
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:12,700
It's fucking insane.

1919
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,700
It's great.

1920
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:15,500
I would outlaw cheese if I could.

1921
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,500
Whoa.

1922
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,500
Cheese, it's gotta go.

1923
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,500
It's gotta go.

1924
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,500
I hate cheese also.

1925
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,740
Have you ever considered what it would be like to have a hole in your chest?

1926
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:24,940
Because I'm about to inflict that upon you right now.

1927
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:26,860
I don't like cheese in anything.

1928
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:27,860
I don't actually...

1929
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:28,860
I do like cheese, but...

1930
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,860
Do you like nacho cheese?

1931
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:30,860
No.

1932
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,860
Oh, shit.

1933
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:32,860
That's the best kind.

1934
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:33,860
I don't like...

1935
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:34,860
It's just...

1936
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:35,860
It's just...

1937
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,860
I don't know.

1938
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:37,860
Do you like nacho cheese Doritos?

1939
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,860
Hell yeah.

1940
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:39,860
Not on a pizza though.

1941
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,860
I mean, that's like cheese powder, you know, that kind of shit?

1942
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:43,860
No.

1943
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,860
I don't know.

1944
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:47,620
There's something about the taste of cheese that I don't like.

1945
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:48,620
That's crazy, dude.

1946
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,620
You guys are making me hungry now.

1947
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:50,620
That's my God.

1948
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:51,620
Yeah.

1949
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:53,940
Do you like Crab Rangoon's with cream cheese in them?

1950
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:55,180
They're called Crayon Goons, but yeah.

1951
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:56,180
Oh my God, guys.

1952
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,180
Crayon Goons.

1953
01:45:57,180 --> 01:45:58,180
Crayon Goons.

1954
01:45:58,180 --> 01:45:59,180
Clam Chowder.

1955
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:03,980
Dude, haven't I told you the story of Crayon Goons about how there was a typo on my fucking...

1956
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:04,980
Thin crust, get fucked.

1957
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:05,980
Thin crust, get fucked.

1958
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:06,980
Go, Crayon Goons.

1959
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:07,980
You're dead, you're dead.

1960
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,500
What's the next question?

1961
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,500
Next question.

1962
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,500
This is my new first name.

1963
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,500
This is our next and last question.

1964
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,500
Given takes, you made a mistake.

1965
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,500
We're in the same continent.

1966
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,500
Oh shit.

1967
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,500
Same country.

1968
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,500
Oh my God, she's rapping.

1969
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:20,500
Oh, that's...

1970
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,500
Yeah, she's coming for you, dude.

1971
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,500
She's coming for you.

1972
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,500
She's got a...

1973
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,500
Is the pizza blue...

1974
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,500
Are you flying away soon?

1975
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,500
Dude, she's got an NGOC and she knows how to use it.

1976
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,500
Exactly.

1977
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,500
Why the fuck out?

1978
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,500
Okay, last question.

1979
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,500
How much...

1980
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,740
Oh, by Michael3041.

1981
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:38,500
How much is too young for sex with the young?

1982
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,020
I don't think this guy understands the question here.

1983
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:44,340
I don't think he's really aware of what we're talking about when we're talking about sex

1984
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,340
with the young.

1985
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:48,300
My favorite, my favorite, is when you're...

1986
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:51,460
They're so young that it's like nine months before they were born.

1987
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:52,780
Yes, that's right.

1988
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,780
That's right.

1989
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:54,780
I was gonna...

1990
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,540
I mean, there's a couple adages I like to use in times like this.

1991
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,540
Let me see.

1992
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:00,020
Grass on the field, play ball.

1993
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,020
That's one.

1994
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,740
And the other is old enough to crawl.

1995
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:03,740
Or enough...

1996
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:04,740
Oh, they're already in the right position.

1997
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:05,740
Yeah, that's the one.

1998
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,740
That's the one.

1999
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:07,740
Yeah.

2000
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:12,540
I think if they can count the right amount, that's my policy.

2001
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:14,740
If their age is on the clock, they get the conch.

2002
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,740
Yes, that's right.

2003
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,740
But what does that...

2004
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:19,740
Like one second old, I guess, would technically be on the clock?

2005
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:21,740
No, it means age one through twelve.

2006
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:23,740
Okay, okay.

2007
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:26,420
Yeah, you can't go younger than one.

2008
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:27,420
What are you talking about?

2009
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,420
You can't use it.

2010
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:29,420
Sicko.

2011
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:30,420
You can go younger than one.

2012
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:31,420
You can go younger than one.

2013
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:32,420
Oh, you're disgusting.

2014
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:33,420
Yeah, you're disgusting.

2015
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:34,420
I'm five fucking infants.

2016
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:35,420
I'm five fucking infants.

2017
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,420
I'm five fucking infants.

2018
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:45,500
But come on, if they're like one second before they hit one age-year-old, then come on.

2019
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,900
Let me ask this though.

2020
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:50,260
Does it count as sex with a young if you have sex with a very pregnant woman?

2021
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:51,260
Does that count?

2022
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:52,260
I want to say yes.

2023
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:53,760
That's the first thing I said.

2024
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,540
According to Maddox, yes, it does count.

2025
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:56,540
I agree.

2026
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:57,540
I agree.

2027
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,540
Should you be arrested?

2028
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:01,300
It's like your only way to have sex.

2029
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,780
With the young, with that young.

2030
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:04,780
That's legal.

2031
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:05,780
That's legal child sex.

2032
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:12,940
The youngest person to ever have sex was me when I abolished slavery.

2033
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:15,020
Sex slavery, a.k.a. the ability to have sex.

2034
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:17,020
Yeah, that was well done.

2035
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:19,540
Okay, that's the end of these decent questions.

2036
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:20,540
They were all garbage.

2037
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,540
Do better next time, as always, everybody.

2038
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:25,020
All right, thanks for asking enough of a message.

2039
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:29,100

2040
