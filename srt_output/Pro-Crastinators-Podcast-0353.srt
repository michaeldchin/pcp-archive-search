1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch...

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
...on account of three say sink. One, two, three, sink!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Really? Wait. One, two, three sink!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why are you so far behind?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm thinking man. All right. Internet slow, I guess. I guess. Uh, all right. Um, welcome

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:48,960
everybody to the procrastinators podcast. It's me and Gib and cheesy manfredo. And all

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
right, bye. That's the end of the episode. I guess nobody has anything to say. Bye. I

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,960
thought cheesy was going to say something. I thought cheesy was going to say hello. Hey,

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,040
cheesy. I said hello. Give them before the episode. Give them before the episode started.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,840
See, cheesy doesn't even know. Cheesy, what the fuck? Gib, what do I do?

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, we can hear you. Can you guys hear me? Cheesy. No, I mean, yes. Cheesy can't hear us,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,360
I guess. God, I'm going to punch my fucking window. Jesus. I can hear you. No, you fucking

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,360
can't hear you. Stop lying. I can hear you guys. No, you can't. What's, then why didn't you answer?

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,400
What's a damn job? Oh, God, I answered. We didn't hear the answer, I guess. I answered the call.

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,720
You answered. No. Yeah. You asked to be on the show when you said show. I gave an answer.

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,680
Yeah, I did. I think you're just like 20 seconds behind us. And now I'm here. Your audio may be

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,720
getting cut off and also you're applying like very late to what we're saying. Yeah, we can't,

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,200
we can't do it. We can't do it like this. We can't do it like this. I think it's it. Okay, you know

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,080
what? Give me one quick second. You got to go to the internet router and turn it on.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
God, I hope it's, I hope that's the solution.

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
Perfect, perfect time to log my breakfast calories since I forgot to.

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:34,960
One tub of marinara cheese. Close. Two chub tubs of marinara cheese.

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,040
It was oats, actually, but close, close. Oats. From the Scottish Highlands.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,920
What? The Scottish Highlands, you know, where the oats come from. You said Scottish,

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,560
but I heard it as Squish from the Squish Highlands. The Squish Highlands.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,000
Where they toss the kebab. Where they toss the, where they toss it a pizza. Where they,

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,880
where they toss it, they hand toss it a mozzarella and the dough and the cheese and the tomatoes.

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Hey, I'm walking here in Italy. New York style. New York style,

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,200
Italian, authentic rustic Italian style marinara pizza.

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,040
They don't say, hey, I'm walking here in Italy. They say, hey, I'm walking here and then. No,

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,160
they don't care about going quick. They're just, they're just sort of, they're walking here and

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,200
they're like, hey, nice to see you. Hey, mozzarella or whatever they say. Hey, mozzarella. I hardly

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:55,760
know her. I'm walking here. Good old racism. Good old, like, cultural, cultural racism.

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,640
When I don't have anything funny to say, I just pick a minority and I just, then I just start

35
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,280
beating on them. I just start mailing on them. Fuck them.

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,680
Fuck. You guys can start. Just give me a second. Okay. Cheesy will try again.

37
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
I guess let's just start talking. Cheesy, she's got to get his shit together, man.

38
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,040
All right. Here's what, I don't know. I don't know if he always has these connections issues,

39
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,480
but Cheesy's mic is dog shit. He needs a decent mic if he's going to keep podcasting.

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
He's got to upgrade. What does he even have? I don't know, but it does not sound good. It's

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,680
not podcast quality. Like even like a blue snowball, like a baby USB mic. It sounds better, I think.

42
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Yeah. Yeah. There's probably like, that was like the good mic for beginners a long time ago.

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,680
There's probably like really good for the same price. I know it's out there for beginners.

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Not not even that long ago, I saw a thread on Twitter of someone being like,

45
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,520
it was really annoying. Someone was like, guys, if you're if you're trying to get into a voice

46
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,960
acting or any kind or any kind of content creation, don't cheap out with the blue yeti.

47
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,680
You know, you need, you should invest in your future. You should, you should invest, you should

48
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,880
actually invest the money that you need to be doing to like to be sounding good. And I mean,

49
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,400
first thing, no, no, unless unless you're doing like professional quality voice acting and the bar

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,920
is really high or you're doing ASMR videos or something, nobody gives a shit. If you're just

51
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,840
making shit for YouTube, nobody gives a shit. You can, you can use a snowball. I did use a

52
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,480
snowball on the PCP for like two years and nobody's even going to 95 people are not even going to

53
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,240
notice the percent of people are going to notice the difference. And then of course, of course,

54
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,480
it turned out that this freak, this was like a tube or something, but this freak had like

55
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,640
Amazon links and was like an affiliate with a bunch of like microphone companies and stuff.

56
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,720
So of course, she's spreading this fucking hogwash that like you if you're if you're using a blue

57
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:31,520
yeti, you've already failed, right? False false. Yeah, voice acting, potentially, you're a good

58
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,000
idea to invest in your future because if you do get a job, if it's specifically in voice acting

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
or ASMR, then maybe you might benefit from like a really high stream. No, like you can

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,320
start out with like is going to give a budget stuff. That's no problem.

61
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,320
Like I guess we're recording. Yeah, I guess I guess we've started now.

62
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,600
Ellie is our cut out as much of the anger as would make for the as would keep the pace of this

63
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:08,560
podcast brisk, but also funny. So I released a video. What? Oh, yes. Oh, I was just going to say

64
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,360
I released my YouTube video advertising my Twitch stream, as I've been saying, I wanted to do

65
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,640
for a while. Why didn't I see that? When did you do that just today? Just like an hour ago.

66
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,920
Well, two hours, an hour and a half ago. Now, yeah. The the conversion rate, okay, it's not,

67
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,720
you know, it's only got a couple hundred views, but the conversion rate of like Twitch follows

68
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,400
to views on it is like really high. I've gained, hang on, it's got it's got about 300 views now.

69
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,760
I think it's it's like an hour and a half old 300 318 views and I've gained 23 followers.

70
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,400
I mean, that's I wonder. I wonder if that ratio will be maintained.

71
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,200
I mean, it makes sense. You got a lot of subscribers and viewers from

72
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,640
the metal man, the metal man, the metal metal man video, you know, I should make a separate

73
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
the lore of metal man.

74
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:18,640
Nine hours long. But like those people, they don't necessarily do more than subscribe. They might

75
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,880
not go to check your Twitter, they might not know anything else about you. So the best way to get

76
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,080
them to know about stuff is to make a YouTube video. That I mean, yeah, definitely, definitely.

77
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,240
That was the it's my biggest platform by far. And that was that was the the logic.

78
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,920
I don't know. It's just this just a pretty high pretty high click through rate.

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I hope I get a big hope it makes my streams really huge hope everyone fucking watched me hope I do

80
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:56,240
big number on Twitch platform because a Twitch a Twitch follower, I think per capita a Twitch

81
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,440
follower is worth a lot more than a YouTube subscriber. Oh, yeah. Like just the fact that if

82
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,240
if it translates to a viewer on stream. Yeah. If you've got if you got like, yeah, yeah. It's

83
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:21,760
just a generally speaking, a stream has a lot less viewers total. Yeah. On average. If you've got

84
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:31,840
like 10k 20k followers on Twitch, like you're good, like that's your career. If you've got 20k

85
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,560
followers on YouTube, it's probably it's probably it's probably it's probably just a hobby. Yeah,

86
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,840
it's probably just a hobby and you're you're you're a and then that's where I'm at. And that's me.

87
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
So trying and trying to convert that one number into the other number

88
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,520
for the big for the big money. I'm trying to get that big money. Although my audience isn't big,

89
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:05,600
but I'm finally getting around to making avenues for people to purchase my comics. Yes, they do

90
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,280
like them. So I'm on Amazon. I don't know if you saw my tweet. I took a few pictures of

91
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,440
the Clarissa Gunsmoke proof. But you got it. You got it already. That's fast. Yeah, it's quite

92
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:27,120
quick. Wow. No, I didn't see that. Let me look at that. Yeah. It's, it's nice. Colors are good.

93
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,160
Print quality is, you know, good. And like, no, no problems with any of the printing.

94
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:43,680
It is a book. And it's real. And the only problem. The only problem is that I messed up something

95
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,040
with the bleed area, the trim. They trimmed off a bit too much off the top. All I need to do is

96
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,560
adjust the size and then re put the manuscript back in and then look at it and then publish that.

97
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,360
And then it'll be on the store and I'll have an Amazon store and you can be paying money for me.

98
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,760
I love paying money for you. Yeah. You'll have Clarissa Gunsmoke volume one,

99
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,440
the first four chapters. So that's the new chapter included. I might do like individual issues as

100
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,920
well. If you just want the fourth chapter. But like, I'm going to be doing it like the volumes

101
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,280
are cheaper than buying each chapter individually. If I do that. Whoa, screen tones. There are screen

102
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:35,040
tones. I have screen tones in the new chapter. Holy shit. I'm advancing my skill power, my tool set.

103
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,040
I had a somewhat similar, well, on the proof that I got of the Radcon dojin,

104
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,480
it was pretty good the bleeds, but like the page numbers were like too far off and like the page

105
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,040
numbers got cut off. So like I had to move, I'm going to move those in a little bit before I order

106
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,480
the like the reorder. Yeah. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. I mean, how do you feel about

107
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,800
like the paper quality and all that? The paper quality is like decent. It's not like super

108
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,560
high end stuff. It's print on demand, but it's not like, it doesn't feel like it's going to

109
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,480
fall apart. It's like good quality. It's a quality product. It's a quality product and

110
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,480
you can put it on your shelf and it won't fall apart. This is one of those books that I've heard

111
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,400
so much about. Did you have the option to like put any design on like the spine of it?

112
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,360
Yes. The cover, they say you give the manuscript, which is all the pages on the inside,

113
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,560
then they say give a separate PDF as the cover, which includes the front and the back and the

114
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,200
middle is the spine. I didn't put anything on the spine because the spine is kind of shallow.

115
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,080
Yeah. It's kind of thin for just volume one. Although I could do like a Dragon Ball thing

116
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,400
where I have the sides of the spine showing a little picture and if you line them up,

117
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,120
they'll become a little thing. I should do that. You mean like, okay, the yellow like bar on volume

118
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,920
one, I assume that extends over the spine? Yes, it does. Like if you had four. It extends over

119
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,960
the spine and it goes round to the barcode, which is printed in the bottom right corner.

120
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Like if you had four, if you had four volumes of it, I don't know, I think it would look good

121
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,880
if it's just like the four different colors, but the yellow bar like continues from one

122
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
onto the next, like that would look good too. If you wanted to get real fancy and yeah,

123
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,360
put a little picture that forms if you put them all next to each other.

124
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,280
Or maybe I could put like a tiny number so you could see at a glance like, oh, this is volume one,

125
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,120
this is volume two, one, two, three, four. That'd be nice. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's,

126
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,040
and there's probably going to be four volumes. First volume is four chapters,

127
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,960
then it's going to be chapter five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Oh no, just three volumes. Yeah,

128
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,880
three volumes for this Closer Gunsmoke and the Bandit King adventure.

129
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh, you have drawn five?

130
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,640
No, I've been, I've mostly been working on the Amazon stuff and my website for the past week

131
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:17,520
or two. Wait, I thought five was done. No, four was done. Oh, okay, okay. Oh, right, right, right,

132
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,480
right, right. Okay, four is the new one. So you can buy, by the time this episode out,

133
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,200
you can buy it. So there will be a link, an Amazon link, to buy the physical version

134
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:36,880
in the description. Also, I'm going to put it on, I guess I'll put it on Kindle for people who

135
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:44,560
use Kindle just to access that marketplace. But also, I want to make a digital version for,

136
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
or like on Gumroad or something so I can get more of the profit from that,

137
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:00,480
because Amazon takes, my cut for the Amazon is 60%. You get 60%? I get 60% of the sale.

138
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,040
That's more than I expected. Wait, how much is it? I'm going to be selling them for like

139
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,600
15 bucks, I think, volumes. That book for 15 bucks and you get 60% of that?

140
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,920
Yeah, I think so. Wow, that's, I mean, I don't know exactly how. That's cheaper than I expected

141
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,520
and that's a bigger cut than I expected. Yeah, I think that's quite reasonable. Yeah, that's not

142
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:32,720
bad. I thought you were going to say that due to printing and shipping fees, it was going to

143
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,840
cost like 20 plus, maybe like 20 and then you would get like maybe five bucks off a sale or

144
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:48,960
something. No, I mean, it's because Amazon has such a large cut of the market. They can afford to

145
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,400
make it very, very lucrative for all the independent. And I for one, celebrate them

146
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,280
for doing that because they pass that savings on to the consumer. It's so true. So true.

147
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:11,600
But yeah, it will be like a 60% cut for me for buying a physical version, which is much better

148
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,920
and much less labor intensive for me than if I was doing it by myself,

149
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,560
sending out books. So I'm happy with that. I think it might be the same on Kindle,

150
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:28,000
might not be, but I think if I put the PDF that I put on Kindle, also on Gumroad for

151
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,720
the same price, then I'll get a bigger cut. So if you just want the PDF, the digital version and

152
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,680
you don't use Kindle, like Kindle has no meaning for you, you can just get it on Gumroad and I'm

153
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,440
going to make a Gumroad and that's going to be where it's going to be.

154
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,840
Well, speaking of... I'm going to do that. I'm going to do it for Lord of Ghosts as well.

155
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm going to do it for Redman. Redman comics are coming. Do it for him. Do it for him. Yes.

156
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,800
Maggie, Maggie Poster. Speaking of things that should be out by the time this episode goes up,

157
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,360
we got our Patreon, not Patreon money, we got our freaking Radcon money. Did you get yours?

158
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,960
Yes, I got mine. It's done. It's done. The Curse of Radcon. The Curse of Radcon is lifted.

159
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,840
The Curse of Radcon 4 is lifted, Gib. We finally did it. We finally did it. Nate actually sent.

160
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Finish the OVA. We've got to release that. We dealt with a certain nefarious individuals,

161
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:42,480
like a non-bullshit and then all the problems were solved and then we got the money now.

162
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm going to cry just thinking about it. It's not about the money. It's about a job well done.

163
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,560
I would say that Radcon 4 was a huge success.

164
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,880
Yes. Everyone's asking, when's Radcon 5? Everyone's asking.

165
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,200
Oh, no. We'll do a VR Radcon 5 in virtual reality. Everyone come along.

166
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,440
That would actually be pretty funny. Do like an Oculus Rift lecture with all the people jumping

167
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,640
around. Honestly, well, I mean, that could be good. That could be good. The only thing that

168
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,840
would be bad about that is that you'd be standing there for who knows how long with a

169
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,120
fucking VR headset on your head. Yes. Six-hour-long lecture about the history of

170
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,120
boats. The history of boats.

171
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,520
We scoff, but that's probably very interesting. Oh, for sure. It goes back to the beginning of

172
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,160
humanity. Yeah. I mean, you would have to, every freaking

173
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,800
culture would have their own freaking, I mean, you couldn't make a comp... You simply could

174
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,960
not make such a comprehensive history of such a thing. We came out the water. We were like,

175
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,720
what if we became mammals? But then we were sad because we couldn't be under the water

176
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:23,120
anymore. We invented boats to visit our old friend. The sea. Well, you see, the sea wants

177
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,920
to drag us down, but the devil fruits want us to rise up and achieve our potential. We made

178
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,000
boats so that we could go and hang out with our old buddy, but he's kind of a jerk and he wants

179
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,280
to drown us now. We made a boat so we didn't have to actually get in there. Wait, is the devil fruits

180
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:48,720
metaphor for evolution? Yes. We evolved to be on land and the sea was like, you're not even gonna

181
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,720
thank me. You're not even gonna say thank you. You're just gonna leave. Yep. That's why I hate

182
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:05,040
the devil fruits. Yep. But we should, hey, we should watch that freaking OVA this week. Oh,

183
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,800
no. I know it's gonna suck. I know it's gonna suck. I know it's gonna suck, but we should do

184
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,680
it this week and maybe we can release the, well, I'll release the bonus commentary of it.

185
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,880
Sure, sure. On Friday. Okay, okay, we'll do it. We'll do it like soon. So yeah, by the time this

186
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:29,040
episode goes out, this should be, the Radcon OVA should be live and we can, there'll be a bonus

187
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:39,760
commentary track of us watching it and cringing. Cringing hard. Yeah, yeah. But that's a scar,

188
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,520
that's a battle scar that I'll be proud to wear. The scar gained from cringing so hard.

189
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,720
Oh, because it means Radcon was done and we did it and we did everything we had to do. We did

190
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,760
everything, we did do everything we had to do. Another Twitch follower. Did I say, did I say

191
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,480
on the podcast already the thing about the video that I just, the Twitch thing? Did you talk about

192
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,200
that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Couldn't remember if that was before or after the, because cheesy's nonsense

193
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:19,280
derailed the start of the video. I hate that guy. That guy, but also that guy, he, I'm gonna play,

194
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm going to play the voice of Grimace in the voiced comic version, the video comic

195
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,560
version of McPagliacci. Did you know that? Yeah, I think I saw a post on Discord about

196
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:40,800
McPagliacci if you want to be a voice. Yeah. I submitted voice auditions for every male character

197
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:48,080
and cheesy, I guess he liked my Grimace voice the best. So I'll be, I'm gonna be Grimace. It's fun.

198
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,160
Can you give us a sneak peek of that voice? What's, what's the thing he says?

199
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,160
Well, Grimace. Oh, you're singing, you're singing is good. I really like your voice,

200
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,360
Bertie. You should sing more. It's like a dark, goofy, kooky monster combo.

201
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,760
Like it evil fucked up. Oh God. How long have you been there?

202
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,120
For like five seconds. I mean, you're for five seconds.

203
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,080
Okay. Okay, boss. Sorry. I was leaking the content. No, it's fine. Actually, I'm,

204
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm gonna actually like try to pump out the motion conic before Friday. Oh God. I can do that. Yeah.

205
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,840
Well, that's a, that's pretty, that's a pretty fast turnaround, but okay, I think I can, I think

206
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,400
I can do that for you. Appreciate it. Doesn't take, doesn't take that long.

207
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:52,640
Did you say you were going to send me notes? I did. Oh, you already liked it yesterday. Okay. Okay.

208
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,040
Okay. Yeah. Just read the things I actually send you, Ben. No. For once. No. Well then. No.

209
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,520
I'm gonna have to replace you. Fired, fired, fired. No.

210
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,920
Uh, you know what? Hey, stupid. My Hamburglar voice was better than Grimace.

211
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,920
My Hamburglar voice was better. You should have given me Hamburglar. I found another Hamburglar.

212
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Well, well, see, that's my problem. That's my problem with you is that you did that.

213
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,520
It's fine. My Hamburglar, I'm just saying my Hamburglar voice was, was, was a masterpiece.

214
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,680
Look, you know what? We could, we could like special edition this,

215
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,480
where there's another version of the motion. This is all me. All me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,280
Yeah. No. Well, I'll give them, I'll give them my best shot. I'll give them my best shot. Even the

217
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,800
audience, even the audience members will just be like you, different voice, different use.

218
00:23:50,800 --> 00:24:00,160
Yeah. I love the circus. Over and over again. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We'll workshop it. Interesting.

219
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,560
Working on it. Complete. Looking into it. Ben edition. Ben edition. Yeah, the Ben edition.

220
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,280
That'd be very cute. In case anyone who was reading the book thought like, man,

221
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,840
this would be 10 times better if everyone voiced by Ben Singh. Man, you know, they'd be

222
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,600
re, you know what would make, you know what would make this voice comic better is if it sucked.

223
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:33,360
That would make me McPoggliacci. Oh my God. McPoggliacci. Like Mc, like McPAWGliacci.

224
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,240
Do you know about Pogs Give? Do you know what a Pog is? Oh, I know all about that.

225
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,680
All right. You know, I, of course you do. Of course you do.

226
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,680
Um, where were we? Help. Um, we were talking about grimace.

227
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,600
Talking about, we were grimacing right then. We were, we were going to,

228
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,640
we're going to cringe and we're going to grimace when we watched the OVA.

229
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,480
Do you want to watch the uncensored version or the censored version?

230
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm thinking censored version because I think that's the version people know.

231
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,640
Because I think the funny, some of the comedy will be, I haven't seen,

232
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,400
I have not watched as a single frame of it. I don't know anything that's in there,

233
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,080
but I think some of the comedy of it will come from like the places where Nate puts

234
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,080
like beams of light and steam clouds and stuff covering up the dirty parts.

235
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,560
Did I mention that? Did you guys actually show dirty parts in it?

236
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:42,000
Well, they, well, you know, they're, well, yeah, because we were all females at the time.

237
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,400
So all of our nipples became female presenting. So our nipples are not safe for work in that video

238
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,280
at the time. They're fine now. And to this day.

239
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,800
Well, my nipples became recently female. My nipples recently became female

240
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,320
resenting, if you will.

241
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
Okay, that's not what I thought you were going with that.

242
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
Like a repelling force.

243
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,680
Yeah, yeah, like a female looks at it and they're like, never, never mind. No, thank you.

244
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,480
Nice.

245
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,520
I have a, I have a complaint. Wait, okay. I got one more thing.

246
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,120
Uh, the plebeian wee blue rays. I'm going to run out. They're going to be gone soon.

247
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,440
And I'm, and here's the thing. It's not, it's not worth making more of them.

248
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,360
It's not, it's not worth it. So I'm not going to, I'm not going to make more of them.

249
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,080
You know, a lot of people have gotten angry at me about that lately. I've gained some haters over

250
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,400
it. You want to know how many I've sold in this, in this recent bout with me writing the manifesto

251
00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:00,240
and all that three, four, four. Oh, it's up to four now. So all of, all of this, uh, all this,

252
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,480
this nonsense, all this, all these shenanigans have been for the sake of selling four copies

253
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,760
of these. And I have, oh, I have four more. I have four left on my shelf. So, um, yeah,

254
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,880
pretty sure when those are gone, uh, that's going to be it. Cause it's, you know, it's not,

255
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,120
it's just not worth it. It's just not worth the trouble.

256
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,600
You know what this means? What's that?

257
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,360
Write a second manifesto and you'll sell four more.

258
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,760
No, no. I think one, I think one sold because I wrote the manifesto. Did I mention the manifesto?

259
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
I just, if I,

260
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
I don't think you mentioned it. I saw it though.

261
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
On the podcast. Yeah, I didn't mention it on the podcast. I think I sent it on the stream.

262
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,680
Yeah, I wrote, I wrote, I wrote a thing on my website called the Blu-ray manifesto,

263
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,640
stcomics.com slash brm.html. And it's just, and it's just

264
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,240
an explanation of my reasoning behind why I think writing the Blu-rays was good

265
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,800
and the right thing to do. And you don't have to agree with it, but I wrote it

266
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,160
because I didn't want to explain it to anyone else. It's like, that's, that's my reason. And if

267
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,320
you don't agree, then I guess we don't agree. But the statement is there. And I think, I just

268
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,640
thought, I think it's really funny. I asked, you know who, I got to say, I got to tell Cody

269
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,080
LaRue, the butt chugger himself. I got to ask, he was mad at me and I asked him, did you read my

270
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,160
manifesto? And he said, I will after work. And I said, nothing.

271
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,360
I should have named the manifesto the Blu-ray question.

272
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,920
The Blu-ray question. That would have been good. I just, I just, I like calling it a manifesto.

273
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,680
Anyway, I'm, yeah, they're gonna, they're, they're going. Listen guys, I just, if you want one,

274
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,680
get one now. I have four left and I'm not gonna restock because I can't justify the cost of it.

275
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,800
So, you know, buy the, buy them while they're still there. Twitchsaintcomics.com

276
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:11,280
slash store.html. Or, or else, or you'll live or live in regret. Okay.

277
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,440
And if you, if you're not interested in buying that, actually don't buy the Blu-ray. Save your

278
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,520
money for me, for me, actually. And pre-order, make Pagalacchi right now. We have two days left.

279
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,800
I bought it. I bought a copy.

280
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,440
Yeah, yeah. Ben here bought a copy. I even follow, follow your leader,

281
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:38,400
PCP listeners and buy a copy of McPagalacchi. I mean, if there's one, if there's one McPagalacchi

282
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,760
fan, it's me. And if there's no McPagalacchi fans, I'm dead. I'm, I'm, I'm McPagalacchi

283
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,600
for life. I'm right or die. Yeah. Yeah. Ben auditioned for the Birdie Boys.

284
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
No, he did not. I told them. That's like the only, that's like the only voice in the comic that I

285
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:03,120
did not audition for. You don't need to lie. Maybe, maybe take a couple more years of, of HRT

286
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,520
Ben and maybe we'll get back to the Birdie, the Birdie voice. Maybe we'll have a discussion

287
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,160
about it. You know, I watched, I watched a bunch of McDonaldland commercials to, to like get a sense

288
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,400
of what the voices were like. And I didn't hear, none of them had Birdie in them. I didn't hear

289
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,360
Birdie even a single time. I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't classic silencing women. I mean, I wasn't

290
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,240
looking for, I think she was introduced yet you weren't looking for, I was looking, I was looking

291
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,680
for Grimace and Hamburglar and, and Ronald. What, there you go. Did you type in? But I, but I mean,

292
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,280
I saw other, like I saw Mayor McCheese, I heard Mayor McCheese speak many more times than I

293
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,840
heard Birdie, which was zero. Probably, you probably saw a couple commercials from like

294
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,200
the 70s to like early 80s. Did they introduce Birdie later? Yeah, she was kind of later.

295
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,160
She's kind of like the, the last like mainstay character. Okay. Yeah, that, that is probably

296
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,120
why then I was looking at the really old ones. Is she the Smurfette? They were like, we need a woman.

297
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:09,360
We need representation. They needed a mascot to represent the breakfast menu. Oh, oh, oh, she's

298
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:19,440
the early Birdie. Oh, I, that's her full name. I never knew that. First name, early. Last name,

299
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:28,640
Birdie. That crazy. That changes everything. Yeah, yeah. So wait, what, what are the rest of them?

300
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,520
What's Grimace? Grimace is milkshakes, right? Wasn't he like a milkshake stealing monster?

301
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,520
Yeah, Grimace was the original, originally a milkshake monster.

302
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,800
Makes sense because of how thick he is. Yeah. Didn't they talk about this in like the newest

303
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,440
red letter media? One of them brings up Grimace and so and one and one of them is like, yeah,

304
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,720
there's a whole backstory behind Grimace, but I don't remember it. And they're all like, yeah,

305
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,480
none of us remember it, but there definitely is one. Oh, anyway, let's talk about how Mike hates

306
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,680
old people. The Grimace backstory has been like retcon like two times. I didn't, because they were

307
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,760
talking about it, I looked it up and I guess he was originally like a villain. He was like,

308
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,240
he's like a reformed villain. He's like discord. He's like Vegeta. He's exactly like Vegeta.

309
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,240
Grimace is the Vegeta of the Ronald McDonald universe. He popped up and showed to be,

310
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,120
showed to be too powerful for Ronald to handle, but over over a course of time.

311
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,200
Like he became friendly. Like he originally had four arms. He had four arms for stealing milkshakes

312
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,880
and they just got rid of, they just forgot it. Oh, he's a milkshake stealer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,840
Yeah. So the hamburger is like a hamburger. Yep. The burger. And the fry guys steal fries.

314
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,240
Yeah. Why is everyone trying to steal all this food? It's an entire universe of tricks rabbits.

315
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,640
Okay. So basically in McDonald land, food is very like just plentiful. Actually,

316
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,920
food is just straight up alive in McDonald land, right? Literally grows on trees.

317
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,160
I guess it's implied that like Grimace, Hamburger, all the characters are not

318
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,720
necessarily like natives to McDonald land, not even like Ronald potentially.

319
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,600
So this is an invasive force. Colonizers. They're colonizing the nugget plan. I actually have my

320
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,160
own like head cannon of how all this like works. Let's get into it. Okay. So basically, how does

321
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:41,120
this relate to the clown force? So, oh man, we'll be here all day. Is this a potential lecture?

322
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,840
Oh, you're right. You know, honestly, McDonald land lore, but there probably is an hour's worth

323
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,200
of lore there. Probably. It'll be kind of tough because I really have to like,

324
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,400
I've seen the majority of the commercials. I swear I've seen the majority of them.

325
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,240
But every couple of months, like a new one that I haven't seen pops up. It's almost like they

326
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:11,920
manifest into the ether, right? Even like yesterday, I was like, I was talking to a bud, another of the

327
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,120
voice actors and I asked him, hey, do you think you could do just a quick like Mayor McCheese line?

328
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Because he literally just has one line in McPugly Archie. And he's like, yeah, sure. How does

329
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,000
Mayor McCheese sound? And I'm like, oh, he's literally just like the Mad Hatter impression from

330
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,680
the. Yeah, like, like, I'm not a cheeseburger, don't you know? He says shit like that. And

331
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,440
and so I looked up a clip of myself in a McDonald land commercial Mayor McCheese. And the first

332
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,160
one that I saw was like, wait, I've never seen this commercial. Because it's literally like,

333
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,360
it's a commercial from the 70s. And he's like, weird aliens, aliens that look kind of like

334
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,640
crewmates from a mugga's that may make cheese because they think he's an actual cheeseburger.

335
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,520
Well, they think he's like an edible cheeseburger. Does he just does he just have like a congenital

336
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,840
illness that makes him look like a cheeseburger, but he's not actually a cheeseburger? Well, my

337
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,520
theory is that the thing is that you never necessarily see one of the good cheeseburgers

338
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,760
eat. Yeah, you never see any of the characters like eat any of the food, to be honest. And I think

339
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,840
I think what it is in McDonald land is that the food is just kind of sent to it, like it's just

340
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,440
alive. And in the commercials, sometimes there's like, there's like just a hamburger with eyes

341
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,640
with no body, right? What I like to think is that the older they get, they grow a body like

342
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,320
may or make cheese. And the like the ones with like just with just like that hamburger and two

343
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,840
eyeballs is like the young form and they and it kind of grow on like bushes and trees, apparently,

344
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,640
because you see like, you never see anyone make the stuff, it just kind of grows like it manifests

345
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,080
the Garden of Eden. Yeah, and there was even like, there was this one tree character that was kind

346
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,640
of like one of the main cast, but that never necessarily like brought back. And he's like

347
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,680
mentioned, he's like brought up in one of the cartoons, but never like, again, I notice.

348
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:16,240
My theory is that like Ronald, and this is from this is my like on this is like what I think is

349
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,600
the main kind of like line of continuity from, since like the early commercials up until like

350
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,200
the few handfuls that were made in the early 2000s is that Ronald has this kind of like aura

351
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,200
that like man, that like kind of brings out the kids and people, you know, kind of like comforting

352
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,840
aura, right? But but if you say he's like a paladin, he's like a paladin, like a heroic aura of

353
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,520
courage that nullifies fear effects to all his party members. Yeah, he's a holy warrior.

354
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,160
He makes you feel he makes you feel young, you know, in an innocent sort of way. But what I

355
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,560
like to think happens is that if you stand around him for too long, or if you hang out with him for

356
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:06,080
too long, you start like not just feeling like a kid, but you start de-aging. You start becoming

357
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:13,120
younger. That would be terrible. And my main my main theory to kind of the main kind of point

358
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,920
that I like to think is evidence of this is the fact that when the hamburger first showed up,

359
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,040
he was kind of like he had white hair. Yeah, like he kind of had wrinkly skin.

360
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,240
In his first appearance on now, he's like young. He has like red hair. He's like ginger now. Yeah,

361
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,920
he got younger. Surely it could it could just be the the air of the hamburger line lineage.

362
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,760
Surely surely it could be his little offspring. True. True. That being said, I like to think

363
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,800
that that's kind of the reason why maybe that's why the food in like McDonald's land doesn't like

364
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,160
rot away because they're just around Ronald that keeps them like weirdly fresh. You know,

365
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,160
it keeps them like young, in a sense. Right. He's a freshness clown. And if you haven't noticed.

366
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,200
Freshness. He's the power of freshness. He ate the fresh. He ate the fresh. Yeah, that's a yep.

367
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,440
And another another piece to the puzzle is the fact that when Grimace first appeared,

368
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,400
he had forward arms and now he just has two, right? And what I like to think is that Grimace

369
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,760
a species grows an extra set of arms the older they get. And well, Ronald is like turning Grimace

370
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,760
younger. Actually Grimace seems to get dumber, right? But maybe he's not that he's getting

371
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,520
dumber. He's just getting like that child like naivety, you know, his brain is is yeah, de de

372
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:45,520
forming. Right. It was early birdie going to turn into an egg. No, early birdie. Well, there's

373
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,560
there's there's a commercial where it's like when she first shows when like they they give her an

374
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,600
origin story, right? Like she was like an egg they found and she hatched and she was already she

375
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,280
hatched with clothes on and everything. But like her you stay as a kid, you don't like become a baby

376
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,760
or fetish, you just stay as a kid, you know, like you stay the target audience for a character like

377
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,680
Ronald, right? That that being said, I think Ronald probably realizes that he has his effect on people

378
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,000
and it's kind of like a horrifying when it happens. And I think other adult characters in the early

379
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,640
commercials kind of realized this. That's why they disappeared because they realized we can't be around

380
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,040
Ronald because we're going to river back into being a kid. That's why the professor, then there are

381
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,000
no more. That's why Captain Crook is in there no more. Mayor McCheese as well. They were just like

382
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,560
we've got business to take care of. We can't be we can't be messing around with this shit. I see.

383
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,880
Right, exactly. 30 characters kind of stayed around. It's also the fry kids. They were originally

384
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,480
known as the fry goblins, right? They learned that. And the thing is, there used to be like way

385
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,720
more of them. There used to be a lot of them because they seem to be addicted to fries, right?

386
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,480
They wanted to constantly eat them. I think what probably happened is that the fry goblins probably

387
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,920
realized the this weird side effect of hanging out around Ronald caused to them, right? So like

388
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,440
slowly they stopped like trying to be around Ronald, trying to eat fries and only like a concentrated

389
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,560
few stick around. And it didn't make sense calling them by their species name and only made sense

390
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,080
calling them by specifically what they are. They became the fry kids. They became younger.

391
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,960
Oh my god. There is. That's amazing. And a little bit back to Grimace, I'd like to think that

392
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:41,360
Ronald realized that he can't like he kind of had to there's this commercial that kind of red

393
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,240
cons the origin of Grimace. And it implies like Ronald said, because Grimace doesn't remember,

394
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,160
but Ronald says, oh, we used to be like literally kids that hanged out and we're usually we were

395
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,200
actually babies together that grew up, right? And Grimace just kind of buys it. But how is how

396
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,760
is it just Ronald like convincing them that, hey, this is actually implanted false memories.

397
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,840
Yeah, exactly that. Hey, you weren't an adult. And you were never an adult. Actually,

398
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,520
you're still a kid this whole time, blah, blah, blah stuff, you know,

399
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,720
you got Mac gaslit. Yeah, Mac gaslit. You got make light to what if okay, alternate theory.

400
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,040
Okay, here's my here's my alternate theory is that the McDonald Land commercials actually,

401
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,240
they just take place in reverse in reverse chronological order.

402
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,240
You think so? I don't know. I mean, wouldn't that wouldn't that explain all this all the same things?

403
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,480
I mean, what if they're just they're just they're just showing them in reverse?

404
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,360
You'd have to track the existence of things. The thing is that like, they kind of like,

405
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,360
I mean, the commercials usually end with like a current toy of that era, mostly the ones like,

406
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,560
as we get into like that. But you see, it's an it's an alternate time stream,

407
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,440
whose whose time flows in the opposite direction of our own.

408
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,160
Well, you see, like, if we become more into the 70s, like black people start losing rights,

409
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,360
women start losing rights, holy shit, you're right. Actually, in their in their

410
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,080
as their time goes forward, our time goes backwards. So, so, you know, our future is

411
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,000
their past. They're they're they're the two the two timelines point in different directions,

412
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,680
but they're parallel to each other. I'm gonna leave a little more evidence for this one.

413
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:31,440
I just I just think that wouldn't that also explain that like, oh, as the commercials

414
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,600
went on, everyone looks younger and like grimace. What if what if what if Ronald that would explain

415
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Ronald would be telling the truth, they did grow up as kids, but then in the in their future

416
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,960
of the timeline that aired in the 70s, grimace grows up to be an evil milkshake stealing.

417
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,400
Beast, I don't know, because it's like, there's this kind of like when the characters are first

418
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,800
introduced, I mean, I guess it's implied there's some sort of like, I mean, I just I mean, I just

419
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,720
think you're reverse age. I just think you're reverse aging aura theory is so ridiculous. I

420
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,320
just think it makes a lot more sense that like clearly the time stream has just been reversed

421
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:12,000
and is flowing in reverse parallel to our own. I mean, you'd need to show it's just so much more

422
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,280
plausible each other more in the past than they do in the present. I think there's more evidence

423
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,960
for my they get younger. They become younger around Ronald theory. I think there's more evidence

424
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,240
to that. What happened? What happened with because obviously they retired Ronald McDonald

425
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,400
from like this the main look of a lot of McDonald's stores. I don't know if that still exists. I don't

426
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,920
know if they like still have kiddie. They mostly just they mostly just use Ronald for the was it

427
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,760
the McDonald house and just like a charity. There's one in my city and that's where I like

428
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,440
take the pictures with the Ronald statue because it's right in front of their building.

429
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,680
They mostly see Ronald here and there. He's on Instagram. He has like a social media account.

430
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,120
That's really funny. His look kind of changed and mostly just keep them for like I notice he

431
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,960
mostly does like little parade or events. Yeah. Yeah. And charities they don't do like commercials

432
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,520
with him no more. And it's a combination of like they'll bring it back eventually.

433
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,840
I think it I think it ultimately I think it does have to do something with the documentary

434
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,760
supersize me because I like change the shit load of things for McDonald's like that documentary

435
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,880
was bullshit too. Oh yeah but that was like like years later we kind of well I don't even know if

436
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,080
it's like public like everything I feel like it's because I always hear like oh the documentary is

437
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,320
bullshit all the time yada yada. How do we not know this is just because of our little

438
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,120
circles that we carve ourselves and everyone is aware of that but like to ignore me how aware

439
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,000
are they that like that commercial is bullshit because like yeah you know on a surface level

440
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,560
it's like oh yeah you know you too much for McDonald's this is bad for you yeah obviously right but

441
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:06,080
maybe the problem is that like oh how bad it is was kind of like misdirected in that commercial

442
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,400
in that documentary. I mean that documentary made like a huge cultural impact so and so and

443
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,960
everybody knows about supersize me so yeah it's going to be it's going to be fewer people that

444
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,200
hear about oh did you hear was kind of debunked like oh did you hear that guy was kind of like

445
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,520
lying about it like oh did you hear that like there was all this weird shit going on behind the

446
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,400
scenes and like he misattributed lots of things and he was like also an alcoholic at the time and

447
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,280
it's etc etc. Yeah I remember when the first like the first couple of times make the news in the

448
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,800
same way. Yeah I remember the first couple of times I heard it get debunked um people's first

449
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,840
reaction were like oh are you paid out by McDonald's lol yeah right what are you in the pot you're in

450
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:57,920
the pocket of big cheese. Big M. Big M. Big clown. Yeah big clown. Right. Right. I mean I don't

451
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,800
want to I don't want to I don't want to keep for McDonald's or anything but you know yeah it's like

452
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,960
the what he what he did it what it was the purpose the purpose for the documentary was to make

453
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,520
people realized that first food was bad and very bad if you ate it all the time which is true

454
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:22,560
it's just that like so like is it really that much of a negative outcome it's true but it's just

455
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,840
that the it was it was made in a way that is like the food at McDonald's will do this to you but

456
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,200
like he did it in an extremely unscientific way and he did it in a way that was like specifically

457
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,640
designed to guarantee like a bad outcome and it he also like never he also never like said that he

458
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,680
was actually going through alcohol like he was an alcoholic which is like an important thing when

459
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,760
you're talking about like the the effect that like the food you're eating has on your body

460
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,880
it's like that that might have had the could that have had an impact you never who knows he

461
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,600
fucked up his liver his liver got fucked by the introduction I wonder if that does anything

462
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,600
metabolism or like alcohol or it might have just been the alcohol that did it for you because they

463
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,360
interviewed a guy in the documentary said like oh I eat it every day and what's funny is that guy

464
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,880
looks kind of like fucking John Lennon yeah um and I'm thinking like well if it makes you look like

465
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,240
John Lennon it can't be that bad right it's you know feed it every day that you therefore it makes

466
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,920
you grow those glasses wait what was that I think I watched it at at the digi house uh with Trixie

467
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,800
and maybe Victor there no no not supersize me but like the response to it you know what I mean

468
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,280
there was like oh there was yeah there was like it was it called baloney or something there was a

469
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,560
counter there was a counter I watched it I watched the counter documentary and it was like yeah the

470
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,600
guy eats mcdonald's every day but like he loses weight because he also starts like exercising

471
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,720
and stuff that had a it had a really cringy like animated segment in the middle with like

472
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,480
yeah really like uncomfortable like stupid libertarian like moralizing

473
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,200
yeah that part's bad but like the point he's making is good it's like you know it's not

474
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,560
yeah you actually well if you wanted to you actually could eat mcdonald's every day and

475
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,480
still like lose weight and stay healthy you could eat mcdonald's I think I think it's just a bad habit

476
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:21,440
for children yeah no yeah yeah that's that's kind of like one every day that's kind of what

477
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,560
it took like ronald I mean they kind of already knew that even back in the day too because they

478
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,200
you'd never like there probably is like one or two commercials where you see ronald's eating

479
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,080
like mcdonald's food but like the majority of them he's never eating it they kind of just he's

480
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,200
just kind of sitting in front of it and he's never put it in his fucking mouth but yeah you never

481
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,080
see him like eating any of it yeah he never eats it he's he's a total I mean it's probably just

482
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,880
because he hates it it's not it's not you know this is alive yeah but I was it's probably just

483
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,680
because like it's not a very flattering like look for a person and also he would get his clown

484
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,600
makeup all over the food and it would probably just be messy and like he's already got red like

485
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,200
ketchup or there's a way to eat there's a way to eat with clown makeup on I done it before yeah I

486
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:15,920
mean I'm sure they could wait to eat out pussy that's disgusting clowns they don't have that on the

487
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:26,000
menu no they don't they don't have mine at my McDonald's they will we're doing a massive rebrand

488
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,840
pcp is now going to be a fast food chain I'm thinking about um I'm thinking about uh trying to get

489
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,480
a job at McDonald's for like a month and I just put copies of McPuglachy and people's bags

490
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,680
oh that would be so funny they get dude that would be they get home they're like what the fuck is

491
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,400
this that would actually be like really funny how would you how would you stealth it you'd have to

492
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,280
you'd be behind the counter or something okay I have to like it has to be drive through yeah and

493
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,840
like the thing is I'd have to like grease all over the copies that's true but luckily it's like

494
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:07,200
just it because it's just I had the test copy that I got it's just like yellowish printer paper

495
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,320
but uh that that being said I have to like um hide a stacked somewhere near the counter and

496
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,280
and you could probably hide it well enough that people just think it's like oh this just looks

497
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,960
like paper like it's just paper that's on the left there and it might be important yeah it'll

498
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,840
touch it right and then I just casually just put it I mean I can even pretend what would you do

499
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,320
kind of like oh do you want some sauce and then like you know get one and put the sauce in it and

500
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,920
then put it in the bag what's the conversation like when you're you're working at mcdonald's

501
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,600
in like two weeks into your you're working at mcdonald's your boss is like cheesy I need to see

502
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:43,520
you in my office what are these and he really is on a stack of mcpogliacci it's like where did you

503
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:53,120
get I don't know I don't know I they were there when I when I started I thought those were napkins

504
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,120
I thought those were napkins the paper doesn't seem like it's kind of like flimsy it doesn't

505
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,840
seem like such a what a piece of shit I can't believe they're in $15

506
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,520
I say like look it's yellow like the burger wrapper I thought you guys made it

507
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,880
he could wrap the burgers in the mcpogliacci or you know what would be funny I'd be like oh

508
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,240
fucking um fucking the man the was it the vice manager whatever the fuck they're called the

509
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,280
assistant manager like he I saw him just grab that and put a sauce in it and put it in the bag so

510
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,160
I thought oh that's what you're supposed to do and I just kept doing it um yeah I don't know who's

511
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,000
restocking it I mean I guess I think you brought them here's the dead giveaway

512
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,600
you just gotta go buy a pseudonym when you apply for the job that's true or I gotta print out a

513
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,520
special batch that just has to name cheesy man I mean they could just look up cheesy and find my

514
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,360
name it's not that hard oh man well that's a plan um it has to be I'm I'm imagining you're wearing

515
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:00,080
the clown makeup the whole time that would be such a weird like stealth market that would require

516
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:07,200
like a really incredible commitment to the bit which I would respect immensely it would it would and

517
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,360
I don't know if I got that it's a lot it's quite it's a lot to do you gotta have you gotta be like

518
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,600
you you know you're at the drive through the hand over the thing and then you ninja star throw like

519
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,600
like the the book in behind them so they can't see it and it's in the back of their car

520
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:36,880
um yeah true it's um it's something um I mean you know I'm kind of hoping that this is this is

521
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,440
my kind of what I'm hoping in my brain because I'm hoping that I by by the time this podcast

522
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,400
get out the motion comic should be available for people to like watch and I'm hoping that I see enough

523
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,560
yeah yeah yeah but I could do it I mean I already got everything in place I guess I better hurry and

524
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:06,560
record those lines then yeah please I appreciate it but um what I was saying is that um I hope I mean

525
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:14,800
either if it's out like by now or even I wanted to be up before the deadline because I'm hoping

526
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,920
that enough attention could be brought to it that like it makes it worthwhile to extend the deadline

527
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,120
a little bit more you know because like oh now a new group of people are finding out about

528
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:33,840
McPuglatchy because of the motion comic you know right it's it's it's it's kind of it's it's a gamble

529
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,880
but I think I think overall like over time you are gonna like talk about hey do you know about

530
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:46,720
this comic yada yada yada you know I mean yeah I know what I'm saying that's I think so I think

531
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,120
that's plausible I mean it's a really it's just a really funny idea I've heard something that could

532
00:53:51,120 --> 00:54:02,400
exist so I think I think yeah I think you've uh if I could go slight yeah that's it if I could go

533
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,560
like slightly back in time I probably would have done the motion comic before doing pre-orders but

534
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:13,120
um kind of like spurred on them I mean it's not like you have to stop taking orders after the

535
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:20,400
comic right you can still take orders right yeah yeah I could if people like um I mean

536
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,480
because they send me it in bulk when they um when they say you have to like order a certain amount

537
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,360
so I know I know like I'm probably not going to get to that number but like I am going to have

538
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,560
so and like you know I have physical conventions I'm planning to take the book too so you know

539
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:42,000
people can get it in person if they see me um I'm doing another convention next month

540
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:50,080
too and I'm actually doing a panel for the first time oh doing a dynamic panel what do you mean

541
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:57,360
what's the what's the panel it's uh it's oh the panel is um actually there's a there's a page for it

542
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,560
but I think I think I gave it the name uh how to design a villain is the name of the panel

543
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:12,160
hmm and it's uh it's basically um it starts off as kind of a very like I give you like the

544
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,920
abridge basic um tips for designing a character and then we then we jump into talking about

545
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,680
designing villains and then I talk about like here's my mentality when I came to designing these four

546
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:31,680
villain versus characters and then the second half of the panel is kind of like a audience member

547
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,400
like they give suggestions for what to design and I create a character right in front of their eyes

548
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:47,200
like a magician yeah exactly and I'm doing that at uh the convention is called uh Fangia

549
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,760
it's here in San Diego and it's pretty it's pretty cool I was uh boofing there last year it's not too

550
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,840
bad um what was kind of annoying last year was that the one of the halls where they have the

551
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:05,680
vendors also doubles as like a hall with a stage and sometimes they're bringing people to play like

552
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,200
the loud ass music like live performances but the thing is like you're trying to sell so imagine if

553
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,720
you hear a fucking like Japanese drums in the same room as you're trying to like tell people like oh

554
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,360
this is what my comic's about but they can't hear you that's like that was like one of my complaints

555
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,680
about the event um also there was a guy there like cosplaying as christian which I didn't like

556
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,560
kind of was really bothered by that um luckily there was other people there who were too who

557
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,000
were also bothered by them and they approached this guy and told him like hey wait a guy doing

558
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,400
what you're doing say that again a cosplay yeah yeah he like he came well yeah he came in with

559
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:52,000
the striped sweater and he had like a sonic chip okay yeah and I was I was like what are you doing

560
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,280
there bud what do you think you're doing well I mean what's the problem was he bothering people

561
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,400
it's just I in my opinion it's like a hot take I think it's very inappropriate that I did that

562
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,880
I'll say that because I don't I think I've said this is publicly before I really don't like

563
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:21,360
like anyone who's really into like yeah into the I mean I guess I get that because I

564
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,840
I I'd see it like at the end of the day I see it as like this was like a massive like

565
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,320
like kind of like a well not kind I think it was like a cyberbullying campaign on like

566
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,000
basically a disabled person online and I think um I think like when you cosplayed it when you do

567
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:46,560
like the fan art when people like sell the christian shirt merch and stuff like that it's this weird

568
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,400
kind of like glossing over the fact this was kind of actually very terrible that's just happened to

569
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,840
this person and I know I know people like to say like oh well he turned out to I mean she turned

570
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:01,360
out to do this terrible shit sure but that was like very much at the tail end of the whole thing

571
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:08,320
the majority of it was her getting goaded to do awful like things it it was like ultimately like

572
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,960
bullying and I'm hoping that I'm hoping with that when we eventually get the Netflix documentary

573
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,440
about this um they go with that handle because it's like you're kind of right but don't you think

574
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,280
but don't you think it's going a little bit far to be like this guy's wearing a costume I don't

575
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:32,160
wear I'm gonna I'm gonna like make an issue of it and complain about it I don't know there was like

576
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,080
someone wearing a costume I I somebody it's them just like this guy's wearing a costume with

577
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,120
disabled person that the whole joke is like hey remember this like disabled person like they

578
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:48,240
got bullied online well I'm gonna dress up as that person and I I think I would I think I would

579
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,360
understand if it was like something like years ago like it was Henry Darker had like a look

580
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,720
okay I don't I don't know if it was you I mean the person's still alive I guess

581
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:07,680
a lot of it was like a recent memory sure I guess uh whatever I I know the the internet

582
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,760
makes things seem like they happen a while long ago because things happen so fast but

583
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,040
like I think the main thing is you you get a bit of a sense of the type of person who would choose

584
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,720
that as a cosplay and then you're I mean that's probably yeah I I don't I don't mind their costume

585
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,960
I guess I wouldn't like report them like I don't like I don't like most bad first impression

586
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:35,200
that's that's that's true I I I think there's like I think there's something kind of wrong with

587
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,280
people who like obsess over it I mean there's there's there's a there's a I know and I I'm

588
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,600
talking to Ben I'm talking to I know I'm talking to Ben who made like two videos about it yeah it's

589
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:51,920
fine I I know because of that I've had I've had I've had so many I've had so many interactions

590
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,480
with so many interactions with people online who are like so bad about it like I know the type of

591
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,280
person you're talking about I just wouldn't assume it I mean honestly yeah if I got it would I just

592
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,080
wouldn't assume it based on the solely on the fact that someone's interested in Chris or thinks Chris

593
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,440
is funny or even wore a costume of it but like yeah there's a definite type of person who's like

594
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:21,280
too into it and is weird about it and is probably a Kiwi farmer and probably doesn't think trans

595
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:29,680
people are real most of the time if you if you if you ask them etc etc but also live free or die

596
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:39,680
but also but also I'll never take away his right to say it I'll die for your right for your right

597
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:50,560
to wear that striped shirt in public sir okay well I the only thing I'll die for I don't like it

598
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:56,320
I don't like it I'm not a fan I think it's um I think it's awful well I think you're awful that's

599
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:05,520
okay well all right okay okay that guy who who made that twitter comic you made

600
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:12,960
that aren't you twitter how dare you criticize someone else for something when you did something

601
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,640
that I don't like you hypocrite you made big twitter artists and that was bad

602
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,840
you know it's so funny like answer the question that was bad

603
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,400
cheesy was it bad or not for you doing that just say yes no in fact just say yes no I just say yes

604
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:42,640
admit it admit it admit you did admit you did you did something or die okay what are you saying

605
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,640
um deep fake deep fake me on like uh passion of the Christ uh scene where he's getting

606
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:57,280
crucified but it's me and I'm like um I regret big twitter artists oh no what I was gonna say

607
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:03,840
earlier is that I keep hearing like people tell me about like um they tell me about other

608
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,720
bigger artists like just DMing other art bigger artists and be like hey just retweet this for me

609
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:14,240
and they just kind of do it and it's like they're they're not friends or anything they're just mutuals

610
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,440
and it just kind of happens like all the time casually and I'm gonna hear everything and like

611
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,720
well they're doing it they've been doing it yeah the problem the problem is that like you're not

612
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:32,960
big enough for them to give a shit about yeah um it's it's uh it's it's annoying it's a yeah it's

613
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,800
it's annoying um I don't consider like mutuals friends I think I only consider someone a friend

614
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,160
if I like talk to them in a voice call at least like uh 200 I keep count

615
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,720
no but I can send this so I can guess it I consider a mutual a friend when I leave a reply

616
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,560
and then they like their play I consider my friend is one mutual a friend when we meet up and and

617
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:05,760
fuck I consider my friend once he starts sending me salacious photos that's that's the line that's

618
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,080
when that's the confirmation like okay this person's in it he's he's part of the cheesy the the

619
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,400
cheesy on you know what the cheesy family you know what's weird you know maybe you you know what

620
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:24,560
I'm like I'm like I'm like not a nudes guy I like don't like nudes yeah really you prefer

621
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:31,440
talking over personalities and talking I would hate it if nudes no uh I just don't no no no

622
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:39,680
what I I don't when I'm uh talking to someone I'm not I'm not angling for nudes I kind of don't

623
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,120
care to see the picture I you know if I if I if I think they're attractive and I want to have sex

624
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:52,320
with them I would want to meet them in person and maybe we fuck and that's cool I I don't know I

625
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:59,120
don't need I don't need them to send me pictures of their body like I'll see it you know what I mean

626
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,920
like you don't like you're kind of like I don't look up what cars they have at the dealership I

627
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:14,160
just show up to the dealership yeah see what they got yeah I guess so yeah sure I mean I'm not a car

628
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:21,520
guy so I wouldn't make that comparison but sure close yeah of course I don't like nudes and I don't

629
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:29,440
like cars and I don't like oh my god I'm a woman I was a woman all along nude cars if I I don't

630
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:36,240
like guy things if a smoke show if a real if a real if a real hot babe DM view and saying oh Ben

631
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,840
oh let me show you this picture of my pussy what would you say like no no one's no one's say no

632
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:47,920
thank you your personality no be fine no be fine I'm just I just I don't I don't I probably wouldn't

633
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,640
I probably wouldn't ask for nudes even if even if I thought I could get them I would just be like

634
01:04:53,200 --> 01:05:03,040
let's find you earn them let's meet let's meet and fuck baby let's let's but babe just show

635
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,680
show me a picture of your personality that's the real that's what I'm really sure I mean I'd like

636
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,400
to see a picture of your diet I'd like to see what she looks like and I'm like and then and then

637
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,440
from that I can be like do I like this okay good and I don't need I don't need to see the nude

638
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,680
to know if I'm interested I don't need to see the nude to know if I'm interested or not

639
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,880
but that's but that's not it is that that's how what nudes is about it's not about like

640
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,720
determining am I interested or not right it's usually like if you're getting nudes you're

641
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,760
already interested yes it's it's so if the so if the interest is there social interaction I don't

642
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:46,400
really need the nude let's just get together I think um now and now there's this now now woman

643
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:53,040
who's in Ben Sainz yeah I'm talking about yeah I hope god god I hope she's listening god I hope

644
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,640
you know I think there's this kind of like thing you hear all the time where like

645
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,920
um people are like oh why does anyone pay for only fans when there's like just titties free

646
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,720
online you know and it's kind of like well you're missing the point of it because it's not even like

647
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:19,920
necessarily about seeing titties just for titties sake but like um there's this kind of like um

648
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,360
almost like a a bond that you're paying for you know because a lot of like people who do kind of

649
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,400
only fans and it's not even necessarily like an only fans thing there's something like kind of

650
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:36,880
social interaction that you get from someone sending their own picture of their own titty to you

651
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,520
instead of you finding like a random there's a little bit more of a connection there yeah it's

652
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,440
like it's like yeah obviously it's paid for but you know it's part of it you know an incredibly

653
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:53,760
cringe way to look at listen I'm not I'm not trying to be a snob about it because I am on only fans

654
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,880
and I have I'll say at least one subscription but it's not but it's not a wait type type it into

655
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,160
the general no you don't gotta tell us just no it doesn't matter I'm gonna throw out some names

656
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,760
that you're gonna just just like wink look uh twice if I right I think I might have mentioned some on

657
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,960
the on the on a bonus episode one time but it doesn't matter but the point is it's not is definitely

658
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,480
not about oh I feel a social connection I feel some sort of some sort of a social interaction

659
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,880
with this person it is not about that is it is about it is about I want to get that I I like this

660
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,760
person I like their look I want to see a person that looks like this doing that they've got this

661
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:42,320
paywall content and I'm prepared to pay for it right I guess right it's not it's I mean I guess

662
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,960
it is a parasocial thing in the sense that like every like online interaction is parasocial but

663
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,800
it's not like oh I feel close to them I yeah I because they specifically sent me their news

664
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,720
because I made the request and they gave it to me no I made the request because I wanted to see

665
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,040
it I don't give a shit and they gave it to you sending a thing for it right right it's not it's

666
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,200
not about it's not about that so I don't agree with me Ben tell me Ben you're never taken advantage

667
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:13,360
of when they say like hey guys uh doing uh dick raid offers send your dick for the DMs you never

668
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:21,040
took an advantage of those deals I don't take advantage of women cheesy I don't take advantage

669
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,960
of women or deals because I believe in consent and consent and deals violate the non-aggression

670
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:33,680
principle I believe deals go against free market I believe deals are against and I trust the market

671
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:40,240
I believe deals are against God's law if you read the Torah it says uh it says uh don't eat don't

672
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:47,280
eat anything that's verboten uh uh no usury and it should have had a third clause it should have

673
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:53,760
also outlawed deals but they forgot God just God just forgot I am scrolling through the people

674
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:59,280
that you follow and see if any name pops up you don't I really want a pinpoint what on what on

675
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:10,000
twitter yeah on twitter I don't think the person I or people that I that I that I I don't think

676
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,920
they're on twitter oh okay this is this is your this is your special just for you

677
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,600
girl I mean not every not everyone who's on only fans is on twitter but many of them I mean that's

678
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,200
just what yeah many yeah many yeah because it's like the one social media platform where you could

679
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:36,960
post like Vaj and Bube for uh without getting in trouble uh it's probably true that it's probably

680
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:44,320
true that most of them are that's probably true I stopped going on only fans when I realized that

681
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,680
they you don't get good you don't get good payout they take a big cut of your money

682
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,360
what they take like forward they take like 20 it's kind of a big cut yeah yeah it is a big

683
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,400
cut I know a lot of people go like on fansly I don't know how it's the same it's the same cut I

684
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,880
actually looked into it and it's the same cut on fansly that's a shame I guess like I guess

685
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,480
then the idea is like oh they just go do both platforms I'd rather I'd rather do safe content

686
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:16,480
and get a better cut is there is there like a meaningful difference between uh doing one

687
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,320
versus the other I'm not necessarily I assumed only fans was just better because it's probably

688
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,520
got a bigger user base because more people have heard of it I I think I think the fact that like

689
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,480
I mean that's probably the bigger reason why people still use only fan is because more people

690
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:36,240
have heard of only fan so like even if they take a bigger cut you still guaranteed more people than

691
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,880
yeah yeah fansly or the alternatives although I see a lot of people kind of branching out

692
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,920
and doing other things did I did I mention that thing about how in that vlog Trixie said that she

693
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,840
thought that if she had joined only fans uh when when someone told her to that she could single

694
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:00,480
handedly have changed its reputation to be not just for for porn people I heard of it oh it's

695
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,040
super funny she yeah there's there's a there's a there's a picnic adventure where she and Bert are

696
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,680
driving and she's going she's talking about something it doesn't matter but she she's

697
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,720
straight up says like yeah if I had joined only fans at such a such time she says I made

698
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,120
patreon's reputation what it was because I was one of the first people to be successful on patreon

699
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:25,760
I basically made patreon what it was so if I had joined only fans when it when someone told me to

700
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,000
if I joined it at that time I would have single handedly changed it so that its reputation was

701
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,320
not just for sluts that's her her her wording now mine uh it it would have been for everyone

702
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,920
but unfortunately but I didn't do that so we live in the in the alternate timeline that's so

703
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:46,000
stupid it's so stupid it's so stupid on many levels because like many levels because the

704
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,400
thing about patreon is not even true at all she was never she was never in like the top

705
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,400
tier like by the time before she even joined patreon Amanda Palmer was making like $30,000 a

706
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:02,960
month like it's not even close I love Trixie she should livestream more and stuff like her live

707
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:08,160
streams her live streams are gold such as I don't have the money to give you a refund on

751
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,480
that the shell that's yoshi doesn't have a shell that's a koopa why is she wearing a koopa it's

752
01:16:50,480 --> 01:17:01,840
fucking women fake gamer sluts don't play video games right they don't they didn't they they use

753
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:07,040
their too busy showing their giant butts she probably used spells and dark souls

754
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,440
she probably did a this mad arcane build

755
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,240
but get this this is fancy pants do you remember fancy pants I do I do remember fancy pants and

756
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,960
I remember and I remember flirtally flirtally is my favorite my favorite background pony far

757
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:30,080
away these two these two stole the show and they didn't do anything yeah they did I like these two

758
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,320
flirtally that's a funny name I don't think that's her I just got a flirtally on our cutie mark I

759
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:41,520
don't think that's an official name I think that's just what fans call her I think this that she's

760
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:48,880
called flair well maybe I don't in that episode no she doesn't have a name maybe they gave her one

761
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,120
later I think they call it because on her cutie mark is a flirtally I guess it just makes sense

762
01:17:53,120 --> 01:18:01,600
oh yeah that's that's why that's why pinkie pie is named balloon yeah balloon balloon balloon

763

balloon but babe as like yeah the baby little baby and that they it pops and like is pops

766
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,640
what I said it's it's mixed it makes too much sense it makes too much sense pinkie but we all agree

01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:35,120
pinkie pie is a pog right yeah but but if you have a big balloon we have a big balloon but don't

772
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:09,440
call me call me crazy I just think people don't really look good in nudes I just think it they

773
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:15,360
most people look better in person wow body-shaming humanity I think I've never seen a you never

774
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,800
seen a new uh a good no it's not that I've never seen a good nude it's just it's just that uh I've

775
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:28,400
seen I've had I've had I've had sexual partners if you can believe it and in my opinion I don't

776
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:34,880
think I've ever had I don't think I've ever known you know I've they look better in person

777
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:40,160
than in a photograph I think I think most people I think photographs are generally not flattering

778
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:46,080
most photographs are not very flattering the same okay okay but like I think you can't have a good

779
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:54,960
nude I think a lot of people like nude sending is not very isn't a very high art no don't people

780
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,720
don't bring like photography degrees to that some of them do if they're if they've got like an

781
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:06,640
account but it so so so that being the case if it's not if it's not a flattering picture that's

782
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,200
like very gotta learn how to take better picture then why do I want to see it I don't you'll look

783
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:16,160
you'll look better in person the thing is that the thing yeah true I agree in person is way better

784
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:22,240
but like I think there's something kind of like there's something kind of hot about the amateurness

785
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:27,760
of it in my opinion you know the amateur point it's like its own category um well it's there's

786
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,360
something kind of like yeah attractive about the the confidence something human the confidence

787
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:40,320
I get that I get the decision to do it in the first place is nice uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so I yeah I get

788
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:50,400
it yeah especially if they do like you know you know actually I mean yeah you know I kind of agree

789
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,080
with that actually you kind of turn me around on it if there's like if it's like you kind of turn

790
01:20:54,080 --> 01:21:00,240
me on on that yeah nice um okay good that's yeah that's the okay that's that's gonna say guys that's

791
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:08,480
consent that's consent for uh the person or people I'll never tell that I'm subscribed to on only fans

792
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:14,480
they're not they're not very professional they're pretty but okay but it's like okay it's it's not

793
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:21,440
it's not what I appreciate about them is that in their unprofessionality is that I like to see them

794
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:28,960
in let's say in in situations I'd like to see them but I like the the amateurness of it makes it feel

795
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:34,880
authentic makes it feel like this is a real person doing these things it feels unstaged

796
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,920
uh uh so I mean in that sense I I completely agree I don't know if I feel quite the same

797
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:50,640
way about oh I took a picture of myself in a mirror I think that I I feel the same way in

798
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:58,560
in this one specific sense that like porn doesn't have to be like nudes but porn sometimes is more

799
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:06,080
like interesting and engaging when it's people characters just doing normal things and they

800
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:12,320
just happen to be sexy they're not like going oh look at how sexy I am and doing all this stuff

801
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,240
and yes like that sort of is like that feels fake that feels like staged when someone when a character

802
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:24,880
just happens to be like wrapped up in like a spiderweb or like tied up in like ropes or something

803
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,680
you know I just just natural you know they're just going they were just going about their day

804
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:35,520
just doing their just doing their job they're just making a living you know filing texas with

805
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,800
their titties out like bouncing around right you know I don't like a fake girl if you're wearing

806
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,200
makeup ill disgusting no makeup makeup is just a default thing you just you can you can do you

807
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:53,280
can wear your makeup you can wear nice things and then you can be like hanging out on a on a

808
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,240
playing a video game or like on a bench you don't need to be looking at the camera being like oh I

809
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:06,480
see the the yeah the real um in like a lot of like porn that you find on like sites where the girl is

810
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:13,120
like uh you know like the art the artifice of it is very like because because I know that because

811
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:18,400
they make such a big show of it it like really feels like this is acting and I can and it it's

812
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,840
like calling attention to the the fakeness of it and that's a really big like ugh I don't like

813
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,880
people cannot act right at least they don't need to if they're pretty enough right so they don't

814
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:39,920
need to learn how right I am yeah yeah yeah yeah one of these days I'm gonna direct a very like

815
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,800
weird porno where I'm it's gonna be one of those things where like when people pass around a clip

816
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,040
of something that seems funny and weird and then everyone in the comments like uh they people

self-titled lemon stealing whore she um she's stealing their lemons and she put in it in her

825
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:37,200
like I figure she's wearing like a onesie kind of thing like a onesie bikini kind of thing and

826
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,840
they're like hey that's the lemon stealing whore and like we only see the intro of this I imply

827
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,800
they potentially I think they punish the lemon stealing whore in like a sexual way yeah that's

828
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,440
what I would have done in that situation as well yeah if I were to catch a lemon stealing whore

829
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,680
my backyard to catch a lemon stealing whore I'm glad you remember you remember this better than I

01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,160
it'll be you'll never be forgotten those were the days never you never be forgotten that's right

844
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:18,880
did you know that game grumps still exists and and not only that it's like if you look at it's like

845
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:25,280
I can still hear the voice of Danny sex bang uh on the wind now they're doing thumbnails now where

846
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,000
they're doing like the the default youtuber gamer where they've got their photograph of

847
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,680
themself doing a whore face with the picture of the game next to them I was no longer the old

848
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:42,080
orange and the little faces that's that's amazing actually I can't it's so it's so different and

849
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,760
it's like well contents about about the same they're just sitting on a couch that's so weird

850
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,840
laughing and talking it's like you know I was yeah I was considering thumbnails for my uh for the

851
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,280
video the the twitch announcement video and I was I was picking out like which pictures of like

852
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:06,320
screen caps of myself from uh to use and I was just picking out and just thinking like you know

853
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:12,720
you kind of want to look deranged like you kind of want to look like you're a freak in the thumbnail

854
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,640
like like like mr beast like mr beast I don't know I think mr beast is extremely off-putting

855
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,480
looking especially the fakes he makes and all his thumbnail I mean and I'm not I know I'm not the

856
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:29,280
only person that thinks this but yeah it's not uh it's not like a it's not a an accident that he

857
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,840
chooses photos to look kind of freaky you I think that's just been a thing for a long time there's

858
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:40,320
something compelling about like a sort of deranged looking guy or something I don't know how to explain

859
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:46,320
it there but it has to be on purpose it has to be like an intentional thing I think I think a little

860
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:54,960
while ago a few years ago there was a trend of using like um like photoshop to like enlarge

861
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:01,120
the eyes and the teeth and to make it like look like absurdly horrifically different than a human

862
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:05,520
face like if you look if you look at it it looks really weird that trend has gone away a little

863
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,840
bit because it's a little too scary there's there's some that still works there's something yeah even

864
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,880
if it's not like good it's there's something that just grabs you about yeah like a human face

865
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,000
with some sort of like visual interest even if it's a negative interest but if like the eyes and

866
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,920
the teeth are really big your face goes right to it it's like a like a jump scare it's like ah

867
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:31,840
like um when you see it yeah it's really a sad and pathetic that that is how everything looks

868
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:38,480
if you want to maximize like clickability you have to be the same kind of a freak but I want

869
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:44,240
varieties of freaks you know there's a certain kind of thing that the human brain dreams

870
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:48,480
there's a certain kind of thing that the human brain just sees and has a visceral

871
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:56,400
reaction to and it's just all about getting that it's that reaction I think what I I like

872
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:02,160
book covers I like album covers those are cool this was on them I'll read them if they had if

873
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,680
like imagine if like albums and stuff were all physical now and then I mean they are physical

874
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:12,960
but like you know what I mean like albums like albums like you go you don't go to Spotify to

875
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:19,680
find albums you go to the store and they've got all these albums CDs and whatever but they've

876
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:25,600
all got the artist they've got the artist on the front cover doing well oh my god I can't believe

877
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:32,960
I made this sort of like face and like that's what gets people to buy it you travel to like

878
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,520
an alternate reality where everything is the same like there's no change except for one thing

879
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:44,560
and that's like the the album for Beatles rubber soul is them doing like the soy face pointing

880
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:50,000
and they're pointing at their own music yeah they're pointing at their album it's like a slip

881
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,280
so you could pull it out you could pull out the part where they're like pointing and it's like

882
01:29:53,280 --> 01:30:04,880
the regular album cover but this is yeah I was gonna say earlier this kind of reminds me of

883
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:12,240
there's this like there's this kind of theory that like stupid insane people have where like

884
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,760
people were saying something about like have you noticed that you're just kind of just naturally

885
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:23,920
scared of like pale horrific faces and like you know maybe maybe maybe it's because like back then

886
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,960
our ancestors saw some sort of subspecies creature that maybe was a pale evil monster thing and it's

887
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,640
ingrained in our DNA and that's why we're scared of it and it's beyond fucking stupid it's because

888
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:42,160
it's like well like there's a lot of reasons now to kind of be scared of someone pale or scary looking

889
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:48,400
than like something stupid and like oh it's at one point there was actually pale scary looking

890
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:53,520
monsters who lived on earth and they and they were like one of the one of the lesser oh this is like

891
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:58,960
an eight this is like an alien yeah yeah um well not not necessarily an alien but that like there

892
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,200
could there's just a creature like that that is kind of like the way people talk about it they

893
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:09,360
seem to explain it some sort of like one of the several subspecies of sapien that exists like

894
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,840
what like early man was developing because there was like a shitload of different like subspecies

895
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:20,240
I mean there's lots of ways for a face to look uncanny and alarming and like yeah being being

896
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:27,440
extremely pale I guess is one of them but it's like right definitely not the only one it's like

897
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:32,240
a weird kind of thing or like someone out there heard about the whole thing what assassins create

898
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:38,320
where it's like oh do you know that like your entire family history is near a dna and shit like that

899
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:43,040
and that like kind of crops up back and it's like oh what if like what if like your great great great

900
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,600
great grandpa saw like a spooky monster and it traumatized him so bad that it like passed on

901
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:52,400
and now that's why you're traumatizing spooky monsters that's what we call lamarky that's what

902
01:31:52,400 --> 01:32:00,240
we call lamarky and uh genetics you know about those malarky and more like more like malarky

903
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:06,400
lamarky said that like he thought that like the reason giraffes have long necks is because like

904
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:13,280
previous generations had to like they had to reach up with their necks to try and grab high fruit

905
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:18,480
and he thought that that physical activity like like physically stretched their neck out and that

906
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,080
and that then the giraffes would have babies and they would and they would pass that trade

907
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:27,360
on to their offspring and it was because they had developed it through like you know through their

908
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:32,800
the physical uh uh mechanical action through the through the grind set right yeah yeah it was not

909
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:39,920
that it was a natural selection by like gene mutation um so that's gene that's what that is it's

910
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,520
like oh your grandpa got really scared by a ghost so and he got so scared that he like it like he

911
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,640
learned that associate and then he and then his kid he's it was it was locked into his DNA from

912
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:56,080
that point on yeah so he gave birth to kids it's we're also scared of ghosts it's it's like it's

913
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:02,560
just like in the bible they said uh what it was like joseph or some fucking some fucking antediluvian

914
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:09,120
guy god was like hey god hey i'll tell you a trick to make to breed goats with stripes and they and

915
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,680
so he said cut stripes into a stick and put the stick in a water and then have the goats drink

916
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:21,120
the water and then their babies will have stripes and they did what fucking magic and hey and you

917
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:26,000
know that you know what else yes yes and you know the other part that's in the same chapter where they

918
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:34,000
describe uh the circular pool whose ratio of its diameter to its circumference is exactly three

919
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,520
lamal

920
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:44,160
whoa if you pi pi is i can't believe the number three is in pi is exactly three god according to

921
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,520
to the bible lamal

922
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:53,680

include that in my amazon order a copy of chlorissa gun smoke and a jar of a of a corn fiber please

945
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,840
to add up to $25 to get that that's what you should do everyone should should add a chlorissa

946
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,680
gun smoke volume to their shopping cart to save on delivery fee exactly you you can't afford you

947
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:31,840
can't afford not to and then and the corn fiber of course too and corn pop yeah what ben said

948
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,160
obviously but in in the course of of making the site i had to like go through all of my comics

949
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:47,040
again uh bail jake is great bail jake is really fun i should reread it it's been a while i love bail

950
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:54,240
jake i love ken and story i even love horse stuck even though it's like really really old and uh digi

951
01:36:54,240 --> 01:37:02,880
is in there yeah right at the end uh boy i had to scroll way back to see that i think it's a great

952
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:08,320
feeling when you go back to your older work and you still think it like looks good you know yeah

953
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:14,640
a lot yeah i mean it's obviously like worse drawing than what i could do now like the the

954
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,560
things i tried my hardest at i remember certain panels that like oh i tried my hardest to make

955
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,920
this look good and it just sort of is okay but now i could do so much better uh a part of me

956
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:29,920
was thinking like oh when i do the volume one of villain verse where i have the the prologue to

957
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,600
chapter six maybe i should go back and redraw a couple those panels so they look a little bit

958
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:39,280
better but then i i look at those panels and i'm like ah this still looks good i still looks good

959
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:45,520
i don't need to change anything it you know it's still serviceable very i still think

960
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,160
about about which comic you're talking about uh villain verse are you still doing it are you

961
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:58,640
still gonna do more villain verse oh yeah i've been yeah okay i think i mentioned it before that um

962
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:04,800
i kind of put that on pause because uh it's not yeah making me it's not making me as much money as i

963
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,640
thought it would i've been trying to focus on more kind of like comics that will help me

964
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:15,120
stand out i understand i understand i i i get you because uh this should this should

965
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:21,520
as tough i um i hate i hate talking to other artists i think me too terrible people you know

966
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:29,280
you know i was joking but go on i might i might agree with you even more okay so what i what i mean

967
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:34,960
is that um so every time i like i'm not every time but there's a there's a there's a certain group

968
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:39,680
there's a certain type of artist that every time i tell him like yeah like what's kind of annoying

969
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:43,840
i mean i'm basically just complaining about like oh man i'm not making a living tough tough to make

970
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:50,240
money isn't yeah yeah exactly and then this person is always like dude who cares about the money

971
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:55,200
dude it's all about you know it's all about making art for yourself man all cool all cool shut the

972
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:00,960
fuck up shut up you fucking monster yeah i hate yeah i do people actually say that do people

973
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:07,040
actually say that in casual conversation people do say that to me like yeah i mean it's that's

974
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:12,480
yeah that's not reading the room at all if you're having trouble with money and you need the money

975
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:18,960
because you do need the money because everyone needs my job my job my job sure is hard my job

976
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:27,040
sure is all who cares how hard it is it's like because like i mean i get the ultimate in a perfect

977
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:31,520
society yeah of course you would be only making art for yourself because all that that's all that

978
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:37,120
matters ultimately but in this society where like i want to i want to make a living off something

979
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:42,960
that doesn't make me want to shoot my fucking like brains out yeah you know like and i basically

980
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:48,320
argue like man it sucks that like the job that i want is it making me enough i'm gonna be i'm gonna

981
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,360
be perfectly honest it's ultimately what i'm saying i'm gonna be perfectly honest i don't

982
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:57,600
really talk to that many other artists i talk to like gib oh i could tell how do you how could you

983
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:06,960
tell i could tell it's easy okay well i won't i won't ask i won't ask for any more details uh i i

984
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:13,200
don't uh i don't really talk to that many uh and i mean okay those when people say that something

985
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:20,880
like that is it people that like are they successful or are they people who are also no it's never

986
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:26,480
it's never successful okay it's so it's so it's cope so it's cope well it's not even like cope it's

987
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:32,000
kind of like i feel like because i noticed is that if if an artist has like a well-paying job and

988
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,880
then they do the art thing um obviously they don't care too much about making money off of art right

989
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:45,200
because they have the well-paying job and so they can do art for themselves yeah and that's fine

990
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,920
yeah um that's that's cool if you want if you want to go down that route there's no problem with

991
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:56,320
that but like there's something it's so it just feels kind of weirdly dismissive not like oh i want

992
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:01,360
to go down a route where like the stuff that i like to make is the stuff that's keeping me afloat

993
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,200
yeah and um to some people that doesn't like click like oh you should just if you like making that

994
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:12,640
so you should just make it and it's like yeah but you know i kind of want to kind of eat yeah i

995
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:19,360
gotta want to eat i kind of have rent to pay i kind of yeah it's it's it's just it's i would say i

996
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:25,680
guess there's two like if they're like a successful artist it's obviously hit like hypocritical of

997
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:32,560
him to say that if they're like yeah like wealthy or at least like their bills are paid by some other

998
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,720
thing and like they just they they're just like a hobbyist and they say that then it's like why are

999
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:45,120
why are you saying that like you don't you don't have the same concern as me so like fucking how

1000
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:51,360
how dare you dismiss it like that right like who who are you to tell me oh don't worry about that

1001
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:58,800
fuck yourself uh and then yeah if if they're if they're also struggling and they're then then like

1002
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,640
i could see i could see someone who's like also doing that just being it is like cope this is

1003
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:07,280
like oh it's it's not about the money it's just about it's about uh it's about the passion

1004
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:16,160
and can i pay my bills no but you know i don't expect to uh i am a lowly worm uh this is what i

1005
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:23,280
deserve yeah i i think um what i was gonna say another thing that i also kind of like

1006
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:29,760
in the same vein as this is like uh can i tell people that like i i aim to make

1007
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:37,280
stuff that like i try to make stuff that like is like popular like that can be popular you know

1008
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:41,920
and a lot of like other i guess the same kind of artists who's like just drawing for themselves

1009
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,480
like raises an eyebrow to that like comment because they're like oh you should try to make

1010
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:52,640
stuff that appeals to you you should make art for yourself oh you should just make the art you

1011
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:58,720
want to see uh have they ever had bakuman it's literally all about it's all about the reader

1012
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:08,400
surveys nothing else matters except the reader surveys i with me i like to um i like to i i

1013
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,560
talk about this i i've tried to talk about this on other podcasts and i keep getting interrupted

1014
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:18,160
but hey i hey actually i mean you didn't talk about the pcb website for a second not going

1015
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:23,200
sorry but but basically and i think i have mentioned it before on this podcast is like

1016
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:28,640
there's the art that like um that feeds your soul but doesn't make you any money and then there's the

1017
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:32,640
art that like can make money but like kind of hurts your soul and you want to hit the middle

1018
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:37,680
ground of that like right because no because no one's like a complete contrarian where they like

1019
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,920
you don't like something that's popular right like you there's gotta be everyone likes at least

1020
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,600
one thing that's like popular and yeah and if you're an artist you should like think about

1021
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,640
what are the popular things you like and that and try to do your version of that popular thing you

1022
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:56,400
know yeah um because that's gonna like keep you afloat actually i would yeah go on someone said

1023
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:02,720
i think it might have been like i just heard someone say i think it might have been majulaar

1024
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:08,560
in a video not that long ago or someone i heard some youtuber just they it was not even relevant

1025
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:13,680
who had said it but someone said like a lot someone just commented that like a lot of art

1026
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:18,880
this reminded me the art is a lot of the time it's about like you just see someone else

1027
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,800
do something and you just think that sucked i i could do that better like i could do that

1028
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,080
better than that person get and then you and then you do it and then you try to do it and

1029
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:32,240
just prove that you you could do it better than that other person did it and that's just where a

1030
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:38,080
lot of art comes from yeah and that's fine that's like uh i i love that that's like when you do

1031
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:44,480
something out of spite which is great not even out of spite it's it's just if you i mean it's

1032
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:49,920
stupid example but that reminds me of like the pony the pony scene back the pony review scene i

1033
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,280
saw other idiots making pony reviews and i was like well this any you could do a better pony review

1034
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:02,720
than this and i did that's how it that's how it starts i remember i kind of had that same

1035
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,400
mentality when i made my first like short film in high school because there was like a a senior

1036
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:13,360
at the time and i was doing your who made a short made a short horror short film and everyone loved

1037
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,200
that everyone thought like oh that was great and awesome and epic but i was like dude you literally

1038
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:22,480
just ripped off a creepy pasta like i know this creepy pasta and he passed it off as like his

1039
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:26,960
his own work and i'm like ah dude this will aim as fuck dude i could make something scarier and

1040
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:33,920
original and i like the thing i did you know my short film was very weird it was very particular

1041
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:39,360
like i i thought i thought it was funny i guess i think a lot of time did not get it i guess we'll

1042
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:44,880
never know um it's still on it's still on youtube it's called it's on my cheesy's do even dare to

1043
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:52,160
watch it's on my cheesy uh classic channel it's called the dog man okay i've ever even seen that

1044
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:58,240
channel uh it used to be used to be called well link link link it if you dare but i guess we don't

1045
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:04,880
have time to watch it right now i don't i don't want to link it okay okay okay just take my word

1046
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:11,280
for it it was really good i totally blew that guy out of the water it destroyed that guy yeah his

1047
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:16,800
is he was like he was shaking he became a little quiet after dog man came out he was a little a

1048
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,480
little silent interesting interesting you know yeah speaking speaking of oh oh no are you going

1049
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:28,400
yeah god i was just gonna say that yeah i just kind of i'm annoyed by those kinds of people um i

1050
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:36,160
think it's pretty cringe to not understand that like an artist would want to do art as a living

1051
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:44,240
and therefore the the struggle to make it a profitable venture is like really obviously

1052
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,520
important and what kind of a f***ing flawed wouldn't wouldn't appreciate that

1053
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,920
i mean i i want to play devil's advocate for just a second no no to these types of people

1054
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:05,040
die die die um when they say just do things that make you happy or could they be referring to like

1055
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:12,320
art that is successful being good because the artist who made it like doing it

1056
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,040
no like that happens yeah that happens obviously it may be a very misguided because it's like they

1057
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:25,120
only know that's that's that's that's that's such a uh that's such a but that's probably where their

1058
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:28,480
mind is when they say that might be where their mind is i would think but that's such as like a

1059
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:33,440
survivorship bias thing because when you when you look at like comics that are really successful

1060
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:39,520
and maybe the artist behind them is like i just draw what i like and it's just what they draw is

1061
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:44,480
like something that's wildly popular it's like then it's simply it's just a coincidence like

1062
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:49,040
this they're just lucky that like the thing that they really like to draw just happens to be the

1063
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:54,560
thing that the zeitgeist is like really into and and it was became successful like you can't you

1064
01:47:54,560 --> 01:48:00,240
can't just you can't generalize that advice to everyone because most people if they just draw

1065
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:07,280
whatever appeals to them most it wouldn't people wouldn't care uh they have they have to think

1066
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:11,920
about how can i how can i make this something make this into something that the people like

1067
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:18,000
that's my cope though i still think that if i care about what i'm doing then people will be like

1068
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,040
oh you know what to a certain extent it's true but i don't think it's good general advice for

1069
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:28,720
like how to make it in the art scene no i mean i don't know how to make it in the scene because i

1070
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:36,880
mostly have money from podcasts i think um true i think it i think yeah there's a lucky few out there

1071
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:43,040
who like the art they want to make is already stuff that's like super popular so they're like oh

1072
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:48,960
yeah oh wow hot wow the guy who uh the guy who drew fuck when did undertale come out like 2015

1073
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:54,320
something something like that 2015 the guy who just was just drawing his own undertale

1074
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:59,760
art in 2015 got super popular because oh obviously he was just drawing from the heart right well not

1075
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:04,960
that coincidentally at the same time he was really into a game that was super popular at the time you

1076
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:10,560
know yeah like that that can't be it yeah right there's like all these like like yeah there's like

1077
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,760
all these like other things that people don't like speak taking count speaking for counterpoint

1078
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:21,680
my work is great and people will look back and say wow i wish i was a fan of gibb earlier and then

1079
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:27,520
i would be a cooler but nobody but nobody but nobody will find nobody will find you i'm sorry

1080
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:32,320
but nobody's gonna find you through Clarissa they're gonna find you through other stuff

1081
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,760
and if and if they stick around then they'll read Clarissa and it'll be good and it'll

1082
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:44,400
i understand this i that's why i'm i'm trying to like during Clarissa or maybe afterwards

1083
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:49,040
make a few videos make a few youtube videos see if i can get some of that back

1084
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:57,120
so i can i can advertise again yeah send people that way having a good website that's like good

1085
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:03,360
and not shit would also do some some good you know like having a having a good presenting

1086
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:09,040
front-facing base of operations that people can go to like i'm setting things up and i think it's

1087
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,680
it's gonna work guys it's just gonna work no i believe you i believe uh speaking of okay

1106
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:20,320
on the subject of things that are popular parker i need new spider-man no they're not flattering

1107

1109
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:37,680

01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:43,200
oh that makes me so angry ben gets the venom symbiote come venom in this in this continuity

1111
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,160
fight spider-man so he can't spread his nudes speaking of oh i want a green symbiote because

1112
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:56,960
it'd be like slime ha ha um uh ben slime ben ben smeels uh speaking of all that shit speaking

1113
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:03,040
of piggybacking off of popular things uh to get popular uh my mega man video the the reason why

1114
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:09,840
i rushed and got that uh that uh twitch announcement video out today or yesterday was because uh

1115
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:15,120
mega man video is getting a big third wave it's getting like a big third uh like like uh wind

1116
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:22,400
i think it's because uh i think it's because the battle network legacy collection is like

1117
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:29,440
being announced it's gonna come out like next month uh it's it's uh we're doing we're doing

1118
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:34,640
numbers we're doing numbers here i'll show you i'll show you the last 28 days of numbers on this graph

1119
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:40,000
right here see you're lucky you've got you've got mega man that you care about you make a video about

1120
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,240
that you care about mega man i don't care about mega man i would never force myself to care about

1121
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:50,000
mega man listen here's the here's the thing i plan i planned for all this because i knew i knew that

1122
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,520
mega man that the legacy collection was coming out and that mega man 11 had just surpassed mega

1123
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:01,040
man 2 as like as like uh uh the best-selling mega man of all time so there's like renewed

1124
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,160
interest there's renewed fan interest and there's renewed corporate interest in the franchise

1125
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:10,400
and i knew that they have like bigger projects in the works that are still a secret but had

1126
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,560
that have like huge budgets put to them i knew that there were going to be big mega man developments

1127
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:19,520
coming in the future so i was like i need to do this now i need to make the definitive mega man

1128
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:25,120
video that everybody's gonna want to watch when 10 years from now some big fucking thing comes out

1129
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:29,680

1131
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:39,440
watch that and it's happening it's paying off and then they'll get to the bit we talk about the pcp

1134
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:58,720
where is my mega man i bet if i were you um to make a to make a mega man comic no at this point

1135
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:07,040
no um but here's the ticket just just retell the entire mega man story but don't

1136
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:11,840
but change everyone's names everyone's like proxy characters it's really funny also make it edgy

1137
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:19,920
and cyberpunk mega man axe is already the edgy cyberpunk version of uh of mega man it's really

1138
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:26,400
funny i went to a local this was a couple years ago i went to i was invited to a local it was at

1139
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:33,120
a college it was a meeting of like the the comics it was like a comics club at this college yeah

1140
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:37,440
and it was a it was a bunch of hacks it was a bunch of you know it was college kids

1141
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:42,160
it was it we thought they they were just they were just they had oc's they were just talking

1142
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:45,520
about their oc's and they were like yeah i've been working on this i've been working on this

1143
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,760
comic for like eight years now i've been working on it for eight years haven't started drawing it yet

1144
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:56,080
but you know i'll uh yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be really good uh and one guy was talking about

1145
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:01,760
his comic his comic idea and he's describing the plot of his comic idea and he talks for several

1146
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:06,080
minutes and i'm sitting there and he's talking about yeah it's the future there's robots that are

1147
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:12,880
that are alive there's uh you know they some of them go crazy uh there's a rebellion uh certain

1148
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:18,560
good robots have to form a team to fight against the bad robots that are rebellious wow he's talking

1149
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:23,920
listen there's more there's layers because he's saying all this and i'm looking at him and he's

1150
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:29,200
wearing a mega man shirt and i'm like i'm just looking at him i'm like yeah yeah that sounds

1151
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:33,840
pretty good yeah that's it's compelling yeah that's pretty good and then he talks for like five

1152
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:39,040
or ten minutes about this idea for this this comic series that he wants to do and he gets to the end

1153
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:43,440
and he goes like yeah so basically it's mega man like i basically just ripped off mega man

1154
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:52,320
and i was like you know what okay i respect it at least at least he cops to it so at least he

1155
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:58,320
under at least he appreciates that about his pitch so i couldn't be that mad i can't i can't

1156
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:04,240
imagine working on a comic in your head for eight years and not it's literally just like

1157
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:10,560
they have an oc they have an oc that they have stories about in their head and some maybe occasionally

1158
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,360
they sketch them in a notebook and they think this would make a great comic one day and that's what

1159
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:21,760
they mean by i've been working on this comic for eight years i cannot comprehend doing ideas that

1160
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:26,800
are eight years old because like you're like a different person by then and it's like here's

1161
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:30,960
the kind of trick if you have a genius idea right now that you think like oh i'm gonna say this for

1162
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:35,760
later no do it now because like even in a year or so you're gonna like think that idea is not that

1163
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:41,360
good some people have so i just do it now some people have uh like since they were kids even

1164
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:45,760
they have like a cast of characters in their head that they've thought up and they've just continued

1165
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:52,320
to like think of like scenarios for these characters to do you know who's like you know

1166
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:59,280
who's like that is is emily ree you know emily ree that sounds she's a comic she does she does a

1167
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:04,880
comic called anarchy dreamers and uh she's on twitter and that's that's her comic she's had

1168
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:10,400
these these ocs for like uh you know since she was like a kid a teenager whatever and she's just been

1169
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:15,600
i mean it's fine to like use concepts you've had lying around i just it's the it's the sense that

1170
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:25,920
like anarchy you haven't like made anarchy dreamers okay look out right now um sure because i also

1171
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:32,240
have like a bunch of like characters i guess a lot of them were invented in the process of like

1172
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:41,920
making shit up while i was drawing bell jpe and stuff but like oh and like uh rfck lord of ghosts

1173
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:47,360
i made up because it was like a fun character to play yeah yeah i don't really have anything from

1174
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:56,160
childhood no i'm either no i'm either i think um yeah i think i mean her she's like the exception

1175
01:58:56,160 --> 01:59:02,000
i think also the creator of bone uh jeff smith he came up with the bone characters the bone

1176
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:08,000
cousins when he was like a little kid because it's like he was a big fan of this comic strip called

1177
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:15,520
pogo and it's like a possum character and he and he drew the main character um phone bone

1178
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:22,240
is based on pogo and pogo and because bone phone bone looks kind of like pogo but like hairless

1179
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:28,320
and that's kind of where he based the idea for all the bone characters and if you look up the art of

1180
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:34,640
bone he he adds like his old like children like his old comics that he made when he was a kid

1181
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:39,760
with with phone bone and phony bone and their design has that it literally never changed at all it's

1182
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,440
like been the same since he was a kid um i've never i've never read i mean lucky for oh bone is

1183
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:52,880
fucking a lot of big bone is bone is a real comics nerd's uh favorite comic like your favorite

1184
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:58,160
comic artist's favorite comic is bone i saw it on a library once and i read a bunch of it and it was

1185
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:05,520
like it was really really well drawn and funny and woody and and just it was great i really should

1186
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:12,640
find more issues for more volumes yeah you gotta like you gotta like get that um you're probably

1187
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:18,160
i feel like even the color version the the scholastic like really so the books are pretty good

1188
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:25,120
i know there's like complete like versions of bone but um it's fucking it's fucking great uh

1189
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:30,960
10 out of 10 every time like every time i see motherfuckers complaining about like oh like it's

1190
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:37,440
so hard to get into like oh man uh western comics are dying i saw you've been you've been retreating

1191
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:42,720
that you were retreating that one about like oh the manga section is bigger and i'm over here

1192
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:48,480
thinking like oh please just read daniel claus please the reason it's so simple the reason the

1193
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:54,640
manga section is bigger is because print manga is just a bigger business in japan because there's

1194
02:00:54,640 --> 02:01:01,680
just bigger demand there's bigger financial demand for serialized fucking print comics it's

1195
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:07,520
literally just there's more money in it over there it's so and it's also kind of like every

1196
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:12,160
time i see anyone complain every time someone makes this kind of tweet they're usually and they keep

1197
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:18,560
it nice and vague i usually also see them talking about how like and the reason why is because of

1198
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:23,760
comics keep pushing progressive politics right you'd have to be so fucking stupid not to see it's

1199
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:29,920
because there's more fucking money in it you fucking idiot they pay them more it's a bigger

1200
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:36,080
industry it's it's just so yeah it's it's really fucking annoying i really it's because they made

1201
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:42,080
april o'neill well she was already black but they made her black and fat in the new change and that

1202
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:49,280
was too far that ended calm ended western comics yeah exactly took the words right out of my mouth

1203
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,280
and it's it's a shame there's a lot of really good like there's a lot of like really good comics

1204
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:01,440
out there that aren't like big two superhero stuff i i try to mostly recommend non big two

1205
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:09,600
like superhero stuff um yeah because it's just so much like like better damn i was thinking about

1206
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:13,440
but but there's but there's not but there's not as much of it not as much of it comes out

1207
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:19,280
that there no a lot of it does come out um it's just that like you don't like people don't talk

1208
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:25,520
about it mostly that's kind of it i i think i think manga in japan is like

1209
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:32,640
there's so many mangaka just churning it out for so many different publications

1210
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:39,040
we just don't we just don't have the culture of that over here it's not it's not it's simply not

1211
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:47,680
the same ecosystem i agree yeah i think i think that's the main difference well i mean but by

1212
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:52,320
the same token a lot of the western comics a lot of the non-western like stuff like daniel

1213
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:57,600
claus and stuff it's kind of like you know it's very it's very like kind of high it's a lot of

1214
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:05,040
highbrow stuff uh you know 100 100 bullets or whatever uh uh uh you know whereas like yeah

1215
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:12,080
the manga section is really big because there's a lot more schlock there's tons more schlock manga

1216
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:17,280
coming out and it's just because they need to fill pages you know it's just cheaper to make and

1217
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:21,840
yeah like people say like oh it's hard to get into but i'm like i feel like people get into

1218
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,160
comics the same way they get into manga which is usually just recommendations right because like

1219
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:30,880
yeah how many times was the last time you get into barnes and noble and thought like oh i've

1220
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:36,640
literally never heard of this manga i'm gonna get it uh no you usually don't know if the last time

1221
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:44,720
that happened was when i must have been like 14 13 12 and i went into walden books and i bought a

1222
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:53,920
copy of ragnarok you know what that is yeah i know what that is the manga the manga yeah wait it's

1223
02:03:53,920 --> 02:04:00,960
it's not a manga because it's korean uh but it's a manhwa wife i thought manhwa was when it was on the

1224
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:08,400
phone uh what was before it was before like webtoon because i'm old remember there's a western

1225
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:14,080
comic called the ragnarok yeah a lot of things called ragnarok here here this one this one um

1226
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:19,840
i just bought it because i thought i had a cool art style yeah and that was when i was like uh

1227
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:26,640
yeah probably like 13 i was um i was lucky that i grew up like going to the public library like

1228
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:32,400
religiously like i went like every week and what i did was that i would just read any comic if it

1229
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:40,160
just looked interesting to me if i wait if i remember correctly i think that ragnarok

1230
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,840
had like in the in the ending section along with like letters from the editor and stuff

1231
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:55,120
i think it had the characters like statted out in like d&d stat blocks if i'm if i'm not

1232
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:04,400
insane if i'm not completely imagining that which means that it was it was they it was marketed

1233
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:09,200
specifically to me nerdy nerdy white nerdy white young high schooler

1234
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:15,520
done for that nerdy white money so now that i think about it i feel it's shameful and now

1235
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:22,400
and now i'm noticing oh my god it was published by tokyo pop no what have i done does it have an

1236
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:30,560
over the oh is it ragnarok i guess may might technically be ragnarok ragnarok is it is it

1237
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:36,000
kind of like a thing or like um what uh what japanese people do in english words where they just

1238
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,680
pick words that sound cool i think koreans don't know what how's that little thing is supposed

1239
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:47,840
to be pronounced so i i look at this i look at this and i and i think remember those d&d stat

1240
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:54,000
blocks and i think this was probably made specifically for the west even though it's

1241
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:01,600
by a korean artist uh this this says like made for the western market too much to me market

1242
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:10,160
that's just that's just a hunch but uh um lamal there's god i need to get i just want to become

1243
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:14,160
big enough that i can just recommend um there's this channel i think i mentioned that before

1244
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:21,920
but they're called the cartoonist k fave have you heard of this channel no it's run by two um two

1245
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:29,280
guys two comic creators who work in the industry um ed piscor and jim rug and they're both really

1246
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:35,280
cool i really like their stuff um and and they they got a pretty popular like they're a pretty

1247
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:40,400
popular channel with like people who like like comics and what i like about them is that they

1248
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:45,760
they shine spotlights on like more obscure kind of stuff and they they interview all sorts of people

1249
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:53,520
like they recently interviewed both creators of tmnt um and i think um but they talk about

1250
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:59,360
something called the k fave effect and what it is is that like they there's this thing where like

1251
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:05,520
they'll talk about an obscure comic and then the literally right after the video drops on ebay the

1252
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:10,480
price for that comic goes like it's skyrockets because everyone just keeps like looking for it

1253
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:14,160
like oh shit like where is it like i want to read it and that's happened a couple time with me when

1254
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:18,480
they talk about something like obscure like oh you guys heard about this comic and i'm like oh that

1255
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:22,800
comic looks so cool i want to get it and then like i look it up and i'm like wow that shit

1256
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:27,440
cranked up in price because everyone had the idea and even now what they do is that on their

1257
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:33,920
patreon they drop the videos early so those comics like go up in price even before they drop on youtube

1258
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:40,880
right and i i think that's so cool because it's like oh now more people are getting into more

1259
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:49,200
kind of the obscure things right yeah and um it's it's really badass and i want to like i want to

1260
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:54,960
get to that point where i just could just recommend something obscure and it just kind of like blows

1261
02:07:54,960 --> 02:08:02,160
up i really i really wish would be pretty rad to be able to do that yeah right it acid that was

1262
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:10,000
also kind of like i think also i think a big thing that would probably help um western comics is if

1263
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:16,160
if we get like more like animated adaptations you know but not but not exactly like not exactly

1264
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:21,120
like another spider-man cartoon put them on netflix we should i wonder if netflix is making any

1265
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:26,720
cartoons i think they've got some budget for for for some new animated productions i think um i think

1266
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:32,640
what i want is something kind of like just just just make good adaptations of things kind of like

1267
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:38,240
when the walking dance started or like or like the boys or like invincible because when those shows

1268
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:43,280
like first came out and they got super popular you know more like invisible because nobody watched

1269
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:50,000
it that's not true you go on um you go on amazon and i look up oh what's like the best selling

1270
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:56,000
comic on amazon that's not a manga and it'd be like invincible or the boys actually at

1271
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,800
during the heights of the popularity of the dough shows the boys and invincible are like

1272
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:06,400
outselling manga they're outselling like super popular things and i mean they just kind of just

1273
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:11,360
happens when like oh when the chainsaw man anime dropped uh the chainsaw man was like

1274
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:16,000
the best selling a manga on amazon you know and it like but i i mean i feel like we need more kind

1275
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,520
of like we need more kind of like banger series that are based on like um i mean i guess the

1276
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:26,960
the annoying part is that the boys and invincible is still related to like superheroes but i think

1277
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:32,240
the nice thing about the boys and invincible is that it literally you start with volume one or

1278
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:36,240
volume one volume one with the boys or volume ones have been invincible to start the story and

1279
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:41,440
there's like an ending you know it's not like oh you got to read like it's not like oh it's implied

1280
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:48,080
there's like five other books that you could also like are connected to this and yada yada right

1281
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:55,920
mm-hmm i think i think we i think we just need like just more good adaptations of like

1282
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:01,280
just like more non superhero comics and whatnot and you know people try there's like a lot of

1283
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:06,400
like series that like didn't really catch on like there was a preacher show and i felt like the

1284
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:11,440
preacher show should have been way bigger than it was and i don't know why it wasn't that successful

1285
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:15,680
um because i heard people the people who did watch said like oh it's pretty good

1286
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:23,520
but um it just never caught on like uh the boys did or um invincible did or uh they made a they

1287
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:28,960
made a they made like an Amazon Prime show yeah it's hard to tell they might just been they came

1288
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:35,280
out there in the wrong time or it might be that these fucking SJW cucks made the the girl character

1289
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:40,800
into a black woman in the adaptation you know who's to say what really caused it but yeah who's

1290
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:48,400
to say i mean i mean uh you got your theory i got my theory uh i think it's probably communism's fault

1291
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:56,080
but uh it's the free the free market will decide uh the free market will decide if communism wins or

1292
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:03,200
the wins or loses my brain is my brain is too small to think of such things i'm just gonna draw

1293
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,040
i'm just gonna draw

1294
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,000
i just want to draw okay

1295
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:15,200
i just just draw just draw what you want to draw you know

1296
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:21,440
don't focus on being popular that's so nice that's so nice to imagine that just draw don't even

1297
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:26,880
think about it just draw whatever you want to draw and the money will just start just start rolling in

1298
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:31,440
yeah don't even post it don't even post it just throw it or you just throw it in the trash after

1299
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:36,880
you just draw it again i was talking to someone and like they were asking me because like

1300
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:42,320
someone literally said like no one's ever like got in popular from trying to be like popular

1301
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:47,040
with their art hey that's the dumbest that's the stupidest fucking thing i've ever heard yeah

1302
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:52,240
actually uh actually that's literally all that's actually what happens way more often you freaking

1303
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:58,560
imbecile you freaking you freaking you freaking loser you gotta get your fucking get in the

1304
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:04,080
fucking real world okay you live in a fantasy nobody's ever gotten popular by trying to get

1305
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:12,480
popular haven't you read bakuman you it it's so it's so like funny because it's like if you're an

1306
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:17,200
artist that has like a family you're probably more inclined to like want to make popular things

1307
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:22,000
because you want to feed your fucking family i brought up the example of like because i brought

1308
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,440
up um brought up jack Kirby as an example of an artist who was trying to do popular things and

1309
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:32,960
i got i got like shun when i brought that up like like what no no way no because jack Kirby is

1310
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:37,360
considered one of the greats and i do consider him one of the greats that being said that guy was

1311
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:42,400
trying to be popular like he um there was a period actually not even a period his whole life he was

1312
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:46,400
trying to aim to do stuff that people that he thought like oh people might like this because at one

1313
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:51,120
point he made a comic about a jazz singer because like oh people like jazz i'm gonna make someone

1314
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:56,560
make someone about i mean i read i read a there's a there's a thing i think it was an

1315
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:03,280
interview with like edgar allen poe that they asked him like boy how did you come up with a raven

1316
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:09,200
like you must have been and you must have gone into like a freaking oh you must have like you

1317
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:14,800
were you smoking edgar allen poe were you on depression pills you must have gone into like a

1318
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:20,160
poetic fugue state and like emerged uh uh you know days later not having written it because it's

1319
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:24,880
such a masterpiece and he was like well uh actually you know i just uh you know horror

1320
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:29,200
short horror was like really popular was really trending and like doing well in magazines at the

1321
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:32,960
time and i just uh you know i just thought i could really i could do that i could really

1322
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:40,880
capitalize on that so i just wrote it and it worked yeah i was right exactly i thought it'd be

1323
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:46,480
popular and it was idiot uh it happens it happens just so often that people don't even fucking

1324
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:51,120
realize it's it's literally the it's it's probably the rule it's the rule it's the rule not the

1325
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:57,280
exception yeah it is it is so nobody even talks about it because it's so unremarkable so you

1326
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:02,160
hear the stories of oh this person was a surprise smash hit and they were like oh well i just do

1327
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:06,800
whatever i wanted to and everyone loved it and it's like oh so that's so that's how you get

1328
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:12,400
popular oh that's how you become a quote surprise splash hit smash hit like it's a surprise that

1329
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:18,080
they did that yeah despite not having any work in the industry before then oda was just drawing

1330
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:22,560
from the heart dude he wasn't you know he was just drawing for himself and just so happened to caught

02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:36,320
really is like really he still loves the ronnie kenshin guy he's yeah it's uh it's it's a real

1333
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:41,200
bummer i mean i understand feeling professional professional attitude towards him for getting

1334
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:46,960
your start in the industry uh the ronnie kenshin guy is a what's the ronnie kenshin guy is a

02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,800
kenshin guy and like he still is like yeah i love that guy like he's a great guy we're like we're

1338
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:08,720
like comrades you know i was like working for him was like the happiest time of my life

1339
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:14,880
and it's like i i get i get being grateful for the opportunity i if you like to work it under

1340
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:21,520
him like that's cool you should not you should not defend that guy far under him yeah yeah you

1341
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:27,200
know every every time like something kind of the only shonen i really like i'm up to usually i'm

1342
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:34,240
the most up to date with his like one piece that's the only one i read yeah yeah but like every but

1343
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:40,000
usually like that's the only shonen i'm getting like a lot of like frustration from and every time

1344
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,840
i have a problem with something in one piece or any shonen i always say to myself this shit never

1345
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:50,320
happens in hunter hunter this shit never fucking nothing ever happens in hunter hunter because the

1346
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:59,440
guy is he doesn't draw it um fuck you but also um what's up but wait hey you know what i hey you

1347
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:03,920
know what i love about one piece is that it'll finish one day is that it will ever be completed

1348
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:09,120
that's so cool hunter hunter hunter hunter is finished it's over oh really finished a while

1349
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:15,120
wait really it finished for me it's over for me like i like the the ending i wanted to happen

1350
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:21,280
and i'm like all right well i'm good when like when literally the two main characters go their

1351
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:26,720
separate ways that's where it ends and everything else is supplementary material for me got um

1352
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:32,000
that being said the reason why i brought that up is because um like someone pointed out that like

1353
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:37,200
out of all the out of all those mangakas who were still in support of raruni kenshin guy

1354
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:43,120
after the whole fucking pito shit came out uh two names that didn't pop up were uh kiritori

1355
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:48,400
yama and uh to with tagashi which is the guy from hunter hunter well that's nice and it's like all

1356
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:54,080
right that's pretty cool oh good thank god it's the ones who are for a good what about um good ones

1357
02:16:54,080 --> 02:17:02,000
what about miura was he was he like i don't know i don't know when did this happen it was a couple

1358
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,200
years ago so it might have been before he died it was back it was like it was a little bit before um

1359
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,760
yeah it was a little bit after the whole thing happened and people were like mangakas were like

1360
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:17,520
oh i stand with this guy i stand with the pito and it's unfortunate oh boy you know

1361
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:22,080
fucking also saw someone say something like oh another reason why no one fucks with western

1362
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:26,160
comics is because there's so much like sexual allegations among like people

1363
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:35,680
buddy acting like oda wasn't defend didn't defend a pedophile twice he defended two different

1364
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:42,160
pedophiles with the other the the um the torah dora guy no not torah dora um yeah tori tori kogai

1365
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:48,320
yeah um yeah i don't know the details but i know that oda is kind of a little bit

1366
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:56,080
yeah i don't know um it'd be like that i mean i guess i'm glad there's no allegations against

1367
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:03,360
oda like that would be very very oda if you if you're doing any funny business please get exposed

1368
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:11,760
after one day really yeah i i was in a i kind of had that thought like i remember um literally i

1369
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:18,720
think the the second week of january when um andrew callaham got exposed as like a sex past

1370
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:25,120
and there was all these allegations yeah i heard about that like a couple i i fucking he came to

1371
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:28,880
my city like the month before because he was doing like a tour where he was like there it was like a

1372
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:33,440
little show i didn't really hear like what he actually did it sounded like damn i wish i went

1373
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:39,760
before he got it sounded like it wasn't really anything that that bad it sounded like he um he

1374
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:47,120
was doing the he was really like coercing a lot of women to like give fine okay but to find i mean

1375
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:52,080
what doing the whole thing where like where like you're kind of begging for them to just say yes to

1376
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:58,720
give me sex and he apparently was doing this a lot a lot like cross country because he was that

1377
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,360
yeah a lot of girls came out and said yeah because he would he would do the thing where he was literally

1378
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:10,800
begging for them to consent and a lot of like girls have like evidence that they got dms of him

1379
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:16,400
doing this and a lot of people around them and even open so you're saying he so you're saying he

1380
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:23,520
asked for consent no not that he was okay there's like a difference between like oh do you want to

1381
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:28,000
have sex and she says no and that's over right that's the end of but what he was doing was they

1382
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,360
would say no but he would be like but please i really want he was basically doing the but i

1383
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:37,760
really want to have sex with you i really do please say he was doing like his version of that

1384
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:46,560
um sounds fine sounds fine actually sounds fine sounds i mean it's it's it's lame it sounds lame

1385
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:52,720
sounds like most girls would say no but it doesn't sound like a bad thing to do

1386
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:59,200
but then that's when they say no that's just sounds pathetic the end of it as then what

1387
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:07,920
is is not okay for guys to do that it's not it's not okay to to ask for sex i don't i don't

1388
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:13,920
understand no it's it's fine to ask but when they say like he they would say no and he would keep asking

1389
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:21,680
so like after they say no okay so they just say no again or they can just stop answering no but

1390
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:26,800
the problem is that they would even he would even ask again that's dumb that's like after the first

1391
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:32,160
no no that's not that's not really that's i mean that it's annoying it might be annoying

1392
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:41,600
oh man that's not that's not a good is it is this like in dms like and stuff it was in person it was

1393
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:47,920
in dms he would do this in person it's bad it's in person it might be in person it might be bad if

1394
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:53,920
you i mean it would yeah it could be i think you could you could you could do it in a way you could

1395
02:20:53,920 --> 02:21:01,840
do it in a way that is that is potentially uh coercive or or something yeah sure it i mean it

1396
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:06,400
is coercion i mean it's like pathetic jeez what you're doing what you're doing okay look i don't

1397
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:09,920
know i don't know the details what you're what you're just the the bare facts of what you're

1398
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:15,440
describing to me are simply not coercion like asking repeatedly is not coercion there may there

1399
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:19,120
might there might be detail there might be details that make it coercion on top of that

1400
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:25,680
i i think that it was all in the effort to no not that i think i know it's like it was all

1401
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:30,480
in the effort to ultimately get sex even though they said like no of course it was to get sex

1402
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:36,800
yes i understand that he was asking for sex repeatedly how am i i i can't believe them

1403
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:41,200
it's a totally i'm not saying it's cool or good i'm just saying like

1404
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:48,080
i'm saying it's atrocious it's atrocious it's it's atrocious to ask

1405
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:55,440
repeatedly for sex yeah after they said no it's the same person yeah it's don't do that that's

1406
02:21:55,440 --> 02:22:00,320
that's not good that's awful it's atrocious they already said no it's can't it's cancel worthy

1407
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:06,880
yeah you don't do especially if you're doing this from state to state with like different women

1408
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:11,520
who cares who oh oh he did it with different women oh he would what are you talking about

1409
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:14,560
oh you definitely can't do it with different women what are you talking about

1410
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:20,000
now i'm not saying he can't have sex i'm saying it's how you he's how he got the sex that's awful

1411
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:27,440
that's like no that's not a good thing to do that i listen what stopped the women if they said no

1412
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:34,160
and then he said but i really want to what stop them from simply saying no again or simply not

1413
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:39,280
responding i mean okay listen we can't we can't we can't talk we i can't speak to like how he acted

1414
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:44,960
in person there he could have acted in a way that was threatening or or or something like that's

1415
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:49,520
possible but in dms if he says i want to have sex with him and she says no and then he sends a sense

1416
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:56,400
of but he says but please can i though why did she why is it coercion then is she what stops her

1417
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:02,720
from simply saying i said no or not answering it it's it's it doesn't look good on andrew if he

1418
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:08,080
doesn't it doesn't look good but why what's what's what's i i mean i get that it's not cool

1419
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:12,880
it's they say no that's that's it like in the like in person when they said no like that's

1420
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:20,000
that's it but if you keep like asking for it says says who then it says who he says the women the

1421
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:25,600
one accusing the women accusing him of asking multiple times why didn't if if you at what what

1422
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:30,320
stop you don't seem to understand what i'm asking what stopped them from simply saying

1423
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:34,960
no again or just not answering him you don't have to answer a text

1424
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:41,680
there's there's i obviously i feel like there's because it's happened a couple months ago

1425
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:46,880
there's probably details and i'm forgetting that like really like pain a better it will like a

1426
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:52,800
worse well maybe there are well maybe there are ultimately i i remember at the time i the details

1427
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:58,480
of it i remember being kind of maybe maybe if i read maybe if i read the text the details of it

1428
02:23:58,480 --> 02:24:07,440
would be would like yeah it would be bothersome coercion is like a specific thing right i mean

1429
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:13,200
it's i mean there's different forms it can take it's not it's not just a yeah but like it's it's

1430
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:18,080
like similar enough to blackmail like there's a reason they couldn't just say no or block him or

1431
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:23,760
like if he was stalking them if he was harassing them like is it is it harassment there's like

1432
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:28,720
there's a couple of i remember there was a couple other like details about this thing

1433
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:34,800
all i all i know is that he got a lot of he got a pretty awful reputation and a lot of like like

1434
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:38,960
seeing i mean if you i mean if you're if you're if you're whiny would label the guy as like someone

1435
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:44,240
to like if you someone to like watch out if you're if you're whiny and annoying and you beg for sex

1436
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:50,400
what's yeah what you're gonna get a reputation that like you're you're pathetic and like avoid

1437
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:59,360
this guy uh uh and i mean i yeah i mean i'm just telling you that at the time when it came out

1438
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:06,960
and people were like didn't like like like what he did sure he was dropped by the the freaking like

1439
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:12,240
production company that he was a part of like he has like he has like no career now is that true

1440
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:17,360
is that is that true yeah he has well well like i mean obviously he's probably just gonna take a

1441
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:21,280
break and he's willing to come back i mean i would if maybe if i maybe i would read

1442
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:24,480
maybe if i read all the details and i read all the dms i would be like

1443
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:35,040
that's an unacceptable way to behave but i don't know the the sim the simple fact of asking repeatedly

1444
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:39,440
for sex and she says no and then you ask again like just just does not strike me as like a

1445
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:46,800
particularly offensive crime in and of itself really no not at all not at all well it's cringe

1446
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:52,320
but like it doesn't it doesn't go into the in the realms of like criminality there's obviously

1447
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:57,760
there's worse i know there's obviously worse crimes but i mean it's all it's it's it's it's

1448
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,840
just annoying i don't even it's pretty awful actually it's it's it's it's merely it's merely

1449
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:08,240
annoying i i don't even know if it's it was just i would say it's more than just annoying that he

1450
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:12,720
like was doing this that he was like repeating i don't know i think your values for the same people

1451
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:18,720
was what you know what it what if they say no they can they can't change their minds

1452
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:26,000
you but like do you think like in the like say yeah you could change your mind but like i

1453
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:32,800
i would assume change your mind like takes a minute you know if it's like in the same moment

1454
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:38,240
he just it's like i don't know it's like it's like you think it's like you think that by asking

1455
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:45,200
again he is somehow violating their consent well like it's like you're it's like you're not accepting

1456
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:53,920
their no well i mean maybe but if they if if it's still okay but if it's still a no the if they

1457
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:59,440
ask again and you said no the first time and it's still a no one no should be enough one one no

1458
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:05,120
should be well maybe it well maybe it should be but i think it's all there's no there's nothing

1459
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,840
there's nothing about there's nothing about asking again that has any any power to make your

1460
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:19,200
no into a yes unless you want it to unless you want it to be you can you can ask again yeah

1461
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:26,880
this fine but i think like later when like you know there's like like maybe later in a different

1462
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:32,240
time but i don't think if you already said no to not having sex with someone i don't think you're

1463
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:38,000
gonna change your mind like in the next two seconds well i don't like to lay down well i don't

1464
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:44,960
like to lay down hard rules for social interaction like if if they say no then it's like it's it's

1465
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:51,680
never it's it's never there's never any reason why you might ask again like shortly i mean maybe

1466
02:27:51,680 --> 02:28:00,000
there might be like you could ask again but i'm as a habit as a habitual thing i i think it sounds

1467
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,880
it sounds annoying it sounds needy it sounds clingy it sounds desperate and and pathetic

1468
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:14,480
but it doesn't it doesn't rise to the level of coercion unless there are other elements to it

1469
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:20,240
all right i guess that's all i guess that's we've been we've been over this same loop of

1470
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:30,160
couple of times now uh oh boy fuck you fuck you who boy fuck you who boy who boy ben that's a

1471
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:36,560
cause spicy take don't ask don't don't say please if she says no don't say please afterwards

1472
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:44,960
though if you ask someone for their nudes and then they say no and then like you're always say like

1473
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:53,440
okay oh but please but i really but i really want them though but i really want them i mean

1474
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:58,160
listen that's not what i would do i my strategy well i didn't want your dirty disgusting nudes

1475
02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:01,520
anyway they probably wouldn't even be flattering you probably can't even take a decent picture if

1476
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:09,200
your life depended on it ugly and then she said fuck you i'll show i'll show you i'll oh okay the

1477
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:13,840
the ben the ben saint strategy works every time works every time

1478
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:19,520
and if it doesn't work the first time i just do it again immediately and it would always

1479
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:26,480
works the second time there's no response that you say hey by the way um i won't like it if you

1480
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:30,720
send nudes i would i say just letting you know that i would hate and then i look and there's no

1481
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:34,800
response five minutes later i'm back to texting okay well you're really ugly and you're really

1482
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:40,000
stupid and you have daddy issues and you have blue hair and communist and you're probably woke

1483
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,760
and you probably read manga even though western comics are dying and it's all your fault you're

1484
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:50,800
killing the industry uh and and i'll let you know how it goes i'm still i'm still going i'm still

02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:22,800
and stole my rice cooker and now i can't make my green lentils that's terrible do you think it was

1508
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:30,560
maybe a giant rat yeah well it probably wasn't the regular rats it wasn't the regular rat if you will

1509
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:34,880
the regular rats aren't that big no they didn't even take they didn't even take the whole thing

1510
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:41,440
they didn't take the lid or the interior pot they just took the exterior like mechanism of the rice

1511
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:46,720
cooker which is useless it's useless on its own but they just i i guess they just took it

1512
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:56,800
and walked out and um yeah yeah some some our house got invaded check a local pawn shop they

1513
02:32:56,800 --> 02:33:02,640
probably pawned it off i wonder if there even are any local pawn shops there's probably a

1514
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:08,880
bunch around here is it worth like calling the police and reporting stone i know i mean the

1515
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:13,200
all police is gonna do is check local pawn shops if i even if they if they gave a shit that's

1516
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:19,280
important i mean the right the rice cooker is literally worth 20 on amazon so it's not even

1517
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:27,280
worth reporting a theft it's just unsettling that that happens you should set up a shotgun to go off

1518
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:34,320
when the door opens we set up a um we set up a plan we set up c4 in the in the doorway we set up a

1519
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:39,360
camera we set up someone someone set up a camera in the kitchen that i guess you can look at through

1520
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:45,120
an app or something i'm not gonna look at it i don't care um but maybe someone if it happens again

1521
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:57,200
maybe i'll check the footage uh fucking i don't know wish wish that didn't happen but i guess what

1522
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:04,080
can you do well i wish i did not get robbed hot take i mean i wish i still had my rice cooker

1523
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:10,800
i guess i gotta buy another one well then first they might have it then think about this think

1524
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:15,760
about how if i go to the person is they've stolen your rice they were probably happy to steal most

1525
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:21,760
of a rice cooker than i was to have that piece of the rice cooker imagine how happy they were from

1526
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:27,680
the money they got from pining off your rice the eight dollars they probably got for it imagine

1527
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:32,480
how much meth they got off with eight dollars dude like come on they're probably happier they

1528
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:38,080
they know a bless you can never never feel imagine just like walking into somebody i mean we said

1529
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:43,840
we all said okay we got to keep the door locked for now on uh i i like never locked the door

1530
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:50,720
but i guess i guess i gotta start locking my door uh i wonder if there are any pawn shops near me

1531
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:58,240
hang on let me let me find out maps google maps pawn shops

1532
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:11,600
yeah there's um there's one there's one oh there you go boom start

1533
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:20,640
uh yeah i mean i guess start of your um detective journey there's i mean there's one kind there's

1534
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:25,280
one pretty close to me that i honestly could probably walk to in like half an hour and there's

1535
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:32,960
a couple more like it more like in the city um i don't know it's not even worth it it's not even

1536
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:37,440
it's not even worth it just fucking go just buy another one on amazon

1537
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:45,360
so you get rows then there's like crackhead sees it as like oh in this house they keep respawning

1538
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:50,640
there's a respawning rice cooker it's eight the eight dollars every single time

1539
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,760
respawning rice cooker glitch found in ben's house

1540
02:35:56,240 --> 02:36:00,000
oh she put c4 in the next recipe cooker

1541
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:07,440
you should coat it inside i there's there's there's there's just there's just nothing

1542
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:17,120
wait a minute what remember how i did all that weird chemistry stuff to boil down all the the

1543
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:23,920
quinine oh you can make you can make a crack and then attract the crackhead and then you kill them

1544
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:29,920
what would actually be much more like easy way to do that would be if i if i use that rice cooker

1545
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:35,840
the rice cooker is designed to cook off all the water and only leave and and stop cooking when

1546
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:39,680
there's when the water is gone so that would actually be a really useful thing to like be

1547
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:48,480
cooking down a solution hmm i didn't think about that oh just got another twitch follower

1555
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:59,280

1557
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:09,360

1558
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:20,000
i hate you uh sweet this is gonna be great uh who cares who cares about people just genuinely

1559
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:26,560
genuinely enjoying the content true all right that's enough

1560
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:34,240
someone said someone said you will never get half a million views on your mega man video lol

1561
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:39,280
but i'm yeah i saw that but i'm actually really i'm actually i i think it's a joke

1562
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:44,080
i think it's like a joke like the meme of like the guy eating breakfast and then the second

1563
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:48,400
panel he spits it out because he's proven wrong i i think it's it has to be a joke because i'm

1564
02:38:48,400 --> 02:38:53,120
obviously am going to hit a half a million if they're doing that joke the guy doesn't laugh he's

1565
02:38:53,120 --> 02:39:00,160
like dead pan when he says huh that'll never happen yeah you know you don't put a lull at the end

1566
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:06,800
you fucked up yeah but yeah botch delivery i didn't quite get it but like that it can't he can't

1567
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:13,760
genuinely think that i won't hit it like i certainly will i'm like i'm like less than 20 k i'm like 20

1568
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:19,840
k away so i mean he doesn't know about the third wave he doesn't know that the third wind is hitting

1569
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:26,320
right now so he might think that maybe it has stalled out not not the case is we might we've

1570
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:32,000
got life we've got life left in these in these old bones yesterday was like a big day yesterday was

1571
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:37,200
the i think i've got like eight or nine k views on that video just yesterday which is more than

1572
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:42,240
i've gotten since like that's more views than in one day than i've gotten since the video was like

1573
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:47,760
new although today does not look like it's quite as explosive someone was uh someone was talking

1574
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:54,320
about you somewhere maybe was a gino you're talking about gino samuel um do you think that's why

1575
02:39:55,200 --> 02:40:00,480
i the views jump because everyone's like oh who's this ben saint character i mean the video

1576
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:08,240
it i don't think so because it's just the mega man video that got the views like the other other

1577
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:14,800
videos did not see a spike although it is weird that like yeah yesterday was like a had like was

1578
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:20,640
like a spike within a spike and gino samuel release spike spike spike and gino samuel yeah

1579
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:27,840
gino samuel release the new thing which goes into like the slime stuff which is very funny i wish

1580
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:37,280
damn i wish i had i mean i it's better to release phantom's revenge after that is out and people

1581
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:42,160
have heard about that but it would have been even better to have had the campaign running

1582
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:48,480
when he made that video and announced it but oh well you know what can you do

1583
02:40:50,480 --> 02:40:56,960
what can you do what can you do nothing uh so many things can be planned out so much better

1584
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:06,320
true right and you know every hindsight is 2020 2023

1585
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:13,360
2020 12 when we all really died after this has been fake i want my green lentils

1588
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:36,160

1590
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:43,600

1591
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:52,720
good trick you ever um you ever done a bacon wrapped rice balls before no but i did have uh

1592
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:59,600
someone cook uh it was they made spam they fried spam in sesame oil and they put that on like the

1593
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:03,280
bottom of a rice ball almost like like a sashimi that was really good

1594
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:11,760
that was held i've had i've made bacon wrapped Brussels sprouts that's really good that's a

1595
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:17,280
way i did um i did my second attempt at orange chicken a couple nights ago it was uh probably my

1596
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:23,920
best so far but i said i've not perfected it sounds that sounds tough yeah because i'm

1597
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:29,760
well kind of fucked me up is making the homemade sauce i uh i i took the baby way out and i bought

1598
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:36,160
a bottle of like the pan to express orange chicken sauce and um all i did what it is like

1599
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:41,280
after i like fried the chicken a little bit i like eat it up some of the sauce on a pan and i

1600
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:47,440
put the chicken on it and i coated in it and um it tastes it tastes good but it could always be

1601
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:57,680
better is it crispy yeah it was crispy um let me um oh hey i won't have one last thing

1602
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:04,080
that i want to mention this week this is really funny i was asking i was asking chat gpt some

1603
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:13,040
stuff actually the reason i started uh the the first thing i asked chat gpt was i i asked it

1604
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:18,000
whether making the blue rays was ethical that was the first quest set of question i asked yeah

1605
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:24,400
it said what did they say it did it said no it's but here's the thing here's the thing

1606
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:31,840
i i explained the situation to it and i asked it like can like it did it said no

1607
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:39,680
uh it sort of said like yes i acknowledged that like yes these are problems like yes the

1608
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:44,000
artist should have delivered on their work however you know it's you know it's not it's not uh

1609
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:50,240
one must be careful of like ethical the legal the it said it wasn't ethical and it wasn't legal

1610
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:54,960
i think it was just really hung up on the fact that like i think it was just really hung up on

1611
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:59,520
the fact that like it's technically copyright infringement and therefore it's like it's illegal

1612
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:03,600
i think i think it's just a fucking narc and it's just obsessed with rules and it'll end

1613
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:08,800
it only and it only knows how to operate by like there's no there's no room for lateral thinking

1614
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:15,840
and there's no room for like oh but like what about what about what about uh what's the word um uh uh

1615
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:20,560
extenuating circumstances it just it just wasn't thinking like that so yeah it said no

1616
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:26,640
but like fuck jet gpt it's a narc uh but anyway after that i asked it about the pcp

1617
02:44:27,440 --> 02:44:33,280
and i think gibby probably saw my post i i asked it about like who what is the procrastinators

1618
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:40,560
podcast and then i asked it who are the members of the procrastinators podcast and um here i'll

1628
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:59,920
they've all appeared in a radcon so then i so then i asked it uh so gib you didn't see these

1629
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:08,480
i saw that i like um nate talks to you i think i asked it i asked it about nate it thinks that

1630
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:12,800
natan best guy ever nate talks to you and best guy ever two different guys and it thinks that best

1631
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:20,880
guy ever is this like german soccer player named jonathan berghardt oh yeah so so i asked it who

1632
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:25,520
ben saint is and it said that i won't read this whole thing but it said ben saint is an animator

1633
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:32,160
and the creator of the animated series munchie minute and then i asked and then i asked it tell

1634
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:38,560
me about some episodes of the munchie minute and uh it said oh yeah munchie minute is a series of

1635
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:45,280
short comedic animated sketches episodes include crash bandicoot breaks the law ben shepiro destroys

1636
02:46:45,280 --> 02:46:54,160
the snowman egg boys and nuclear fusion dance i asked it for some more but the next set wasn't as good

1637
02:46:54,320 --> 02:47:02,320
um my favorite here is jupiro destroys the snowman in which ben shepiro attempts to use logic and

1638
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:11,600
reason to destroy snowman and then um so i and it ends in ends in a in a in a comedic twist ending

1639
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:17,600
so then i asked it explain the comedic twist ending of uh of ben shepiro destroys the snowman

1640
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:22,080
and the plot of ben shepiro destroys the snowman is he attempts to use logic and reason to prove

1641
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:27,840
that the snowman does not have rights and then the comedic twist ending is that it turns out

1642
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:36,000
it was all happening inside a snow globe which is very very funny and good and cool i i wonder why

1643
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:41,680
i am imagining the reason is like they came up with ben shepiro destroys the snowman is because

1644
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:47,840
of like special snowflakes maybe you're just a you're just a big collection of snowflakes maybe

1645
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:55,840
sort of possibly villain ben shepiro i don't know it's hard to say um i i asked it so i mean i i love

1646
02:47:55,840 --> 02:48:01,360
this i pardon pardon me want pardon me wants to yeah pardon me wants to make like munchy minute

1647
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:10,720
episode one ben shepiro destroys the snowman just because of this prompt um but um i i asked it about

1648
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:17,120
who is munchy and it said munchy is not a person he is only like the the munchy and munchy minute

1649
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:21,600
simply refers to the food related themes that are often prevalent in the munchy minute

1650
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:26,480
also munchy is the co-creator of the munchy minute and he is an important person involved in like the

1651
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:33,200
in the in the creation of the series it's like okay but he's also the co-creator he's not a real

1652
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:38,000
person but he's also the co-creator of the series and then i asked it that the fourth episode called

1653
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:42,560
nuclear fusion dance it got i asked it about the plot of nuclear fusion dance and it got really

1654
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:49,920
it basically said okay in nuclear fusion dance two characters like kyle and trevor try to do the

1655
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:54,640
dragon ball z fusion dance and they fuse but it doesn't go right yeah it leads to unexpected

1656
02:48:54,640 --> 02:49:00,160
consequences so i asked it okay what are the unexpected consequences and it said that they

1657
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:04,800
merged together into like a big like disgusting flesh monster and then they rampaged through the

1658
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:10,800
town uh but then they worked together to defeat it and i'm like wait a second so i asked it like

1659
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:15,120
with chat gpt what do you mean they work together to defeat it aren't they the monster because they

1660
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:21,440
fuse together into it and it's like yes sorry for any any any confusion they fuse together into the

1661
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:28,160
monster and then they have to work together kyle uses his his intelligence to strategize

1662
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:32,880
while trevor uses his physical prowess to perform martial arts maneuvers against the monster

1663
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:38,400
and thus they defeat they defeat the monster and i'm like no chat gpt hang aren't they fused

1664
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:45,120
together into the monster and it's like sorry sorry for the confusion they have to work together to

1665
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:51,440
perform strategic maneuvers to get the monster to defuse so that then they can defeat it and i said

1666
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:57,280
what do you mean what strategic maneuvers do they do and they said sorry sorry for the confusion um

1667
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:02,720
yeah you see they they they they they strategy they have to get they have to perform the fusion

1668
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:08,240
dance again and that makes the monster defuse so that they can fight how do they perform the

1669
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:13,920
fusion dance again if they're fused into the monster instead sorry sorry they had to desync

1670
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:21,040
they had to desync their behavior so much that the fusion came apart and then once they were taken

1671
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:26,960
apart then they could do the fusion dance and that caused the monster to defuse and so that they

1672
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:32,960
could defeat it and like okay okay and that i gave up at that point i'm like it doesn't understand

1673
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:40,240
the concept of the fusion dance um but that i thought that was pretty great uh i had a very

1674
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:49,440
had a very uh uh very laughs aplenty laughs aplenty from chat gpt um there was a chat gpt episode

1675
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:55,440
of south park actually was the last one really yeah and it was pretty funny because the the joke was

1676
02:50:55,520 --> 02:51:04,720
that um uh stan's girlfriend wendy did not um she didn't like that stan wouldn't really like

1677
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:09,600
dm her back or talk talk to her like she would send him a message and all he would do would

1678
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:15,280
like reply with a thumbs up emoji tell her messages right and because that wendy was like

1679
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:21,040
was threatening stan that she was gonna break up with him and stan hears the rumors that um

1680
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:27,120
he wants his name i forget the name of the other there's another kid who who probably he's

1681
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:36,160
not kyle um token now i think it's heart right craig maybe okay uh maybe oh no it's not craig

1682
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:41,280
because craig is like i forget the other name of the there's like another kid who's kind of like

1683
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:47,680
who's considered popular ken among the boys okay that being said this kid like apparently he's

1684
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:52,400
always gives the best messages ever to his girlfriend and stan asks him like what's your

1685
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:59,840
secret man and he's all like chat gpt so basically what he does is that he like gets chat gpt to come

1686
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:04,560
up with replies for the stuff his girlfriend sends him he just copy and paste what the replies are

1687
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:09,600
back to his girlfriend and his girlfriend eats it up his girlfriend thinks it's really him so stan

1688
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:15,520
started doing that to wendy so every time wendy sends him a dms he just like copies and replies

1689
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:20,480
and like gets chat bt to like come over reply then he copy and paste it back into

1690
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:29,280
oh god i bet i bet i bet guys are like i bet guys are making like chat gpt write me like a good

1695
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:57,040
nudes that's what i want i wanted to be interested but i do not want the news how do i how do i make

1696
02:52:57,040 --> 02:53:06,240
this happen all jabby chat gpt would say like hey bitch fuck hey negam just just negam just negam

1697
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:14,800
uh she definitely won't fucking send you nudes and she definitely will not if you listen if you if

1698
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:23,920
no nudes is your goal i have the solution for you um i know the guy i know a guy i know i know a guy

1699
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:29,760
who can get you absolutely zero news for free his name is ben sake

1700
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,560
oh you don't want you don't want nudes i don't just the guy

1701
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:49,200
anyway the episode the episode of south park ends with um like so apparently um like kids are also

1702
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:55,120
using the chat gpt to come up with like essays for a class you know for you know so they don't have

1703
02:53:55,120 --> 02:54:02,880
to do homework and um one of the one of the like supervising teachers realizes that um oh that's

1704
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:08,480
not good so there's a guy that they hire who could check to see if any of any of the essays are written

1705
02:54:08,480 --> 02:54:14,240
by ai and the guy that they that shows up is like a like looks like a weird shaman guy who lives in

1706
02:54:14,240 --> 02:54:20,560
the woods and he has like a pet hawk like he's like anti technology and he um and he basically

1707
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:25,840
uses his little shaman stick because he could detect like who's using ai with his shaman stick

1708
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:32,320
and apparently they pinpoint it to stan's girlfriend because she has a bunch of ai messages

1709
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:38,080
in her dms and this is what this this guy is like finding and stan is like oh no if um she finds out

1710
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:43,440
about the ai messages i'm fucked i'm gonna break out with me but then stan comes up with a brilliant

1711
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:52,320
idea he goes back to chat gpt and he says um chat gpt tell me a story about a guy named stan who's

1712
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:57,520
been using chat gpt messages to like light his girlfriend and the story has to end with him

1713
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:04,480
still being with his girlfriend and not having to tell her the truth about it and um and and then

1714
02:55:04,480 --> 02:55:10,240
and then the the last like the last like three minutes of the episode is literally like a script

1715
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:15,840
that chat gpt wrote for the ending of that episode where stan still ends up with his girlfriend even

1716
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:21,920
though he he comes out with the truth about the ai and then when the episode ends it says episode

1717
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:28,720
written by trey parker and chat gpt chat gpt that's funny yeah that's funny okay so i asked chat gpt

1718
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:32,880
i asked chat gpt to write me a good opening line to send to a girl i matched with on tinder but

1719
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:38,480
write it so she won't send me any nudes chat gpt says sure here's a friendly and respectful

1720
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:43,360
opening line that should avoid any unwanted requests for nudes hey there i couldn't help but

1721
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:48,240
notice we share a love for insert common interest from her bio or photos would you be interested

1722
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:53,600
in grabbing a coffee or drink sometime and chatting more about it and i said no i want to make sure

1723
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:58,560
she won't send me nudes and chat gpt said my apologies for misunderstanding your request

1724
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:02,960
earlier here's a suggestion for an opening line that conveys your intention and sets a clear

1725
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:07,920
boundary while still being respectful hey i'm really enjoying chatting with you so far but

1726
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:13,200
just wanted to make it clear that i'm not interested in receiving any explicit photos hope that's okay

1727
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:20,080
with you i'm just gonna drop that in a casual conversation the conversation's going well we're

1728
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:24,160
hitting it off yeah we're thinking of maybe a first date hey i'm really enjoying chatting with you

1729
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:28,320
but i just want to make it clear i'm not interested in receiving any explicit photos i hope that's

1730
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:34,480
okay with you you know i wonder okay i wonder i wonder if that would actually pique interest

1731
02:56:34,480 --> 02:56:41,520
because it's like hey this guy is telling me not to send him nudes he must he must get too many

1732
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:46,000
nudes he must be so drowning and pussy that he simply gets too many nudes all the time and he's

1733
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:51,280
sick of them this must be a high value alpha male and he doesn't want to see my nudes because

1734
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:54,960
he doesn't want to see my nudes exactly what they'll say knows that they're not good enough

1735
02:56:54,960 --> 02:57:02,000
because i'm not good enough for him but but i will prove him wrong this is the this is the

1736
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,760
concept this is why i say all right cheesy you're gonna hate this you're gonna hate this

1737
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:15,440
the the the pick up the pickup artist community is unfairly maligned because oh okay some of the

1738
02:57:15,440 --> 02:57:19,680
norm because okay there's really bad guys there's really bad guys that pedal really bad stuff in

1739
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:23,920
there but if you read just like bad guys on both sides but if there's bad guys on both sides but

1740
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:28,560
if you read the normal books about it if you read like the mainstream most popular books about it

1741
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:34,640
the stuff they tell you to do is actually really normal and one of the and one of the things that

1742
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:39,600
people don't like is the idea of a neg which is like which people think that negging a girl means

1743
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:45,120
insulting her and if you read the books if you read like like the the big book or the art of the game

1744
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:50,080
or whatever it's called it makes it very clear that no a neg is not just an insulting a girl

1745
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:56,160
it's just something that you do or say that simply makes it clear to her that you are not overly

1746
02:57:56,160 --> 02:58:01,200
interested in her and something and an example that it gives is like blowing your nose just to

1747
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:06,400
make it like you you you you're not you don't care if she sees you blowing your nose you're not like

1748
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:10,160
hung up on she's like oh we gotta make a really good impression because i'm so invested in in this

1749
02:58:10,160 --> 02:58:16,000
interaction right so this is a perfect neg perfect neg hey i'm really enjoying chatting with jafar

1750
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:19,440
just wanted to make it clear that i'm not interested in receiving any explicit photos

1751
02:58:19,440 --> 02:58:24,160
hope that's okay with you that tells her that i have that i'm a high value male that tells her

1752
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:28,560
that she's not good enough for me that's gonna get the juices flowing she's gonna she's gonna soak

02:58:29,280 --> 02:58:38,560
her panties soaked and dropped it's over it's over thank you gbt you've changed everything for me

anything else what else what else we're doing what else what else is going on

1781
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:54,640
dudes uh i'm playing kids i'm playing more out of wilds again that's fun

1782
03:01:56,560 --> 03:01:59,600
yeah you were you were damning me about that cheesy have you played out of wilds

1783
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:06,400
i've heard about it you know you know what it's about you're in space and stuff it is about space

1784
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:12,800
and stuff and gravity of the little orbital the planets do gravity on you in a realistic

1785
03:02:13,360 --> 03:02:20,000
enough fashion they sure do they really do be doing gravity though it's really fun it's really

1786
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:25,040
fun just flying out somewhere and being like oh shit i'm in an i'm in like a collision course

1787
03:02:25,040 --> 03:02:31,280
with the sun and that's no good and then you die i actually got really one of the most frustrating

1788
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:36,400
parts was like just just when you would be like you would die and then be like oh i got to get

1789
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:41,760
back to wherever i was going and then just the way it worked out getting back there meant going

1790
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:46,400
around the sun but you would like try cut it too close and you'd fall in that happened like so many

1791
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:52,400
so many times but it's on me it's on me for not planning my route more carefully there's this

1792
03:02:52,400 --> 03:03:01,840
one thing i tried i tried not putting my spacesuit on because some planets have oxygen um and i can't

1793
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:10,400
remember what i did i got on my ship and then i flew to somewhere where did i fly oh doesn't it

1794
03:03:10,480 --> 03:03:15,120
doesn't the deep doesn't the giants deep have oxygen it does but only on the islands if you're

1795
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:21,280
in the water you instantly drown which is funny right not instantly um well it's funny how like

1796
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:29,040
yeah you you're in the water presumably you still have an oxygen supply when you're under the water

1797
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:34,880
not if you don't have your suit on that's what i mean oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but i can't

1798
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:38,320
talk about what i was going to talk about because this contains too many spoilers

1799
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:46,080
um now i got you nice but there was a cool thing i did and then i died and it was funny

1800
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:51,920
also the echoes of the idlc i finally i'm finally looking into that because the version i played

1801
03:03:51,920 --> 03:04:00,080
before was on like xbox live like whatever and it didn't have the dlc and i finished that that xbox

1802
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:06,720
live um like month that i got for free and then i bought the game on steam and it had the dlc

1803
03:04:06,720 --> 03:04:13,040
you know i'm trying that and it's very scary very scary and i'm scared it seems a little scary

1804
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:19,600
i'm not i don't think i'm into it i'm a little too scared i am a little too i am a little too

1805
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:25,040
scared and also it doesn't really involve much like space stuff which is kind of disappointing

1806
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:31,280
which is the real scary part it's that's the i i appreciate that they tried to do a different

1807
03:04:31,280 --> 03:04:36,640
kind of stuff of stuff in their engine i just it's kind of not what appealed to me about the

1808
03:04:36,640 --> 03:04:41,040
core game so i've sort of like found it a little disappointing that that's what they did with it

1809
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:50,560
i mean what i'm enjoying so far is just that it's a new a different set of mysteries to solve

1810
03:04:50,560 --> 03:04:57,120
like i don't know nothing about all this this extra i don't like how scary it is i don't like

1811
03:04:57,120 --> 03:05:02,640
how scary it is i haven't actually got to a jump scare yet i'm just exploring but when i got there

1812
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:08,880
for the first time the thing is like they have in the menu by the way the echoes of the iadlc

1813
03:05:08,880 --> 03:05:15,680
may be maybe too much for some uh gamers go into the options and turn down the scary factor and

1814
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:20,560
i'm like don't tell me about that don't you've already ruined it now yeah yeah yeah it did

1815
03:05:20,560 --> 03:05:27,120
yeah it terrified me i bet it's not even that bad but that made me so i was so nervous about it

1816
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:31,120
because it felt the need to warn me that i'm like i don't even want to i don't even want to do it

1817
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:35,920
i don't even want to see it i'm i'm going in though i'm gonna go in i'm gonna pee my pants

1818
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:39,120
i'm gonna scream and then i'm gonna go to the menu i'm gonna turn down the stairs

1819
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:43,520
but i'm not gonna do them down yet i want to see what it what it you're going in p mode you're

1820
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:49,360
going in p mode first first thing right off the bat oh congratulations hey hey gamer are you a little

1821
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:56,000
baby bitch too scared of a little video game yes the baby mode in this i know i am baby i mean

1822
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:03,280
there's parts of the main game that are so scary that i hate them oh yeah yeah yeah even the main

1823
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:11,040
game has some what you might consider jump scares yeah they are so bad and i am so scared and but

1824
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:17,680
it's like best game ever but it's it is the best game ever it's so scary the bramble is really like

1825
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:23,920
it's rough it's really rough going in the bramble um sometimes i literally have to like

1826
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:28,960
just close my eyes when i know something is gonna kill me i in outer wiles is like this is not going

1827
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:37,040
to work out fuck it i'll uh close my eyes then i eventually kind of just got sort of like used

1828
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:43,520
to what happens in the bramble that it's sort of just i got numb to it uh although if i probably

1829
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:49,200
booted up again it's been long enough that i probably would have to re re but i just but i just kept

1830
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:54,240
hey re but i just kept happening over and over again so many times that finally it lost it lost

1831
03:06:54,240 --> 03:06:59,200
its sting a little bit but never completely it's still like really you hate you hate it every

1832
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:07,120
single time and another thing i've been playing recently is subnautica i've gone back into that

1833
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:12,880
and that is similarly the scariest game ever but it's yeah for similar probably for similar reasons

1834
03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:18,880
yeah i played subnautica before i played out played outer worlds and subnautica is like you're in the

1835
03:07:18,880 --> 03:07:26,080
ocean and you're trying to survive and there are lots of very good sound design scary scary

1836
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:31,600
sounds of big huge leviathan beasts far off in the distance that you can't see because the ocean is

1837
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:38,560
like blurry and you feel like you're gonna get eaten at any point moment all the time yeah i the idea

1838
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:44,080
of like being floating in like water and like you look down and down below you is just like

1839
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:51,680
void and like something might come up out of it is like the scariest thing yeah i like i i'm i'm

1840
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:56,960
like in the shallow areas i don't know if i could handle subnautica at the beginning you're in you

1841
03:07:56,960 --> 03:08:03,040
usually land in an area near in the same sort of place every time you play and it's like a

1842
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:08,480
shallowish area with coral reefs and stuff and you can explore caves there but then you go out

1843
03:08:08,480 --> 03:08:14,080
a little bit and then there's this big long trench this huge and you have to go like a hundred meters

1844
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:21,760
down i think and it's like if i were oh i think if i were floating above some kind of underwater

1845
03:08:21,760 --> 03:08:32,480
chasm and i would be so scared to look down and then if i did look down and if something was like

1846
03:08:32,480 --> 03:08:38,400
coming at me i think i it would be over it would be over if i look down and there was something

1847
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:43,680
there with its mouth open that would just be over for me oh yeah if i looked down to the void

1848
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:50,560
and i saw if i saw like a nude slowly come down yeah i would lose it if i looked into the void

1849
03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:59,920
void void void void void void these fish aren't wearing any clothes this is not like

1850
03:09:00,640 --> 03:09:10,160
this leviathan is is indecent uh but yeah um subnautica ocean uh when i played out a world

1851
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:15,120
to the first time and i got to giant steep giant steep is a little bit scary but it's not really

1852
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:19,680
that bad i thought i was gonna i thought i was gonna be way more scared of like the ocean in the

1853
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:24,880
giant steam i was like turned the game off like paralyzed by giant steep the first time i came

1854
03:09:24,880 --> 03:09:30,560
there because i i landed in the ocean because it's mostly an ocean planet yeah and i saw some

1855
03:09:30,560 --> 03:09:36,640
stuff below me and i was like i know what subnautica is like i am going to be eaten by a giant fish

1856
03:09:36,640 --> 03:09:44,880
immediately i'm so scared i had to pause i had to leave my room i i when i got to giant steep i was

1857
03:09:44,880 --> 03:09:48,960
i think the first couple times maybe the first time i just swam around the surface and i was just

1858
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:53,600
like i'm not looking down i'm not looking down i'm not looking down uh i think the second time i

1859
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:58,480
got there i was like god damn it i gotta do it and i just like didn't even think about it i just

1860
03:09:58,480 --> 03:10:02,320
like pushed my mouth i was like go just look down just dive just go go and i looked down and you

1861
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:07,120
know what's actually there is not especially unsettling so i was like okay it's fine now it's

1862
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:13,120
fine i it's it's the similar to two things it's like the exploration the unknown it's the fear of

1863
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:18,560
the unknown and the amazing sound design on both those games that really if as long as you as long

1864
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:24,160
as you have it as like max volume like normal like if you if you put it down really low sound

1865
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:31,680
when it's like barely there it affects you so much less yeah but um i like i like the immersion

1866
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:38,000
that it brings because it's like that's that's what i want i want to i want to i want to conquer

1867
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:43,280
this fear of the unknown of the ocean of space you're not playing you're not playing it in vr

1868
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:52,880
you're not playing in vr are you i do not have a vr set so i couldn't but i would never do that

1869
03:10:52,880 --> 03:10:58,720
that would be in sub nautica especially yeah that's the sort of thing because i oh my god

1870
03:10:59,440 --> 03:11:04,800
i don't play with headphones when i play with headphones it's so much scarier yeah i can only

1871
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:10,560
i can only the surround sound and it's like you hear like a little you hear like the the big

1872
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:16,560
booming like growls of certain fish and you know those growls are kind of like those of her before

1873
03:11:16,560 --> 03:11:20,400
is okay those ones are okay but then you hear a different one and it's very close and you're like

1874
03:11:20,400 --> 03:11:27,440
what i don't know this and you just you're you're you're put upon you're put upon by by fear

1875
03:11:28,240 --> 03:11:33,840
put upon put upon put upon put upon put upon put upon um yeah now that's what my heart's doing

1876
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:43,120
i uh it makes ooo love the leviathans of the deep make my kokoro go doki doki

1877
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:51,520
doki doki in a in a uh korae way or what do they say uh is that korae

1878
03:11:52,960 --> 03:12:01,200
i know sugoi koi is scary koi yeah it's not kawaii it's koi koi yeah kawaii yeah

1879
03:12:02,160 --> 03:12:10,400
japan japan yeah japan they done it again they make the best comics and more of them too

1880
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:16,160
the western market will never survive well good we're all gonna die we're all gonna die

1881
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:25,840
you know i um so i tuned into nate's talking pirate stream for a little bit uh the other day

1882
03:12:26,400 --> 03:12:32,720
i was i was i was shocked i was shocked by what i heard what did he say

1883
03:12:34,480 --> 03:12:37,600
i don't i don't are you talking about the the the sound board

1884
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:43,920
i was shocked by what i was hearing and maybe it's like a bit that i don't get

1885
03:12:44,800 --> 03:12:52,000
the guy does not seem to like one piece like what may yeah ever it seems like the attitude

1886
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:58,640
in there is like one piece is just is bad i mean that's how it's always it always was on like

1887
03:12:58,640 --> 03:13:06,720
uh the podcast nate would be super cynical and be hyper focused on anything he could find that was

1888
03:13:06,720 --> 03:13:14,400
slightly like potentially incorrect yeah yeah or like that's what it was how dare this you know

1889
03:13:14,400 --> 03:13:19,920
like he's he's ready and willing and able to shit all over one piece the second it like

1890
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:26,320
deviates from pre-established canon or implies something that he doesn't like

1891
03:13:26,960 --> 03:13:31,440
yeah and it's like i don't know like i guess he likes it and that's just how he likes it

1892
03:13:31,440 --> 03:13:37,600
it doesn't i mean it doesn't my i mean i came away from that stream being like i think i think he

1893
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:43,600
i don't even think he likes one piece i'm over here like one piece is literally the best it's

1894
03:13:43,600 --> 03:13:49,200
ever been and he's reading it and it's like i don't i don't know if it's a bit it seems almost

1895
03:13:49,200 --> 03:13:56,240
like a bit but he's just like oh the art all the art so the line are so sketchy oh bad uh oh does a

1896
03:13:56,240 --> 03:14:03,520
hack uh uh oh this this jinbei is like oh these these the the the freaking seraphim are too strong

1897
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:11,360
broken op oh uh uh oh does a hack uh sanji's eyebrow was swirling the wrong way and like this implies

1898
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:18,560
some weird shit about uh the the germa's thing the thing uh oh does a hack oh he broke his own rules

1899
03:14:18,560 --> 03:14:24,240
again uh huh oh but he said it but he said it was like this in the sbs but now it's like this in

1900
03:14:24,240 --> 03:14:30,640
this panel but only for one panel and it goes back why doesn't why doesn't odi give a fuck about

1901
03:14:30,640 --> 03:14:40,560
about his own work anymore this is why it's it's a very doomery like approach yeah i like he he

1902
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:45,840
sees like the inevitable demise of his favorite thing and he can't help but bring it into the

1903
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:51,520
like he's all the time it's like he sees it in every panel it's like he sees every page is like

1904
03:14:51,520 --> 03:15:00,560
here's the the decline continues and there it is uh i knew this would happen he says reading the

1905
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:05,440
best fucking chapter one piece ever had i knew this was gonna happen i knew this would happen as

1906
03:15:05,440 --> 03:15:11,760
well i've been dreading i've been dreading this day i i didn't get it i didn't get it that was always

1907
03:15:11,760 --> 03:15:17,760
the thing is that i would be the optimist and they would be the cynic we would balance each other

1908
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:23,920
out i guess people i think liked it you know what's better if you just have two people on one side

1909
03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:30,880
of the seesaw that's why we're such a good team give because we both just love one piece we both

1910
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:35,600
just uncritically love one piece and we'll just shovel down whatever slop oda puts on our on our

1911
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:46,000
bowl suck it down and say thank you yep you see oda he he he makes his see he makes his chapters

1912
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:52,160
of one piece bad on purpose right he makes them bad on purpose and the reader says no but any the

1913
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:57,120
reader says no i don't like this but then oda says please like my shitty one piece i made it bad on

1914
03:15:57,120 --> 03:16:02,880
purpose but but please would you read it and continue to buy my comics and they go oh i guess

1915
03:16:02,880 --> 03:16:07,600
i have to i guess i have to keep buying it even though it's bad now because he's because he asked

1916
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:15,360
me again um that's why he loves his pedophile friends so much they just have no they just don't

1917
03:16:15,360 --> 03:16:21,120
believe in consent are you referencing something no i feel like you're referencing something here

1918
03:16:21,120 --> 03:16:28,000
wrong i'm referencing reality yeah referencing the real life cheesy if you have if you don't know

1919
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:36,160
we love y'all living it yeah i'm referencing um torico our twisted world our twisted my dark

1920
03:16:36,160 --> 03:16:42,480
twisted mind i'm maybe like i don't know you ever consider that maybe like nate has good taste

1921
03:16:42,480 --> 03:16:48,960
and you have bad taste that could just be it you know that that could be could be the real answer

1922
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:53,200
here having the best taste means being the most miserable person on the planet and i don't want

1923
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:59,920
that i myself i don't know if that's true i i don't know i think i'm gonna want you to be miserable

1924
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:06,400
that was the intention with this chapter and you're i know i'm enjoying instead yeah i'm

1925
03:17:06,400 --> 03:17:12,400
i'm definitely authoring it i i found i found fishman island and the wano arcs a little bit

1926
03:17:12,400 --> 03:17:19,200
tedious like i definitely did not have no complaints about those chapters but egghead i like

1927
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:25,120
unless it's unless it goes on and on like i have like basically no problems with it at all and i

1928
03:17:25,120 --> 03:17:29,680
think it's great and it's so cool to see all these like threads that are so old they were established

1929
03:17:29,680 --> 03:17:34,960
so long ago and they're coming together right before our eyes and like it's really happening and it

1930
03:17:34,960 --> 03:17:42,000
feels great and i just and i just don't fucking understand i just don't fucking understand the

1931
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:49,440
mindset on display over there where it's like what was he uh yeah sanji's eyebrow swirl being

1932
03:17:49,440 --> 03:17:57,760
inconsistent uh fuck yeah what else was there the like like the the line line art is sketchy uh i

1933
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:04,240
don't even remember there were there were like one or two other things jinbei's some like something

1934
03:18:04,240 --> 03:18:11,680
about like the the specific verbiage that shanji used to insult the lunarian jinbei i don't even

1935
03:18:11,760 --> 03:18:19,680
remember but like there's just so i don't see i don't see any cause for negativity at all i don't

1936
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:25,280
see any i don't see call right thank you thank you uh i don't see any cause for negativity at all and

1937
03:18:25,280 --> 03:18:33,120
i was like i was watching and i was just like what what what where's this coming from it genuinely

1938
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:38,560
like took me back like how could you i just don't see how you can be negative about one piece in

1939
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:46,640
march of 2023 but that i don't know and that's why i'm like am i just am i just not in on the joke

1940
03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:54,560
i i don't know if it's a joke i think it's just the there's a there's a sense that

1941
03:18:55,840 --> 03:19:02,560
like your favorite thing could get worse it seems like it's a fear of a lot of media

1942
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:06,480
enjoyers that their favorite thing could get worse and they're so scared that it's gonna happen

1943
03:19:06,480 --> 03:19:11,600
what if it goes woke now it's whatever whatever does this or that it seems like it just doesn't

1944
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:15,760
look like anything particularly bad is happening but they're just so ready to be it's not just

1945
03:19:15,760 --> 03:19:24,480
nate it's like a whole community of like like uh what's the word um negative nancies uh they're

1946
03:19:24,480 --> 03:19:30,400
nate uh they're not negative nate heads negative nate heads it just it just seems like he's already

1947
03:19:30,400 --> 03:19:38,080
accepted that it will get bad and in fact it already has so if it is a why continue why continue

1948
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:43,760
this charade any longer there's there's like if you've decided that there's points where there's

1949
03:19:43,760 --> 03:19:49,200
like an argument that this is worse than it was sure but i just generally i listen to those

1950
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:54,160
and i'm like sure i can see why you would think that but i don't mind it and it's fact it's fine

1951
03:19:54,160 --> 03:20:00,720
actually there's a few there's a few nate nate is nate is still bothered by nika i'm like i don't

1952
03:20:00,720 --> 03:20:05,600
care i don't care about nika yeah it's fine cool the fruit wasn't the gum gum fruit cool okay

1953
03:20:06,720 --> 03:20:12,320
i guess we got nika now gear five sure like it's it's it's it's one of those things it's like um

1954
03:20:13,920 --> 03:20:20,160
would it like hypothetically i guess it would have been better if that had been planned from

1955
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:26,000
the very beginning and been and been sprinkled like little hints towards it so that people could

1956
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:31,440
come up with theories and and and then the theory would be true sure and then it feels like some

1957
03:20:31,440 --> 03:20:39,200
things that you they they were sort of made up more recently sure biota um and i think that is

1958
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:44,080
like you know hypothetically would have been nicer if it was all perfectly planned but like real life

1959
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:50,320
it's hard to it's hard to plan out like 900 chapters of a manga series it's hard to like

1960
03:20:50,320 --> 03:20:56,320
perfectly plan out everything yeah and i think that a little leeway is fine yeah it doesn't

1961
03:20:56,320 --> 03:21:04,000
break anything it's just you couldn't have seen it coming yeah oh jeez you said i like responded

1962
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:08,960
to you on twitter because you said like one piece botches it's like it's like power reveals oh yeah

1963
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:12,560
and i said give me an example and you gave me a couple of good examples i was like oh yeah that's

1964
03:21:12,560 --> 03:21:19,920
true okay that i did i did nancy one piece is not perfect but like it's so good i like that

1965
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:25,840
so much of the good outweighs like all of the bad and there's a reason it's like the most popular

1966
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:31,440
thing ever and that it's still going and still quality it's just maybe there's a few things that

1967
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:38,080
pet peeves and things that make you sad a little bit i just i i doesn't affect me so much i don't

1968
03:21:38,080 --> 03:21:45,360
know why i know that um online i'm known as the number one one piece hater on uh twitter.com if one

1969
03:21:45,360 --> 03:21:53,360
piece has one hater it's me if one piece has no haters your cheesy's dead yeah yeah yeah but even

1970
03:21:53,360 --> 03:22:00,000
but even i cheesy manfredo i have to admit that um i i feel like what i always kind of liked about

1971
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:05,360
one piece and why i'm i'm still i'm still like you know right there in the hot seat would it

1972
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:10,640
are you are you current are you up to date on it no but i promise that the next time i come back

1973
03:22:10,640 --> 03:22:16,400
on this on this podcast i'll be up to date that's fine i actually i didn't read this week's chapter

1974
03:22:16,400 --> 03:22:23,040
again lol uh but um i think the one thing i really like about one piece is the the fact that oda will

1975
03:22:23,040 --> 03:22:31,600
like give you 50 things at the same time and like one or five of those things might not be the best

1976
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:37,120
ever but like a lot of it is good a lot of it is like still good right he's really good at just

1977
03:22:37,120 --> 03:22:41,520
throwing things at you that are like entertaining that are interesting that are cool that are funny

1978
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:46,560
that are base that are redpilled you know you'll still throw you all this like really good stuff so

1979
03:22:46,560 --> 03:22:51,760
like the fact that it just you can only think of like negative things it's like i don't know you

1980
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:58,400
you might be like really like like reaching you know um one problem that i had and it's kind of

1981
03:22:58,400 --> 03:23:04,400
why i like kind of stopped reading at the at towards like the middle of the kaito fight um and

1982
03:23:04,400 --> 03:23:10,720
i mean i'll catch up whatever but i think one thing that kind of really bothered me is that um it

1983
03:23:10,720 --> 03:23:16,080
is kind of this problem that one piece figured out at the start but then they kind of just

1984
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:23,440
went back into having this problem and it's like um i always like that one piece solved the the

1985
03:23:23,440 --> 03:23:31,040
waiting for Goku problem you know and the whole thing about like waiting for Goku is that they

1986
03:23:31,040 --> 03:23:37,040
in Dragon Ball they usually how it ends up is they usually wait for Goku to show up so all the

1987
03:23:37,040 --> 03:23:43,040
other side characters are getting their ass kicked buying Goku time right and i think one piece did

1988
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:49,920
such a good job of solving that issue and what they did is that like there isn't just one bad guy

1989
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:56,720
it's a crew of bad guys and we have a crew of good guys so while Luffy is fighting the the big top

1990
03:23:56,720 --> 03:24:03,440
dog all the other crew members are fighting their own individual battles right and yeah and it's kind

1991
03:24:03,440 --> 03:24:11,280
of like like like if Oda wrote if Oda wrote like the Namek uh the the the Namek arc in Dragon Ball Z

1992
03:24:11,840 --> 03:24:17,280
he would have had it that uh Goku would have been fighting Frieza at the same time all the side

1993
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:20,320
characters would have been fighting the Ginyu force so he would have had those fights be

1994
03:24:20,320 --> 03:24:24,560
happening simultaneously while the planet is blowing up like that would have that's how Oda

1995
03:24:24,560 --> 03:24:30,880
would have wrote in that written that arc right but then and they did this they did so well but

1996
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:34,880
then for some reason and this is kind of like something that kind of cropped up a little bit

1997
03:24:35,920 --> 03:24:41,520
um i noticed it a little bit in a dress rosa it's it feels very obvious to me and Wano

1998
03:24:41,520 --> 03:24:46,400
is that they start introducing all these other side characters like a lot of side characters

1999
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:53,840
yeah yeah and and the side characters will be the people will be the people waiting for the straw

2000
03:24:53,840 --> 03:24:58,640
hats to show up so it just becomes waiting for straw hats so it's not about just like an individual

2001
03:24:58,640 --> 03:25:04,800
they're waiting for a specific straw hat member to show up and to take out the specific bad guy

2002
03:25:04,800 --> 03:25:11,280
crew member right and i guess that wouldn't be too bad if if not for the fact that all these side

2003
03:25:11,360 --> 03:25:19,200
characters also have very compelling motives like incredibly compelling motives of why they

2004
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:23,520
want to like fight the people they want to fight and i think it's bad to let the one they'll let

2005
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:29,840
the straw hats do it for them i think it i think it yeah i think it kind of kills a little bit

2006
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:35,200
emotional connection to it you know because the problem with i think one of my issues like okay

2007
03:25:35,200 --> 03:25:40,880
look if you if you want there's nothing wrong with the straw hats there's no like there's nothing

2008
03:25:40,960 --> 03:25:45,200
wrong with the straw hats fighting the fights they fight i just want there to be kind of

2009
03:25:45,200 --> 03:25:50,480
something more going on rather than like the straw hat is there to just fight this one guy

2010
03:25:51,360 --> 03:25:56,400
because like i think my big example is all the samurai's that were like this whole time this

2011
03:25:56,400 --> 03:26:02,800
fucking what is like a 20 year plan that they had just to the feet kaito it all leads up to this one

2012
03:26:02,800 --> 03:26:09,040
moment where they finally show up at the top to like fight kaito right and i and and ultimately

2013
03:26:09,520 --> 03:26:13,120
they don't they ultimately they don't stand a chance again i mean it was like a 20 year plan

2014
03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:19,280
they all have this emotional connection to kaito elder problem seems to stem from kaito it's all

2015
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:24,560
these things they're connected to kaito right but then no they can't do it and then luffy is there

2016
03:26:24,560 --> 03:26:29,200
luckily to the feet kaito and it's like there's nothing wrong with luffy fighting kaito but

2017
03:26:29,200 --> 03:26:34,800
luffy like there's not besides like what they're his friends with them sure that's fine but like

2018
03:26:34,880 --> 03:26:40,560
what's the thing with luffy and and and kaito and i and i feel like you don't have to like

2019
03:26:41,440 --> 03:26:46,720
there's not like there's ways to write this to not make it like you have to rewrite the whole

2020
03:26:46,720 --> 03:26:55,040
arc like maybe um kaito whatever ideology kaito is has is opposed to luffy's ideology in a way

2021
03:26:55,040 --> 03:26:59,680
aside from but they didn't really seem like kaito kaito believes in anything which is kind of i

2022
03:26:59,680 --> 03:27:03,600
always thought was kind of weird because when they first introduced kaito he's like straight up trying

2023
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:09,280
to commit suicide yeah and i thought like oh there he's like he's going to be the kind of guy who's

2024
03:27:09,280 --> 03:27:13,040
interested in like he's going to be like an accelerationist or something he's going to be

2025
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:18,000
interested in trying to like wipe out the world as fast as possible and wiping out everyone in it

2026
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:22,560
and luffy's going to be the guy who's like no living his base actually but but no that really

2027
03:27:22,560 --> 03:27:28,880
doesn't seem to be kaito he's just a strong guy who wants to be strong yeah right exactly and

2028
03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:32,480
and then at the same time there's all these other fights happening where like other side

2029
03:27:32,480 --> 03:27:36,720
characters are fighting other like members of the of the what they call the beast pirates

2030
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:42,400
and and they're not really dealing any major damage they're kind of just chipping damage away

2031
03:27:42,400 --> 03:27:47,280
until a strong hat character a strong hat crew member comes in and they like you know defeat

2032
03:27:47,280 --> 03:27:54,160
that person right they're kind of like warming up the battle for them and it's so it's so kind of

2033
03:27:54,160 --> 03:28:01,280
frustrating you know to read i agree with that as the the fact that there's so many new characters

2034
03:28:01,280 --> 03:28:09,040
they're always introducing and they don't have anything to do it's like the story could not it

2035
03:28:09,040 --> 03:28:16,240
could be told without the straw hats being there at all like early on it's this it's the plight of

2036
03:28:16,240 --> 03:28:20,960
the straw hats fighting against another pirate crew or trying to survive against like crocodile and

2037
03:28:20,960 --> 03:28:27,520
his organization and they're just like by themselves and that's why they have to pair off to fight

2038
03:28:27,520 --> 03:28:33,520
everyone but when there's like a whole bunch of people already doing a fight like in Dressrosa

2039
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:39,360
there was the one armed a one-legged guy what's his name chorazon or chorazon or something

2040
03:28:42,800 --> 03:28:48,640
i thought i forgot his name he was a toy soldier the former king well the former former the

2041
03:28:48,640 --> 03:28:54,560
no he wasn't the king he was like the he was the gladiator he was gonna be though like oh right

2042
03:28:54,640 --> 03:28:58,800
like it was set up that he was gonna become the king because he married like the princess and

2043
03:28:58,800 --> 03:29:07,680
their yeah daughter whatnot right yeah so like he has um like a big reason to come up and fight

2044
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:14,320
uh the the don flamingo pirate crew um you know he's finally been freed from his toy prison

2045
03:29:15,040 --> 03:29:18,320
and like he has a battle and it really should be about him

2046
03:29:19,280 --> 03:29:23,040
and but then there's all there's all this other stuff going on with the pirates

2047
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:31,840
and also with law and uh it's it's it gets it gets it gets confusing and muddled the more

2048
03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:38,480
factions that are involved in any one singular event and i like it when a straw hat character a

2049
03:29:38,480 --> 03:29:46,240
straw hat member gets their battle because that's you know we were with them pre like uh the

2050
03:29:46,880 --> 03:29:51,360
battle at marinford with their little adventures the the straw hat pirates and they're trying to

2051
03:29:51,360 --> 03:29:58,080
fight like it's very simple one pirate crew is the protagonists against the villains and that's

2052
03:29:58,080 --> 03:30:04,720
like every island and um the more like side characters need their own screen time the less

2053
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:09,040
the straw hat pirates get of their own screen time but luffy always has the main screen time at the

2054
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:17,520
top so it's like it's spread out and it's just it's not satisfying yeah it's not satisfying enough

2055
03:30:17,520 --> 03:30:23,120
there's not enough time or space for all these individual characters to get their their their

2056
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:31,200
emotional thing and and this is kind of what i mean by like oh this never happens in hunter hunter

2057
03:30:31,200 --> 03:30:38,720
because in hunter hunter they're not like interested in the main character gone fighting the bad guy of

2058
03:30:38,720 --> 03:30:44,240
each arc right because like there's so like in a traditional shonen there's like so many like

2059
03:30:44,240 --> 03:30:49,200
villains in the hunter hunter arcs that would have been like and the final fight of this fight

2060
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:54,960
is gone versus this villain right but that actually never really fucking happens it's only like one

2061
03:30:54,960 --> 03:31:01,680
season or like one arc and with villain with a gone fighting the villain but all the other ones

2062
03:31:02,400 --> 03:31:09,520
um it's either like another character is like either fighting the villain or realizing something

2063
03:31:09,520 --> 03:31:17,440
about like the bad guy and about themselves right and and like i think in i think a big example

2064
03:31:17,440 --> 03:31:24,240
of this is in the chimera and arc like the chimera and king like um in the traditional shonen gone

2065
03:31:24,240 --> 03:31:29,360
would be the guy to fight him at the end right like if this was one piece and gone it was like

2066
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:33,760
luffy they would have just made gone fight him but no instead there's like another character

2067
03:31:33,760 --> 03:31:37,760
who's like beyond stronger than gone who ends up fighting the chimera and king

2068
03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:42,320
and even that fight like goes in like in a very different direction i think what's also kind of

2069
03:31:42,320 --> 03:31:48,880
great is that in hunter hunter the the power system like is like so well defined that like they never

2070
03:31:48,880 --> 03:31:54,560
have to like introduce something new they just like everything they show is it could always be

2071
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:58,560
explained like they always kind of they already explained how like everything works so anytime

2072
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:03,920
something kind of new or wacky pops up we already like get that like this is this ability like we

2073
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:11,600
know this and the fact of the matter is that we're constantly reminded that like uh our main

2074
03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:18,240
character gone is not the strongest not in an effort to like say like oh he has a long way to go

2075
03:32:18,960 --> 03:32:26,000
but but more like to kind of show how big the world of hunter hunter is that like

2076
03:32:26,720 --> 03:32:31,600
you're this one kid and sure you are strong actually it's kind of scary how strong you are

2077
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:41,360
but there are at least like 500 other people above you and it's not about beating these people it's

2078
03:32:41,360 --> 03:32:46,240
about kind of like your own kind of goal you know and you're just going to get stronger as you go

2079
03:32:46,240 --> 03:32:50,960
through like the adventure but with like one piece i think it just boils down to eventually

2080
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:58,800
luffy has to become the strongest guy on the fucking planet right and um it's kind of like i mean

2081
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:03,840
i mean it works for like chun and i think like when one piece ends and it doesn't matter if the

2082
03:33:03,840 --> 03:33:10,000
ending is good or bad i feel like if it's good that's great that's awesome if it's bad i still

2083
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:13,760
feel like at the end of the day that people are going to still label one piece probably the greatest

2084
03:33:13,760 --> 03:33:21,280
shonen ever written and i and i 100% agree with that sentiment but like hunter hunter is just a

2085
03:33:21,280 --> 03:33:27,440
really good manga like i feel like it it it passes like it passes the threshold of like a shonen

2086
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:33,600
and it's just a good manga it's just i should i should read it i should read it story um yeah i

2087
03:33:33,600 --> 03:33:38,240
mean you might like i don't i don't know but i like it it's really good um i think the anime

2088
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:42,960
doesn't really i think the anime does a really good job i'm always finding myself wishing i knew

2089
03:33:42,960 --> 03:33:47,120
what people were talking about when they talk about it so that's probably a sign that i should

2090
03:33:47,120 --> 03:33:52,960
check it out at some point i think the ending that the anime chooses is like the perfect ending

2091
03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:59,040
and if the manga ended like that i thought like okay dude bum 10 out of 10 banger manga but the

2092
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:04,560
manga keeps going and it's fine right but i'm but the thing is like i'm just not that interested

2093
03:34:04,560 --> 03:34:09,280
in reading like the rest of it and it's and it's not like the quality has gone down it's like still

2094
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:16,800
consistently good but like like the two like to me the um once like in episode two of the anime

2095
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:23,040
once gone meets kiloa that's when the show starts because that's like this is this is these are our

2096
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:27,600
characters this is our duo and it's all about it's all about them and once they go they're

2097
03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:33,280
separate ways that's it that's the end of the series for me right yeah um but yeah i would

2098
03:34:33,280 --> 03:34:39,040
recommend it it's really good really good anime well while you were saying all that i read the

2099
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:48,720
new chapter nice so there's so pretty bass uh when it uh new chapter 10 it was good it was a

2109
03:36:00,080 --> 03:36:07,200
that's pretty cool how many um how many chapters do you have on mine for clover sir i finished the

2110
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:12,640
sketching the like blocking out of all the pages so it's just a matter of doing line art and shading

2111
03:36:12,640 --> 03:36:19,520
and and everything cleaning uh it's gonna be 10 chapters each chapter is around 15 to 20 pages

2112
03:36:19,520 --> 03:36:25,200
the last chapter is quite long it's like 23 actually there's gonna be more because i still

2113
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:31,840
haven't drawn there's like a couple pages of epilogue because you gotta you gotta end a western

2114
03:36:31,840 --> 03:36:40,560
with the right enough into the sunset haven't got there yet kind of reminds me of um not really

2115
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:47,360
an epilogue but um was it uh and for the the movie fistful of dollars which was like the start of

2116
03:36:47,360 --> 03:36:56,400
like the yes the good and the bad and the ugly trilogy um uh yes so julian yeah and in the

2117
03:36:56,400 --> 03:37:05,200
in the first movie um it's gone back it uh i'm freaking back it starts with all over shut up

2118
03:37:05,760 --> 03:37:13,280
jesus talking what oh i'm talking my headphones got disconnected okay go on but in the um fistful

2119
03:37:13,280 --> 03:37:18,880
of dollars um in the movie in the original movie the clint eastwood character just shows up into

2120
03:37:18,880 --> 03:37:25,120
town and he starts a fight with like the gang there right and that's the whole movie um but in

2121
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:31,520
the tv version when it came out what they did was that they added a prologue because the thing is that

2122
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:37,920
like um the clint eastwood character in the movie is not a good person like he's kind of like a piece

2123
03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:43,200
but he's fighting against people who are way worse so like you know you're kind of like

2124
03:37:43,200 --> 03:37:48,480
compelled to be on his side but i guess that was like too much when the movie was brought to tv

2125
03:37:49,040 --> 03:37:53,840
so what they did was that they added a prologue where they add like a narration talking to clint

2126
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:58,240
eastwood saying like um they're talking to him like he's like a federal agent and they're like oh

2127
03:37:58,240 --> 03:38:03,760
this town has been overrun by a gang go stop them and to make it seem like oh he works for the law

2128
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:08,960
like that's that's what happened the new prologue and it's just so like funny because it's like

2129
03:38:08,960 --> 03:38:14,080
you can't just have a character who just so happens to be like morally gray and then he finds people

2130
03:38:14,080 --> 03:38:20,240
who are a whore it it has to it has to be that like he's on the side of good so everything he's

2131
03:38:20,240 --> 03:38:26,720
doing is ultimately for the greater good that i mean that's the whole fun of the spaghetti westerns

2132
03:38:26,720 --> 03:38:32,000
as opposed to like the older like fifties sixties westerns where the good guy is the good guy and

2133
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:37,280
everyone likes him and the bad guy's the bad guy and he's got a mustache um is the in spaghetti

2134
03:38:37,280 --> 03:38:44,560
westerns and like other cool western movies uh it's morally gray it's just like more realistic in

2135
03:38:44,560 --> 03:38:50,240
the like if you're a guy with a gun you can just shoot a guy and it might not be a good thing to

2136
03:38:50,240 --> 03:38:56,080
do that but you know um you do what you got to do a lot of there's a handful of like early westerns

2137
03:38:56,080 --> 03:39:00,560
where um one of the characters are kind of like morally good i mean that's where the term like what

2138
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:05,920
is it white hat comes from yeah is the good guy and then black hat like and i think a big example

2139
03:39:05,920 --> 03:39:13,120
of like the kind of like um the major like difference between like a western back then a western now

2140
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:18,640
and if you look at if you watch the original true grit movie and then you watch the remake um and in

2141
03:39:18,640 --> 03:39:23,280
the original the the character i forget the character i think he's played by jeff bridge is in the

2142
03:39:23,280 --> 03:39:28,080
remake but that character i think he's played by john wane yeah he's played by john wane the john wane

2143
03:39:28,080 --> 03:39:34,960
everyone's john wane in the in the old days yeah john wane character is like this nice he's i think

2144
03:39:34,960 --> 03:39:40,560
he's a nicer person he's like a good guy he's like awesome and cool but in the remake he's like a drunk

2145
03:39:40,560 --> 03:39:47,040
he's like fucking like past his prime and he's like an asshole and whatnot and the big reason why

2146
03:39:47,040 --> 03:39:54,000
like westerns kind of became darker and grittier is because of the movie blazing saddles that really

2147
03:39:54,000 --> 03:39:59,920
like killed that really killed the trope of the whole like a really like good guy western

2148
03:40:01,520 --> 03:40:07,280
man doing good and whatnot all they needed was one good lampoon right and you know you know what's

2149
03:40:07,280 --> 03:40:11,600
another you know what's another movie that kind of did something another parry that kind of did

2150
03:40:11,600 --> 03:40:17,920
something similar for their own is it spaceballs no not spaceballs okay it's fucking austin powers

2151
03:40:17,920 --> 03:40:25,120
what for like spy thrillers for for the james the james spawn reboot that happened in like the

2152
03:40:25,120 --> 03:40:31,920
early 2000s with daniel craig uh the reason so in those early like i think the first three or four

2153
03:40:31,920 --> 03:40:38,080
movies there there was no jokes no character would say a fucking joke in those movies and that's because

2154
03:40:38,080 --> 03:40:43,120
of austin powers like that's because they were like we're not we're not like austin powers right

2155
03:40:43,120 --> 03:40:47,120
because that's because i think it was this period where like people weren't like

2156
03:40:47,920 --> 03:40:53,600
interested in james bond movies and the popular side guys was austin powers right like oh this is

2157
03:40:53,600 --> 03:41:00,560
kind of silly right so when uh they they brought back james bond they're all like okay we're gonna

2158
03:41:00,560 --> 03:41:06,960
make a serious james bond or he's gonna be he's gonna you know it was very post-9 11 like the

2159
03:41:06,960 --> 03:41:12,640
pierce brazil movies are kind of silly yeah they are they're over the top yeah yeah because i mean one

2160
03:41:12,640 --> 03:41:18,480
of the bad guys was like fucking christ for walkings and one of those movies but but yeah but

2161
03:41:18,480 --> 03:41:23,200
with um the daniel craig one they took it super serious this new james bond is like very there's

2162
03:41:23,200 --> 03:41:29,920
he never smiles never smiles he has ptsd because you know we were in the iraq war and that was hot

2163
03:41:29,920 --> 03:41:40,160
to give it ptsd right that was some hot shit yeah that was some hot shit and yeah so it's funny

2164
03:41:40,160 --> 03:41:46,240
funny funny funny but yeah i'll read i'll read clara so next time i come back i'll have read

mcpagliacci oh hell yeah but i'm i'm accumulating order now i'm consuming i'm consuming

2174
03:42:39,280 --> 03:42:45,520
western comics i'm support i'm supporting i'm supporting creators whose work i appreciate

2175
03:42:45,520 --> 03:42:48,480
the average supporter i'm creating

2176
03:42:51,280 --> 03:42:58,560
i'm created over here mom oh i'm creating but like uh uh john wane right he's like

2177
03:42:59,200 --> 03:43:04,960
he was the big movie star yeah he played a lot of cowboys he was known for that i think

2178
03:43:04,960 --> 03:43:14,640
john wane made famous in diehard yeah uh uh john wane he uh he just looks like someone's dad

2179
03:43:14,640 --> 03:43:19,040
which was always funny to me because he's always like in these cowboy films and he's like the cool

2180
03:43:19,040 --> 03:43:24,960
guy the the serious guy the sensible guy and the guy who knows what's up and he's got he's got the

2181
03:43:25,040 --> 03:43:30,640
quick hand but he just looks like a strawberry like a guy's dad it feels like it's a you think

2182
03:43:30,640 --> 03:43:35,440
like a vanity project that he's always in yeah well cowboy movies are very dad core

2183
03:43:36,400 --> 03:43:42,000
they're very dad core it's just sort of like that they're on they're on again again i was

2184
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:46,000
thinking of clint eastwood no you're right john wane does just look like some guy's dad

2185
03:43:46,720 --> 03:43:51,600
yeah clint eastwood looks like a hot boy yeah yeah he was like a good looking guy

2186
03:43:51,600 --> 03:43:55,840
john wane literally looks like you've ever seen um the church of the subgenius

2187
03:43:57,440 --> 03:44:06,240
yeah i heard of it uh nope it was like kind of like a ironic cult that people would join

2188
03:44:06,800 --> 03:44:12,880
yeah it's kind of a it's kind of a gen X thing i think yeah it was like oh it'd be so ironic if

2189
03:44:12,880 --> 03:44:18,800
we were part of like a funny little cult and um yeah that's what it was well like their logo

2190
03:44:18,960 --> 03:44:25,840
the the logo of the church of the subgenius is um man there's something so i think i'm a little i

2191
03:44:25,840 --> 03:44:31,680
think i'm a little bit i think i got a little bit of that nostalgia for a time that i never

2192
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:37,520
experienced about like fucking like gen X irony culture i think i probably would have been like

2193
03:44:37,520 --> 03:44:42,400
all in on the church is the subgenius if i was like you know at the right age when it was like

2194
03:44:43,280 --> 03:44:51,840
at its peak uh but um yeah this is its logo is this guy called jr dobs jr bob dobs and like

2195
03:44:51,840 --> 03:44:58,080
they that yeah john wane looks like that looks like this guy lamal that's pretty funny

2196
03:44:59,920 --> 03:45:07,120
yeah i thought this guy's like a generic like dad picture right yeah like yeah i don't know if it's

2197
03:45:07,120 --> 03:45:12,960
based on an actual person or what but yeah it's it's it's meant to it's meant to look like uh like

2198
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:23,600
you know mr walton or you know the idea of like a post post war old timey you know american father

2199
03:45:23,600 --> 03:45:30,160
figure yeah yeah it's funny that it's funny to imagine that like the that stereotype involves

2200
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:35,360
smoking a pipe because smoking a pipe is fucking disgusting smoking a pipe is like foul it's like

2201
03:45:35,360 --> 03:45:42,640
a foul thing to do but it's let's put together image of oh yes a respectable dad it's it's classy

2202
03:45:42,640 --> 03:45:48,960
he's got his pipe and it looks cool in an image i think you wouldn't want to be around a guy who

2203
03:45:48,960 --> 03:45:53,600
smoked a pipe in real life i think it would be extremely unpleasant unless you're also a pipe

2204
03:45:53,600 --> 03:46:00,240
pipe weed smoker and then it's fine that's why they have the smoking room yeah true and various

2205
03:46:00,240 --> 03:46:04,320
business but then they smell but then they smell everywhere they go they're gonna smell like it

2206
03:46:04,320 --> 03:46:09,920
everywhere i know they just they're just they're just being i guess they're just guys i guess back

2207
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:14,400
in the day everything must have just smelled like smoke like everywhere you went must have smelled

2208
03:46:14,400 --> 03:46:19,360
like smoke all the time yeah everything smelled like shit back in the medieval times because there

2209
03:46:19,360 --> 03:46:24,800
was shit in everywhere well that's understandable day like like the shit that the the shit that guys

2210
03:46:24,800 --> 03:46:30,400
could get away with was like 10 times more than like the shit they could get away with now now i

2211
03:46:30,400 --> 03:46:35,440
can't even ask a girl to have sex with me twice or else cheesy jumps down my throat and calls me

2212
03:46:35,440 --> 03:46:42,560
atrocious now now now i can't now like they send you news when they know i don't want them i just

2213
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:48,400

parent answer he he will never stop asking he's got it's called the sigma grind set it's called

2215
03:46:55,280 --> 03:47:01,040
the grind set i was gonna say about how like oh there's this there's this like kind of illusion

2216
03:47:01,040 --> 03:47:06,400
of like people like ted bundy we're like oh the reason he murdered so many people was because he

2217
03:47:06,400 --> 03:47:12,720
was so swab and whatnot i was like no no because the standards of like hitting on women was so low

2218
03:47:12,720 --> 03:47:17,840
back then um there's this kind of like there was this tiktok trend i remember a couple months ago

2219
03:47:17,840 --> 03:47:24,320
where like people were like um like doing they were like hearing to their like stories of how

2220
03:47:24,320 --> 03:47:28,800
their grandma got their grandpa and it would always be like the grandpa would commit like a

2221
03:47:28,800 --> 03:47:33,520
sex crime or sexual assault to them and then they would get married and then the clip is like played

2225
03:47:54,800 --> 03:47:58,720
day like if you wanted to get with a girl you'd sneak into her window and assault her at night

2226
03:47:58,720 --> 03:48:03,120
and then you'd marry her that same week because that's because the parent their parents would insist

2230
03:48:25,760 --> 03:48:30,160
i mean i have to go back though i mean i think of all those statues we're missing out it's the

2231
03:48:30,160 --> 03:48:34,880
what it's the wildling way it's the wildling way you got it that's how you keep the gene pool

2232
03:48:35,680 --> 03:48:41,840
broad and and deep you gotta you gotta you gotta kidnap a wife from a neighboring twine god you

2233
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:48,160
know who's twine i'm maybe i'm enabling twine never doing twine you know who's really ruining

2234
03:48:48,160 --> 03:48:53,520
the gene pool i committed sexual i committed i committed kidnapping and sexual assault against

2235
03:48:53,520 --> 03:48:59,920
members of the enemy twine oh i impregnated them against their will that keeps the gene strong

2236
03:48:59,920 --> 03:49:08,320
our twine will prosper oh that was that was really like ruining the gene pool like you know who

2237
03:49:08,320 --> 03:49:17,600
was like the worst people brown people i'm sorry what we're fixing the gene pool and in my opinion

2238
03:49:17,600 --> 03:49:24,400
but all right tell me well um comedians ugly comedians that have hot wives are like ruining

2239
03:49:24,400 --> 03:49:28,480
the gene pool they're fucking they're putting their ugly just because they're funny just because

2240
03:49:28,480 --> 03:49:34,800
they're funny really you're gonna let them ruin the our fucking our humanity with right ugly children

2241
03:49:34,800 --> 03:49:40,640
just because they're funny because by eating by eating a lot of food uh they they grow become

2242
03:49:40,640 --> 03:49:44,800
very large and then according to lamarckian genetics that means that they'll pass on the

2243
03:49:44,800 --> 03:49:51,840
largeness gene to their offspring so they're they're gonna have fat children you see that they're

2244
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:59,200
ruining the ruining the gene pool it's i agree i agree exactly uh i've never been swimming in the

2245
03:49:59,200 --> 03:50:04,000
gene pool i i've heard it's great somebody i've heard it's nice i think it was i think it was

2247
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:16,480
understand what genes are like scar is talking about like the gene pool but there's some other

2248
03:50:16,480 --> 03:50:22,640
thing where like they're completely baffled by some like really very simple like mechanical concept

2249
03:50:24,080 --> 03:50:27,280
i don't i don't remember what the example was but it's like yeah why is scarred

2250

2285
03:54:00,560 --> 03:54:04,160
why do you hate javajiga because they're the the person who did the

2286
03:54:04,160 --> 03:54:09,160
the fucking whole like, oh, graphic novel section, manga section, it's so fucking over.

2287
03:54:09,160 --> 03:54:11,160
No, they're not. Wait, is that them?

2288
03:54:11,160 --> 03:54:12,160
Yeah, that's them.

2289
03:54:12,160 --> 03:54:14,160
No, I didn't realize it was them.

2290
03:54:14,160 --> 03:54:18,160
Every time, every time, like, I've never seen a good take from them.

2291
03:54:18,160 --> 03:54:22,160
I swear I've only ever seen, like, annoying ass takes from them.

2292
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:25,160
Oh, I kind of thought, I kind of like, okay.

2293
03:54:25,160 --> 03:54:27,160
Maybe, maybe they did something.

2294
03:54:27,160 --> 03:54:30,160
Well, I mean, well, I mean, okay, you know what, you know what, you know what, I mean,

2295
03:54:30,160 --> 03:54:32,160
I'm actually not that mad because, I mean, I don't even disagree.

2296
03:54:32,160 --> 03:54:35,160
Like, it is over in the sense that, like, yeah, they're making more.

2297
03:54:35,160 --> 03:54:38,160
Yeah, they're making more manga because the money is there.

2298
03:54:38,160 --> 03:54:41,160
It's been over, like, the thing is, like, it's been over since, like, the 90s,

2299
03:54:41,160 --> 03:54:44,160
everyone has been saying, oh, it's dying, it's dying, it's dying.

2300
03:54:44,160 --> 03:54:45,160
It's like, yeah.

2301
03:54:45,160 --> 03:54:46,160
Right, right.

2302
03:54:46,160 --> 03:54:48,160
Just read, please.

2303
03:54:48,160 --> 03:54:49,160
Don't get drawn, you idiot.

2304
03:54:49,160 --> 03:54:51,160
Read Daniel Klaus.

2305
03:54:51,160 --> 03:54:53,160
He's gonna have a new book in October.

2306
03:54:53,160 --> 03:54:54,160
You can pre-order it now.

2307
03:54:54,160 --> 03:54:55,160
Really?

2308
03:54:55,160 --> 03:54:56,160
Yes.

2309
03:54:56,160 --> 03:54:58,160
Actually, have you read Patience, which was the last book?

2310
03:54:58,160 --> 03:54:59,160
That one came out in 2016.

2311
03:54:59,160 --> 03:55:01,160
What was the one you got me to read?

2312
03:55:01,160 --> 03:55:05,160
Dan, it was David Boring.

2313
03:55:05,160 --> 03:55:07,160
That was also Dan Klaus, right?

2314
03:55:07,160 --> 03:55:08,160
Yeah, that was Daniel Klaus.

2315
03:55:08,160 --> 03:55:10,160
Yeah, that's the only one I've read.

2316
03:55:10,160 --> 03:55:11,160
Hey, I just hit 1600.

2317
03:55:11,160 --> 03:55:13,160
Just hit 1600 Twitch followers.

2318
03:55:13,160 --> 03:55:15,160
Hey, oh, that's 40 followers.

2319
03:55:15,160 --> 03:55:16,160
Whoa.

2320
03:55:16,160 --> 03:55:21,160
I think you should read Defray next, Ben.

2321
03:55:21,160 --> 03:55:23,160
I think you'll like Defray.

2322
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:26,160
It's kind of like David Boring, but it's kind of...

2323
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:30,160
Maybe I'll order it on Amazon when I'm ordering Clarissa.

2324
03:55:30,160 --> 03:55:37,160
It's Daniel Klaus doing his version of like, oh, superheroes in real life, but it's like...

2325
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:43,160
No one ever talks about how he really shows how pathetic it is.

2326
03:55:43,160 --> 03:55:46,160
There's been other things where they're like, oh, superheroes in real life, but I think

2327
03:55:46,160 --> 03:55:51,160
Daniel Klaus probably hits it the most realistic in what would happen.

2328
03:55:51,160 --> 03:55:53,160
How do you feel about...

2329
03:55:53,160 --> 03:55:58,160
Who was that guy who was the superhero in real life in real life?

2330
03:55:58,160 --> 03:55:59,160
Phoenix Jones.

2331
03:55:59,160 --> 03:56:01,160
Phoenix Jones, yeah.

2332
03:56:01,160 --> 03:56:02,160
Yeah.

2333
03:56:02,160 --> 03:56:03,160
Do you ever see that?

2334
03:56:03,160 --> 03:56:05,160
There's an atrocity guide video about Phoenix Jones.

2335
03:56:05,160 --> 03:56:09,160
Yeah, he's like, end up selling drugs.

2336
03:56:09,160 --> 03:56:12,160
Yeah, he was selling drugs on the side.

2337
03:56:12,160 --> 03:56:14,160
I think...

2338
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:18,160
He was busting people for selling drugs while he was...

2339
03:56:18,160 --> 03:56:19,160
Like, that's the terrible thing.

2340
03:56:19,160 --> 03:56:21,160
I wouldn't begrudge him.

2341
03:56:21,160 --> 03:56:23,160
I wouldn't begrudge him a side hustle.

2342
03:56:23,160 --> 03:56:26,160
I wouldn't begrudge him a side hustle, but the fact that he was busting other people

2343
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:30,160
for it while he was doing it is like, ugh, that's so disgusting.

2344
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:37,160
That was part of the plan to come off as a superhero, that drug bust, everyone butt your own.

2345
03:56:37,160 --> 03:56:44,160
That sounds like a plot to something, like Spider-Man Story or something.

2346
03:56:44,160 --> 03:56:45,160
That's a really good video.

2347
03:56:45,160 --> 03:56:48,160
I wonder if atrocity guides made any more...

2348
03:56:48,160 --> 03:56:49,160
I think they have.

2349
03:56:49,160 --> 03:56:51,160
I really like that channel.

2350
03:56:51,160 --> 03:56:52,160
It is good.

2351
03:56:52,160 --> 03:56:55,160
It's like down the rabbit hole, but better, and they still make videos.

2352
03:56:55,160 --> 03:56:58,160
I think they pump out stuff faster, which I really like.

2353
03:56:58,160 --> 03:57:03,160
I really hate that down the rabbit hole would spend so long on just one video.

2354
03:57:03,160 --> 03:57:07,160
I think they've been working on one for a long ass time, and it's like...

2355
03:57:07,160 --> 03:57:10,160
It won't be worth a wait.

2356
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:12,160
Yeah, that's the kind of annoying thing.

2357
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:15,160
The Wings of Emotion video, bad.

2358
03:57:15,160 --> 03:57:19,160
Most of their other videos are very good, but I don't...

2359
03:57:19,160 --> 03:57:22,160
Do you know what the new one is going to be on?

2360
03:57:22,160 --> 03:57:25,160
I think that...

2361
03:57:25,160 --> 03:57:29,160
I hear people back and forth talking about it.

2362
03:57:29,160 --> 03:57:36,160
I thought I heard someone say that, oh, they're doing the Keemstar retrospective, or they're doing...

2363
03:57:36,160 --> 03:57:37,160
That sucks.

2364
03:57:37,160 --> 03:57:38,160
I mean, hopefully not that.

2365
03:57:38,160 --> 03:57:39,160
That sucks really bad.

2366
03:57:39,160 --> 03:57:40,160
That blows.

2367
03:57:40,160 --> 03:57:43,160
Or like some sort of expansion on Furries, or they're doing...

2368
03:57:43,160 --> 03:57:44,160
Garbage.

2369
03:57:44,160 --> 03:57:46,160
Did they do Gaia Online already?

2370
03:57:46,160 --> 03:57:48,160
I don't know if they did Gaia Online.

2371
03:57:48,160 --> 03:57:51,160
I don't think so.

2372
03:57:51,160 --> 03:57:53,160
Okay, Atrocity Guide has won...

2373
03:57:53,160 --> 03:57:58,160
Oh no, Atrocity Guide has only made one in the last six months.

2374
03:57:58,160 --> 03:58:04,160
Yeah, the last two down the rabbit hole videos I thought were kind of not interesting.

2375
03:58:04,160 --> 03:58:08,160
Wings of Redemption, I would say Wings of Redemption is a bad video.

2376
03:58:08,160 --> 03:58:09,160
Really?

2377
03:58:09,160 --> 03:58:11,160
I thought that one was interesting.

2378
03:58:11,160 --> 03:58:15,160
I liked how it was secretly in Origins of Keemstar video.

2379
03:58:15,160 --> 03:58:17,160
Yeah, I didn't feel like that was intentional.

2380
03:58:17,160 --> 03:58:19,160
It was slowly rising in the background.

2381
03:58:19,160 --> 03:58:20,160
Yeah, probably not.

2382
03:58:20,160 --> 03:58:21,160
That was like an accident.

2383
03:58:21,160 --> 03:58:22,160
8.6...

2384
03:58:22,160 --> 03:58:24,160
Oh God, okay, great.

2385
03:58:24,160 --> 03:58:27,160
Cool, his worst video has the most views, so this is going to be what his fucking stupid

2386
03:58:27,160 --> 03:58:28,160
channel turns into now.

2387
03:58:28,160 --> 03:58:29,160
Awesome.

2388
03:58:29,160 --> 03:58:30,160
Cool.

2389
03:58:30,160 --> 03:58:35,160
Oh fuck, I haven't seen the last Atrocities Guide video, even though I did a podcast episode

2390
03:58:35,160 --> 03:58:39,160
on the movie that they're talking about in that video.

2391
03:58:39,160 --> 03:58:42,160
Oh, the kidnapped and forced to make action films?

2392
03:58:42,160 --> 03:58:48,160
Yeah, they're talking about the only North Korean Kaiju film, Pogusari.

2393
03:58:49,160 --> 03:58:51,160
Well, I've heard you talk about that.

2394
03:58:51,160 --> 03:58:52,160
Yeah, Pogusari, it's great.

2395
03:58:52,160 --> 03:58:55,160
We do have an official Toku cast on it.

2396
03:58:55,160 --> 03:58:57,160
I haven't seen the two newest ones.

2397
03:58:57,160 --> 03:59:00,160
The one about Bob's Game is really good.

2398
03:59:00,160 --> 03:59:04,160
I mean, I've watched all of these and they're all really good.

2399
03:59:04,160 --> 03:59:06,160
It's a great channel.

2400
03:59:06,160 --> 03:59:12,160
Bob's Game is one of the few examples of earlier where we were talking about, oh, just make

2401
03:59:12,160 --> 03:59:14,160
games for yourself.

2402
03:59:14,160 --> 03:59:17,160
Bob's Game is the ultimate that because the guy is insane.

2403
03:59:17,160 --> 03:59:27,160
Have you seen the Mandalore Gaming video about, fuck, Mandalore Gaming?

2404
03:59:27,160 --> 03:59:31,160
I think I might have mentioned this one before, but I can't remember the name again.

2405
03:59:31,160 --> 03:59:33,160
Atrocity.

2406
03:59:36,160 --> 03:59:38,160
Oh, fuck.

2407
03:59:38,160 --> 03:59:42,160
It's the one where you play as the edgy teen who kills pedophiles.

2408
03:59:43,160 --> 03:59:45,160
No.

2409
03:59:45,160 --> 03:59:47,160
The Simpsons Game?

2410
03:59:47,160 --> 03:59:49,160
No.

2411
03:59:51,160 --> 03:59:54,160
I know about the Kanye Game.

2412
03:59:54,160 --> 03:59:56,160
Anonymous Agony.

2413
03:59:56,160 --> 03:59:58,160
Anonymous Agony.

2414
03:59:58,160 --> 04:00:03,160
That's another one that is just like somebody made it in RPG Maker.

2415
04:00:03,160 --> 04:00:07,160
Bob's Game looks so dumb.

2416
04:00:08,160 --> 04:00:15,160
It's like, hey, what if I made a game about me in real life walking around my house?

2417
04:00:15,160 --> 04:00:17,160
You should make that game, then.

2418
04:00:21,160 --> 04:00:22,160
What's the name of that one guy?

2419
04:00:22,160 --> 04:00:24,160
Oh, Austin Cowell?

2420
04:00:24,160 --> 04:00:25,160
Austin McConnell.

2421
04:00:25,160 --> 04:00:27,160
Yeah.

2422
04:00:27,160 --> 04:00:33,160
That guy, he's the guy who made a video where he was talking about that film that he made

2423
04:00:33,160 --> 04:00:36,160
that was bad all those years ago.

2424
04:00:37,160 --> 04:00:40,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

2425
04:00:40,160 --> 04:00:42,160
It's called, I made a movie.

2426
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:44,160
It's Stunk.

2427
04:00:44,160 --> 04:00:46,160
Oh, Austin McConnell.

2428
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:48,160
Yeah, Austin McConnell.

2429
04:00:48,160 --> 04:00:55,160
Oh yeah, and didn't that guy plagiarize his video about the Special Olympics team?

2430
04:00:55,160 --> 04:00:57,160
Oh, did he?

2431
04:00:57,160 --> 04:01:04,160
It might have just been a case that he made another, he just made another video with a very similar

2432
04:01:05,160 --> 04:01:08,160
content to one that John Boyce made.

2433
04:01:08,160 --> 04:01:12,160
And I don't know if it's like ever technically been called out as plagiarism, but

2434
04:01:12,160 --> 04:01:16,160
the John Boyce video is better, and John Boyce is better than Austin McConnell.

2435
04:01:16,160 --> 04:01:18,160
Fuck Austin McConnell.

2436
04:01:18,160 --> 04:01:26,160
Austin McConnell is very, he has such like a, the quality of his videos jump so much like back and forth.

2437
04:01:26,160 --> 04:01:27,160
I feel.

2438
04:01:27,160 --> 04:01:29,160
I haven't seen a good one in a while.

2439
04:01:29,160 --> 04:01:34,160
The majority of them are kind of like mid, and also I think you ever like,

2440
04:01:34,160 --> 04:01:38,160
I liked his one about the Harry Potter play.

2441
04:01:38,160 --> 04:01:39,160
I thought that one was pretty good.

2442
04:01:39,160 --> 04:01:44,160
I ever like, and this is kind of like a kind of like specific, this is kind of a certain

2443
04:01:44,160 --> 04:01:49,160
content creator where they're like, they have pretty good insight on like writing and like

2444
04:01:49,160 --> 04:01:50,160
criticism and whatnot.

2445
04:01:50,160 --> 04:01:55,160
But when it comes to them making art, it's always kind of like, wow, this is bad.

2446
04:01:55,160 --> 04:01:56,160
Yeah.

2447
04:01:56,160 --> 04:01:57,160
You know what I'm saying?

2448
04:01:57,160 --> 04:01:58,160
Many such cases.

2449
04:01:58,160 --> 04:01:59,160
Yeah.

2450
04:01:59,160 --> 04:02:00,160
Yeah.

2451
04:02:00,160 --> 04:02:06,160
Austin McConnell is kind of like that because I feel like he has really good insight on certain

2452
04:02:06,160 --> 04:02:07,160
things.

2453
04:02:07,160 --> 04:02:11,160
But then when he was talking about his, because he's all like, oh, we're making like a, we're

2454
04:02:11,160 --> 04:02:15,160
making kind of like an animated movie based on public domain superheroes.

2455
04:02:15,160 --> 04:02:20,660
And I'm going to make my own like little animated superheroes cinematic universe with public

2456
04:02:20,660 --> 04:02:24,160
domain characters, which isn't that bad of an idea.

2457
04:02:24,160 --> 04:02:28,160
But when I heard his kind of retelling of one of the characters stories, like his version

2458
04:02:28,160 --> 04:02:33,160
of it, it's like, wow, it just sounds just as dull as like the original.

2459
04:02:33,160 --> 04:02:36,160
Like, why don't you like do something completely different?

2460
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:37,160
Yeah.

2461
04:02:37,160 --> 04:02:38,160
I see.

2462
04:02:38,160 --> 04:02:39,160
Yeah.

2463
04:02:39,160 --> 04:02:43,160
Because there's already like so many, there's been so many comics about public domain superheroes

2464
04:02:43,160 --> 04:02:45,160
and other public domain characters.

2465
04:02:45,160 --> 04:02:50,160
And like, I think people, I think people have done really like beyond amazing job as being

2466
04:02:50,160 --> 04:02:55,160
incredibly clever with those characters or going, going in such interesting directions

2467
04:02:55,160 --> 04:03:01,160
that like whatever like Austin McConnell is trying to do, it sounds kind of like whatever.

2468
04:03:01,160 --> 04:03:05,160
And I'm pretty sure when the movie, when this movie is finished, it's going to be like very

2469
04:03:05,160 --> 04:03:06,160
mid.

2470
04:03:06,160 --> 04:03:11,160
It's not going to be like, and he's not going to be like incredibly good or incredibly bad.

2471
04:03:11,160 --> 04:03:14,160
He's going to be like, okay, I'm going to forget about it.

2472
04:03:14,160 --> 04:03:15,160
Yeah.

2473
04:03:15,160 --> 04:03:16,160
Did you?

2474
04:03:16,160 --> 04:03:17,160
Okay.

2475
04:03:17,160 --> 04:03:18,160
You know, Vito Gizwaldi.

2476
04:03:18,160 --> 04:03:19,160
Yeah.

2477
04:03:19,160 --> 04:03:22,160
Is he making like a comic?

2478
04:03:22,160 --> 04:03:24,160
I don't know.

2479
04:03:24,160 --> 04:03:29,160
He's making some kind of superhero thing.

2480
04:03:29,160 --> 04:03:32,160
And I don't know what the deal is with it, but I don't like that guy.

2481
04:03:32,160 --> 04:03:38,160
So it's probably bad, but I haven't, I don't know what the, I think it's called super killer.

2482
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:42,160
And I don't know what the deal is, but I kind of want to know just so I can be like, I was

2483
04:03:42,160 --> 04:03:43,160
right.

2484
04:03:43,160 --> 04:03:44,160
It's stupid.

2485
04:03:44,160 --> 04:03:45,160
Yeah.

2486
04:03:45,160 --> 04:03:51,160
That's the guy who just do the constantly like, oh, it's gone woke and now it sucks or he

2487
04:03:51,160 --> 04:03:52,160
does.

2488
04:03:52,160 --> 04:04:00,160
I think he does that like semi ironically, but not completely ironically, but like semi

2489
04:04:00,160 --> 04:04:01,160
ironically.

2490
04:04:01,160 --> 04:04:02,160
Yeah.

2491
04:04:02,160 --> 04:04:03,160
His thumbnail, learnaboutsuperkiller.org.

2492
04:04:03,160 --> 04:04:04,160
What is that?

2493
04:04:04,160 --> 04:04:05,160
You know, it's funny.

2494
04:04:05,160 --> 04:04:13,160
Like yesterday, a couple of days ago, I think I made like a tweet Friday saying like, hey

2495
04:04:13,160 --> 04:04:17,160
guys, post your comic recommendations that aren't like Marvel or DC.

2496
04:04:17,160 --> 04:04:22,160
And someone recommended the comic common America, which is not a good comic.

2497
04:04:22,160 --> 04:04:23,160
Common America.

2498
04:04:23,160 --> 04:04:25,160
Oh, I know about common America.

2499
04:04:25,160 --> 04:04:26,160
Yeah.

2500
04:04:26,160 --> 04:04:27,160
Common America sucks.

2501
04:04:27,160 --> 04:04:29,160
Oh, the one that Mary whether collabed with.

2502
04:04:29,160 --> 04:04:30,160
Yeah.

2503
04:04:30,160 --> 04:04:34,160
It's fucking even though they're like a bunch of fucking far right motherfuckers.

2504
04:04:34,160 --> 04:04:35,160
Yeah.

2505
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:36,160
A bunch of fucking MAGA heads.

2506
04:04:36,160 --> 04:04:42,160
It's like, it's like the most mid person teams up with like the worst person I know.

2507
04:04:42,160 --> 04:04:44,160
It's I was thinking about making a video.

2508
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:45,160
Cool.

2509
04:04:45,160 --> 04:04:46,160
Yeah.

2510
04:04:46,160 --> 04:04:55,160
I think because it fucking I have I talked about common America before on this podcast.

2511
04:04:55,160 --> 04:04:56,160
I think maybe a bit.

2512
04:04:56,160 --> 04:04:57,160
Yeah.

2513
04:04:57,160 --> 04:04:58,160
I know about it from you.

2514
04:04:58,160 --> 04:05:00,160
It's it's so it's so funny.

2515
04:05:00,160 --> 04:05:05,280
It's just so funny like the whole and I've probably have said this before where her origin

2516
04:05:05,280 --> 04:05:08,480
story is literally like, Oh, what's Peter Parker?

2517
04:05:08,480 --> 04:05:13,640
Oh, his uncle got shot due to him being like selfish and he's like, I must take responsibility

2518
04:05:13,640 --> 04:05:18,760
for these amazing powers I've gained while common America's origin is like one time my

2519
04:05:18,760 --> 04:05:23,800
science teacher told me to play baseball with boys, but I'm a girl.

2520
04:05:23,800 --> 04:05:25,920
I want to do girl things.

2521
04:05:25,920 --> 04:05:28,920
And then she gets the powers that's incredible.

2522
04:05:28,920 --> 04:05:31,080
It's fucking it's just it's just amazing.

2523
04:05:31,080 --> 04:05:33,160
And this this was this was the Marvel killer.

2524
04:05:33,160 --> 04:05:38,440
This was like, yeah, we're going to out so Marvel and DC fucking.

2525
04:05:38,440 --> 04:05:39,440
That's amazing.

2526
04:05:39,440 --> 04:05:40,440
All right.

2527
04:05:40,440 --> 04:05:41,440
Here it comes.

2528
04:05:41,440 --> 04:05:42,440
Super killer.

2529
04:05:42,440 --> 04:05:48,680
Give me give me the five give me the five second pitch on super killer.

2530
04:05:48,680 --> 04:05:53,040
Here comes super killer the multiverse is home to a variety of super powered individuals

2531
04:05:53,040 --> 04:05:56,480
nobles heroes who risk their lives to protect the world from destruction.

2532
04:05:56,480 --> 04:06:01,800
Fortunately, for a multiversal assassin, Sam King, these heroes won't be going down without

2533
04:06:01,800 --> 04:06:03,440
a fight.

2534
04:06:03,440 --> 04:06:07,720
So he okay, this comic's going to kick some ass.

2535
04:06:07,720 --> 04:06:08,720
Okay.

2536
04:06:08,720 --> 04:06:13,040
God fucking like like these these guys who are always like, like, oh, I'm going to make

2537
04:06:13,040 --> 04:06:16,840
my better superhero than Marvel and DC.

2538
04:06:16,840 --> 04:06:18,080
They always look awful.

2539
04:06:18,080 --> 04:06:23,280
Like none of them could design sounds like in superhero sounds so fucking generic.

2540
04:06:23,280 --> 04:06:31,440
He looks like a background character from my hero academia is a learn learn learn more.

2541
04:06:31,440 --> 04:06:35,680
This comp is going to is a hilarious blood soaked superhero romp where absolutely no

2542
04:06:35,680 --> 04:06:36,680
one is safe.

2543
04:06:36,680 --> 04:06:37,680
Okay.

2544
04:06:37,680 --> 04:06:41,680
So it's edgy superheroes.

2545
04:06:41,680 --> 04:06:45,520
I really super it's superheroes with blood.

2546
04:06:45,520 --> 04:06:46,520
It's terrible.

2547
04:06:46,520 --> 04:06:48,520
Here's a fucking sucks.

2548
04:06:48,520 --> 04:06:51,160
It's worse than I thought.

2549
04:06:51,160 --> 04:06:53,120
Isn't that Deadpool already?

2550
04:06:53,120 --> 04:06:57,280
This is like imagine if Deadpool had a bad design and sucked.

2551
04:06:57,280 --> 04:06:58,280
All right.

2552
04:06:58,280 --> 04:07:04,920
I come away from this pitch having what would what would I tell someone if I wanted to recommend

2553
04:07:04,920 --> 04:07:05,920
them super killer?

2554
04:07:05,920 --> 04:07:09,120
I'd be like, it's a superhero.

2555
04:07:09,120 --> 04:07:10,120
And he kills people.

2556
04:07:10,120 --> 04:07:11,120
What?

2557
04:07:11,120 --> 04:07:12,120
Oh, wow.

2558
04:07:12,120 --> 04:07:16,040
Never heard that one before fucking 10 and 10 idea.

2559
04:07:16,040 --> 04:07:17,040
I don't know.

2560
04:07:17,040 --> 04:07:18,040
Wow.

2561
04:07:18,040 --> 04:07:20,320
I thought there would be a hook, but there's but there's no hook.

2562
04:07:20,320 --> 04:07:22,640
I'd be lost at superhero.

2563
04:07:22,640 --> 04:07:25,280
I haven't been interested in a superhero design.

2564
04:07:25,280 --> 04:07:26,280
They lose you at superhero.

2565
04:07:26,280 --> 04:07:27,280
100 years.

2566
04:07:27,280 --> 04:07:28,280
Superhero.

2567
04:07:28,280 --> 04:07:31,320
But then you say, but and then you go, huh, then you get your back again and they and

2568
04:07:31,320 --> 04:07:34,000
then they put their mouth to you and they say, but he kills people.

2569
04:07:34,000 --> 04:07:36,160
And then you go, oh, no, you lost me again.

2570
04:07:36,160 --> 04:07:40,000
A superhero literally doing anything is like unappealing to me because I just don't like

2571
04:07:40,000 --> 04:07:41,000
what they are.

2572
04:07:41,000 --> 04:07:48,760
There's probably some twist on the formula that might be if they wear like a costume.

2573
04:07:48,760 --> 04:07:49,760
Get out of here.

2574
04:07:49,760 --> 04:07:50,760
They wear a mask.

2575
04:07:50,760 --> 04:07:54,560
If they have a double identity as a million is the same thing over and over again.

2576
04:07:54,560 --> 04:07:57,520
Superheroes are always the same.

2577
04:07:57,520 --> 04:07:58,520
Stop it.

2578
04:07:58,520 --> 04:08:02,440
You know, I'm so tired of superheroes.

2579
04:08:02,440 --> 04:08:05,360
The thing is, people talk about stuff like superhero fatigue.

2580
04:08:05,360 --> 04:08:09,040
Ultimately, you just need like one good superhero movie and then people usually shut up about

2581
04:08:09,040 --> 04:08:10,040
it.

2582
04:08:10,040 --> 04:08:13,440
But if someone's not interested in superheroes, that's fine, like there's no problem with

2583
04:08:13,440 --> 04:08:14,440
that.

2584
04:08:14,440 --> 04:08:15,440
I don't really care.

2585
04:08:15,440 --> 04:08:16,440
Okay.

2586
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:17,440
Okay.

2587
04:08:17,440 --> 04:08:18,440
I get it.

2588
04:08:18,440 --> 04:08:19,440
I get it.

2589
04:08:19,440 --> 04:08:20,440
Okay.

2590
04:08:20,440 --> 04:08:21,440
So the idea of super killer.

2591
04:08:21,440 --> 04:08:22,440
Okay.

2592
04:08:22,800 --> 04:08:25,160
He kills other superheroes.

2593
04:08:25,160 --> 04:08:30,720
It's basically like he kills characters that resemble other heroes that you might be more

2594
04:08:30,720 --> 04:08:31,720
familiar with.

2595
04:08:31,720 --> 04:08:39,720
Like he kills Superman types and he kills magical girls and he kills what's this guy?

2596
04:08:39,720 --> 04:08:40,720
What's this guy?

2597
04:08:40,720 --> 04:08:41,720
What?

2598
04:08:41,720 --> 04:08:42,720
Who?

2599
04:08:42,720 --> 04:08:43,720
Super killer?

2600
04:08:43,720 --> 04:08:44,720
A guy who looks like Batman.

2601
04:08:44,720 --> 04:08:48,840
He kills characters that remind you of comic.

2602
04:08:48,840 --> 04:08:51,280
This fucking sucks.

2603
04:08:51,280 --> 04:08:57,200
What if a superhero went around killing characters that you're familiar with?

2604
04:08:57,200 --> 04:08:59,640
God, you know this character.

2605
04:08:59,640 --> 04:09:03,640
You know, my expectations were low and I'm still disappointed.

2606
04:09:03,640 --> 04:09:06,160
Give, do you know this character?

2607
04:09:06,160 --> 04:09:07,160
Martial law?

2608
04:09:07,160 --> 04:09:08,160
No.

2609
04:09:08,160 --> 04:09:09,160
No.

2610
04:09:09,160 --> 04:09:14,920
It's drawn by Kevin O'Neill, which is a British artist.

2611
04:09:14,920 --> 04:09:15,920
You should know this, Gib.

2612
04:09:15,920 --> 04:09:18,120
But he put an American flag on the gun?

2613
04:09:18,120 --> 04:09:19,120
No.

2614
04:09:19,120 --> 04:09:20,800
Oh, because the story takes place in America.

2615
04:09:21,320 --> 04:09:25,000
An American flag on a gun is like, it's like, that's good.

2616
04:09:25,000 --> 04:09:29,240
Anyway, super killer just sounds like this.

2617
04:09:29,240 --> 04:09:36,120
I can see he's got like a Batman cowl on his little thing there, his little belt there.

2618
04:09:36,120 --> 04:09:37,120
Yeah.

2619
04:09:37,120 --> 04:09:43,080
It's funny because martial law is kind of like, imagine if someone like, what's the

2620
04:09:43,080 --> 04:09:47,560
name of that one political cartoonist who labels everything like a for a writer?

2621
04:09:47,560 --> 04:09:49,200
Oh, he's a libertarian.

2622
04:09:49,200 --> 04:09:50,200
Ben Garrison.

2623
04:09:50,200 --> 04:09:51,200
Yeah.

2624
04:09:51,200 --> 04:09:52,200
Yeah.

2625
04:09:52,200 --> 04:09:53,200
Yeah.

2626
04:09:53,200 --> 04:09:57,520
So like imagine if Ben Garrison like wrote like a superhero comic.

2627
04:09:57,520 --> 04:10:02,680
But the thing is that what's great about like martial law is that he's like a fucking,

2628
04:10:02,680 --> 04:10:04,200
he's like my favorite fascist.

2629
04:10:04,200 --> 04:10:06,880
He's a really awesome fascist character.

2630
04:10:06,880 --> 04:10:08,120
Hell yeah.

2631
04:10:08,120 --> 04:10:14,680
And and and basically like, so the gist is that he's basically a cop for superheroes,

2632
04:10:14,680 --> 04:10:15,680
right?

2633
04:10:16,040 --> 04:10:21,240
And but the thing is that in their universe, superheroes are like several things that aside

2634
04:10:21,240 --> 04:10:28,240
from like being like propped up as like protectors of like good in society.

2635
04:10:28,240 --> 04:10:35,120
The majority are superheroes are like former like war veterans who are who have superpowers

2636
04:10:35,120 --> 04:10:38,760
and are fucking insane and they just kill random people on the street.

2637
04:10:38,760 --> 04:10:39,760
Yeah.

2638
04:10:39,760 --> 04:10:45,640
And the and martial law comes in and fucking shoots the shit under and and rips them up

2639
04:10:45,760 --> 04:10:50,560
part and yeah, this actually martial law is like a big influence on villain verse.

2640
04:10:51,280 --> 04:10:56,080
Oh, wait, you might you might have mentioned this guy before, maybe, maybe.

2641
04:10:56,640 --> 04:10:57,000
Yeah.

2642
04:10:57,000 --> 04:11:02,960
And the the the book was like co-created by a thing, one of the guys behind Judge Dredd.

2643
04:11:04,440 --> 04:11:08,680
But but I think this also Linkara hates his book.

2644
04:11:08,680 --> 04:11:10,840
He really fucking does not like this character.

2645
04:11:11,280 --> 04:11:14,600
But I love this guy because Linkara is

2646
04:11:15,360 --> 04:11:18,280
like for every because he's woke.

2647
04:11:19,880 --> 04:11:22,160
Actually, I would say he's just stupid.

2648
04:11:22,240 --> 04:11:23,760
But I'm damn.

2649
04:11:23,760 --> 04:11:27,760
But for every kind of like interesting thing Linkara has to say, I feel like he always has

2650
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:29,840
two stupid things to say with it, too.

2651
04:11:30,360 --> 04:11:35,600
Because he talks about like, oh, I'm tired of stories where superheroes are bad.

2652
04:11:35,920 --> 04:11:39,800
We already know what superheroes being bad is like.

2653
04:11:39,800 --> 04:11:42,080
They're they're called super villain.

2654
04:11:42,560 --> 04:11:45,440
And it's like fucking the fucking card.

2655
04:11:45,440 --> 04:11:49,200
Wow, you know, do you not get the idea of a deconstruction?

2656
04:11:49,920 --> 04:11:54,880
Or or the fact that like or the fact that like, do you think cops are like all good?

2657
04:11:54,920 --> 04:11:57,200
Do you think like, wow, yeah, that really blows.

2658
04:11:57,760 --> 04:12:00,160
Do you think there's not like some sort of fucking moral?

2659
04:12:00,480 --> 04:12:02,760
Like maybe there's something else going on.

2660
04:12:02,760 --> 04:12:08,040
Maybe the fact that like you can't individually stop all crime one at a time

2661
04:12:08,040 --> 04:12:10,160
as a person, even with fucking superpowers.

2662
04:12:10,600 --> 04:12:16,120
And it's like, yeah, the idea, the idea is that the the superheroes are bad is not.

2663
04:12:16,120 --> 04:12:18,680
What if we made the superhero bad instead of good?

2664
04:12:18,680 --> 04:12:21,400
It's like the superhero does the things a superhero does.

2665
04:12:21,400 --> 04:12:24,880
But we see that, in fact, they are bad, actually.

2666
04:12:25,520 --> 04:12:29,120
I think what's great about martial law is that it has a really good design.

2667
04:12:29,120 --> 04:12:30,040
It's also very funny.

2668
04:12:30,040 --> 04:12:32,040
Everything is so exaggerated in martial law.

2669
04:12:32,040 --> 04:12:36,440
It's like it's also a cartoony, you know, like nothing is supposed to be taken like.

2670
04:12:37,320 --> 04:12:38,520
Like really seriously.

2671
04:12:38,520 --> 04:12:41,560
Like there's I think in the first story, I kind of have a problem

2672
04:12:41,560 --> 04:12:44,000
where they like take themselves too seriously at certain parts.

2673
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:47,640
But everything else is like very it's very like goofy with it.

2674
04:12:48,240 --> 04:12:52,240
And I mean, the biggest example is that all the characters have their

2675
04:12:52,240 --> 04:12:54,720
like beliefs just like written out on them.

2676
04:12:55,240 --> 04:12:59,840
And like, oh, he has fear and loafing on on his like stomach.

2677
04:13:00,200 --> 04:13:04,080
His right arm has barbed wire because one of his power, his powers

2678
04:13:04,080 --> 04:13:05,880
that he doesn't feel any pain.

2679
04:13:05,880 --> 04:13:09,960
So like he like, you know, he fights other superheroes and they can't really hurt him.

2680
04:13:10,680 --> 04:13:15,120
And I think my favorite story is is the second story.

2681
04:13:15,120 --> 04:13:18,920
The second martial art story, martial law story where he fights the Avengers

2682
04:13:19,520 --> 04:13:22,160
and they're like all members of like an insane asylum.

2683
04:13:22,760 --> 04:13:27,600
And he's mostly and it's it's the story works so good when like

2684
04:13:28,600 --> 04:13:30,880
they're just doing like goofy shit.

2685
04:13:30,880 --> 04:13:34,560
Like there's like a one scene in in the second story

2686
04:13:34,560 --> 04:13:39,880
where he's like chasing a punisher proxy who has like a swatze gun in his forehead.

2687
04:13:40,320 --> 04:13:43,800
And and they're fighting in an elevator and this

2688
04:13:44,720 --> 04:13:48,360
this punisher guy is about to like electrocute him with some wires.

2689
04:13:48,800 --> 04:13:53,000
And he and he says the word superhero to martial law.

2690
04:13:53,000 --> 04:13:56,080
And then martial art like fucking like gets so pissed off from here.

2691
04:13:56,080 --> 04:14:00,040
The word superhero is all like like, oh, you said the you said the secret

2692
04:14:00,040 --> 04:14:02,160
world superheroes, my Shazam.

2693
04:14:02,160 --> 04:14:04,480
Many fucking like rips apart whenever it's holding them.

2694
04:14:05,200 --> 04:14:08,960
And it's it's just so it's just the more goofy it is.

2695
04:14:08,960 --> 04:14:11,560
I think it's the more funny it is.

2696
04:14:11,560 --> 04:14:13,600
And it's it's it's great.

2697
04:14:13,600 --> 04:14:15,040
I really like it.

2698
04:14:15,040 --> 04:14:17,640
The super killer looks really fucking dull.

2699
04:14:17,640 --> 04:14:19,960
Like this this concept has been done fucking.

2700
04:14:19,960 --> 04:14:21,800
I see I see nothing appealing about it.

2701
04:14:22,280 --> 04:14:24,760
Well, I'm glad I'm glad we put that to bed.

2702
04:14:25,560 --> 04:14:28,040
The thing of me is that superheroes

2703
04:14:28,560 --> 04:14:30,680
aesthetically are dead to me.

2704
04:14:30,680 --> 04:14:35,080
I hate colorful costumes with wacky powers

2705
04:14:35,400 --> 04:14:38,560
that a child could come up with.

2706
04:14:38,560 --> 04:14:41,240
And even if it's good, even if it's like a great thing,

2707
04:14:41,400 --> 04:14:43,360
I just don't like the look of a superhero.

2708
04:14:43,360 --> 04:14:47,400
I feel upset when I see such things.

2709
04:14:47,520 --> 04:14:49,040
Yeah, feel enraged.

2710
04:14:49,040 --> 04:14:51,560
Yeah, there's something there's something there's something a little off

2711
04:14:51,560 --> 04:14:55,840
putting about the whole just the whole aesthetic of the spandex clad hero.

2712
04:14:55,840 --> 04:14:57,400
I agree. It's a bit.

2713
04:14:57,440 --> 04:14:59,160
I feel a little bit like about it.

2714
04:14:59,160 --> 04:15:03,160
The way you see if it hadn't been like pushed when I was a film

2715
04:15:03,160 --> 04:15:05,800
when I was a little kid like 30 years when I was a little kid.

2716
04:15:05,800 --> 04:15:08,640
I didn't I'm completely desensitized when I was a little kid.

2717
04:15:08,640 --> 04:15:11,520
I didn't like movies that had animals like cartoons about animals.

2718
04:15:11,520 --> 04:15:12,880
I thought animals were for babies.

2719
04:15:12,880 --> 04:15:14,360
I wanted humans only please.

2720
04:15:14,360 --> 04:15:17,080
So now as an adult, I feel the same way about superheroes.

2721
04:15:17,240 --> 04:15:18,120
It's for babies.

2722
04:15:18,120 --> 04:15:20,200
And I just feel sick when I see it.

2723
04:15:20,560 --> 04:15:23,960
Yeah, a little bit even shows like the boys that people tell me are good.

2724
04:15:23,960 --> 04:15:26,560
I'm like, yeah, but like it's a fucking superhero thing.

2725
04:15:26,600 --> 04:15:27,840
They're going to have powers.

2726
04:15:27,840 --> 04:15:29,800
They're going to be like powers.

2727
04:15:29,800 --> 04:15:30,600
I get it.

2728
04:15:30,600 --> 04:15:34,360
They're going to show that the good guys are the bad guys, actually,

2729
04:15:34,360 --> 04:15:36,520
because they serve the status quo already seen.

2730
04:15:36,520 --> 04:15:39,240
Watchmen, I don't need to see it again in a TV show.

2731
04:15:40,200 --> 04:15:41,400
We've been going for four.

2732
04:15:41,400 --> 04:15:42,440
That's my trigger hours.

2733
04:15:42,440 --> 04:15:46,640
I feel like maybe it's time to be wrapping up

2734
04:15:46,640 --> 04:15:49,880
and maybe getting to to one piece discussion pretty soon.

2735
04:15:50,400 --> 04:15:51,600
Yes.

2736
04:15:51,600 --> 04:15:54,480
Cheesy. Let's let's do you have I mean.

2737
04:15:55,480 --> 04:15:58,880
Do you have if there's any if there's any last words

2738
04:15:58,880 --> 04:16:01,960
before you make you walk the plank, you know, speak them now.

2739
04:16:01,960 --> 04:16:03,960
I guess.

2740
04:16:04,720 --> 04:16:08,600
You know, I'm not interested in stories of colorful characters

2741
04:16:08,600 --> 04:16:11,000
with powers that children would come up with.

2742
04:16:11,480 --> 04:16:13,640
OK, just say you won't reveal it or skip it.

2743
04:16:13,640 --> 04:16:14,560
Just say you don't like.

2744
04:16:14,560 --> 04:16:15,440
I will not.

2745
04:16:15,440 --> 04:16:19,160
I already read it in my face until you make more of it.

2746
04:16:20,360 --> 04:16:21,760
Whoa.

2747
04:16:21,760 --> 04:16:24,680
Yeah, more, more, more, more, more is coming.

2748
04:16:27,360 --> 04:16:28,960
Villain versus different.

2749
04:16:28,960 --> 04:16:29,800
It feels different.

2750
04:16:29,800 --> 04:16:30,720
They're villains.

2751
04:16:30,720 --> 04:16:33,680
They're not in New York or like some alternative,

2752
04:16:33,680 --> 04:16:37,000
like the same New York where petty crime is the reason

2753
04:16:37,000 --> 04:16:39,560
somebody puts on a superhero mask.

2754
04:16:39,560 --> 04:16:40,480
Why would you do that?

2755
04:16:40,480 --> 04:16:43,240
Why would you feel like it's not like, I mean,

2756
04:16:44,000 --> 04:16:45,800
they're not even like in a society.

2757
04:16:45,800 --> 04:16:47,560
They're just like a completely chaotic.

2758
04:16:47,560 --> 04:16:49,320
They're just all in a bunch of like spaceships,

2759
04:16:49,320 --> 04:16:51,400
just like trying to all try to kill each other.

2760
04:16:52,000 --> 04:16:53,600
I don't know, it doesn't it doesn't feel at all

2761
04:16:53,600 --> 04:16:55,080
like a superhero story.

2762
04:16:55,080 --> 04:16:57,440
It's just a bunch of like monsters in space.

2763
04:16:58,720 --> 04:17:02,560
That like you want to sometimes they fight each other, I guess.

2764
04:17:04,080 --> 04:17:06,320
Yeah, it's just everyone.

2765
04:17:06,320 --> 04:17:09,080
Just like literally everyone that exists in the world

2766
04:17:09,080 --> 04:17:11,400
is trying to kill everyone else, right, right?

2767
04:17:11,400 --> 04:17:12,560
Because it's all villains.

2768
04:17:12,560 --> 04:17:13,800
Yeah, yeah.

2769
04:17:13,800 --> 04:17:15,840
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

2770
04:17:15,840 --> 04:17:19,520
Well, there is a society, but like it doesn't whatever.

2771
04:17:19,520 --> 04:17:20,120
It doesn't matter.

2772
04:17:20,120 --> 04:17:22,240
It's not it's not crucial to the story I'm telling.

2773
04:17:22,240 --> 04:17:25,680
So it's not it's not like we don't really see it.

2774
04:17:27,840 --> 04:17:30,120
But yeah, anyway, pre-order make Paglacci.

2775
04:17:30,120 --> 04:17:33,560
You got like two days left on Sunday.

2776
04:17:33,560 --> 04:17:34,640
Should be the last day.

2777
04:17:34,640 --> 04:17:36,640
Actually, this Sunday, this coming Sunday,

2778
04:17:36,640 --> 04:17:38,800
I'm going to be on a live stream with a stereo.

2779
04:17:38,800 --> 04:17:39,560
Oh, cool.

2780
04:17:39,560 --> 04:17:41,520
And we're going to talk about we're going to talk about

2781
04:17:41,520 --> 04:17:43,880
make Paglacci ask him about his cancel Ben St.

2782
04:17:43,880 --> 04:17:48,360
shirt. Yeah, I'll I'll I'll ask him about that.

2783
04:17:49,160 --> 04:17:52,240
We're also going to be talking about the toddler show, Bluey.

2784
04:17:53,080 --> 04:17:54,960
I'm going to bluey I'm going to bluey pill

2785
04:17:54,960 --> 04:17:57,480
stereo on it.

2786
04:17:58,280 --> 04:18:00,040
I have some insight about the show.

2787
04:18:00,040 --> 04:18:03,000
I was on the ground floor for the show.

2788
04:18:03,200 --> 04:18:06,720
So, you know, congratulations.

2789
04:18:06,720 --> 04:18:08,160
But a bit of a deal.

2790
04:18:08,160 --> 04:18:09,320
Thank you.

2791
04:18:09,320 --> 04:18:10,360
Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.

2792
04:18:10,360 --> 04:18:13,240
Imagine imagine being into a kid's show for.

2793
04:18:13,240 --> 04:18:14,720
I can't imagine.

2794
04:18:14,720 --> 04:18:16,160
I would kill I would destroy myself.

2795
04:18:16,160 --> 04:18:18,120
I almost said I almost said kill myself.

2796
04:18:18,120 --> 04:18:20,040
But I would never say that.

2797
04:18:24,360 --> 04:18:26,640
Anyway, yeah, cool.

2798
04:18:27,720 --> 04:18:28,440
All right.

2799
04:18:28,440 --> 04:18:29,720
Prior to make Paglacci.

2800
04:18:29,720 --> 04:18:30,120
All right.

2801
04:18:30,120 --> 04:18:32,040
Thanks for joining us, Cheesy.

2802
04:18:33,240 --> 04:18:34,320
Now, get out of here.

2803
04:18:34,320 --> 04:18:37,960
You guys can you guys aren't going to do a voicemail.

2804
04:18:38,560 --> 04:18:41,240
We're going to do it after we do one piece of discussion.

2805
04:18:41,240 --> 04:18:41,920
That would be voicemail.

2806
04:18:41,920 --> 04:18:44,600
All right, then. Well, it's been it's been good.

2807
04:18:44,880 --> 04:18:46,120
I'll I'll talk.

2808
04:18:46,120 --> 04:18:47,240
Should we sink one more time?

2809
04:18:47,240 --> 04:18:48,640
Yeah, we can say one more time.

2810
04:18:48,640 --> 04:18:49,400
Yeah, that's good.

2811
04:18:49,400 --> 04:18:51,640
All right. Three, two, one, sink.

2812
04:18:52,320 --> 04:18:54,960
Sink three, two, one, sink.

2813
04:18:55,720 --> 04:18:56,280
Sink.

2814
04:18:56,280 --> 04:18:59,400
Elisa should probably use that one and not the early one.

2815
04:19:00,000 --> 04:19:01,520
Maybe sounds good.

2816
04:19:01,520 --> 04:19:02,400
All right. All right.

2817
04:19:02,400 --> 04:19:03,960
I'm going to stop recording.

2818
04:19:03,960 --> 04:19:04,800
Thanks for having me on.

2819
04:19:04,800 --> 04:19:05,800
I'll talk to you.

2820
04:19:05,800 --> 04:19:07,000
Our pleasure.

2821
04:19:07,000 --> 04:19:09,800
Thanks for jumping in.

2822
04:19:09,800 --> 04:19:11,560
All right.

2823
04:19:11,560 --> 04:19:13,440
All right.

2824
04:19:13,440 --> 04:19:15,600
Yeah, so I read I read one piece.

2825
04:19:15,600 --> 04:19:20,960
I read the new one piece while cheesy was talking about one piece, I think.

2826
04:19:23,360 --> 04:19:27,720
So let's go and 1078 escape limit.

2827
04:19:29,840 --> 04:19:33,200
So we've got a German 66

2828
04:19:34,160 --> 04:19:35,680
and Caesar clown.

2829
04:19:35,680 --> 04:19:38,040
They have formed neo-mads.

2830
04:19:38,200 --> 04:19:40,160
Yeah, I mean.

2831
04:19:40,160 --> 04:19:44,240
Neo-mads are two mad scientists together at last.

2832
04:19:44,240 --> 04:19:48,520
I think we could have gathered from the last one that they were going to team up, but OK.

2833
04:19:48,880 --> 04:19:51,280
I wonder what they're going to do.

2834
04:19:51,280 --> 04:19:54,600
Probably some mad science, if I had to guess.

2835
04:19:59,600 --> 04:20:01,280
Cool.

2836
04:20:01,800 --> 04:20:04,640
Well, I wonder how judge is going to react

2837
04:20:04,640 --> 04:20:08,560
to hearing that his son, Sanji, is in league with.

2838
04:20:08,560 --> 04:20:09,200
I saw.

2839
04:20:11,200 --> 04:20:13,920
For a while, I felt like we had too much Caesar clown.

2840
04:20:13,920 --> 04:20:18,520
I was kind of sick of Caesar clown for a while, but we haven't seen him in a bit.

2841
04:20:18,520 --> 04:20:20,800
So OK, yeah, yeah, bring him back.

2842
04:20:20,800 --> 04:20:22,640
Yeah, I mean, what was he?

2843
04:20:22,640 --> 04:20:24,720
He has been one of those consistent.

2844
04:20:25,320 --> 04:20:26,080
He was in punk.

2845
04:20:26,080 --> 04:20:27,480
He's been in like a lot of arcs.

2846
04:20:27,480 --> 04:20:32,160
Luffy. Luffy punched him and then law took his heart out

2847
04:20:32,720 --> 04:20:35,400
and he was a bargaining chip interest Rosa.

2848
04:20:36,200 --> 04:20:40,800
And then he continued with them, with law, I think,

2849
04:20:41,320 --> 04:20:46,760
as law still wanted him as a bargaining chip for some reason.

2850
04:20:46,920 --> 04:20:51,480
Like the thing that the thing that they wanted to trade him for didn't go through.

2851
04:20:52,400 --> 04:20:55,120
So he didn't trade him away.

2852
04:20:55,120 --> 04:20:57,080
So you got to keep him from trading away.

2853
04:20:57,080 --> 04:20:59,040
They ended up on a whole cake.

2854
04:20:59,040 --> 04:21:01,320
They ended up on a whole cake.

2855
04:21:01,320 --> 04:21:05,160
And I don't even know what, how he got there.

2856
04:21:06,360 --> 04:21:09,480
But he was involved with Capone gang, Beji.

2857
04:21:10,480 --> 04:21:13,080
And they had the the whole like big mom

2858
04:21:13,080 --> 04:21:17,240
assassination and Caesar is just like, I just want to go home.

2859
04:21:17,720 --> 04:21:20,480
I don't like this anymore.

2860
04:21:21,720 --> 04:21:24,000
Well, and now he did.

2861
04:21:24,840 --> 04:21:26,680
All right. He did.

2862
04:21:26,680 --> 04:21:28,520
Uncle Kizar is coming.

2863
04:21:28,520 --> 04:21:31,840
OK, you know, I'm just I'm just going to complain about Nate's complaints

2864
04:21:32,040 --> 04:21:33,920
because I watched him critique this chapter.

2865
04:21:34,120 --> 04:21:39,720
Nate doesn't like the the the the the the the diagram showing where people are.

2866
04:21:40,760 --> 04:21:43,480
He says they're he says their point.

2867
04:21:45,240 --> 04:21:47,080
They are a little hard to follow.

2868
04:21:47,080 --> 04:21:52,320
I think when when it's something big like the what's it called?

2869
04:21:52,320 --> 04:21:55,240
The big Skull Island in Wano.

2870
04:21:56,360 --> 04:21:59,240
Onigashima, it was very important.

2871
04:21:59,240 --> 04:22:01,720
I think the diagrams were extremely important in Wano.

2872
04:22:01,720 --> 04:22:07,240
You had to understand that the flying thing was going to crash into the other thing.

2873
04:22:07,240 --> 04:22:10,520
And you had to understand that like the lava was like, you know,

2874
04:22:10,520 --> 04:22:13,800
descending through floors and was going to hit the weapons, cash and detonate.

2875
04:22:15,320 --> 04:22:20,160
I yeah, I think it's more just to give you a grasp of the scale of the place

2876
04:22:20,160 --> 04:22:23,280
because you can't draw.

2877
04:22:23,280 --> 04:22:26,320
You can't draw like scene setting.

2878
04:22:26,840 --> 04:22:29,520
You can't waste time setting the scene every chapter.

2879
04:22:29,600 --> 04:22:32,200
You already know from the previous chapter that they're in a place.

2880
04:22:32,320 --> 04:22:34,440
But if you've forgotten, this is where they are.

2881
04:22:34,800 --> 04:22:40,320
And yeah, just give it like very quickly here, just in case you're confused.

2882
04:22:40,320 --> 04:22:42,160
And it is sometimes useful.

2883
04:22:42,160 --> 04:22:43,200
I don't really pay.

2884
04:22:43,200 --> 04:22:45,560
I don't really internalize them that much.

2885
04:22:45,560 --> 04:22:48,240
I mean, most of the time is like this building.

2886
04:22:48,520 --> 04:22:51,240
I can't remember which building is B, C or A.

2887
04:22:51,440 --> 04:22:56,040
I have no idea who is going from which place to which place or where everyone is.

2888
04:22:56,600 --> 04:22:59,640
They're just saying, during this scene, we're in this place.

2889
04:23:00,360 --> 04:23:03,280
And I guess it might be helpful later, but I don't hate it.

2890
04:23:04,640 --> 04:23:07,240
It's not doing much for me, particularly.

2891
04:23:08,240 --> 04:23:11,880
Sure, because everybody's walking around and.

2892
04:23:13,560 --> 04:23:17,040
Like on the map is not is not shown

2893
04:23:17,760 --> 04:23:22,440
where the seraphim have been fighting people.

2894
04:23:22,720 --> 04:23:25,520
Yeah, I don't really remember where everyone was.

2895
04:23:25,760 --> 04:23:28,640
I mean, it's true. I don't think about it like all the time.

2896
04:23:30,400 --> 04:23:37,400
But it probably is largely for people that are maybe a chapter behind or.

2897
04:23:38,400 --> 04:23:41,280
Just to just to just put a chapter behind you just read chapter.

2898
04:23:41,280 --> 04:23:46,640
I mean, just to establish that like these people are in separate locations that are related.

2899
04:23:47,920 --> 04:23:52,880
And then it's it's not really it's it's not always for knowing

2900
04:23:53,080 --> 04:23:56,560
it's not always for like getting a grasp of the whole situation for this.

2901
04:23:56,920 --> 04:24:01,960
I think it's just to show where these characters are without having to draw.

2902
04:24:02,400 --> 04:24:07,600
And then and then this next panel, this one of Stussy, Nate, Nate called this.

2903
04:24:08,080 --> 04:24:10,400
Can you believe he called this scuffed piece?

2904
04:24:10,920 --> 04:24:12,560
He said the line work was rough.

2905
04:24:12,560 --> 04:24:15,120
It was looking scuffed and we are in scuffed piece.

2906
04:24:16,120 --> 04:24:19,120
And like, it's fine. I mean, I fucking fine.

2907
04:24:20,120 --> 04:24:21,680
It is fine.

2908
04:24:23,200 --> 04:24:26,360
I I know what he means, though, over time,

2909
04:24:27,120 --> 04:24:32,760
Oda has obviously he's gotten older and maybe he's not as he's a bit looser.

2910
04:24:32,760 --> 04:24:37,360
If you go back to early chapters, it's a very much completely different style.

2911
04:24:38,960 --> 04:24:40,240
I think it looks.

2912
04:24:40,240 --> 04:24:42,480
Oh, you like the new. Yeah, I like the new as well.

2913
04:24:42,480 --> 04:24:44,600
I don't they don't bother me at all.

2914
04:24:47,160 --> 04:24:49,040
They they show you the thing.

2915
04:24:49,840 --> 04:24:52,760
That's how that's how it's got to be sometimes.

2916
04:24:52,760 --> 04:24:56,000
Sometimes it's just you got to get through

2917
04:24:56,800 --> 04:24:59,320
a panel of somebody talking on a thingy.

2918
04:25:00,080 --> 04:25:03,440
And it doesn't really matter if it's the most beautiful thing thing ever.

2919
04:25:03,440 --> 04:25:06,760
You want to save those moments for when you're doing like the big

2920
04:25:07,400 --> 04:25:09,600
the big reveals, the big punches.

2921
04:25:11,440 --> 04:25:12,840
OK, so.

2922
04:25:12,840 --> 04:25:17,200
And like, it's largely really good, even if it's a bit sloppy,

2923
04:25:17,400 --> 04:25:20,280
line art wise, compared to previous fine.

2924
04:25:21,440 --> 04:25:24,400
But it's got so much character, I say impression is wrong.

2925
04:25:26,320 --> 04:25:29,960
Well, sloppy in that it's like compared to previous one piece.

2926
04:25:30,600 --> 04:25:33,760
You know, lines don't always yeah, I connect.

2927
04:25:33,760 --> 04:25:38,040
There's some some some's like maybe the the pen is a bit thicker.

2928
04:25:38,440 --> 04:25:41,000
But like it's it's just it still has the character.

2929
04:25:41,000 --> 04:25:43,120
So that's been like it's been like this for a long time.

2930
04:25:43,120 --> 04:25:46,800
Like I literally I literally don't care and I literally don't understand

2931
04:25:46,800 --> 04:25:49,840
how someone could look at this and be like it looks worse than it used to

2932
04:25:49,840 --> 04:25:52,760
when the lines were cleaner, like I don't understand

2933
04:25:53,120 --> 04:25:55,240
feeling that way about the difference.

2934
04:25:56,800 --> 04:25:59,720
I yeah, I don't get it really.

2935
04:25:59,720 --> 04:26:02,320
I know that you can you can observe things,

2936
04:26:02,320 --> 04:26:05,120
but I don't know why you would get not even not even getting mad.

2937
04:26:05,120 --> 04:26:08,320
Just it to me, it looks better this way.

2938
04:26:09,480 --> 04:26:12,440
The the the the cleaness of the lines did not

2939
04:26:13,400 --> 04:26:16,440
make me did not impress me before, if anything.

2940
04:26:17,000 --> 04:26:19,520
I I would say that there's they're different.

2941
04:26:19,520 --> 04:26:21,720
I like old one piece as well.

2942
04:26:22,480 --> 04:26:23,640
I like an oil.

2943
04:26:23,640 --> 04:26:26,000
I'm I like I like scuffed piece.

2944
04:26:26,760 --> 04:26:28,760
I like it better.

2945
04:26:31,360 --> 04:26:33,960
I'm I'm I'm I'm reading.

2946
04:26:33,960 --> 04:26:38,120
So they're taking the government is taking the situation even more seriously

2947
04:26:38,120 --> 04:26:40,520
than Ohara. Yes, that's bad.

2948
04:26:40,600 --> 04:26:42,520
That's a bad sign.

2949
04:26:42,520 --> 04:26:43,840
They're going to do a super bomb.

2950
04:26:43,840 --> 04:26:46,280
Also, I forgot that Stussy was with Jim Bay

2951
04:26:46,280 --> 04:26:47,760
and we hadn't seen Jim Bay, I think.

2952
04:26:47,760 --> 04:26:51,720
So my my theory that it was to see with the gun, they're wrong.

2953
04:26:52,120 --> 04:26:54,320
Oh, Stussy, I don't know how to say it.

2954
04:26:54,320 --> 04:26:56,720
And I'm just going to say it wrong every time.

2955
04:26:56,720 --> 04:26:58,200
I it's got to be Stussy.

2956
04:26:58,200 --> 04:27:00,080
It's got to be Stussy.

2957
04:27:00,080 --> 04:27:02,840
Stussy, but then they say Luffy instead of Luffy.

2958
04:27:03,120 --> 04:27:06,800
So they so what are you what can be known, huh?

2959
04:27:08,640 --> 04:27:09,760
What can it possibly be?

2960
04:27:09,760 --> 04:27:10,480
That's you're right.

2961
04:27:10,480 --> 04:27:13,080
I mean, you're right. You're right. You're right.

2962
04:27:13,120 --> 04:27:17,080
I'm going to say Stussy until until I'm proven proven wrong.

2963
04:27:17,120 --> 04:27:22,520
Stussy, Factory A, Fabrio Stratum.

2964
04:27:22,520 --> 04:27:24,000
OK, I'm sorry.

2965
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:27,400
I don't know if this is annoying, but to to to rag on Nate even more,

2966
04:27:27,400 --> 04:27:33,280
he got like in a previous page, this building was written with it was

2967
04:27:33,280 --> 04:27:35,680
spelled like F-A-B-I-R-I-O.

2968
04:27:35,680 --> 04:27:39,040
It was spelled Fiberio, but it's actually supposed to be called Fabrio.

2969
04:27:39,840 --> 04:27:42,280
And he spent like he spent like five minutes being like,

2970
04:27:42,280 --> 04:27:44,560
oh, Oda, Oda made a mistake.

2971
04:27:44,560 --> 04:27:47,120
What a goof. He put an extra I in the name.

2972
04:27:47,560 --> 04:27:51,400
I mean, it could be hidden by the little bit there.

2973
04:27:52,200 --> 04:27:55,800
Yeah, like there's a space for it right where the panel.

2974
04:27:55,800 --> 04:27:58,440
Well, the text, well, the text says Fabrio.

2975
04:27:58,440 --> 04:28:01,840
Yes, but that's translated and it's a fan translation.

2976
04:28:01,840 --> 04:28:04,320
So they may not have realized.

2977
04:28:04,320 --> 04:28:06,600
Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah.

2978
04:28:06,600 --> 04:28:08,600
Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it could be.

2979
04:28:08,640 --> 04:28:10,280
Honestly, true.

2980
04:28:11,480 --> 04:28:15,280
It's one of those panel things where he does like a tiny sliver of a panel

2981
04:28:15,280 --> 04:28:17,640
to show that we're changing scene.

2982
04:28:17,640 --> 04:28:20,720
Yeah, changing scene or time is progressing.

2983
04:28:22,760 --> 04:28:24,520
Third or so.

2984
04:28:24,520 --> 04:28:28,200
Yeah, so Centimaru is here and from Stussy that.

2985
04:28:29,160 --> 04:28:32,040
Yeah, the CP zeros are a mission.

2986
04:28:33,040 --> 04:28:35,160
Was to eliminate the doctor.

2987
04:28:36,560 --> 04:28:39,040
And wait for the arrival of.

2988
04:28:41,040 --> 04:28:43,360
Wait for who's arrival, Kazaru, yes.

2989
04:28:43,360 --> 04:28:45,480
So the the the admiral.

2990
04:28:47,240 --> 04:28:49,880
And so Centimaru is like, OK, everybody,

2991
04:28:50,200 --> 04:28:52,480
all you little goofs and I don't even know who you are.

2992
04:28:52,720 --> 04:28:55,280
These little citizens, get out of here.

2993
04:28:55,400 --> 04:28:56,920
Save yourselves.

2994
04:28:56,920 --> 04:28:59,840
These random these random egghead citizens are awesome.

2995
04:28:59,920 --> 04:29:03,960
Yeah, I love I love in that they're all running away.

2996
04:29:04,640 --> 04:29:07,800
The the big robot in the back with the clockwork head.

2997
04:29:08,720 --> 04:29:09,560
Yeah, he's pretty good.

2998
04:29:09,560 --> 04:29:11,600
I think I like the little hooded guy down in the middle.

2999
04:29:11,600 --> 04:29:13,600
Also, yeah, the little hooded guy.

3000
04:29:13,600 --> 04:29:15,440
I mean, all of them, they're just so.

3001
04:29:15,440 --> 04:29:16,680
Yeah, yeah, they're great.

3002
04:29:16,680 --> 04:29:18,640
Nice little that that guy on the right.

3003
04:29:18,640 --> 04:29:21,240
I like I like the Phineas and Ferb guy over on the right.

3004
04:29:21,640 --> 04:29:23,720
Yeah, he is kind of like that.

3005
04:29:25,200 --> 04:29:28,000
Sexy lady in the front, she's very cute, you know.

3006
04:29:29,000 --> 04:29:31,840
If only it was so easy later sexy ladies

3007
04:29:32,640 --> 04:29:34,400
for me, then I could draw them all.

3008
04:29:34,400 --> 04:29:38,240
Oh, it doesn't even have to think about anything.

3009
04:29:39,040 --> 04:29:40,520
He's just brainless.

3010
04:29:40,520 --> 04:29:42,480
He's just drawing all this with no brain power.

3011
04:29:42,480 --> 04:29:45,440
Oh, oh, it just sneezes in a sexy big boob lady.

3012
04:29:45,440 --> 04:29:49,480
Just appears on this in a panel and he's like, that's not good enough.

3013
04:29:49,480 --> 04:29:52,040
That's a good power.

3014
04:29:52,040 --> 04:29:53,080
It's pretty good.

3015
04:29:53,080 --> 04:29:54,080
It's pretty good.

3016
04:29:54,080 --> 04:29:57,600
OK, so we flip over to third floor lab

3017
04:29:57,640 --> 04:29:59,840
building, see, no idea.

3018
04:29:59,840 --> 04:30:03,400
Sure, we got Frankie, who's not fully stoned.

3019
04:30:04,240 --> 04:30:05,360
He's only had a bit of that.

3020
04:30:05,360 --> 04:30:07,400
How did how did that happen?

3021
04:30:07,400 --> 04:30:09,560
He took a bite of stone stone.

3022
04:30:09,560 --> 04:30:10,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3023
04:30:10,400 --> 04:30:12,480
How did he only become a half petrified?

3024
04:30:12,480 --> 04:30:13,080
How does that work?

3025
04:30:13,080 --> 04:30:16,760
I believe it's been shown to happen with her powers before.

3026
04:30:16,760 --> 04:30:18,720
I don't think it's like.

3027
04:30:19,880 --> 04:30:20,800
I don't know, though.

3028
04:30:20,800 --> 04:30:24,840
I don't know if it's like a her vision thing, like a Medusa or whether.

3029
04:30:25,840 --> 04:30:30,320
Like her beam is where you turn into stone, or whether if you see it,

3030
04:30:30,320 --> 04:30:32,600
your body turns into stone fully.

3031
04:30:33,200 --> 04:30:35,520
I'm not entirely sure how it works.

3032
04:30:36,520 --> 04:30:38,760
Maybe Frank is just resisting the cuteness.

3033
04:30:39,720 --> 04:30:43,320
He either was like, yeah, not fully taken in by the cuteness,

3034
04:30:43,320 --> 04:30:45,720
or maybe the beam just didn't fully hit him.

3035
04:30:45,720 --> 04:30:47,200
He's so big, you see.

3036
04:30:47,760 --> 04:30:49,080
He is quite large.

3037
04:30:50,840 --> 04:30:52,000
All right, so.

3038
04:30:52,640 --> 04:30:55,200
So Usob and Lilith are fucked.

3039
04:30:56,760 --> 04:31:01,000
They're just they're just they're just dead unless unless she reverts them, right?

3040
04:31:01,000 --> 04:31:03,360
That's the yeah, that's the state here.

3041
04:31:03,520 --> 04:31:05,000
I think so.

3042
04:31:05,000 --> 04:31:08,720
Yeah, it could be a thing in the future was like, oh, chopper,

3043
04:31:08,720 --> 04:31:11,240
you found a way to unstone if I people.

3044
04:31:11,840 --> 04:31:16,760
If I mean, if anyone can like reverse the effects of a fruit, what if like?

3045
04:31:17,240 --> 04:31:18,280
OK, crazy idea.

3046
04:31:18,280 --> 04:31:21,240
What if like Seastone could just reverse it?

3047
04:31:21,240 --> 04:31:23,360
I feel like that would have been tried before.

3048
04:31:24,800 --> 04:31:26,680
And it would have been known that that works.

3049
04:31:27,560 --> 04:31:31,560
I mean, if I'm thinking like a fruit did something, Seastone is what I would think

3050
04:31:31,560 --> 04:31:34,080
to like undo the effects of a fruit.

3051
04:31:34,520 --> 04:31:37,280
But yeah, it wouldn't necessarily wouldn't necessarily work.

3052
04:31:37,440 --> 04:31:42,400
It wouldn't work for every particular fruit, because like what if the fire fruit

3053
04:31:42,400 --> 04:31:46,400
or what if a set fire to something you couldn't put the fire out with Seastone?

3054
04:31:46,680 --> 04:31:48,840
You would just need water.

3055
04:31:48,840 --> 04:31:49,960
Yeah, yeah.

3056
04:31:51,560 --> 04:31:54,120
Well, it was just an idea.

3057
04:31:54,120 --> 04:31:56,560
But Vagapunk, I'm sure Vagapunk could probably come up with something.

3058
04:31:56,560 --> 04:31:58,840
Yeah, so.

3059
04:31:58,840 --> 04:32:00,920
Little guy, I forgot his name.

3060
04:32:00,920 --> 04:32:02,480
I think it's Pythagoras.

3061
04:32:02,480 --> 04:32:03,960
He says Pythagoras.

3062
04:32:03,960 --> 04:32:06,680
Little lemon gets fucking crushed to death.

3063
04:32:06,840 --> 04:32:10,000
This is the guy that he puts his head in like the big body, right?

3064
04:32:10,560 --> 04:32:12,480
Yeah. Yeah.

3065
04:32:12,480 --> 04:32:13,640
Poor little guy.

3066
04:32:13,640 --> 04:32:14,360
You snake.

3067
04:32:14,360 --> 04:32:15,960
Getting fucking killed.

3068
04:32:15,960 --> 04:32:17,840
So crush.

3069
04:32:17,840 --> 04:32:19,400
So Lilith is dead.

3070
04:32:19,440 --> 04:32:22,840
Pythagoras is seems to have been killed here.

3071
04:32:23,960 --> 04:32:26,160
Lilith is stone, Pythagoras crushed.

3072
04:32:27,440 --> 04:32:29,640
Wait, I said she doesn't fully stone him.

3073
04:32:30,440 --> 04:32:32,440
She just leaves him like that.

3074
04:32:33,880 --> 04:32:36,960
Well, she stops because she said somebody says wait.

3075
04:32:37,400 --> 04:32:40,040
Oh, it's not Frankie yelling.

3076
04:32:40,040 --> 04:32:42,440
Yeah. Well, somebody's saying wait, it could be Frankie.

3077
04:32:42,520 --> 04:32:45,440
It looks like she's walking away from this explosion.

3078
04:32:45,440 --> 04:32:48,760
Like I thought she crushed Pythagoras and that like caused the explosion.

3079
04:32:48,760 --> 04:32:52,360
And then she's walking away from it and Frankie is yelling like wait, wait.

3080
04:32:52,720 --> 04:32:54,000
But no, she's looking to the side.

3081
04:32:54,000 --> 04:32:55,320
It might think it's someone else.

3082
04:32:55,320 --> 04:32:57,200
That's a big explosion.

3083
04:32:57,200 --> 04:33:00,160
Yeah. Is that just is that from crushing Pythagoras?

3084
04:33:00,440 --> 04:33:03,040
I can only assume it's like one panel.

3085
04:33:03,040 --> 04:33:05,440
One panel gets crushed and then the other one explodes.

3086
04:33:06,800 --> 04:33:10,400
Yeah, I don't quite understand what's exploding, but I guess it's

3087
04:33:11,040 --> 04:33:14,040
guess it would explode immediately when her foot crushed him.

3088
04:33:14,040 --> 04:33:17,040
So she would be caught in the explosion and not walking away from it.

3089
04:33:18,040 --> 04:33:21,200
But a little confusing, a little weird.

3090
04:33:21,200 --> 04:33:22,520
Yeah, I get it.

3091
04:33:22,520 --> 04:33:27,600
Then we got Robin and Chopper and Big Lady.

3092
04:33:28,720 --> 04:33:29,720
What's her name?

3093
04:33:29,720 --> 04:33:31,320
I don't remember the big one.

3094
04:33:31,320 --> 04:33:33,440
Atlas Atlas. Yeah, there it is.

3095
04:33:33,440 --> 04:33:38,240
Well, all those they're they're hearing all about all of this death

3096
04:33:38,240 --> 04:33:39,520
and destruction that's happening.

3097
04:33:39,520 --> 04:33:44,520
And Robin's saying we should probably go and find the real Vega punk

3098
04:33:44,640 --> 04:33:49,040
because, you know, that's the that's important.

3099
04:33:50,840 --> 04:33:51,920
And so they will go.

3100
04:33:51,920 --> 04:33:55,520
And so I think they're going to Robin and Chopper are going to be the ones

3101
04:33:55,520 --> 04:33:58,480
fighting in that in that environment.

3102
04:34:00,120 --> 04:34:02,080
There's a room that's been sealed off for a while.

3103
04:34:02,080 --> 04:34:04,200
And I wrote it off since the place isn't useful.

3104
04:34:04,920 --> 04:34:08,720
OK, OK, so they're following Sanji's.

3105
04:34:09,160 --> 04:34:12,120
But they're following Nami's scream.

3106
04:34:12,160 --> 04:34:14,320
Because they think Sanji will go there, too.

3107
04:34:14,880 --> 04:34:19,400
And then no, no, no, no, they're saying that Nami will be fine

3108
04:34:19,400 --> 04:34:20,880
because Sanji will go to her.

3109
04:34:20,880 --> 04:34:23,120
We should instead focus on finding Vega punk.

3110
04:34:23,520 --> 04:34:26,720
And Atlas is like, oh, I think he could maybe be in this place.

3111
04:34:26,720 --> 04:34:28,680
And it's probably the right place.

3112
04:34:28,680 --> 04:34:33,840
Yeah. OK, so Brooke and Nami and Edison.

3113
04:34:35,720 --> 04:34:37,680
I don't remember. I don't even remember what Edison's deal.

3114
04:34:37,680 --> 04:34:39,400
Did they found they found him like this, right?

3115
04:34:39,400 --> 04:34:41,280
Because Edison got like jumped by someone.

3116
04:34:42,120 --> 04:34:44,080
I think so.

3117
04:34:44,120 --> 04:34:46,480
I think they found him busted up.

3118
04:34:46,480 --> 04:34:49,920
But they also were fighting the Jinbei Seraphim just then.

3119
04:34:50,440 --> 04:34:53,720
Oh, Nami used the cloud that she got from Big Mom.

3120
04:34:54,600 --> 04:34:56,520
I forget his name. I forget everyone's name.

3121
04:34:56,520 --> 04:34:58,520
There's too many names.

3122
04:35:00,040 --> 04:35:02,960
She zapped him and then Sanji is there

3123
04:35:03,520 --> 04:35:08,440
taking the punches, fighting him while they are thinking about stuff.

3124
04:35:08,920 --> 04:35:13,240
Brooke is going to go scout for Vega punk with his funny ghost ability.

3125
04:35:14,200 --> 04:35:16,280
So this so this bit of Sanji getting punched.

3126
04:35:16,280 --> 04:35:19,840
This is another thing that Nate spent a lot of time on

3127
04:35:20,440 --> 04:35:24,360
because his eyebrow is reversed.

3128
04:35:25,600 --> 04:35:29,240
Normal like like his normally his eyebrow curls at the bottom.

3129
04:35:29,800 --> 04:35:32,480
But here it curls at the top and apparently.

3130
04:35:34,120 --> 04:35:36,400
And apparently this is like confirmed in an SPS.

3131
04:35:36,400 --> 04:35:40,200
Apparently this means that like he's activating his germa powers.

3132
04:35:42,520 --> 04:35:45,760
It's like a germa. It's like, yeah, the like the left eyebrow.

3133
04:35:46,440 --> 04:35:49,680
OK, like, you know how the eyebrow that used to be covered

3134
04:35:49,880 --> 04:35:54,360
curls at the top and the and the one that's now uncovered curls at the bottom.

3135
04:35:54,640 --> 04:35:56,920
But the fact that it in this panel curling at the top

3136
04:35:57,080 --> 04:35:59,680
means that the eyebrow swirl direction has reversed.

3137
04:35:59,960 --> 04:36:03,280
And his eyebrows swirl the other way from his siblings.

3138
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:04,880
But now it's gone the other way.

3139
04:36:04,880 --> 04:36:06,800
So now it's swirling the same way as the siblings.

3140
04:36:06,800 --> 04:36:09,640
So he's in like germa science mode. Apparently.

3141
04:36:10,640 --> 04:36:12,400
Is that something to be complaining about?

3142
04:36:12,400 --> 04:36:14,480
I thought that that means it makes sense.

3143
04:36:14,560 --> 04:36:15,800
They was a mistake.

3144
04:36:15,800 --> 04:36:18,520
Nate was complaining that he was looking at another panel.

3145
04:36:19,120 --> 04:36:23,320
I think the idea was that there was another panel where he did seem to be

3146
04:36:23,320 --> 04:36:27,960
using like germa science, but his eyebrow was not in reverse mode.

3147
04:36:29,920 --> 04:36:32,000
Yeah, one of them is a mistake.

3148
04:36:32,120 --> 04:36:36,560
I mean, I was just I was interested because apparently this is like a real thing

3149
04:36:36,760 --> 04:36:39,520
that's not bullshit and like it's in SPS's.

3150
04:36:39,800 --> 04:36:43,200
So this eyebrow swirl thing actually is real.

3151
04:36:43,800 --> 04:36:46,840
So I guess when he says it's the undying power of love, it's actually like.

3152
04:36:48,760 --> 04:36:51,680
I mean, everything everything he does is the power of love, right?

3153
04:36:51,720 --> 04:36:53,520
Yeah, because he's.

3154
04:36:53,520 --> 04:37:00,960
My I think it's he's like he didn't like his germa family connection and his power.

3155
04:37:01,120 --> 04:37:05,520
You didn't like using the funny capsule with the suit and the cape or whatever.

3156
04:37:05,960 --> 04:37:08,600
Yeah, but he is a super soldier.

3157
04:37:09,480 --> 04:37:12,800
So I guess he's like harnessing some of that power to get punched in the face

3158
04:37:12,800 --> 04:37:14,640
and not even doesn't look like he's using hacky.

3159
04:37:14,640 --> 04:37:16,720
I guess he might be so well.

3160
04:37:17,160 --> 04:37:19,600
So I'm sorry, remind me.

3161
04:37:20,760 --> 04:37:24,200
They said that like Sanji was the only one that didn't have superpowers,

3162
04:37:24,200 --> 04:37:26,800
but like he does have superpowers, right?

3163
04:37:27,000 --> 04:37:28,280
He can't. Yeah.

3164
04:37:28,400 --> 04:37:32,400
Yes, they call him a failure because he had too many emotions, I think.

3165
04:37:32,840 --> 04:37:35,760
The other ones were more emotionless and violent.

3166
04:37:35,760 --> 04:37:38,720
But because Sanji loved his mother and his mother was nice,

3167
04:37:39,880 --> 04:37:45,320
that he was like he's the freak and maybe he's like the half super kid.

3168
04:37:45,640 --> 04:37:50,760
So he's got some latent powers, but he's more of a human than his siblings.

3169
04:37:51,200 --> 04:37:56,160
A pair of parents aren't shown to be like totally like inhumane either.

3170
04:37:56,720 --> 04:37:58,560
They have the girl.

3171
04:37:58,560 --> 04:38:00,000
The girl has emotions.

3172
04:38:00,000 --> 04:38:04,640
Yeah, so it's not even like it's a it's a true thing that they're like robots.

3173
04:38:04,880 --> 04:38:08,040
Yeah, so she just doesn't like being nasty.

3174
04:38:08,480 --> 04:38:14,040
Apparently, the eyebrow swirl direction is like a is some kind of tell with that.

3175
04:38:14,040 --> 04:38:16,960
So that's interesting, never picked up on that before.

3176
04:38:19,800 --> 04:38:25,400
All right, yes, Zoro and Luffy Zoro, Luffy fighting Kuma.

3177
04:38:25,840 --> 04:38:27,840
We're weird little baby Kuma.

3178
04:38:28,320 --> 04:38:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3179
04:38:31,280 --> 04:38:33,560
And Hawkeye and Hawkeye, but he's gone.

3180
04:38:34,240 --> 04:38:36,360
He's reprioritized the order of his targets.

3181
04:38:36,720 --> 04:38:42,040
He's going after the weaker straw hats to demoralize the stronger ones.

3182
04:38:42,880 --> 04:38:44,960
Divious, devious.

3183
04:38:46,800 --> 04:38:51,200
Yes, so Zoro and Kaku have to go stop Hawkeye,

3184
04:38:51,840 --> 04:38:53,480
which is, I mean, makes sense.

3185
04:38:53,480 --> 04:38:55,480
They're already like paired up against that guy.

3186
04:38:57,160 --> 04:39:00,760
So now it's the two strong and the other two strong with swords going off

3187
04:39:00,760 --> 04:39:03,880
to the guy with swords and the other guy is going to kind of I kind of feel

3188
04:39:03,880 --> 04:39:05,760
like this actually puts the odds more in their favor.

3189
04:39:05,760 --> 04:39:06,080
I don't know.

3190
04:39:06,080 --> 04:39:10,320
I feel like a one on I feel like a two on one fight is more unbalanced.

3191
04:39:10,360 --> 04:39:17,000
Two two on one fights is better for the two than than the one two and one one four

3192
04:39:17,000 --> 04:39:20,840
on two fight. Yeah. Yeah, because you can do pincer attacks.

3193
04:39:20,880 --> 04:39:23,360
You can do strategic maneuvers, you see.

3194
04:39:25,880 --> 04:39:29,960
It is funny also that Luffy calls Kaku Usopp because of his nose.

3195
04:39:29,960 --> 04:39:31,840
Oh, I didn't mean I didn't even catch that.

3196
04:39:33,160 --> 04:39:35,680
Quick, go get him, I didn't even notice.

3197
04:39:35,680 --> 04:39:37,800
Lol, that's good.

3198
04:39:39,520 --> 04:39:43,720
All right, so Luffy's punching Luchi said, you can't just punch him.

3199
04:39:44,680 --> 04:39:47,080
Doesn't matter how many times you try hitting it, that won't work.

3200
04:39:47,080 --> 04:39:50,080
And it looks like it's not true.

3201
04:39:50,120 --> 04:39:53,880
It's I guess I mean, it's he's definitely he's definitely recoiling

3202
04:39:53,880 --> 04:39:57,240
from the blows, maybe he's not doing any real damage.

3203
04:39:57,840 --> 04:40:02,400
Yeah, if nothing else, he's getting interrupted so we can't be doing anything.

3204
04:40:02,560 --> 04:40:05,560
Yeah. OK, and then we've got.

3205
04:40:06,640 --> 04:40:11,200
Only one only one day remains before the famous egghead incident.

3206
04:40:11,560 --> 04:40:12,480
However, this is funny.

3207
04:40:12,480 --> 04:40:15,040
This is like the first future tense.

3208
04:40:15,760 --> 04:40:19,680
Like, yeah, what you're reading right now is going to be so big

3209
04:40:19,720 --> 04:40:23,400
in a few days. Is is that what that is that like a narration?

3210
04:40:23,400 --> 04:40:25,680
Or is that like her memory?

3211
04:40:25,680 --> 04:40:29,880
Like in the is that memory she's experiencing in the Kuma bubble?

3212
04:40:30,280 --> 04:40:33,560
No, I think we're just looking at Bonnie to see where she is.

3213
04:40:33,560 --> 04:40:35,840
She's crying. Yeah. Yeah.

3214
04:40:35,840 --> 04:40:39,280
And and it's not about her this narration.

3215
04:40:39,280 --> 04:40:40,840
It's about the egghead incident.

3216
04:40:40,840 --> 04:40:41,840
It's very strange.

3217
04:40:41,840 --> 04:40:43,800
It's very strange for the narration to just come up with.

3218
04:40:43,800 --> 04:40:49,080
Yeah, a big important thing called the egghead incident is happening one day from now.

3219
04:40:49,440 --> 04:40:50,880
But let's go back.

3220
04:40:50,880 --> 04:40:53,520
But for now, let's journey back into the past.

3221
04:40:53,800 --> 04:40:59,120
I think, yeah, it's maybe odd phrasing, but it's really just how do we get here?

3222
04:40:59,120 --> 04:41:01,800
And that's yeah, yeah, that's what they get to.

3223
04:41:03,040 --> 04:41:06,080
So marriage war and they're getting

3224
04:41:06,800 --> 04:41:12,880
marriage war is getting the the the the call from a head about the void century.

3225
04:41:14,800 --> 04:41:15,120
Dr.

3226
04:41:15,120 --> 04:41:17,600
Vega Punk is reaching the void century.

3227
04:41:17,600 --> 04:41:18,760
OK, this is the informant.

3228
04:41:18,800 --> 04:41:23,400
This is the trader informing the CP five agents were dispatched.

3229
04:41:24,640 --> 04:41:28,400
They didn't learn anything.

3230
04:41:28,400 --> 04:41:31,280
And the ships were attacked.

3231
04:41:32,720 --> 04:41:35,400
And so.

3232
04:41:35,400 --> 04:41:39,920
They send more agents and then it is turned into a big thing.

3233
04:41:41,800 --> 04:41:43,440
I wonder about this, because like.

3234
04:41:44,200 --> 04:41:51,760
I suppose the idea for this traitor is to, excuse me, I need a I need a water right now.

3235
04:41:51,760 --> 04:41:53,240
Oh, I have to pee.

3236
04:41:53,240 --> 04:41:54,240
You know what?

3237
04:41:54,240 --> 04:41:56,400
I mean, let's let's take a quick break.

3238
04:41:56,400 --> 04:41:57,400
One second.

3239
04:41:58,400 --> 04:42:02,680
Seltzer, pure Aqua Seltzer, very flavorful.

3240
04:42:02,680 --> 04:42:03,680
Yeah.

3241
04:42:04,960 --> 04:42:05,960
So.

3242
04:42:05,960 --> 04:42:08,080
So as I was saying, I'll say what I was saying again.

3243
04:42:09,080 --> 04:42:11,520
So CP five agents were dispatched.

3244
04:42:11,560 --> 04:42:16,360
And then their ship vanished and we know they ended up in a pod and then more agents were sent

3245
04:42:16,360 --> 04:42:20,000
and they also ended up in the same pod, starving to death.

3246
04:42:22,000 --> 04:42:28,960
Now, the reason for doing that, I wasn't sure at first, but now I guess the point is to escalate

3247
04:42:28,960 --> 04:42:34,520
the the mystery for the government if the agents are disappearing.

3248
04:42:34,520 --> 04:42:36,960
Because if you just say, Dr.

3249
04:42:36,960 --> 04:42:39,400
Vega Punk is researching the void century.

3250
04:42:39,440 --> 04:42:43,280
So anonymous informant, the government sends agents, they find nothing.

3251
04:42:43,280 --> 04:42:44,280
They go back.

3252
04:42:44,280 --> 04:42:45,280
They say there was nothing there.

3253
04:42:45,280 --> 04:42:46,280
Seen fine.

3254
04:42:46,280 --> 04:42:47,280
Right.

3255
04:42:47,280 --> 04:42:49,280
Maybe they maybe they think, oh, it's just a prank call.

3256
04:42:49,280 --> 04:42:51,120
It's just that it's not a real thing.

3257
04:42:53,120 --> 04:42:59,800
So you think the trader specifically kidnapped them so that they would send more powerful

3258
04:42:59,800 --> 04:43:00,800
agents?

3259
04:43:00,800 --> 04:43:03,480
Yes, I think that makes that does make sense.

3260
04:43:03,480 --> 04:43:04,480
Yeah.

3261
04:43:04,480 --> 04:43:05,480
Yes.

3262
04:43:06,480 --> 04:43:14,400
And eventually they got to talk to the Gorosei, totally exposing the full extent of the genius

3263
04:43:14,400 --> 04:43:17,000
scientist's treachery.

3264
04:43:17,000 --> 04:43:28,280
So they decided upon the assassination Cypher Cypher Paul Zero was sent and then the five

3265
04:43:28,280 --> 04:43:31,200
elders anticipated that Vega Punk would resist.

3266
04:43:31,200 --> 04:43:37,400
They said one of their own escorted by Admiral Kizaru, this is this is weird as talking in

3267
04:43:37,400 --> 04:43:40,320
past tense about the present.

3268
04:43:40,320 --> 04:43:41,320
It is weird.

3269
04:43:41,320 --> 04:43:42,320
Yeah.

3270
04:43:42,320 --> 04:43:45,720
Well, I mean, they sent them this this was the this.

3271
04:43:45,720 --> 04:43:48,920
This is how the decision was made to do this.

3272
04:43:48,920 --> 04:43:52,800
So it did happen a little while ago, a little while.

3273
04:43:52,800 --> 04:43:54,840
They also reinforced the fleet.

3274
04:43:54,840 --> 04:43:57,840
They deployed with backup from several naval broncers.

3275
04:43:57,840 --> 04:44:00,480
I like some of these designs are like the long beard guy.

3276
04:44:00,480 --> 04:44:02,160
We saw that guy.

3277
04:44:02,160 --> 04:44:03,720
We definitely saw that guy before.

3278
04:44:03,720 --> 04:44:07,320
I commented on that guy in like a previous chapter.

3279
04:44:07,320 --> 04:44:08,320
He was like standing.

3280
04:44:08,320 --> 04:44:11,320
I think he was like with the Gorosei or with Kizaru and I was like, who the fuck's that

3281
04:44:11,320 --> 04:44:12,320
guy?

3282
04:44:12,320 --> 04:44:13,320
So he's cool.

3283
04:44:13,320 --> 04:44:14,320
Yeah.

3284
04:44:14,320 --> 04:44:15,320
He does look cool.

3285
04:44:15,320 --> 04:44:18,680
And the many chins man.

3286
04:44:18,680 --> 04:44:19,680
Is that a fish man?

3287
04:44:19,680 --> 04:44:20,680
I think that's a fish man.

3288
04:44:20,680 --> 04:44:22,760
That's gotta be that's gotta be a fish man.

3289
04:44:22,760 --> 04:44:25,920
The caution level was raised to total war imminent.

3290
04:44:25,920 --> 04:44:29,560
So this is so like weeks ago when I was saying, wow.

3291
04:44:29,600 --> 04:44:31,400
So everything's going well.

3292
04:44:31,400 --> 04:44:33,680
They're just going to get Vega Punk and leave.

3293
04:44:33,680 --> 04:44:35,320
So easy.

3294
04:44:35,320 --> 04:44:37,320
Nothing's going to go wrong.

3295
04:44:37,320 --> 04:44:38,320
Right.

3296
04:44:38,320 --> 04:44:39,320
Yeah, they're not.

3297
04:44:39,320 --> 04:44:40,720
How could it possibly continue?

3298
04:44:40,720 --> 04:44:44,680
And they seem, of course, they seem intent on pressing the issue.

3299
04:44:44,680 --> 04:44:45,680
Yeah.

3300
04:44:45,680 --> 04:44:49,520
Then the sudden unexpected appearance of Emperor Straw Hat Luffy's shit.

3301
04:44:49,520 --> 04:44:50,520
Look at these.

3302
04:44:50,520 --> 04:44:51,520
Look at these simple clouds.

3303
04:44:51,520 --> 04:44:53,680
Look at these cartoony clouds behind.

3304
04:44:53,680 --> 04:44:54,680
This is scuffed piece.

3305
04:44:54,680 --> 04:44:55,680
You know what Nate's right.

3306
04:44:55,680 --> 04:44:57,680
It's comic sucks.

3307
04:44:57,680 --> 04:44:58,680
Wait, which where?

3308
04:44:58,800 --> 04:45:02,360
Oh, and the one of the going Mary.

3309
04:45:02,360 --> 04:45:04,400
You mean the sunny go?

3310
04:45:04,400 --> 04:45:06,400
Is it not called the going Mary?

3311
04:45:06,400 --> 04:45:08,400
That's the first one.

3312
04:45:08,400 --> 04:45:09,400
The sunny.

3313
04:45:09,400 --> 04:45:10,400
Yeah, the sunny go.

3314
04:45:10,400 --> 04:45:11,400
No, you're right.

3315
04:45:11,400 --> 04:45:12,400
Thousand sunny.

3316
04:45:12,400 --> 04:45:13,400
The thousand sunny.

3317
04:45:13,400 --> 04:45:14,400
Yes.

3318
04:45:14,400 --> 04:45:20,200
Just look at there's no no tone, no tone in the sky, no shading on the clouds, scuffed

3319
04:45:20,200 --> 04:45:21,200
piece.

3320
04:45:21,200 --> 04:45:25,800
Yeah, but they it's only looks good.

3321
04:45:25,800 --> 04:45:26,800
It's fine.

3322
04:45:26,800 --> 04:45:29,080
It could have used a little it could have used a little screen tone.

3323
04:45:29,080 --> 04:45:32,280
It could have used a little depth, but it's OK.

3324
04:45:32,280 --> 04:45:33,280
It's fine.

3325
04:45:33,280 --> 04:45:34,280
It's fine.

3326
04:45:34,280 --> 04:45:35,280
I'm not mad.

3327
04:45:35,280 --> 04:45:36,280
I'm not mad.

3328
04:45:36,280 --> 04:45:37,280
I'm not mad.

3329
04:45:37,280 --> 04:45:38,280
I like that.

3330
04:45:38,280 --> 04:45:43,560
I don't really think of the Straw Hats as like an emperor like a Luffy's an emperor.

3331
04:45:43,560 --> 04:45:44,560
Yeah.

3332
04:45:44,560 --> 04:45:51,200
Did they declare him one when the that the last yes, Morgan declared him one after the

3333
04:45:51,200 --> 04:45:52,200
events of whole cake.

3334
04:45:52,200 --> 04:45:53,200
I think.

3335
04:45:53,200 --> 04:45:54,200
Does he get to decide that?

3336
04:45:54,200 --> 04:45:55,200
Is that his job?

3337
04:45:55,440 --> 04:45:58,760
Well, I think there's no like official status.

3338
04:45:58,760 --> 04:45:59,760
It's not like.

3339
04:45:59,760 --> 04:46:03,120
Oh, it's not like the Shichi Bukai, which was like an official government job.

3340
04:46:03,120 --> 04:46:04,360
It's an official government thing.

3341
04:46:04,360 --> 04:46:06,120
And it's not like anything in particular.

3342
04:46:06,120 --> 04:46:10,720
It's just like who is who is considered the biggest, baddest pirate in the entire world.

3343
04:46:10,720 --> 04:46:11,720
Yeah.

3344
04:46:11,720 --> 04:46:12,720
The emperors.

3345
04:46:12,720 --> 04:46:17,440
So I guess Big News Morgan does get to decide that because he fucking he controls the narrative

3346
04:46:17,440 --> 04:46:20,440
and he thought, wouldn't it be fucking funny if this happened?

3347
04:46:20,440 --> 04:46:21,440
Yeah.

3348
04:46:21,440 --> 04:46:22,440
Yeah.

3349
04:46:22,440 --> 04:46:23,440
Yeah.

3350
04:46:23,440 --> 04:46:24,440
Lamal.

3351
04:46:24,440 --> 04:46:31,560
So now after the events of one, oh, they know Luffy has the the whatever fruit and the Nica

3352
04:46:31,560 --> 04:46:36,040
fruit and they're like, they they're looking at him more like with a, oh, we thought you

3353
04:46:36,040 --> 04:46:39,680
were just a rubber boy, but actually you're you're a protagonist, but actually you're

3354
04:46:39,680 --> 04:46:41,440
a joy for you're a joy boy.

3355
04:46:41,440 --> 04:46:42,440
Oh, you ate the joy.

3356
04:46:42,440 --> 04:46:43,440
You ate the joy.

3357
04:46:43,440 --> 04:46:44,440
Joy fruit.

3358
04:46:44,440 --> 04:46:45,440
Yeah.

3359
04:46:45,440 --> 04:46:46,440
Yeah.

3360
04:46:46,440 --> 04:46:47,440
Should have called it.

3361
04:46:47,440 --> 04:46:48,440
Should have called it the joy.

3362
04:46:48,440 --> 04:46:50,440
Joy fruit.

3363
04:46:50,440 --> 04:46:51,440
Yes.

3364
04:46:51,440 --> 04:46:52,440
He does laugh a lot.

3365
04:46:52,440 --> 04:46:53,440
So maybe it is.

3366
04:46:53,440 --> 04:46:54,440
Sorry.

3367
04:46:54,440 --> 04:46:59,520
Is it the is it the is it the hito hito no me Nica model?

3368
04:46:59,520 --> 04:47:01,360
It's not the Nica Nica fruit, right?

3369
04:47:01,360 --> 04:47:05,000
It's the hito hito no me model Nica.

3370
04:47:05,000 --> 04:47:06,000
I forget.

3371
04:47:06,000 --> 04:47:09,080
I'm almost positive that that is hito hito no me.

3372
04:47:09,080 --> 04:47:10,080
It's the same.

3373
04:47:10,080 --> 04:47:11,080
It's man.

3374
04:47:11,080 --> 04:47:12,080
Human human.

3375
04:47:12,080 --> 04:47:16,080
It's the same as a Sengoku hito hito no me model Daibutsu.

3376
04:47:16,080 --> 04:47:17,080
Yes.

3377
04:47:17,080 --> 04:47:18,080
Yeah.

3378
04:47:18,080 --> 04:47:19,600
You got the you got the different models.

3379
04:47:19,600 --> 04:47:20,600
You got Nica.

3380
04:47:20,600 --> 04:47:21,600
You got Buddha.

3381
04:47:21,600 --> 04:47:22,600
And you got Chopper.

3382
04:47:22,600 --> 04:47:27,760
You got the normal normal guy, the most powerful of all.

3383
04:47:27,760 --> 04:47:28,760
What a funny fruit.

3384
04:47:28,760 --> 04:47:29,760
So many different forms.

3385
04:47:29,760 --> 04:47:30,760
Yeah.

3386
04:47:30,760 --> 04:47:31,760
It's like cool.

3387
04:47:31,760 --> 04:47:38,600
If you think about like the idea that it's it's a devil fruit so like evolution and and

3388
04:47:38,600 --> 04:47:39,600
all that.

3389
04:47:39,600 --> 04:47:42,920
It's like they've humans have gone on to land.

3390
04:47:42,920 --> 04:47:44,600
They left the sea behind.

3391
04:47:44,600 --> 04:47:45,600
Yeah.

3392
04:47:45,600 --> 04:47:47,960
And one of the devil fruits evolution is just man.

3393
04:47:47,960 --> 04:47:49,760
Maybe it's like the first devil fruit.

3394
04:47:49,760 --> 04:47:54,600
Well, didn't we didn't in an SPSO to say that if a human ate the hito hito no me, it would

3395
04:47:54,600 --> 04:47:58,560
turn them into like the ideal version of themself.

3396
04:47:58,560 --> 04:47:59,560
That's funny.

3397
04:47:59,560 --> 04:48:00,560
Yeah.

3398
04:48:00,560 --> 04:48:05,600
It's it's it is very funny though that like there's a bunch of different hito.

3399
04:48:05,600 --> 04:48:11,040
I assume other if there are more hito hito no means they are other forms of like legendary

3400
04:48:11,040 --> 04:48:13,600
person or God type.

3401
04:48:13,600 --> 04:48:14,600
Yeah.

3402
04:48:14,600 --> 04:48:15,600
God type people.

3403
04:48:15,600 --> 04:48:17,120
But then there's one that's just a good that's just guy.

3404
04:48:17,120 --> 04:48:18,240
It's just a guy.

3405
04:48:18,240 --> 04:48:19,440
Normal guy.

3406
04:48:19,440 --> 04:48:22,680
But an ideal guy like a really a really cool guy though.

3407
04:48:22,680 --> 04:48:27,440
If you eat it, you become a really cool type guy, not just not just any guy, but but still

3408
04:48:27,440 --> 04:48:29,440
a guy.

3409
04:48:29,440 --> 04:48:32,240
So the government is like what straw hat?

3410
04:48:32,240 --> 04:48:35,440
That's an important character.

3411
04:48:35,440 --> 04:48:40,440
This chain of events is going to culminate tomorrow and the outcome will shock the world.

3412
04:48:40,440 --> 04:48:41,440
Wow.

3413
04:48:41,440 --> 04:48:42,440
Spoilers.

3414
04:48:42,440 --> 04:48:43,440
Wow.

3415
04:48:43,440 --> 04:48:45,440
Will be surprised and delighted.

3416
04:48:46,440 --> 04:48:49,440
Will be shocked by what we see amazing.

3417
04:48:49,440 --> 04:48:55,440
So I for one can't wait to turn the page and learn more.

3418
04:48:55,440 --> 04:49:00,440
So we finish with the shaka shot through the head.

3419
04:49:00,440 --> 04:49:01,440
Reveal.

3420
04:49:01,440 --> 04:49:02,440
Brutal.

3421
04:49:02,440 --> 04:49:03,440
Fucking brutal.

3422
04:49:03,440 --> 04:49:04,440
Yes.

3423
04:49:04,440 --> 04:49:07,440
This helmet's just cracked open his blood.

3424
04:49:07,440 --> 04:49:09,440
He's not alive anymore.

3425
04:49:09,440 --> 04:49:11,440
He seems to be dead.

3426
04:49:11,440 --> 04:49:13,440
Seems fully dead.

3427
04:49:13,440 --> 04:49:14,440
Vegapunk.

3428
04:49:14,440 --> 04:49:17,440
Why are you doing this?

3429
04:49:17,440 --> 04:49:18,440
Slide.

3430
04:49:18,440 --> 04:49:19,440
And here we go.

3431
04:49:19,440 --> 04:49:20,440
It's Stella.

3432
04:49:20,440 --> 04:49:22,440
I mean, it's not Stella.

3433
04:49:22,440 --> 04:49:23,440
It's York.

3434
04:49:23,440 --> 04:49:24,440
York.

3435
04:49:24,440 --> 04:49:25,440
It's the foodie.

3436
04:49:25,440 --> 04:49:26,440
You know what?

3437
04:49:26,440 --> 04:49:27,440
Yeah.

3438
04:49:27,440 --> 04:49:28,440
Okay.

3439
04:49:28,440 --> 04:49:34,440
So she's doing she's the trader because she wants to be a celestial dragon and you know,

3440
04:49:34,440 --> 04:49:35,440
it kind of make.

3441
04:49:35,440 --> 04:49:36,440
Okay.

3442
04:49:36,440 --> 04:49:41,440
I guess she I wonder if like they offered it to her like they'd make her a celestial

3443
04:49:41,440 --> 04:49:46,440
dragon if she did this, but it makes sense because she's gluttonous.

3444
04:49:46,440 --> 04:49:49,440
And like the thing about being a celestial dragon is you just get anything you want.

3445
04:49:49,440 --> 04:49:51,440
You're just a spoiled piece of shit.

3446
04:49:51,440 --> 04:49:52,440
She's like, I want that.

3447
04:49:52,440 --> 04:49:54,440
She fits the bill, I guess.

3448
04:49:54,440 --> 04:49:55,440
Yeah.

3449
04:49:55,440 --> 04:49:56,440
For the mindset.

3450
04:49:56,440 --> 04:49:58,440
She just wants to eat and play video games.

3451
04:49:58,440 --> 04:50:01,440
Just just like that guy, Luffy punched.

3452
04:50:01,440 --> 04:50:05,440
She wants to be that guy.

3453
04:50:05,440 --> 04:50:10,440
You know, this is this is this is yet another time where Sanji's cooking could save the

3454
04:50:11,440 --> 04:50:12,440
for her sense.

3455
04:50:12,440 --> 04:50:16,440
You could make her a big sandwich and then she would eat and be like, ah, you know what?

3456
04:50:16,440 --> 04:50:18,440
I don't need to be a celestial dragon.

3457
04:50:18,440 --> 04:50:19,440
You know what?

3458
04:50:19,440 --> 04:50:20,440
I want to join your crew and eat your food.

3459
04:50:20,440 --> 04:50:21,440
This is fine.

3460
04:50:21,440 --> 04:50:22,440
Actually.

3461
04:50:22,440 --> 04:50:23,440
Yeah.

3462
04:50:23,440 --> 04:50:24,440
True.

3463
04:50:24,440 --> 04:50:25,440
Yeah.

3464
04:50:25,440 --> 04:50:26,440
True.

3465
04:50:26,440 --> 04:50:27,440
Hey.

3466
04:50:27,440 --> 04:50:28,440
Okay.

3467
04:50:28,440 --> 04:50:33,440
So why did he not know that she was doing this?

3468
04:50:33,440 --> 04:50:34,440
Doesn't he know it?

3469
04:50:34,440 --> 04:50:36,440
Doesn't he know everything she knows?

3470
04:50:36,440 --> 04:50:37,440
I get.

3471
04:50:37,440 --> 04:50:39,440
Well, as we were saying last time.

3472
04:50:39,440 --> 04:50:40,440
There must be some way.

3473
04:50:40,440 --> 04:50:41,440
I was.

3474
04:50:41,440 --> 04:50:46,440
I was talking about like how it could be shaka before he got shot like two weeks ago.

3475
04:50:46,440 --> 04:50:47,440
Yeah.

3476
04:50:47,440 --> 04:50:51,440
And they don't seem to have like a connected hive mind.

3477
04:50:51,440 --> 04:50:57,440
They seem to be able to transfer data through the big brain, the big egg.

3478
04:50:57,440 --> 04:51:01,440
So in what sense is this Vega punk at all?

3479
04:51:01,440 --> 04:51:05,440
Because this is the person who poops all of Vega Punks poop.

3480
04:51:05,440 --> 04:51:06,440
Yeah.

3481
04:51:06,440 --> 04:51:08,440
And eats all of the food, I guess.

3482
04:51:08,440 --> 04:51:10,440
I guess.

3483
04:51:10,440 --> 04:51:12,440
I guess.

3484
04:51:12,440 --> 04:51:13,440
But here's one thing.

3485
04:51:13,440 --> 04:51:15,440
Here's one thing I don't get.

3486
04:51:15,440 --> 04:51:22,440
I'm pretty sure Stella, I mean York was the one who was turned into stone and blown to pieces earlier.

3487
04:51:22,440 --> 04:51:23,440
What?

3488
04:51:23,440 --> 04:51:25,440
Like in the last chapter?

3489
04:51:25,440 --> 04:51:26,440
No, no, no.

3490
04:51:26,440 --> 04:51:28,440
A few chapters ago when they first meet Hancock.

3491
04:51:28,440 --> 04:51:32,440
Let me find the chapter.

3492
04:51:32,440 --> 04:51:36,440
But like it was Lilith and it was Usok.

3493
04:51:36,440 --> 04:51:37,440
Yeah.

3494
04:51:37,440 --> 04:51:38,440
And half of Franky.

3495
04:51:38,440 --> 04:51:39,440
And York was there.

3496
04:51:39,440 --> 04:51:40,440
What?

3497
04:51:40,440 --> 04:51:46,440
York got turned to stone and smashed and then they fell down off the bridge.

3498
04:51:46,440 --> 04:51:50,440
And I'm just going to check that that is the person that that happened to.

3499
04:51:50,440 --> 04:51:51,440
All right.

3500
04:51:51,440 --> 04:51:53,440
Because I can't think of who else it was.

3501
04:51:53,440 --> 04:51:54,440
Yeah, show me that.

3502
04:51:54,440 --> 04:51:56,440
That seems weird.

3503
04:51:56,440 --> 04:52:00,440
And I'm like, okay, if that was the case, let me just find it first.

3504
04:52:00,440 --> 04:52:03,440
1075.

3505
04:52:03,440 --> 04:52:05,440
When do we find it?

3506
04:52:05,440 --> 04:52:07,440
They're walking around.

3507
04:52:07,440 --> 04:52:08,440
Yeah.

3508
04:52:08,440 --> 04:52:10,440
So York is in 1075.

3509
04:52:10,440 --> 04:52:17,440
She is with Franky, Lilith, Usok, and they find Pythagoras's head.

3510
04:52:17,440 --> 04:52:19,440
He's just walking around.

3511
04:52:19,440 --> 04:52:23,440
And then yes, here we go.

3512
04:52:23,440 --> 04:52:26,440
I guess for spoiler reasons, I'll DM it to you.

3513
04:52:26,440 --> 04:52:30,440
Go for it.

3514
04:52:30,440 --> 04:52:33,440
But yeah, this page, she gets turned.

3515
04:52:33,440 --> 04:52:34,440
This is York.

3516
04:52:34,440 --> 04:52:35,440
She gets turned into stone.

3517
04:52:35,440 --> 04:52:36,440
Huh.

3518
04:52:36,440 --> 04:52:37,440
Yeah, she did.

3519
04:52:37,440 --> 04:52:44,440
And then in that chapter, I just I'll link the chapter, I guess.

3520
04:52:44,440 --> 04:52:52,440
In that chapter, Boa Hancock uses her BMU to explode everything.

3521
04:52:52,440 --> 04:52:54,440
But I guess we don't see.

3522
04:52:54,440 --> 04:52:55,440
Let me look at this.

3523
04:52:55,440 --> 04:52:59,440
Do we see her turned into rubble?

3524
04:52:59,440 --> 04:53:02,440
Into rubble, rubble, rubble, rubble.

3525
04:53:03,440 --> 04:53:04,440
Okay.

3526
04:53:04,440 --> 04:53:06,440
See York.

3527
04:53:06,440 --> 04:53:10,440
She's saying she's yawning, walking around.

3528
04:53:10,440 --> 04:53:14,440
And then I didn't order, Edison, order you to hold your horses earlier.

3529
04:53:14,440 --> 04:53:19,440
You should really still be waiting out there, even though you're so cute.

3530
04:53:19,440 --> 04:53:20,440
Hmm.

3531
04:53:20,440 --> 04:53:23,440
Turns to stone.

3532
04:53:23,440 --> 04:53:27,440
And then she's kicked, kicked to the side.

3533
04:53:27,440 --> 04:53:31,440
See what I thought was that she blew her up and killed him.

3534
04:53:31,440 --> 04:53:34,440
Oh yeah, she kicks to the side.

3535
04:53:34,440 --> 04:53:39,440
Yeah, I don't see her being killed or exploded.

3536
04:53:39,440 --> 04:53:42,440
She blows up the bridge and they all fall down.

3537
04:53:42,440 --> 04:53:46,440
So I guess it's not like a problem.

3538
04:53:46,440 --> 04:53:50,440
It's just that we don't, we may have assumed that she blew up York during that.

3539
04:53:50,440 --> 04:53:51,440
But she didn't.

3540
04:53:51,440 --> 04:53:53,440
York is still up there, made a stone.

3541
04:53:53,440 --> 04:53:54,440
I got it.

3542
04:53:54,440 --> 04:53:59,440
Hancock turned her back out of stone and then jumped down to fight everyone as York left

3543
04:53:59,440 --> 04:54:00,440
to kill Shaka.

3544
04:54:00,440 --> 04:54:07,440
I did not think that being turned to stone was like a real, the last time we were going

3545
04:54:07,440 --> 04:54:09,440
to see York or anything like that.

3546
04:54:09,440 --> 04:54:10,440
So.

3547
04:54:10,440 --> 04:54:15,440
I mean, I read that situation as York being killed and I thought, oh shit, they're going

3548
04:54:15,440 --> 04:54:18,440
to start killing these mega punk characters.

3549
04:54:18,440 --> 04:54:19,440
That's interesting.

3550
04:54:19,440 --> 04:54:22,440
They're semi disposable as characters.

3551
04:54:22,440 --> 04:54:27,440
At no point have I ever been under the impression that like being turned to stone by Hancock

3552
04:54:27,440 --> 04:54:29,440
is like you're dead.

3553
04:54:29,440 --> 04:54:34,440
Well, no, no, neither do I, but like I thought that she exploded her afterwards.

3554
04:54:34,440 --> 04:54:35,440
Oh, true.

3555
04:54:35,440 --> 04:54:36,440
Oh yeah.

3556
04:54:36,440 --> 04:54:37,440
I guess I didn't.

3557
04:54:37,440 --> 04:54:41,440
I guess I just wasn't paying attention.

3558
04:54:41,440 --> 04:54:42,440
No, I don't know.

3559
04:54:42,440 --> 04:54:43,440
I didn't think they were going to.

3560
04:54:43,440 --> 04:54:48,440
I didn't think they'd be killing these guys off with like, nah.

3561
04:54:48,440 --> 04:54:50,440
But what happened to little Pythagoras?

3562
04:54:50,440 --> 04:54:51,440
Well, she stepped on his head.

3563
04:54:51,440 --> 04:54:52,440
What's that explosion?

3564
04:54:52,440 --> 04:54:54,440
Yeah, that I don't know.

3565
04:54:55,440 --> 04:54:58,440
I guess she just made an explosion.

3566
04:54:58,440 --> 04:55:02,440
She may have done an explosion in between panels.

3567
04:55:02,440 --> 04:55:05,440
Yeah, I think she just did an explosion.

3568
04:55:05,440 --> 04:55:08,440
She crushed Pythagoras, did an explosion.

3569
04:55:08,440 --> 04:55:15,440
I guess the idea being that she was exploding Usopp and Lilith and maybe Frankie killing

3570
04:55:15,440 --> 04:55:17,440
them behind her.

3571
04:55:17,440 --> 04:55:19,440
But I mean, I'm sure they're not actually dead.

3572
04:55:19,440 --> 04:55:23,440
Yeah, we didn't see them explode.

3573
04:55:24,440 --> 04:55:31,440
So I don't really think any, I mean, some of these guys might die.

3574
04:55:31,440 --> 04:55:32,440
Maybe Shaka's really dead.

3575
04:55:32,440 --> 04:55:33,440
I don't know.

3576
04:55:33,440 --> 04:55:37,440
I feel like Shaka could be dead.

3577
04:55:37,440 --> 04:55:41,440
Yeah, yeah, shot through the head.

3578
04:55:41,440 --> 04:55:44,440
And what do we need all these vagabunks for anyway?

3579
04:55:44,440 --> 04:55:49,440
Yeah, the idea they were all going to join the straw hats together.

3580
04:55:49,440 --> 04:55:51,440
There's a lot of characters.

3581
04:55:51,440 --> 04:55:52,440
Wait a minute.

3582
04:55:53,440 --> 04:55:59,440
Do you think one of these vagabunks is going to join the straw hats?

3583
04:55:59,440 --> 04:56:03,440
Well, I thought the idea was vagabunk was going to travel with the straw hats to get

3584
04:56:03,440 --> 04:56:05,440
that information that he has.

3585
04:56:05,440 --> 04:56:08,440
Yeah, but that's not the same as joining the straw hats.

3586
04:56:08,440 --> 04:56:13,440
Well, no, I don't think anyone's going to join the straw hats from this.

3587
04:56:13,440 --> 04:56:16,440
Although they're going to travel with them.

3588
04:56:16,440 --> 04:56:20,440
I mean, you say that and I agree, but at the same time that gets me thinking like,

3589
04:56:20,440 --> 04:56:26,440
what if this whole thing plays out and like most of these vagabunks end up dead,

3590
04:56:26,440 --> 04:56:30,440
but like one of them stays alive and they just become a new crew member

3591
04:56:30,440 --> 04:56:32,440
and they're the crew scientist.

3592
04:56:32,440 --> 04:56:34,440
Well, I guess the Frankie's already the crew scientist.

3593
04:56:34,440 --> 04:56:36,440
He's the engineer.

3594
04:56:36,440 --> 04:56:37,440
He can build stuff.

3595
04:56:37,440 --> 04:56:39,440
He is a good vagabunk.

3596
04:56:39,440 --> 04:56:41,440
Honestly, honestly, I could see that.

3597
04:56:41,440 --> 04:56:42,440
I could see that.

3598
04:56:42,440 --> 04:56:44,440
I could see that maybe happening.

3599
04:56:44,440 --> 04:56:48,440
Maybe like they all die except Lilith and then Lilith just joins or something

3600
04:56:49,440 --> 04:56:51,440
and just is a permanent member or something like that.

3601
04:56:51,440 --> 04:56:53,440
It doesn't sound that crazy.

3602
04:56:53,440 --> 04:56:54,440
Yeah, it could be.

3603
04:56:54,440 --> 04:57:02,440
Lilith is cute and it is the one of I mean, a lot of one piece ladies are very cute

3604
04:57:02,440 --> 04:57:06,440
in the same way that they could easily add to the Nami Rubin.

3605
04:57:07,440 --> 04:57:14,440
Cute girls on the straw hat crew thing gets all the fans going.

3606
04:57:14,440 --> 04:57:15,440
Fans love it.

3607
04:57:15,440 --> 04:57:17,440
The fans love it when there's a cute girl on screen.

3608
04:57:17,440 --> 04:57:18,440
I sure do.

3609
04:57:21,440 --> 04:57:22,440
What if we got Pythagoras?

3610
04:57:22,440 --> 04:57:27,440
What if we got little ball Pythagoras who joins the crew?

3611
04:57:27,440 --> 04:57:28,440
I actually would.

3612
04:57:28,440 --> 04:57:29,440
Yeah, that's pretty cute.

3613
04:57:29,440 --> 04:57:30,440
Little Pythagoras.

3614
04:57:30,440 --> 04:57:32,440
That's different.

3615
04:57:34,440 --> 04:57:39,440
I don't see it just because these vagabunks,

3616
04:57:39,440 --> 04:57:42,440
I think they're going to stay with vagabunk.

3617
04:57:42,440 --> 04:57:46,440
However, along he remains relevant to the straw hats, pirates.

3618
04:57:46,440 --> 04:57:51,440
I'm imagining now like this plays out that like maybe Stella dies

3619
04:57:51,440 --> 04:57:55,440
and most of the other vagabunks die and maybe there's just one left

3620
04:57:55,440 --> 04:57:57,440
and he joins the crew.

3621
04:57:58,440 --> 04:58:00,440
I think that sounds plausible.

3622
04:58:01,440 --> 04:58:03,440
And it's like, hey guys, technically vagabunk.

3623
04:58:03,440 --> 04:58:05,440
Certainly they will travel with the straw hats to escape.

3624
04:58:05,440 --> 04:58:08,440
Oh, I mean, yeah, certainly they'll travel with vagabunk.

3625
04:58:08,440 --> 04:58:11,440
Yeah, certainly they'll leave with a vagabunk.

3626
04:58:12,440 --> 04:58:16,440
Joining the crew, it doesn't mean so much as it used to

3627
04:58:16,440 --> 04:58:20,440
because like a carrot was with the crew for so long

3628
04:58:20,440 --> 04:58:22,440
and she ended up leaving.

3629
04:58:22,440 --> 04:58:25,440
Yamato could have joined the crew, but he was like,

3630
04:58:25,440 --> 04:58:29,440
I'm just going to stay in one of for a little while

3631
04:58:29,440 --> 04:58:32,440
and they've got all those allies.

3632
04:58:32,440 --> 04:58:34,440
They've got those frenemies.

3633
04:58:34,440 --> 04:58:37,440
They've got people out in the sea doing their own thing.

3634
04:58:37,440 --> 04:58:42,440
The crew itself, I think, is quite good at where it is.

3635
04:58:42,440 --> 04:58:43,440
Yeah.

3636
04:58:44,440 --> 04:58:51,440
I think we're getting nearer to the end than to the beginning now.

3637
04:58:51,440 --> 04:58:56,440
I foresee a scenario in which maybe at least one of these vagabunks

3638
04:58:56,440 --> 04:59:01,440
become like a permanent fixture on the ship for however,

3639
04:59:01,440 --> 04:59:06,440
as they make their final journey to Raftel or whatever.

3640
04:59:07,440 --> 04:59:08,440
Yeah, maybe.

3641
04:59:10,440 --> 04:59:14,440
I mean, even Jinbei felt like a bit of a weird addition

3642
04:59:14,440 --> 04:59:18,440
because he already had a crew and he had to say goodbye to them

3643
04:59:18,440 --> 04:59:19,440
to join the Straw Hat.

3644
04:59:19,440 --> 04:59:20,440
Yeah.

3645
04:59:20,440 --> 04:59:21,440
And it was just sort of weird.

3646
04:59:21,440 --> 04:59:24,440
Yeah, he already had a good crew and they were cool.

3647
04:59:24,440 --> 04:59:27,440
He could have been one of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

3648
04:59:27,440 --> 04:59:29,440
He could have been a responsible ally.

3649
04:59:29,440 --> 04:59:32,440
That's what I would have assumed he would do, but I guess that's...

3650
04:59:32,440 --> 04:59:36,440
But he joined the crew because I think there was expectations.

3651
04:59:37,440 --> 04:59:39,440
I don't even think that was...

3652
04:59:39,440 --> 04:59:43,440
They've got to have a helmsman give.

3653
04:59:44,440 --> 04:59:45,440
I don't...

3654
04:59:45,440 --> 04:59:47,440
A ship without a helmsman.

3655
04:59:47,440 --> 04:59:55,440
That always felt like an excuse to give him a reason to join

3656
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:58,440
because he didn't have a lot of other reasons to join.

3657
04:59:58,440 --> 04:59:59,440
Other than that, he's...

3658
04:59:59,440 --> 05:00:00,440
It's not like he was at rock bottom.

3659
05:00:00,440 --> 05:00:01,440
Other than that, he's their friend.

3660
05:00:01,440 --> 05:00:02,440
And they like him.

3661
05:00:02,440 --> 05:00:04,440
Yeah, and he's a strong guy and he wants to help them.

3662
05:00:04,440 --> 05:00:05,440
He has his own crew.

3663
05:00:05,440 --> 05:00:07,440
That's the thing that's meaning...

3664
05:00:07,440 --> 05:00:11,440
The fact that he has his own crew means they have to invent a role

3665
05:00:11,440 --> 05:00:14,440
that he has to do on the Straw Hat ship, which was always a bit funny.

3666
05:00:14,440 --> 05:00:15,440
Yeah, it's dumb.

3667
05:00:19,440 --> 05:00:22,440
And I think the expectation that the Straw Hat crew grows over time.

3668
05:00:22,440 --> 05:00:24,440
I'm just racist and I just don't think that we should mix crew.

3669
05:00:24,440 --> 05:00:26,440
I just don't think we should mix racist and crew, okay?

3670
05:00:26,440 --> 05:00:28,440
I wanted him to join us just a big fish.

3671
05:00:28,440 --> 05:00:29,440
Humans only.

3672
05:00:29,440 --> 05:00:30,440
I think that would have been fine.

3673
05:00:30,440 --> 05:00:32,440
And Chopper counts because he ate the human.

3674
05:00:33,440 --> 05:00:34,440
He's like strong.

3675
05:00:35,440 --> 05:00:36,440
What?

3676
05:00:37,440 --> 05:00:39,440
Did you not hear what I said?

3677
05:00:39,440 --> 05:00:40,440
I was rambling.

3678
05:00:41,440 --> 05:00:44,440
Oh, I just said I wanted him to join us as a big fish

3679
05:00:44,440 --> 05:00:46,440
and I think that would have been fine.

3680
05:00:46,440 --> 05:00:48,440
He just needed to be a strong guy on the crew.

3681
05:00:48,440 --> 05:00:52,440
And now he's like an addition to their intimidation factor.

3682
05:00:52,440 --> 05:00:55,440
And he can do all of the things that require swimming

3683
05:00:55,440 --> 05:00:58,440
because nobody can really do that except Zoro and Sandy.

3684
05:00:59,440 --> 05:01:00,440
Yeah, Jimi.

3685
05:01:00,440 --> 05:01:01,440
Yeah, true.

3686
05:01:02,440 --> 05:01:07,440
But like the idea that the Straw Hat crew grows in member

3687
05:01:07,440 --> 05:01:09,440
is it's sort of.

3688
05:01:10,440 --> 05:01:15,440
It's gotten to capacity, I think for the amount of screen time

3689
05:01:15,440 --> 05:01:17,440
you can give to each one of them.

3690
05:01:17,440 --> 05:01:19,440
I don't think there's enough.

3691
05:01:21,440 --> 05:01:24,440
I feel like if you weren't there by the time skip,

3692
05:01:24,440 --> 05:01:26,440
it's like that was the crew.

3693
05:01:27,440 --> 05:01:29,440
The crew that got separated at the time skip

3694
05:01:30,440 --> 05:01:33,440
and then reassembled and got back together two years later.

3695
05:01:33,440 --> 05:01:34,440
Like that's the crew.

3696
05:01:34,440 --> 05:01:37,440
Jimi is also here now and that's cool.

3697
05:01:38,440 --> 05:01:39,440
But but come on.

3698
05:01:39,440 --> 05:01:40,440
Yeah, come on.

3699
05:01:40,440 --> 05:01:44,440
It's one of those things because it's like the way they joined

3700
05:01:44,440 --> 05:01:49,440
the crew earlier was like more emotional and more serious

3701
05:01:50,440 --> 05:01:52,440
because they were so small in number.

3702
05:01:52,440 --> 05:01:54,440
They needed everyone they could get.

3703
05:01:56,440 --> 05:01:58,440
And it's not even about like needing them.

3704
05:01:58,440 --> 05:02:01,440
It's just sort of the characters they had

3705
05:02:03,440 --> 05:02:06,440
really needed the Straw Hat Pirates.

3706
05:02:06,440 --> 05:02:08,440
Yeah, Jimi didn't need the Straw Hats.

3707
05:02:10,440 --> 05:02:13,440
Like Brooke, his crew was dead and he finally has.

3708
05:02:14,440 --> 05:02:16,440
He's the most recent one.

3709
05:02:16,440 --> 05:02:22,440
He has such a sad story of like sailing on this boat for whoever,

3710
05:02:22,440 --> 05:02:26,440
who knows how long living as a skeleton because of a devil fruit he ate.

3711
05:02:26,440 --> 05:02:27,440
Yeah.

3712
05:02:27,440 --> 05:02:31,440
And all of his crew is dead and he's just he hasn't met anyone in a long time.

3713
05:02:31,440 --> 05:02:32,440
Yeah.

3714
05:02:32,440 --> 05:02:34,440
Yeah, they rescued him from a real good thing.

3715
05:02:34,440 --> 05:02:38,440
And his shadow was, yeah, they got his shadow back for him

3716
05:02:39,440 --> 05:02:41,440
and they were friends and Luffy was just asking,

3717
05:02:41,440 --> 05:02:42,440
you want to come with us?

3718
05:02:42,440 --> 05:02:44,440
He was like, oh my God, a crew?

3719
05:02:44,440 --> 05:02:45,440
Oh, I'd love to.

3720
05:02:45,440 --> 05:02:47,440
It was like, it's so cute.

3721
05:02:49,440 --> 05:02:54,440
And that, you know, it's the same with everyone.

3722
05:02:54,440 --> 05:02:55,440
Pretty much, yeah.

3723
05:02:55,440 --> 05:02:59,440
They're all like crying at the chance to join the Straw Hat Zoro.

3724
05:02:59,440 --> 05:03:01,440
Zoro's like, yeah, fucking whatever.

3725
05:03:01,440 --> 05:03:03,440
I mean, Zoro's the first one.

3726
05:03:03,440 --> 05:03:05,440
When it's him and Luffy, it's just like, yeah, let's team up.

3727
05:03:05,440 --> 05:03:06,440
Cool.

3728
05:03:06,440 --> 05:03:07,440
All right, let's go.

3729
05:03:07,440 --> 05:03:08,440
Let's team up.

3730
05:03:08,440 --> 05:03:11,440
I mean, he smirks and he makes the same.

3731
05:03:11,440 --> 05:03:14,440
He's like, well, if I'm going to be the strongest swordsman,

3732
05:03:14,440 --> 05:03:17,440
the only one I can serve under is the Pirate King.

3733
05:03:17,440 --> 05:03:20,440
So you better, you better become that, I guess.

3734
05:03:20,440 --> 05:03:21,440
All right, cool.

3735
05:03:21,440 --> 05:03:22,440
Let's go.

3736
05:03:22,440 --> 05:03:23,440
Yeah.

3737
05:03:23,440 --> 05:03:24,440
And that's very Zoro.

3738
05:03:25,440 --> 05:03:27,440
And then things like.

3739
05:03:27,440 --> 05:03:31,440
How fucked up would it be if Zoro like wept tears

3740
05:03:31,440 --> 05:03:33,440
and he's like, finally a family?

3741
05:03:35,440 --> 05:03:36,440
Yeah.

3742
05:03:36,440 --> 05:03:38,440
Yeah, it doesn't have to be a big emotional thing,

3743
05:03:38,440 --> 05:03:43,440
but the thing is they made it such a big deal

3744
05:03:43,440 --> 05:03:45,440
that Jim Bay was joining the crew as well.

3745
05:03:45,440 --> 05:03:47,440
Jim Bay did get emotional.

3746
05:03:48,440 --> 05:03:49,440
Sure.

3747
05:03:49,440 --> 05:03:50,440
Whatever.

3748
05:03:50,440 --> 05:03:53,440
I think it's, it just, it wouldn't have made sense

3749
05:03:53,440 --> 05:03:56,440
if Zoro didn't have any reason to leave whatever group he was in.

3750
05:03:56,440 --> 05:03:57,440
Zoro was by himself.

3751
05:03:57,440 --> 05:03:58,440
Yeah.

3752
05:03:58,440 --> 05:03:59,440
So it's like, sure, sure.

3753
05:03:59,440 --> 05:04:00,440
Yeah.

3754
05:04:00,440 --> 05:04:02,440
Sanji left his kitchen because he wanted to find all blue

3755
05:04:02,440 --> 05:04:04,440
and he's very emotional about that.

3756
05:04:06,440 --> 05:04:09,440
And Robin had our whole thing where she.

3757
05:04:09,440 --> 05:04:12,440
She was in Baroque Works.

3758
05:04:12,440 --> 05:04:15,440
She joined because she wasn't going to stay with Baroque Works.

3759
05:04:15,440 --> 05:04:19,440
Baroque Works, she was a double agent for them.

3760
05:04:19,440 --> 05:04:22,440
She's trying to learn about the pony glyphs and stuff.

3761
05:04:23,440 --> 05:04:29,440
And then later, you know, she, she sort of,

3762
05:04:29,440 --> 05:04:32,440
her past catches up to her and it's like a whole thing to get her back.

3763
05:04:32,440 --> 05:04:33,440
It's like, you're a friend of ours.

3764
05:04:33,440 --> 05:04:35,440
And it's like, oh my God.

3765
05:04:35,440 --> 05:04:38,440
Oh, thanks guys.

3766
05:04:38,440 --> 05:04:40,440
Thanks guys for saving me.

3767
05:04:41,440 --> 05:04:47,440
And then Usopp had the whole thing where he joined just to see the world.

3768
05:04:47,440 --> 05:04:49,440
And then he forged in fire.

3769
05:04:49,440 --> 05:04:52,440
They're strong bound in, in Watcher 7.

3770
05:04:53,440 --> 05:04:56,440
When he was, he was going to leave because they were going to get rid of the ship

3771
05:04:56,440 --> 05:04:58,440
because it was no longer.

3772
05:04:58,440 --> 05:04:59,440
I'm getting chills.

3773
05:04:59,440 --> 05:05:00,440
I'm getting chills just thinking about it.

3774
05:05:00,440 --> 05:05:01,440
Oh, what a battle.

3775
05:05:02,440 --> 05:05:04,440
What, what a battle.

3776
05:05:06,440 --> 05:05:08,440
And God, what a seven.

3777
05:05:08,440 --> 05:05:10,440
Annie's Lobby is the coolest.

3778
05:05:10,440 --> 05:05:12,440
I love it so much.

3779
05:05:13,440 --> 05:05:14,440
It's my favorite arc.

3780
05:05:14,440 --> 05:05:18,440
Annie's Lobby is the, no, I'm thinking of Impel Down.

3781
05:05:18,440 --> 05:05:22,440
Water 7 is Frankie and Puffing Tom and the big going Mary.

3782
05:05:22,440 --> 05:05:24,440
What happened to Annie's, what happened to Annie's Lobby?

3783
05:05:26,440 --> 05:05:28,440
They saved Niko Robin from Niko's computer.

3784
05:05:28,440 --> 05:05:29,440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3785
05:05:29,440 --> 05:05:30,440
Right, of course.

3786
05:05:32,440 --> 05:05:37,440
And then the, the Zabusta call was activated by accident by Spandam

3787
05:05:37,440 --> 05:05:38,440
because he's an idiot.

3788
05:05:38,440 --> 05:05:39,440
Right, right.

3789
05:05:39,440 --> 05:05:43,440
Wait, which one is Spandam's the guy with like half a face, right?

3790
05:05:44,440 --> 05:05:46,440
Yeah, he didn't used to have half a face, but now he does.

3791
05:05:46,440 --> 05:05:48,440
He's been punched and kicked so much.

3792
05:05:48,440 --> 05:05:49,440
Oh, good for him.

3793
05:05:49,440 --> 05:05:50,440
And he was.

3794
05:05:50,440 --> 05:05:51,440
That's character development.

3795
05:05:51,440 --> 05:05:52,440
Real, real busted.

3796
05:05:52,440 --> 05:05:54,440
Is he like friends with Kobe now?

3797
05:05:55,440 --> 05:05:58,440
No, I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of acting.

3798
05:05:58,440 --> 05:05:59,440
You're thinking of Helmapo.

3799
05:05:59,440 --> 05:06:00,440
I'm thinking of Helmapo.

3800
05:06:00,440 --> 05:06:01,440
Yeah, I am.

3801
05:06:02,440 --> 05:06:04,440
Who's Axe Hand Morgan's son, right?

3802
05:06:04,440 --> 05:06:05,440
Am I?

3803
05:06:05,440 --> 05:06:06,440
Yes.

3804
05:06:07,440 --> 05:06:08,440
He's still out there.

3805
05:06:08,440 --> 05:06:09,440
I hope he comes back.

3806
05:06:09,440 --> 05:06:10,440
Yeah, we saw him.

3807
05:06:10,440 --> 05:06:11,440
He finds the one piece.

3808
05:06:11,440 --> 05:06:14,440
In some like, in some like intro panel.

3809
05:06:14,440 --> 05:06:17,440
I remember there's like one, remember, remember Axe Hand Morgan?

3810
05:06:17,440 --> 05:06:22,440
Boy, that guy should, that guy should seem like a big deal back in the day.

3811
05:06:22,440 --> 05:06:23,440
Huh, weird.

3812
05:06:23,440 --> 05:06:24,440
Yeah.

3813
05:06:24,440 --> 05:06:26,440
Anyway, let's get back to the grand line.

3814
05:06:29,440 --> 05:06:30,440
And like, yeah.

3815
05:06:30,440 --> 05:06:35,440
So they're all characters who had nowhere to go except the straw hats.

3816
05:06:36,440 --> 05:06:40,440
And, you know, straw hats is something they needed.

3817
05:06:40,440 --> 05:06:44,440
Jim Bae just sees Luffy as like, he's the future pirate king.

3818
05:06:44,440 --> 05:06:45,440
Yeah.

3819
05:06:45,440 --> 05:06:47,440
But also, I gotta be their Helmsman.

3820
05:06:47,440 --> 05:06:48,440
I just gotta.

3821
05:06:48,440 --> 05:06:55,440
Is he there as like an envoy from the fishmen to like serve under the pirate king as like

3822
05:06:55,440 --> 05:06:58,440
a show of unity between races?

3823
05:06:58,440 --> 05:06:59,440
Is that the idea?

3824
05:06:59,440 --> 05:07:01,440
I don't think that's got anything to do with it.

3825
05:07:01,440 --> 05:07:04,440
It's just, it's just personal like loyalty to Luffy.

3826
05:07:04,440 --> 05:07:10,440
He sees Luffy as the person who will liberate the world and save and be the coolest guy

3827
05:07:10,440 --> 05:07:11,440
ever.

3828
05:07:11,440 --> 05:07:12,440
It's probably true.

3829
05:07:12,440 --> 05:07:14,440
And so he wants to help him in his quest and he will join his crew.

3830
05:07:14,440 --> 05:07:15,440
Okay.

3831
05:07:15,440 --> 05:07:16,440
I mean, that's all reasonable enough.

3832
05:07:16,440 --> 05:07:17,440
It's not the worst thing ever.

3833
05:07:17,440 --> 05:07:20,440
It's all makes enough sense, I guess.

3834
05:07:20,440 --> 05:07:21,440
Yeah.

3835
05:07:21,440 --> 05:07:23,440
It would make more sense if he didn't have a crew of his own.

3836
05:07:23,440 --> 05:07:25,440
We've been, we've said this before.

3837
05:07:25,440 --> 05:07:32,440
It seems more reasonable that he would become part of the grand fleet, but you know, he would

3838
05:07:32,440 --> 05:07:38,440
be, you know, a very, a very honored, very honored and esteemed member of the grand fleet

3839
05:07:38,440 --> 05:07:44,440
of the straw hats and, you know, part of their personal envoy to the fishmen would have made

3840
05:07:44,440 --> 05:07:45,440
perfect sense.

3841
05:07:45,440 --> 05:07:46,440
But we could do this too, I guess.

3842
05:07:46,440 --> 05:07:47,440
Sure.

3843
05:07:47,440 --> 05:07:48,440
Leave your crew, Jinbe.

3844
05:07:48,440 --> 05:07:52,940
I guess in the sense that some pirates, Jinbe's old crew are going to be part of the grand

3845
05:07:52,940 --> 05:07:55,440
fleet for Luffy, ultimately.

3846
05:07:55,440 --> 05:07:59,440
I mean, I guess we see, I guess this is kind of how like, like whitebeard's crew is all

3847
05:07:59,440 --> 05:08:00,440
the same.

3848
05:08:00,440 --> 05:08:05,440
I'm probably supposed to imagine that all the people in Whitebeard's crew, they were either,

3849
05:08:05,440 --> 05:08:10,440
they probably used to belong to their own teams or maybe they were even captains of

3850
05:08:10,440 --> 05:08:16,880
their own fleets or ships before and like, still to a certain extent, like they command

3851
05:08:16,880 --> 05:08:22,440
loyalty among those other ships that like, are not maybe technically part of Whitebeard's

3852
05:08:22,440 --> 05:08:26,440
fleet, but because they have loyalty to the captain that is like Whitebeard's guy.

3853
05:08:26,440 --> 05:08:27,440
Yeah.

3854
05:08:27,440 --> 05:08:28,440
See.

3855
05:08:28,440 --> 05:08:29,440
They have a connection there.

3856
05:08:29,440 --> 05:08:31,240
See, that would be cool.

3857
05:08:31,240 --> 05:08:37,940
Like if it's Luffy is so influential now that captains of fleets can just join him if he

3858
05:08:37,940 --> 05:08:38,940
asks them to.

3859
05:08:38,940 --> 05:08:39,940
But that's the thing.

3860
05:08:39,940 --> 05:08:43,680
You don't think he, did he ask Jinbe to join?

3861
05:08:43,680 --> 05:08:44,680
He did, right?

3862
05:08:44,680 --> 05:08:47,200
Kind of don't remember the specifics.

3863
05:08:47,200 --> 05:08:49,880
I don't think it was, I don't think it was clear enough.

3864
05:08:49,880 --> 05:08:55,200
I think it was like, I'll join you, but I just got to be like five or six arcs later.

3865
05:08:55,200 --> 05:08:58,360
He said he had to do something and then if he succeeded in his mission, he would join

3866
05:08:58,360 --> 05:09:02,680
their crew and then he finally got back from that and he's like, well, time to complete

3867
05:09:02,680 --> 05:09:03,680
that arc.

3868
05:09:03,680 --> 05:09:04,680
It looks like I'm joining now.

3869
05:09:04,680 --> 05:09:05,680
It was Big Mom.

3870
05:09:05,680 --> 05:09:10,880
He has like ties to Big Mom and that was the whole cake, I think, after that.

3871
05:09:10,880 --> 05:09:13,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

3872
05:09:13,360 --> 05:09:21,040
And then he appeared in Wano and he's like, I'm going to join, did you miss me?

3873
05:09:21,040 --> 05:09:25,800
I'm sorry, Jinbe just doesn't feel like part of the family.

3874
05:09:25,800 --> 05:09:26,800
Not yet.

3875
05:09:26,800 --> 05:09:27,800
Never.

3876
05:09:28,800 --> 05:09:29,960
Never have a filthy fish man.

3877
05:09:29,960 --> 05:09:32,960
I'll never call one brother.

3878
05:09:32,960 --> 05:09:42,640
But like with all that said, with all that said, who like, I think the idea that a vagabunk,

3879
05:09:42,640 --> 05:09:47,000
the last remaining vagabunk will stay with a straw hat crew because there's nowhere else

3880
05:09:47,000 --> 05:09:48,000
to go.

3881
05:09:48,000 --> 05:09:54,360
That means that makes a lot of sense in the same way that someone like Brooke is like,

3882
05:09:54,360 --> 05:09:55,560
my old crew is gone.

3883
05:09:55,560 --> 05:09:56,560
Yeah.

3884
05:09:57,320 --> 05:09:59,320
I've lost everything else.

3885
05:09:59,320 --> 05:10:03,520
And now, yeah, you've brought me out of what was a terrible fate.

3886
05:10:03,520 --> 05:10:07,640
And yeah, if all the vagabunks got killed, except for Pythagoras and Pagoras, like now

3887
05:10:07,640 --> 05:10:08,640
what do I do?

3888
05:10:08,640 --> 05:10:11,720
Oh, no, I'm just a little robot with all the knowledge in the universe.

3889
05:10:11,720 --> 05:10:15,080
Like, well, why don't you come to Raftel with us?

3890
05:10:15,080 --> 05:10:16,080
Yay.

3891
05:10:16,080 --> 05:10:17,080
Hooray.

3892
05:10:17,080 --> 05:10:18,080
I will.

3893
05:10:18,080 --> 05:10:20,680
Thank you, father.

3894
05:10:20,680 --> 05:10:21,680
I'd love that.

3895
05:10:21,680 --> 05:10:24,040
I'd love the little guy to be part of it.

3896
05:10:24,040 --> 05:10:27,480
I will call you prime unit Luffy.

3897
05:10:27,480 --> 05:10:30,760
You are now my central processing system.

3898
05:10:30,760 --> 05:10:34,240
You command my servos.

3899
05:10:34,240 --> 05:10:36,200
He can talk with Frankie about robotics.

3900
05:10:36,200 --> 05:10:39,400
He could be like, Frankie could build him a new body.

3901
05:10:39,400 --> 05:10:40,400
Yes.

3902
05:10:40,400 --> 05:10:41,400
Yes.

3903
05:10:41,400 --> 05:10:42,400
It's Pythagoras.

3904
05:10:42,400 --> 05:10:45,600
I said Lilith before, but no, I wanted to be Pythagoras.

3905
05:10:45,600 --> 05:10:51,600
Lilith would be like just another humanoid, like normal person on the ship.

3906
05:10:51,600 --> 05:10:56,040
And she'll be in like, oh, like a swimsuit edition of the straw hats, like a wallpaper.

3907
05:10:56,040 --> 05:11:01,560
I defaulted to Lilith because she was the first one they met and because she's got the,

3908
05:11:01,560 --> 05:11:04,680
she's got probably the most aesthetic design.

3909
05:11:04,680 --> 05:11:05,680
She's the coolest looking.

3910
05:11:05,680 --> 05:11:06,680
She's got the most riz.

3911
05:11:06,680 --> 05:11:10,040
Yes, she's got the riz, but Pythagoras is the cutest and the strongest.

3912
05:11:10,040 --> 05:11:13,760
And he's my boy.

3913
05:11:13,760 --> 05:11:16,840
It sucks that the Triter is York, because I liked York.

3914
05:11:16,840 --> 05:11:19,200
I wanted York to join the crew in a way.

3915
05:11:19,200 --> 05:11:20,200
I had no.

3916
05:11:20,200 --> 05:11:21,200
She's huge.

3917
05:11:21,560 --> 05:11:22,720
Huge women on the ship.

3918
05:11:22,720 --> 05:11:25,240
Well, we could get Atlas, I guess.

3919
05:11:25,240 --> 05:11:26,240
I mean, I guess.

3920
05:11:26,240 --> 05:11:27,240
Oh, I guess.

3921
05:11:27,240 --> 05:11:28,240
Yeah.

3922
05:11:28,240 --> 05:11:29,240
Atlas is cool.

3923
05:11:29,240 --> 05:11:30,240
I like Atlas.

3924
05:11:30,240 --> 05:11:31,240
Oh, York is fine.

3925
05:11:31,240 --> 05:11:33,400
I mean, she's weird in an off-putting way.

3926
05:11:33,400 --> 05:11:39,040
And I guess I appreciate that, but I don't know if I want her like around all the time.

3927
05:11:39,040 --> 05:11:42,120
You know what I mean?

3928
05:11:42,120 --> 05:11:43,120
That's what I tell.

3929
05:11:43,120 --> 05:11:44,120
That's what I tell.

3930
05:11:44,120 --> 05:11:47,240
That's, I'm going to, next time I'm on Tinder, I'm going to message and say, hey, don't send

3931
05:11:47,240 --> 05:11:48,240
me a nude.

3932
05:11:48,240 --> 05:11:49,880
I don't appreciate not seeing any nudes.

3933
05:11:49,880 --> 05:11:50,880
Thank you for understanding.

3934
05:11:50,880 --> 05:11:52,920
By the way, you know, I appreciate you.

3935
05:11:52,920 --> 05:11:54,400
You're weird in an off-putting way.

3936
05:11:54,400 --> 05:11:58,840
And I do appreciate that, and they're going to, they're going to get so hot.

3937
05:11:58,840 --> 05:12:01,080
They're going to be so hot for that.

3938
05:12:01,080 --> 05:12:04,200
I just don't want you around all the time.

3939
05:12:04,200 --> 05:12:07,560
I appreciate how weird and an off-putting way you are.

3940
05:12:07,560 --> 05:12:12,720
And I love that about you, but I don't really want you around all the time.

3941
05:12:12,720 --> 05:12:14,560
And I'll say, yeah, that's true.

3942
05:12:14,560 --> 05:12:15,560
That is, yeah.

3943
05:12:15,560 --> 05:12:16,560
Yeah.

3944
05:12:16,560 --> 05:12:19,360
Yeah, you're not, you're not the first, but you're not the first guy to tell me that,

3945
05:12:19,360 --> 05:12:20,360
honestly.

3946
05:12:20,360 --> 05:12:23,600
I don't know what the next word is.

3947
05:12:23,600 --> 05:12:27,960
Pretty good chapter, yeah.

3948
05:12:27,960 --> 05:12:33,680
Didn't, didn't guess it would be York, but it's cool.

3949
05:12:33,680 --> 05:12:34,680
It's the person you least suspect.

3950
05:12:34,680 --> 05:12:38,600
I appreciate, they don't even, they don't even have to explain it.

3951
05:12:38,600 --> 05:12:43,600
I understand immediately, oh, she's tempted because she's a glutton.

3952
05:12:43,600 --> 05:12:47,580
And the celestial dragons live a life of gluttony and decadence.

3953
05:12:47,580 --> 05:12:49,560
And that tempted her to betray them.

3954
05:12:49,560 --> 05:12:50,560
I get it.

3955
05:12:50,560 --> 05:12:51,560
And I like that.

3956
05:12:51,560 --> 05:12:52,560
Perfect.

3957
05:12:52,560 --> 05:12:53,560
Yeah.

3958
05:12:53,560 --> 05:12:58,720
So like, like in this, in this one panel here, like, uh, Vegapunk saying, what are you saying?

3959
05:12:58,720 --> 05:13:03,480
You know the Marishwa, uh, you know what Marishwa is like from that visit a long time ago?

3960
05:13:03,480 --> 05:13:07,160
How could you want to be one of them after witnessing how vile we are?

3961
05:13:07,160 --> 05:13:10,960
And she just laughs and it's just like, ha ha, I like that though.

3962
05:13:10,960 --> 05:13:12,280
You made me like that father.

3963
05:13:12,280 --> 05:13:13,280
Yeah.

3964
05:13:13,280 --> 05:13:14,280
You sound like Shaka.

3965
05:13:14,280 --> 05:13:18,840
He, he also had that opinion, but it's dumb.

3966
05:13:18,840 --> 05:13:22,200
I like it.

3967
05:13:22,200 --> 05:13:24,960
I'm confused a little bit.

3968
05:13:24,960 --> 05:13:25,960
Not confused.

3969
05:13:25,960 --> 05:13:26,960
I'm just curious.

3970
05:13:26,960 --> 05:13:28,400
What is she going to do next?

3971
05:13:28,400 --> 05:13:31,960
Is she going to kill Vegapunk with a bullet to the head right here?

3972
05:13:31,960 --> 05:13:36,280
I'm assuming she's not going to because he's tied up.

3973
05:13:36,280 --> 05:13:38,640
But what, what, what do they need him for?

3974
05:13:38,640 --> 05:13:40,560
What does she need him?

3975
05:13:40,560 --> 05:13:43,680
So she, I mean, would she die if that happened?

3976
05:13:43,680 --> 05:13:48,600
Wouldn't she die because she's like attached to his brain?

3977
05:13:48,600 --> 05:13:54,400
I guess we could go back and check how they describe who, who all these people are and

3978
05:13:54,400 --> 05:13:55,840
what their deal is.

3979
05:13:55,840 --> 05:14:02,480
They share information through the brain, right?

3980
05:14:02,480 --> 05:14:08,360
And if Vegapunk dies, I'm pretty sure the brain dies because it's his brain.

3981
05:14:08,360 --> 05:14:14,480
So I feel like, I mean, maybe if he died, the brain would die, but like she is an independent.

3982
05:14:14,480 --> 05:14:22,040
So she would just persist as her own person with no like link to the brain.

3983
05:14:22,040 --> 05:14:25,800
That might be true.

3984
05:14:25,800 --> 05:14:29,600
It really just, it really just feels like these are not Vegapunk in any meaningful sense

3985
05:14:29,600 --> 05:14:36,840
that he just made seven guys who have a link to his brain.

3986
05:14:36,840 --> 05:14:39,640
Yeah, I don't know.

3987
05:14:39,640 --> 05:14:42,400
I'm going, I'm going back to the chapters.

3988
05:14:42,400 --> 05:14:44,760
I forgot about the mechanized sea beasts.

3989
05:14:44,760 --> 05:14:45,760
Yeah.

3990
05:14:45,760 --> 05:14:52,000
The sea beasts who are just all over the place and the little, the giant robot in the ocean.

3991
05:14:52,000 --> 05:14:54,240
I think the Marines are going to have a big battle with them.

3992
05:14:54,240 --> 05:14:55,840
I wonder how that's going to play out.

3993
05:14:55,840 --> 05:15:03,920
I feel like Kizaru is like not even going to have to fucking think, think about it.

3994
05:15:03,920 --> 05:15:04,920
I mean, there's a lot of them.

3995
05:15:04,920 --> 05:15:08,360
I mean, maybe, yeah, maybe he probably can't defend the entire fleet.

3996
05:15:09,360 --> 05:15:17,720
Hmm, I mean, that's, yeah, that is, that is, I mean, I suppose that is an issue.

3997
05:15:17,720 --> 05:15:20,400
Might delay them.

3998
05:15:20,400 --> 05:15:22,480
But I mean, you know, the merry go got through it.

3999
05:15:22,480 --> 05:15:25,720
I'm sure, I'm sure the grand fleet can get through it.

4000
05:15:25,720 --> 05:15:26,720
A thousand sunny.

4001
05:15:26,720 --> 05:15:27,720
Sorry.

4002
05:15:27,720 --> 05:15:28,720
Yeah.

4003
05:15:28,720 --> 05:15:29,720
Yeah.

4004
05:15:29,720 --> 05:15:30,720
Yeah.

4005
05:15:30,720 --> 05:15:31,720
A thousand sunny.

4006
05:15:31,720 --> 05:15:32,720
Okay.

4007
05:15:32,720 --> 05:15:33,720
I'm reading.

4008
05:15:33,720 --> 05:15:34,720
I'm reading.

4009
05:15:35,200 --> 05:15:39,440
Look at this good old fashioned egghead early chapters.

4010
05:15:40,280 --> 05:15:41,280
Where are you?

4011
05:15:41,280 --> 05:15:43,280
You posting them?

4012
05:15:43,280 --> 05:15:44,280
I'm reading through it.

4013
05:15:44,280 --> 05:15:49,440
I'm trying to find the part where they first describe what's the deal with all these guards.

4014
05:15:49,440 --> 05:15:55,520
Oh, it's the panel with the law turning into a woman because he's fighting Blackbeard

4015
05:15:55,520 --> 05:15:56,520
at the same time.

4016
05:15:56,520 --> 05:15:57,520
Wait.

4017
05:15:57,520 --> 05:15:58,520
Why did he?

4018
05:15:58,520 --> 05:16:02,080
Why did that turn him into a woman?

4019
05:16:02,080 --> 05:16:03,080
Do you remember?

4020
05:16:03,080 --> 05:16:04,080
There was a panel where.

4021
05:16:04,240 --> 05:16:06,040
Was that in turn?

4022
05:16:06,040 --> 05:16:09,240
He did the girl disease or whatever.

4023
05:16:09,240 --> 05:16:11,960
Oh, no, I totally forgot about that.

4024
05:16:11,960 --> 05:16:12,960
So it wasn't Ivankov.

4025
05:16:12,960 --> 05:16:13,960
It wasn't Ivankov.

4026
05:16:13,960 --> 05:16:16,600
Yeah, Blackbeard and Law are fighting.

4027
05:16:16,600 --> 05:16:17,600
Was that was?

4028
05:16:17,600 --> 05:16:18,600
Currently.

4029
05:16:18,600 --> 05:16:19,600
They're fighting now?

4030
05:16:19,600 --> 05:16:20,600
God damn.

4031
05:16:20,600 --> 05:16:21,600
Well, not now.

4032
05:16:21,600 --> 05:16:25,040
I mean, as I'm reading, this is happening during the egghead.

4033
05:16:25,040 --> 05:16:26,040
Okay.

4034
05:16:26,040 --> 05:16:27,040
So not that long ago.

4035
05:16:27,040 --> 05:16:28,040
Not that long ago.

4036
05:16:28,040 --> 05:16:29,040
I forgot about that.

4037
05:16:29,040 --> 05:16:30,040
I forgot about that.

4038
05:16:30,040 --> 05:16:31,040
It sort of rings a bell here.

4039
05:16:31,040 --> 05:16:32,040
I don't think we see.

4040
05:16:32,040 --> 05:16:34,320
Oh, and Pudding is in Blackbeard's ship.

4041
05:16:34,320 --> 05:16:35,320
No way.

4042
05:16:35,320 --> 05:16:38,480
No, Pudding is with Mary.

4043
05:16:38,480 --> 05:16:41,880
No, Pudding is not with Big News Morgan.

4044
05:16:41,880 --> 05:16:45,800
No, that's that's an alabaster girl.

4045
05:16:45,800 --> 05:16:48,400
Vivi is with Big News Morgan.

4046
05:16:48,400 --> 05:16:51,360
Yeah, Pudding is.

4047
05:16:51,360 --> 05:16:53,640
Is Pudding with Blackbeard?

4048
05:16:53,640 --> 05:16:56,520
In Blackbeard's brig, I guess.

4049
05:16:56,520 --> 05:16:57,520
She's in prison.

4050
05:16:57,520 --> 05:16:58,520
As a prisoner.

4051
05:16:58,520 --> 05:16:59,520
Oh, okay.

4052
05:16:59,520 --> 05:17:00,520
Yeah.

4053
05:17:00,520 --> 05:17:06,360
So I guess I guess at the end of the whole cake, a Caesar was leaving Blackbeard was

4054
05:17:06,360 --> 05:17:08,600
there to scoop up Pudding for some reason.

4055
05:17:08,600 --> 05:17:09,600
Hmm.

4056
05:17:09,600 --> 05:17:11,080
It seemed a valuable hostage.

4057
05:17:11,080 --> 05:17:12,360
Now, law is around.

4058
05:17:12,360 --> 05:17:14,280
Man, this is all very important.

4059
05:17:14,280 --> 05:17:15,280
I kind of agree.

4060
05:17:15,280 --> 05:17:16,280
Yeah, it's really important.

4061
05:17:16,280 --> 05:17:22,600
These are important people.

4062
05:17:22,600 --> 05:17:23,600
Got that giant robot.

4063
05:17:23,600 --> 05:17:25,000
He's so fucking cool.

4064
05:17:25,000 --> 05:17:26,200
I want him to do something.

4065
05:17:26,200 --> 05:17:29,800
Oh, the one that was like inactive because they couldn't activate him because they don't

4066
05:17:29,800 --> 05:17:31,320
have the power to power him.

4067
05:17:31,320 --> 05:17:32,320
Yeah.

4068
05:17:32,320 --> 05:17:33,320
No, no, no.

4069
05:17:33,320 --> 05:17:34,320
The one that finds them.

4070
05:17:34,320 --> 05:17:35,480
You see, remember how big he is?

4071
05:17:35,480 --> 05:17:38,320
He's holding their ship right now in this image I'm posting.

4072
05:17:38,320 --> 05:17:39,320
Is that Pythagoras?

4073
05:17:39,320 --> 05:17:40,320
No, no.

4074
05:17:40,320 --> 05:17:41,820
It's a different guy.

4075
05:17:41,820 --> 05:17:44,440
It's the guy that Lilith was riding inside.

4076
05:17:44,440 --> 05:17:45,440
Who?

4077
05:17:45,440 --> 05:17:46,440
Lilith.

4078
05:17:46,440 --> 05:17:47,440
Oh.

4079
05:17:47,440 --> 05:17:48,440
Oh.

4080
05:17:48,440 --> 05:17:53,600
When they got there to the water, there was like a giant metal shark.

4081
05:17:53,600 --> 05:17:54,600
Oh, yeah.

4082
05:17:54,600 --> 05:17:55,600
And then there was a giant robot.

4083
05:17:55,600 --> 05:17:56,600
She was in a big thing.

4084
05:17:56,600 --> 05:17:57,600
Yeah.

4085
05:17:57,600 --> 05:17:58,600
Okay.

4086
05:17:58,600 --> 05:18:00,960
And then there was a giant robot.

4087
05:18:00,960 --> 05:18:04,600
And she came out and she said, I'm Dr. Vegapunk.

4088
05:18:04,600 --> 05:18:08,000
And they were like, huh, I didn't know Vegapunk was a woman.

4089
05:18:08,000 --> 05:18:09,080
They didn't know yet.

4090
05:18:09,080 --> 05:18:10,080
Right.

4091
05:18:10,080 --> 05:18:12,760
There's a giant monster down there.

4092
05:18:12,760 --> 05:18:13,760
Giant monsters down there.

4093
05:18:13,760 --> 05:18:16,520
It's like some kind of futuristic city.

4094
05:18:16,520 --> 05:18:18,520
It's exactly like that.

4095
05:18:18,520 --> 05:18:21,640
It's kind of like what if the city was the future.

4096
05:18:21,640 --> 05:18:26,120
She said the world of tomorrow is here, but actually it's the world of yesterday.

4097
05:18:26,120 --> 05:18:27,120
Oh, I forgot.

4098
05:18:28,120 --> 05:18:33,240
I forgot that the fucking swamp, swamp fruit freak with the long tongue is still on the

4099
05:18:33,240 --> 05:18:35,240
ship, on the storm ship.

4100
05:18:35,240 --> 05:18:36,240
He is.

4101
05:18:36,240 --> 05:18:37,920
I also forgot that.

4102
05:18:37,920 --> 05:18:38,920
He's a stowaway.

4103
05:18:38,920 --> 05:18:42,640
So they don't know, they don't know, they don't know that he's there or did they agree

4104
05:18:42,640 --> 05:18:44,440
to let him come with them?

4105
05:18:44,440 --> 05:18:46,480
Well, I don't think they agreed.

4106
05:18:46,480 --> 05:18:48,920
I think he's just.

4107
05:18:48,920 --> 05:18:49,920
He's just there.

4108
05:18:49,920 --> 05:18:53,480
I completely forgot about that.

4109
05:18:54,040 --> 05:18:58,080
It's funny, like One Piece has so many like stories that are happening in the background

4110
05:18:58,080 --> 05:19:03,720
that you have to really pay attention to understand what is going on.

4111
05:19:03,720 --> 05:19:04,720
Oh, wow.

4112
05:19:04,720 --> 05:19:05,720
This is a wiki moment.

4113
05:19:05,720 --> 05:19:07,480
I'd go to the wikis, see what he's doing.

4114
05:19:07,480 --> 05:19:16,760
Yeah, I assume he's just in a barrel or something.

4115
05:19:16,760 --> 05:19:18,280
He's such a fucking loser.

4116
05:19:18,280 --> 05:19:19,280
I love him.

4117
05:19:19,280 --> 05:19:23,440
He's such a scoundrel and a bastard, but he has no.

4118
05:19:23,440 --> 05:19:26,080
He has no successes in life.

4119
05:19:26,080 --> 05:19:30,840
He's constantly losing to the straw hats and he's just sort of like hiding.

4120
05:19:30,840 --> 05:19:32,720
I mean, he should be so powerful.

4121
05:19:32,720 --> 05:19:35,120
He's like a he's like a grand line pirate.

4122
05:19:35,120 --> 05:19:39,920
He's like he's not one of the he's not one of the new generation, but he's like a really

4123
05:19:39,920 --> 05:19:43,440
strong pirate with a freaking logia fruit.

4124
05:19:43,440 --> 05:19:44,440
But he's just this.

4125
05:19:44,440 --> 05:19:45,440
Yeah.

4126
05:19:45,440 --> 05:19:51,440
This worthless like hides in a barrel.

4127
05:19:51,440 --> 05:19:52,440
What is his name?

4128
05:19:52,440 --> 05:19:53,440
I don't remember his name.

4129
05:19:53,440 --> 05:19:54,440
Yeah.

4130
05:19:54,440 --> 05:19:55,440
I can't remember.

4131
05:19:55,440 --> 05:19:56,440
Yeah.

4132
05:19:56,440 --> 05:20:18,280
When does he say I'm on chapter chapters this 1065 explaining it there in the lab.

4133
05:20:18,280 --> 05:20:28,680
They see those Jim base Seraphim and they fight him for a second.

4134
05:20:28,680 --> 05:20:35,880
They fight him for a whole chapter, basically, and then Edison is there.

4135
05:20:35,880 --> 05:20:45,120
Oh, yeah, Pythagoras had a big butt and Edison was the guy who always was small.

4136
05:20:45,120 --> 05:20:47,800
Well, Edison is like normal size, right?

4137
05:20:47,800 --> 05:20:50,360
And Pythagoras is the little guy who has the little head.

4138
05:20:50,360 --> 05:20:51,360
He's just the little head.

4139
05:20:51,360 --> 05:20:52,960
No, Pythagoras is the little guy.

4140
05:20:52,960 --> 05:20:57,800
No, the Pythagoras is the normal size guy who can detach his head and Edison is the

4141
05:20:57,800 --> 05:21:00,960
little guy.

4142
05:21:00,960 --> 05:21:04,800
But Pythagoras is head is smaller than Edison.

4143
05:21:04,800 --> 05:21:06,800
No, look at.

4144
05:21:06,800 --> 05:21:11,240
You're going to have to show you're going to have to show me what you're talking about.

4145
05:21:11,240 --> 05:21:13,360
I'm looking at the introductions.

4146
05:21:13,360 --> 05:21:15,560
That's yeah.

4147
05:21:16,560 --> 05:21:22,360
Oh, okay, but Pythagoras, I mean, yeah, when Pythagoras is head comes out of his body.

4148
05:21:22,360 --> 05:21:27,160
It's like about the same size as Edison's head, but he just has no body.

4149
05:21:27,160 --> 05:21:28,160
Yeah.

4150
05:21:28,160 --> 05:21:29,160
Yeah.

4151
05:21:29,160 --> 05:21:30,160
Okay.

4152
05:21:30,160 --> 05:21:33,160
I mean, that's about what I thought.

4153
05:21:33,160 --> 05:21:40,320
I mean, what's the difference?

4154
05:21:40,320 --> 05:21:43,800
It seems to me that there's like the only difference between Pythagoras and Edison is

4155
05:21:43,800 --> 05:21:51,800
just that Pythagoras has a big body that he can jump in and out of.

4156
05:21:51,800 --> 05:21:53,200
Guess I'd have to read it again.

4157
05:21:53,200 --> 05:22:02,800
I guess they embody a different trait, but I couldn't tell you what that trait is.

4158
05:22:02,800 --> 05:22:05,800
It's really funny that it's really funny that the one that betrayed them isn't the one that

4159
05:22:05,800 --> 05:22:07,800
embodies evil.

4160
05:22:07,800 --> 05:22:09,800
Yes.

4161
05:22:09,800 --> 05:22:10,800
I love that.

4162
05:22:10,800 --> 05:22:11,800
That's a classic switcheroo.

4163
05:22:11,800 --> 05:22:13,800
I mean, yeah, it was like, of course, it wasn't going to be that.

4164
05:22:13,800 --> 05:22:15,800
Of course, it's too obvious.

4165
05:22:23,800 --> 05:22:25,800
God, there's so many chapters.

4166
05:22:25,800 --> 05:22:27,800
I can't remember where anything is.

4167
05:22:27,800 --> 05:22:29,800
What are you looking for?

4168
05:22:29,800 --> 05:22:33,800
I'm looking for when they explain how they work.

4169
05:22:33,800 --> 05:22:40,800
I think Vegapunk is going to talk about his fruit and he's going to say,

4170
05:22:41,800 --> 05:22:46,800
like how the stuff works.

4171
05:22:46,800 --> 05:22:48,800
Okay.

4172
05:22:48,800 --> 05:22:51,800
You met a little girl who called herself Vegapunk, right?

4173
05:22:51,800 --> 05:22:52,800
That's one of my clones.

4174
05:22:52,800 --> 05:22:54,800
There are six on the island.

4175
05:22:54,800 --> 05:22:59,800
Each one is a facet of myself and an expert in their own field, key field of study.

4176
05:22:59,800 --> 05:23:06,800
You get my full personality if you combine them, but they can get six times the work done apart.

4177
05:23:06,800 --> 05:23:09,800
You get my full personality if you combine them, huh?

4178
05:23:09,800 --> 05:23:12,800
So they're not literally him.

4179
05:23:12,800 --> 05:23:18,800
They're like a separated, like if he was one clone and then he separated it into six people.

4180
05:23:18,800 --> 05:23:26,800
He took his personality and then split it into six aspects and then he just built a body for each of them.

4181
05:23:26,800 --> 05:23:28,800
Oh, this is interesting.

4182
05:23:28,800 --> 05:23:33,800
Each of them connects to punk records once a day to synchronize on memories and knowledge.

4183
05:23:33,800 --> 05:23:35,800
Once a day.

4184
05:23:35,800 --> 05:23:38,800
And they say tomorrow things are going to go down.

4185
05:23:38,800 --> 05:23:42,800
So the next time they synchronize, I guess.

4186
05:23:42,800 --> 05:23:44,800
Well, they would already know.

4187
05:23:44,800 --> 05:23:50,800
They would all already know the stuff that Vegapunk has found out about the void century.

4188
05:23:50,800 --> 05:23:51,800
Yes.

4189
05:23:51,800 --> 05:23:58,800
Which means that Vegapunk Stella could die and then one of these other ones could join the crew instead.

4190
05:23:58,800 --> 05:24:05,800
Well, I don't know about that because all the information is stored in the brain, so I feel like they would lose it.

4191
05:24:06,800 --> 05:24:11,800
But if they've got in their mind from the brain, they might retain it.

4192
05:24:11,800 --> 05:24:18,800
Yeah, the brain might stop working, but if they have the info, they just can't connect to the brain anymore because the user is dead.

4193
05:24:18,800 --> 05:24:23,800
I think, I want to say probably, yeah, they only connect once a day.

4194
05:24:23,800 --> 05:24:28,800
They don't need the brain to continue to live.

4195
05:24:28,800 --> 05:24:30,800
So Shaka's been shot in the head.

4196
05:24:30,800 --> 05:24:31,800
Atlas is fine.

4197
05:24:31,800 --> 05:24:34,800
Edison, I don't remember.

4198
05:24:34,800 --> 05:24:35,800
Pythagoras was stepped on.

4199
05:24:35,800 --> 05:24:39,800
Edison was, like, beat up, but it's not clear if he's, like, dead.

4200
05:24:39,800 --> 05:24:40,800
And Lilith is turned to stone.

4201
05:24:40,800 --> 05:24:45,800
Pythagoras seemingly crushed and exploded?

4202
05:24:45,800 --> 05:24:46,800
Yes.

4203
05:24:46,800 --> 05:24:50,800
York turned to stone, but fine and evil.

4204
05:24:50,800 --> 05:24:52,800
Yeah.

4205
05:24:55,800 --> 05:24:57,800
You all share the same brain?

4206
05:24:57,800 --> 05:25:01,800
Think of it, just think of it as sharing the same library.

4207
05:25:01,800 --> 05:25:07,800
If I could let everyone in the world connect to my brain, all of humanity would have access to my knowledge.

4208
05:25:07,800 --> 05:25:08,800
Based.

4209
05:25:08,800 --> 05:25:09,800
Based, Vegapon.

4210
05:25:09,800 --> 05:25:16,800
Yeah, it would be cool if you could get the void sentry information just broadcasted to the entire world.

4211
05:25:16,800 --> 05:25:21,800
But I think Egghead will be destroyed before that can happen.

4212
05:25:21,800 --> 05:25:24,800
I'm sad to say.

4213
05:25:24,800 --> 05:25:25,800
I kind of agree.

4214
05:25:25,800 --> 05:25:29,800
It seems, I think.

4215
05:25:29,800 --> 05:25:34,800
The Marines that they're sending, there's too many of them, I think, that they can fight them and win.

4216
05:25:34,800 --> 05:25:35,800
They have to run away.

4217
05:25:35,800 --> 05:25:38,800
And so Egghead will be commandeered.

4218
05:25:38,800 --> 05:25:43,800
Egghead seems like it's like, wow, this could solve all the world's problems.

4219
05:25:43,800 --> 05:25:45,800
So I think it's probably going to be destroyed.

4220
05:25:45,800 --> 05:25:49,800
And they're going to be like, oh, no, we only have one shred of hope left.

4221
05:25:49,800 --> 05:25:54,800
And it's, you know, what's stored in Pythagoras' little robot mind.

4222
05:25:54,800 --> 05:25:55,800
Little lemon.

4223
05:25:55,800 --> 05:25:58,800
Little lemon head, yeah.

4224
05:25:58,800 --> 05:25:59,800
Yeah, that's what I think.

4225
05:25:59,800 --> 05:26:02,800
We're going to have to regrow a new...

4226
05:26:02,800 --> 05:26:04,800
What's the brain fruit called?

4227
05:26:04,800 --> 05:26:08,800
I mean, this is a brain brain fruit, but I don't remember what it's called in Japanese.

4228
05:26:08,800 --> 05:26:09,800
Brain brain brain brain.

4229
05:26:09,800 --> 05:26:10,800
What does it call it?

4230
05:26:10,800 --> 05:26:12,800
I can't remember.

4231
05:26:12,800 --> 05:26:13,800
A nominoming.

4232
05:26:13,800 --> 05:26:14,800
Nominoming.

4233
05:26:14,800 --> 05:26:15,800
Right.

4234
05:26:15,800 --> 05:26:16,800
Right, right.

4235
05:26:16,800 --> 05:26:17,800
Right.

4236
05:26:17,800 --> 05:26:20,800
We're going to have to wait for a new nominoming to grow.

4237
05:26:20,800 --> 05:26:25,800
Oh, he says that's because I ate the nominominominomin...

4238
05:26:25,800 --> 05:26:28,060
No, we no me no me no me no me no me no me no me.

4239
05:26:28,060 --> 05:26:28,880
Nice.

4240
05:26:30,160 --> 05:26:31,000
Loll, Loll.

4241
05:26:32,240 --> 05:26:33,060
Great.

4242
05:26:33,060 --> 05:26:33,920
That's one piece.

4243
05:26:33,920 --> 05:26:35,740
That's one piece.

4244
05:26:35,740 --> 05:26:36,580
Good chapter.

4245
05:26:38,160 --> 05:26:39,480
I love one piece.

4246
05:26:39,480 --> 05:26:41,320
It's better than ever.

4247
05:26:41,320 --> 05:26:42,700
It's better than ever.

4248
05:26:43,920 --> 05:26:45,460
You wanna go to voicemails?

4249
05:26:45,460 --> 05:26:47,080
Yes, I hope there's not that many.

4250
05:26:47,080 --> 05:26:48,920
There is a normal amount.

4251
05:26:51,520 --> 05:26:54,740
All right, well let's get into it.

4252
05:26:54,740 --> 05:27:02,740
Uh, I see the first one is called the Ben St. Cancellation Hour from Quickman at EXE 3, 2, 1, go.

4253
05:27:02,740 --> 05:27:10,740
Heh, what's up y'all? Quickman.exe here. I have taken a break from parrying off Ben's attacks to jack into the PCP voicemails and cancel him.

4254
05:27:10,740 --> 05:27:14,740
Without further ado, here are three problematic quotes by Ben St.

4255
05:27:14,740 --> 05:27:17,740
A person of color, haven't seen those before.

4256
05:27:17,740 --> 05:27:20,740
This little boy ought to relieve my boredom.

4257
05:27:20,740 --> 05:27:25,740
And finally, with a cameo from Rusting Robot, Ben, that's a child.

4258
05:27:25,740 --> 05:27:27,740
She's a high schooler, it's fine.

4259
05:27:27,740 --> 05:27:30,740
Truly deplorable, how does this man have a platform?

4260
05:27:30,740 --> 05:27:33,740
Bye bye Ben, see you in Mega Man Network Transmission.

4261
05:27:33,740 --> 05:27:40,740
First of all, who among us has not at one point in their life seen a person of color for the first time?

4262
05:27:40,740 --> 05:27:41,740
Second of all...

4263
05:27:41,740 --> 05:27:44,740
It's been late for you Ben.

4264
05:27:44,740 --> 05:27:45,740
We're all born knowing nothing.

4265
05:27:45,740 --> 05:27:47,740
How'd you go so far?

4266
05:27:47,740 --> 05:27:51,740
I got so far, I got so close.

4267
05:27:51,740 --> 05:27:55,740
And was the second one?

4268
05:27:55,740 --> 05:27:56,740
Child?

4269
05:27:56,740 --> 05:27:57,740
Little boy?

4270
05:27:57,740 --> 05:27:58,740
This boy should relieve my boredom?

4271
05:27:58,740 --> 05:28:02,740
Yeah, because they're full of joy and enthusiasm and lust for life.

4272
05:28:02,740 --> 05:28:04,740
Not lust for anything else though.

4273
05:28:04,740 --> 05:28:08,740
And then the third one...

4274
05:28:08,740 --> 05:28:12,740
High schoolers can be 18, and that means it's fine.

4275
05:28:12,740 --> 05:28:13,740
It's fine.

4276
05:28:13,740 --> 05:28:17,740
Next one is called Twizzlers at PrinceIsolation at Twitter.com.

4277
05:28:17,740 --> 05:28:19,740
3, 2, 1, go.

4278
05:28:19,740 --> 05:28:23,740
I was listening back to one of Ben's recent battle network streams,

4279
05:28:23,740 --> 05:28:26,740
and he was talking about trying to make licorice,

4280
05:28:26,740 --> 05:28:30,740
and then he mentioned trying to make something like Twizzlers.

4281
05:28:30,740 --> 05:28:33,740
And I just have to say that recently, you know,

4282
05:28:33,740 --> 05:28:37,740
Twizzlers aren't that common where I live in the Netherlands.

4283
05:28:37,740 --> 05:28:43,740
And I just found them a few weeks ago at like a local candy store,

4284
05:28:43,740 --> 05:28:45,740
I suppose, and I bought some.

4285
05:28:45,740 --> 05:28:47,740
And I tried them.

4286
05:28:47,740 --> 05:28:50,740
And my girlfriend at the time also tried them.

4287
05:28:50,740 --> 05:28:56,740
And we both agreed that they are disgusting.

4288
05:28:56,740 --> 05:28:57,740
What is...

4289
05:28:57,740 --> 05:28:58,740
What?

4290
05:28:58,740 --> 05:28:59,740
They taste like nothing.

4291
05:28:59,740 --> 05:29:01,740
They taste like eating rubber.

4292
05:29:01,740 --> 05:29:03,740
Like what the fuck is that?

4293
05:29:03,740 --> 05:29:09,740
I thought that American food was supposed to be like completely annihilated with sugar,

4294
05:29:09,740 --> 05:29:12,740
but it tastes like nothing.

4295
05:29:12,740 --> 05:29:17,740
I genuinely threw it away because it would literally be just as fun chewing on cardboard.

4296
05:29:17,740 --> 05:29:19,740
Anyways, yeah, thoughts.

4297
05:29:19,740 --> 05:29:21,740
Is it different here?

4298
05:29:21,740 --> 05:29:22,740
Like what the fuck happened?

4299
05:29:22,740 --> 05:29:24,740
I know licorice.

4300
05:29:24,740 --> 05:29:26,740
Like I'm not a big licorice guy either way,

4301
05:29:26,740 --> 05:29:29,740
but like Dutch people like licorice,

4302
05:29:29,740 --> 05:29:31,740
but it's like fucking black.

4303
05:29:31,740 --> 05:29:33,740
Like it's dark and it's strong.

4304
05:29:33,740 --> 05:29:35,740
It tastes strong at least.

4305
05:29:35,740 --> 05:29:37,740
Twizzlers taste like nothing.

4306
05:29:37,740 --> 05:29:39,740
What the fuck was up with that?

4307
05:29:39,740 --> 05:29:41,740
I mean, I think if you're going for...

4308
05:29:41,740 --> 05:29:44,740
I would prefer the cherry Twizzlers to the black licorice Twizzlers.

4309
05:29:44,740 --> 05:29:48,740
I like black licorice, but like Twizzlers are not real licorice,

4310
05:29:48,740 --> 05:29:51,740
so I would try the cherry ones, I guess.

4311
05:29:51,740 --> 05:29:53,740
I like how rubbery and chewy they are.

4312
05:29:53,740 --> 05:29:54,740
I like it.

4313
05:29:54,740 --> 05:29:56,740
And I like that their flavor is mild.

4314
05:29:56,740 --> 05:29:57,740
I like them.

4315
05:29:57,740 --> 05:29:59,740
I like turkey Twizzlers.

4316
05:29:59,740 --> 05:30:00,740
You ever heard of those?

4317
05:30:00,740 --> 05:30:04,740
Oh, the like twisty fried things?

4318
05:30:04,740 --> 05:30:06,740
The twisty fried meat product.

4319
05:30:06,740 --> 05:30:09,740
Yeah, I've never had one, but I would definitely eat one.

4320
05:30:09,740 --> 05:30:10,740
I would definitely eat one.

4321
05:30:10,740 --> 05:30:11,740
No question.

4322
05:30:11,740 --> 05:30:12,740
I want one.

4323
05:30:12,740 --> 05:30:13,740
I want them.

4324
05:30:13,740 --> 05:30:15,740
They look cool.

4325
05:30:15,740 --> 05:30:16,740
Next one is called...

4326
05:30:16,740 --> 05:30:18,740
Do you like black licorice kid?

4327
05:30:18,740 --> 05:30:20,740
I think I've had it when I was young

4328
05:30:20,740 --> 05:30:22,740
and I thought it was a bit weird.

4329
05:30:22,740 --> 05:30:27,740
And I haven't re-approached it,

4330
05:30:27,740 --> 05:30:28,740
but I didn't hate it.

4331
05:30:28,740 --> 05:30:29,740
I hate it.

4332
05:30:29,740 --> 05:30:30,740
I think I could eat one.

4333
05:30:30,740 --> 05:30:32,740
Some people find it disgusting,

4334
05:30:32,740 --> 05:30:34,740
and I think those people are disgusting.

4335
05:30:34,740 --> 05:30:37,740
I'm a big licorice friend myself.

4336
05:30:37,740 --> 05:30:40,740
It's sort of like a mint, not mint flavored,

4337
05:30:40,740 --> 05:30:44,740
but like the sensation of like a spicy sort of peppermint.

4338
05:30:44,740 --> 05:30:46,740
It's a little bit...

4339
05:30:46,740 --> 05:30:47,740
It's a little...

4340
05:30:47,740 --> 05:30:49,740
Yeah, it's a little bit minty, so sort of.

4341
05:30:49,740 --> 05:30:51,740
It's like an herbal...

4342
05:30:51,740 --> 05:30:53,740
When you drink birch beer,

4343
05:30:53,740 --> 05:30:55,740
birch beer tastes like partially like mint

4344
05:30:55,740 --> 05:30:57,740
and partially like licorice, and I love it.

4345
05:30:58,740 --> 05:31:00,740
Yeah, it's kind of like an herbal, somewhat minty.

4346
05:31:00,740 --> 05:31:02,740
Yeah, I think that's a fair comparison.

4347
05:31:02,740 --> 05:31:03,740
It's kind of root beer.

4348
05:31:03,740 --> 05:31:05,740
It's not a sugar.

4349
05:31:05,740 --> 05:31:08,740
It's a herbal sort of...

4350
05:31:08,740 --> 05:31:09,740
It's a spice.

4351
05:31:09,740 --> 05:31:10,740
Spicy.

4352
05:31:10,740 --> 05:31:12,740
It's a little bit of a spice flavor.

4353
05:31:12,740 --> 05:31:16,740
You ever go to an Indian restaurant

4354
05:31:16,740 --> 05:31:18,740
and they have the little bowl of like the little brightly colored

4355
05:31:18,740 --> 05:31:22,740
like little candy beads that are like really small?

4356
05:31:22,740 --> 05:31:24,740
No, I haven't heard of those.

4357
05:31:24,740 --> 05:31:27,740
Oh, those are candy coated fennel seeds,

4358
05:31:27,740 --> 05:31:29,740
and those have a similar flavor.

4359
05:31:29,740 --> 05:31:32,740
I really like licorice, and I'm a big fan of it,

4360
05:31:32,740 --> 05:31:35,740
and a lot of people think it's gross, and I think it's fucking stupid.

4361
05:31:35,740 --> 05:31:37,740
I've liked it ever since I was a little kid.

4362
05:31:37,740 --> 05:31:42,740
I need another licorice to remember what it was like.

4363
05:31:42,740 --> 05:31:44,740
I wouldn't recommend black Twizzlers.

4364
05:31:44,740 --> 05:31:45,740
I mean, they're okay.

4365
05:31:45,740 --> 05:31:46,740
They're not the best.

4366
05:31:46,740 --> 05:31:47,740
I would get it like...

4367
05:31:47,740 --> 05:31:51,740
Sometimes you can get it like thicker pieces, like cut into chunks.

4368
05:31:51,740 --> 05:31:55,740
Sometimes they have sort of like a six holes, like honeycomb sort of shape.

4369
05:31:55,740 --> 05:31:56,740
I like those ones.

4370
05:31:56,740 --> 05:31:58,740
They're kind of chewy.

4371
05:31:58,740 --> 05:32:01,740
I think those ones are pretty good.

4372
05:32:01,740 --> 05:32:02,740
Anyway.

4373
05:32:02,740 --> 05:32:04,740
I remember there being like a licorice selection.

4374
05:32:04,740 --> 05:32:06,740
Licorice all sorts.

4375
05:32:06,740 --> 05:32:11,740
There's a company called Getz that makes caramel candy,

4376
05:32:11,740 --> 05:32:13,740
especially cow tails.

4377
05:32:13,740 --> 05:32:17,740
They also make a licorice version of like the creams.

4378
05:32:17,740 --> 05:32:21,740
It's like chewable black licorice with like a creamy sugar interior,

4379
05:32:21,740 --> 05:32:22,740
and I really like those.

4380
05:32:22,740 --> 05:32:23,740
All right.

4381
05:32:23,740 --> 05:32:25,740
I remember these licorice all sorts.

4382
05:32:25,740 --> 05:32:27,740
I think I kind of like some of these.

4383
05:32:27,740 --> 05:32:30,740
Oh, I've never had these.

4384
05:32:30,740 --> 05:32:31,740
I've never had these.

4385
05:32:31,740 --> 05:32:32,740
No, maybe I have.

4386
05:32:32,740 --> 05:32:34,740
These look familiar.

4387
05:32:34,740 --> 05:32:36,740
You ever had Good and Plenty's?

4388
05:32:36,740 --> 05:32:37,740
Nope.

4389
05:32:37,740 --> 05:32:38,740
Well, I maybe.

4390
05:32:38,740 --> 05:32:39,740
I don't remember.

4391
05:32:39,740 --> 05:32:40,740
Let me find a picture.

4392
05:32:40,740 --> 05:32:41,740
Good and Plenty's are a little...

4393
05:32:41,740 --> 05:32:47,740
I just remember this little mascot with the pink face.

4394
05:32:47,740 --> 05:32:48,740
He's a licorice boy.

4395
05:32:48,740 --> 05:32:54,740
Good and Plenty's are a licorice, a candy coated licorice candy.

4396
05:32:54,740 --> 05:32:57,740
They're like M&M's, but instead of chocolate,

4397
05:32:57,740 --> 05:32:58,740
they have licorice in them,

4398
05:32:58,740 --> 05:33:03,740
and most people would be very upset about that.

4399
05:33:03,740 --> 05:33:05,740
Here's a picture.

4400
05:33:05,740 --> 05:33:07,740
Good and Plenty's.

4401
05:33:07,740 --> 05:33:10,740
That looks like diarrhea pills.

4402
05:33:10,740 --> 05:33:13,740
You know, I see it.

4403
05:33:13,740 --> 05:33:16,740
It looks like Pepto-Bismol, yeah.

4404
05:33:17,740 --> 05:33:18,740
Okay.

4405
05:33:18,740 --> 05:33:21,740
Next one is called Old Lady Appreciation Hour.

4406
05:33:21,740 --> 05:33:24,740
Three, two, one, go.

4407
05:33:24,740 --> 05:33:30,740
Honestly, that one lady in the Battle Network II game,

4408
05:33:30,740 --> 05:33:35,740
who went to America to sell her chopsticks

4409
05:33:35,740 --> 05:33:39,740
that she made with her deceased husband.

4410
05:33:39,740 --> 05:33:42,740
And she keeps talking about it.

4411
05:33:42,740 --> 05:33:50,740
I feel so much emotion for this old Japanese woman.

4412
05:33:50,740 --> 05:33:53,740
There's an NPC on the plane.

4413
05:33:53,740 --> 05:33:55,740
When the plane is going through, it's a tribulation,

4414
05:33:55,740 --> 05:34:00,740
and you can talk to her, and she tells you that she came...

4415
05:34:00,740 --> 05:34:04,740
I mean, she went from electopia to netopia,

4416
05:34:04,740 --> 05:34:05,740
because in electopia,

4417
05:34:05,740 --> 05:34:08,740
she and her husband had a business making chopsticks,

4418
05:34:08,740 --> 05:34:11,740
and electopia is basically Japan,

4419
05:34:11,740 --> 05:34:13,740
and netopia is basically America.

4420
05:34:13,740 --> 05:34:15,740
So she was basically like,

4421
05:34:15,740 --> 05:34:17,740
oh, me and my husband always had a dream of going global

4422
05:34:17,740 --> 05:34:19,740
with our chopsticks business,

4423
05:34:19,740 --> 05:34:22,740
so I'm going to netopia to try and sell my chopsticks in America

4424
05:34:22,740 --> 05:34:25,740
and start a branch location,

4425
05:34:25,740 --> 05:34:28,740
and my husband's spirit is watching over me or whatever.

4426
05:34:28,740 --> 05:34:30,740
And it's pretty sad, but it's even sadder when you realize

4427
05:34:30,740 --> 05:34:32,740
it's not going to take off,

4428
05:34:32,740 --> 05:34:34,740
because Americans don't eat with chopsticks.

4429
05:34:34,740 --> 05:34:37,740
This business venture was doomed from the start.

4430
05:34:37,740 --> 05:34:40,740
It's a cruel joke by putting her in that game.

4431
05:34:40,740 --> 05:34:43,740
Just be happy that you had a successful chopsticks

4432
05:34:43,740 --> 05:34:45,740
making business in your home country.

4433
05:34:45,740 --> 05:34:47,740
That's more than most people think.

4434
05:34:47,740 --> 05:34:49,740
She's doing it for him, Ben.

4435
05:34:49,740 --> 05:34:51,740
She should do it for herself.

4436
05:34:51,740 --> 05:34:56,740
He's gone. He doesn't need a successful business anymore.

4437
05:34:56,740 --> 05:34:58,740
I'm looking at these liquorice all sorts.

4438
05:34:58,740 --> 05:35:01,740
I see the one that's like a black tube with white in the middle.

4439
05:35:01,740 --> 05:35:04,740
Is that sugar stuff in the middle,

4440
05:35:04,740 --> 05:35:07,740
or is that just more gummy stuff?

4441
05:35:07,740 --> 05:35:12,740
I remember having these when I was like six.

4442
05:35:12,740 --> 05:35:14,740
I want to try these.

4443
05:35:14,740 --> 05:35:16,740
I want to try these. They look awesome.

4444
05:35:16,740 --> 05:35:19,740
They're so weird. They're really strange looking,

4445
05:35:19,740 --> 05:35:22,740
but I want them.

4446
05:35:22,740 --> 05:35:26,740
What if you had color in your liquorice?

4447
05:35:26,740 --> 05:35:29,740
Weird little colorful pieces of liquorice.

4448
05:35:29,740 --> 05:35:31,740
Did liquorice originate from the UK?

4449
05:35:31,740 --> 05:35:33,740
I feel like it's probably one of those things.

4450
05:35:33,740 --> 05:35:35,740
I think it's Victorian in origin.

4451
05:35:35,740 --> 05:35:37,740
I know. I think it's older than that.

4452
05:35:37,740 --> 05:35:40,740
I mean, I think it's probably like a traditional...

4453
05:35:40,740 --> 05:35:45,740
I mean, maybe not in its modern chewable gummy candy form,

4454
05:35:45,740 --> 05:35:48,740
but as a flavoring for stuff, I think people have probably used it.

4455
05:35:48,740 --> 05:35:50,740
Oh, yeah, it's a plant.

4456
05:35:50,740 --> 05:35:52,740
Yeah, it's a plant derivative.

4457
05:35:52,740 --> 05:35:55,740
Where's it from? Where's the history?

4458
05:35:55,740 --> 05:35:57,740
They're just telling me the different types.

4459
05:35:57,740 --> 05:35:59,740
Yeah, Wikipedia is just talking about...

4460
05:35:59,740 --> 05:36:03,740
Oh, okay, there's a different article for liquorice confectionary.

4461
05:36:03,740 --> 05:36:05,740
Yeah, I'm looking at that, but...

4462
05:36:05,740 --> 05:36:08,740
Yeah, health effects.

4463
05:36:08,740 --> 05:36:10,740
Hmm.

4464
05:36:10,740 --> 05:36:14,740
German Nordic liquorice characteristic contains ammonium chloride

4465
05:36:14,740 --> 05:36:16,740
instead of sodium chloride?

4466
05:36:16,740 --> 05:36:18,740
Prominently so in salty liquorice.

4467
05:36:18,740 --> 05:36:19,740
Hmm, what?

4468
05:36:19,740 --> 05:36:21,740
Sounds good.

4469
05:36:21,740 --> 05:36:23,740
I've been finding...

4470
05:36:23,740 --> 05:36:25,740
It's miraculous how, like, adding salt,

4471
05:36:25,740 --> 05:36:27,740
when food tastes bad,

4472
05:36:27,740 --> 05:36:30,740
a lot of the time it just needs salt and then tastes good.

4473
05:36:30,740 --> 05:36:32,740
Just eats salt.

4474
05:36:32,740 --> 05:36:37,740
I saw a TikTok recently where the lady was saying

4475
05:36:37,740 --> 05:36:40,740
when people complain that food is under-seasoned,

4476
05:36:40,740 --> 05:36:46,740
most seasonings are just dehydrated vegetables that are powdered.

4477
05:36:46,740 --> 05:36:48,740
If people say your food is under-seasoned,

4478
05:36:48,740 --> 05:36:51,740
it usually just means there's not enough salt,

4479
05:36:51,740 --> 05:36:55,740
or else that it's missing something like an acid,

4480
05:36:55,740 --> 05:36:57,740
like lemon juice or vinegar.

4481
05:36:57,740 --> 05:36:59,740
And I think she's right.

4482
05:36:59,740 --> 05:37:05,740
Most foods taste good when they have the appropriate amount of salt in them.

4483
05:37:05,740 --> 05:37:06,740
I'm thinking back on...

4484
05:37:06,740 --> 05:37:07,740
It's true.

4485
05:37:07,740 --> 05:37:09,740
I'm thinking back on my dad's meatloaf.

4486
05:37:09,740 --> 05:37:11,740
My dad, he would make meatloaf all the time,

4487
05:37:11,740 --> 05:37:13,740
and sometimes it wouldn't be that good,

4488
05:37:13,740 --> 05:37:15,740
and I would think that the problem was that it was over-seasoned,

4489
05:37:15,740 --> 05:37:18,740
like it was too herbal, like he had too much seasoning in it.

4490
05:37:18,740 --> 05:37:21,740
And I think, thinking back, that it just could have used more salt.

4491
05:37:21,740 --> 05:37:25,740
I think that would have fixed a lot of what I didn't like about it.

4492
05:37:26,740 --> 05:37:29,740
I like at the bottom of this licorice confectionary Wikipedia article,

4493
05:37:29,740 --> 05:37:30,740
it says,

4494
05:37:30,740 --> 05:37:34,740
see also licorice international and list of unusual deaths.

4495
05:37:36,740 --> 05:37:37,740
Okay.

4496
05:37:37,740 --> 05:37:38,740
It's very related.

4497
05:37:38,740 --> 05:37:41,740
When I looked on YouTube for how to make licorice,

4498
05:37:41,740 --> 05:37:50,740
a lot of the recipes, they called for condensed milk,

4499
05:37:50,740 --> 05:37:52,740
and I'm like, what the fuck?

4500
05:37:52,740 --> 05:37:55,740
That's not candy thing.

4501
05:37:55,740 --> 05:37:57,740
Maybe for some kind of homemade shit.

4502
05:37:57,740 --> 05:37:59,740
But yeah, I'm looking here on the licorice confectionary page,

4503
05:37:59,740 --> 05:38:02,740
and it says the ingredients are licorice extract,

4504
05:38:02,740 --> 05:38:04,740
sugar, and some kind of binder like starch flour,

4505
05:38:04,740 --> 05:38:08,740
gum arabic, gelatin, beeswax, molasses.

4506
05:38:08,740 --> 05:38:11,740
So I don't know why, but when you look on YouTube,

4507
05:38:11,740 --> 05:38:14,740
every recipe you find involves condensed milk.

4508
05:38:14,740 --> 05:38:18,740
And I don't think that does not give you a product like you would buy in a store.

4509
05:38:18,740 --> 05:38:20,740
Not even close.

4510
05:38:20,740 --> 05:38:21,740
It can't.

4511
05:38:21,740 --> 05:38:22,740
It can't possible.

4512
05:38:25,740 --> 05:38:26,740
Okay, let's move on.

4513
05:38:26,740 --> 05:38:28,740
Yeah, yeah, let's move on.

4514
05:38:28,740 --> 05:38:32,740
Okay, next one is an image, but it's legal, bro.

4515
05:38:32,740 --> 05:38:34,740
It's 100% legal.

4516
05:38:34,740 --> 05:38:36,740
It is right.

4517
05:38:36,740 --> 05:38:38,740
It is.

4518
05:38:38,740 --> 05:38:40,740
You can really listen to it right now.

4519
05:38:40,740 --> 05:38:42,740
Yo, legal.

4520
05:38:42,740 --> 05:38:45,740
We got to legalize the procrastinator's podcast.

4521
05:38:45,740 --> 05:38:46,740
I'm running for president.

4522
05:38:46,740 --> 05:38:50,740
If I'm elected president, I will legalize the procrastinator's podcast.

4523
05:38:50,740 --> 05:38:52,740
Free them.

4524
05:38:54,740 --> 05:38:57,740
I don't know what else to say about this other than true.

4525
05:38:57,740 --> 05:38:59,740
It is legal, bro.

4526
05:38:59,740 --> 05:39:01,740
Next one is an album.

4527
05:39:01,740 --> 05:39:03,740
Oh, it's just one image.

4528
05:39:03,740 --> 05:39:05,740
Yo, Mr. Ben, where's my money, bitch?

4529
05:39:05,740 --> 05:39:08,740
No homework for the win.

4530
05:39:08,740 --> 05:39:11,740
Jesse, shut the fuck up, libtard.

4531
05:39:11,740 --> 05:39:14,740
Don't fuck with an April bully.

4532
05:39:15,740 --> 05:39:18,740
What does April boy mean?

4533
05:39:18,740 --> 05:39:20,740
Is that...

4534
05:39:20,740 --> 05:39:22,740
Oh, is this Jesse?

4535
05:39:22,740 --> 05:39:24,740
Oh, it's Jesse.

4536
05:39:24,740 --> 05:39:27,740
Right, okay, okay.

4537
05:39:27,740 --> 05:39:30,740
Jesse, shut the fuck up, libtard.

4538
05:39:30,740 --> 05:39:33,740
This is exactly how it goes.

4539
05:39:33,740 --> 05:39:36,740
Don't fuck with an April boy.

4540
05:39:36,740 --> 05:39:40,740
My giant egg head.

4541
05:39:40,740 --> 05:39:42,740
It's just like one piece.

4542
05:39:42,740 --> 05:39:45,740
Maybe that's why I like the current arc so much.

4543
05:39:48,740 --> 05:39:50,740
This is just funny.

4544
05:39:50,740 --> 05:39:52,740
When wait.

4545
05:39:52,740 --> 05:39:54,740
I'm laughing.

4546
05:39:54,740 --> 05:39:56,740
I'm having a good time.

4547
05:39:56,740 --> 05:39:58,740
Next is...

4548
05:39:58,740 --> 05:40:00,740
It's another image.

4549
05:40:00,740 --> 05:40:02,740
It's a Vinnie's doodle.

4550
05:40:02,740 --> 05:40:05,740
Sorry, no comic gear, but working on it now.

4551
05:40:05,740 --> 05:40:07,740
It's fine.

4552
05:40:07,740 --> 05:40:09,740
Hey, don't stress about it.

4553
05:40:09,740 --> 05:40:11,740
What's going on here?

4554
05:40:11,740 --> 05:40:13,740
This is unfinished.

4555
05:40:13,740 --> 05:40:16,740
You can see Uwupiti's uncovered physique.

4556
05:40:16,740 --> 05:40:19,740
Why did you put green on green like this?

4557
05:40:21,740 --> 05:40:24,740
I guess because this is green.

4558
05:40:24,740 --> 05:40:27,740
Is that my skeleton?

4559
05:40:27,740 --> 05:40:30,740
If you scroll down, it's different versions of the same image.

4560
05:40:30,740 --> 05:40:34,740
Yeah, I mean the last one is the clearest.

4561
05:40:34,740 --> 05:40:36,740
Yeah, last color correction.

4562
05:40:36,740 --> 05:40:38,740
This one's the easiest to see.

4563
05:40:38,740 --> 05:40:40,740
These look cool.

4564
05:40:40,740 --> 05:40:43,740
I think that Uwupiti's got the brain floating inside of it.

4565
05:40:43,740 --> 05:40:45,740
I like the Caliborn skull.

4566
05:40:45,740 --> 05:40:47,740
Is that Caliborn? It does look like Caliborn.

4567
05:40:47,740 --> 05:40:50,740
It just reminds me of him because of the green skull and the red.

4568
05:40:50,740 --> 05:40:52,740
It looks very much like Caliborn.

4569
05:40:52,740 --> 05:40:54,740
I don't know if it's...

4570
05:40:54,740 --> 05:40:56,740
I don't know what it's...

4571
05:40:56,740 --> 05:40:58,740
Yeah, whose skeleton is that?

4572
05:40:58,740 --> 05:41:01,740
And also, who is that sultry looking...

4573
05:41:01,740 --> 05:41:03,740
Slime.

4574
05:41:03,740 --> 05:41:06,740
Slime away down at the bottom there.

4575
05:41:07,740 --> 05:41:09,740
It's just a little guy.

4576
05:41:09,740 --> 05:41:11,740
They look like they're having a...

4577
05:41:11,740 --> 05:41:13,740
A good old time.

4578
05:41:13,740 --> 05:41:15,740
Cool.

4579
05:41:15,740 --> 05:41:17,740
I like my big green eyes.

4580
05:41:17,740 --> 05:41:19,740
Thanks, Vinny.

4581
05:41:19,740 --> 05:41:21,740
Thumbs up.

4582
05:41:21,740 --> 05:41:23,740
Next one is called,

4583
05:41:23,740 --> 05:41:25,740
Give Giving a Sex Ed Class, question mark.

4584
05:41:25,740 --> 05:41:27,740
Three, two, one, go.

4585
05:41:39,740 --> 05:41:41,740
I'm not gay. I'm not gay.

4586
05:41:41,740 --> 05:41:43,740
What is this from? I remember it, but I...

4587
05:41:43,740 --> 05:41:45,740
Oh, jeez.

4588
05:41:47,740 --> 05:41:49,740
I know exactly what it's from.

4589
05:41:49,740 --> 05:41:51,740
Oh, is it from the lecture?

4590
05:41:51,740 --> 05:41:53,740
No.

4591
05:41:53,740 --> 05:41:55,740
I'm gonna win.

4592
05:41:55,740 --> 05:41:57,740
What did I say?

4593
05:41:57,740 --> 05:42:00,740
I'm not bad and I'm not gay.

4594
05:42:00,740 --> 05:42:03,740
Everyone laughs at you and then you cracking up,

4595
05:42:03,740 --> 05:42:05,740
I'm gonna win.

4596
05:42:05,740 --> 05:42:07,740
Everyone laughs even louder.

4597
05:42:07,740 --> 05:42:09,740
What's it from? I forgot.

4598
05:42:09,740 --> 05:42:11,740
You want me to tell you?

4599
05:42:11,740 --> 05:42:13,740
Yeah.

4600
05:42:13,740 --> 05:42:15,740
It's Ten Paces and Draw.

4601
05:42:15,740 --> 05:42:17,740
Oh.

4602
05:42:17,740 --> 05:42:19,740
The contestant interviews.

4603
05:42:19,740 --> 05:42:21,740
What makes you think

4604
05:42:21,740 --> 05:42:23,740
you're gonna win this contest?

4605
05:42:23,740 --> 05:42:25,740
I'm not...

4606
05:42:25,740 --> 05:42:27,740
I don't suck and I'm not bad

4607
05:42:27,740 --> 05:42:29,740
and I'm not gay.

4608
05:42:33,740 --> 05:42:35,740
Okay.

4609
05:42:35,740 --> 05:42:37,740
Ten Paces and Draw.

4610
05:42:37,740 --> 05:42:39,740
I worked really hard editing that thing.

4611
05:42:39,740 --> 05:42:41,740
I should, but I find myself so embarrassing.

4612
05:42:41,740 --> 05:42:43,740
Oh, I was talking to the audience more,

4613
05:42:43,740 --> 05:42:45,740
but I mean...

4614
05:42:45,740 --> 05:42:47,740
I worked really hard to edit that thing.

4615
05:42:47,740 --> 05:42:49,740
That thing needed...

4616
05:42:49,740 --> 05:42:51,740
If only there was like

4617
05:42:51,740 --> 05:42:53,740
any B-roll at all.

4618
05:42:53,740 --> 05:42:55,740
It really needed B-roll.

4619
05:42:55,740 --> 05:42:57,740
But I made do with what I had

4620
05:42:57,740 --> 05:42:59,740
and I think it came out pretty...

4621
05:42:59,740 --> 05:43:01,740
I think it came out pretty fun.

4622
05:43:01,740 --> 05:43:03,740
Someone was talking about it in my discord recently.

4623
05:43:03,740 --> 05:43:05,740
That was a pretty good video.

4624
05:43:05,740 --> 05:43:07,740
I worked really hard on that thing

4625
05:43:07,740 --> 05:43:09,740
making it watchable and it kind of

4626
05:43:09,740 --> 05:43:11,740
came out pretty good.

4627
05:43:13,740 --> 05:43:15,740
That line is like really,

4628
05:43:15,740 --> 05:43:17,740
really funny.

4629
05:43:17,740 --> 05:43:19,740
Okay, next one is called...

4630
05:43:19,740 --> 05:43:21,740
I'm glad everyone laughs.

4631
05:43:21,740 --> 05:43:23,740
It's funny because

4632
05:43:23,740 --> 05:43:25,740
when you're saying...

4633
05:43:25,740 --> 05:43:27,740
You can hear people laughing afterwards.

4634
05:43:27,740 --> 05:43:29,740
Because you're saying it

4635
05:43:29,740 --> 05:43:31,740
and you're laughing at yourself

4636
05:43:31,740 --> 05:43:33,740
as you say it.

4637
05:43:33,740 --> 05:43:35,740
And then because you're laughing at yourself,

4638
05:43:35,740 --> 05:43:37,740
everyone else starts laughing at what you're saying

4639
05:43:37,740 --> 05:43:39,740
and then it makes you laugh even more.

4640
05:43:39,740 --> 05:43:41,740
And then you continue,

4641
05:43:41,740 --> 05:43:43,740
but then the fact that you're laughing more

4642
05:43:43,740 --> 05:43:45,740
makes it even funnier

4643
05:43:45,740 --> 05:43:47,740
and then everyone else laughs even more.

4644
05:43:47,740 --> 05:43:49,740
It's really good.

4645
05:43:49,740 --> 05:43:51,740
Next one is called...

4646
05:43:53,740 --> 05:43:55,740
Hi, I'm Ben St.

4647
05:43:55,740 --> 05:43:57,740
I'm going to kill all my friends.

4648
05:43:57,740 --> 05:44:01,740
Also from

4649
05:44:01,740 --> 05:44:03,740
Send Paces and Drop.

4650
05:44:03,740 --> 05:44:05,740
Yes.

4651
05:44:05,740 --> 05:44:07,740
True.

4652
05:44:07,740 --> 05:44:09,740
Next one is called...

4653
05:44:09,740 --> 05:44:11,740
3, 2, 1, go.

4654
05:44:11,740 --> 05:44:13,740
Let's see the music.

4655
05:44:13,740 --> 05:44:15,740
It's pretty fucked up if you ask me.

4656
05:44:15,740 --> 05:44:17,740
I don't like this show.

4657
05:44:17,740 --> 05:44:19,740
The patient is bad.

4658
05:44:19,740 --> 05:44:21,740
The patient is bad.

4659
05:44:21,740 --> 05:44:23,740
And there's just not a...

4660
05:44:23,740 --> 05:44:25,740
The patient is just really bad

4661
05:44:25,740 --> 05:44:27,740
and I don't like it.

4662
05:44:31,740 --> 05:44:33,740
It's funny shit.

4663
05:44:33,740 --> 05:44:35,740
That was funny shit.

4664
05:44:35,740 --> 05:44:37,740
The patient is bad

4665
05:44:37,740 --> 05:44:39,740
and the patient is bad.

4666
05:44:39,740 --> 05:44:41,740
What more do you want?

4667
05:44:41,740 --> 05:44:43,740
Next one is called...

4668
05:44:43,740 --> 05:44:45,740
Doodle Ben at Work.

4669
05:44:45,740 --> 05:44:47,740
I didn't plot the space when I started.

4670
05:44:47,740 --> 05:44:49,740
LOL.

4671
05:44:49,740 --> 05:44:51,740
I'm a green little guy.

4672
05:44:51,740 --> 05:44:53,740
How about that?

4673
05:44:53,740 --> 05:44:55,740
I think that's supposed to be you.

4674
05:44:55,740 --> 05:44:57,740
How about that indeed LOL?

4675
05:44:57,740 --> 05:44:59,740
How about that indeed LOL?

4676
05:44:59,740 --> 05:45:01,740
LOL.

4677
05:45:01,740 --> 05:45:03,740
It's a really long sword.

4678
05:45:03,740 --> 05:45:05,740
It's really long.

4679
05:45:05,740 --> 05:45:07,740
Really short legs.

4680
05:45:07,740 --> 05:45:09,740
Pretty short legs.

4681
05:45:09,740 --> 05:45:11,740
I thought those were knees cut off, but now those are your boots.

4682
05:45:11,740 --> 05:45:13,740
Yeah.

4683
05:45:13,740 --> 05:45:15,740
Oh, I see what you mean.

4684
05:45:15,740 --> 05:45:17,740
Sick.

4685
05:45:17,740 --> 05:45:19,740
Okay, next one is called...

4686
05:45:19,740 --> 05:45:21,740
Cal, 3, 2, 1, go.

4687
05:45:21,740 --> 05:45:23,740
Some general advice.

4688
05:45:23,740 --> 05:45:25,740
I'm looking to move out

4689
05:45:25,740 --> 05:45:27,740
into a shared

4690
05:45:27,740 --> 05:45:29,740
accommodation like you do.

4691
05:45:29,740 --> 05:45:31,740
I just want to know

4692
05:45:31,740 --> 05:45:33,740
is generally a good thing to do.

4693
05:45:33,740 --> 05:45:35,740
I've got this weird fear

4694
05:45:35,740 --> 05:45:37,740
of looking at stuff getting stolen by my

4695
05:45:37,740 --> 05:45:39,740
roommates.

4696
05:45:39,740 --> 05:45:41,740
Yeah, like is it...

4697
05:45:41,740 --> 05:45:43,740
Is it really horrible?

4698
05:45:43,740 --> 05:45:45,740
Or do you recommend it?

4699
05:45:45,740 --> 05:45:47,740
Thanks.

4700
05:45:47,740 --> 05:45:49,740
I haven't really had any major problems

4701
05:45:49,740 --> 05:45:51,740
with people that I've

4702
05:45:51,740 --> 05:45:53,740
moved in with, honestly.

4703
05:45:53,740 --> 05:45:55,740
It's been fine.

4704
05:45:55,740 --> 05:45:57,740
Yeah, I mean, if you think about

4705
05:45:57,740 --> 05:45:59,740
their perspective, why would you

4706
05:45:59,740 --> 05:46:01,740
as a person go and snoop around

4707
05:46:01,740 --> 05:46:03,740
someone else's stuff and risk getting caught?

4708
05:46:03,740 --> 05:46:05,740
Yeah.

4709
05:46:05,740 --> 05:46:07,740
I don't know.

4710
05:46:07,740 --> 05:46:09,740
I feel like most people

4711
05:46:09,740 --> 05:46:11,740
just want to be left alone.

4712
05:46:11,740 --> 05:46:13,740
You're not going to have

4713
05:46:13,740 --> 05:46:15,740
those sorts of interactions

4714
05:46:15,740 --> 05:46:17,740
like that.

4715
05:46:17,740 --> 05:46:19,740
That you don't shit where you eat.

4716
05:46:19,740 --> 05:46:21,740
And if you fuck around with your

4717
05:46:21,740 --> 05:46:23,740
roommate's stuff and you like steal

4718
05:46:23,740 --> 05:46:25,740
their shit or you go through their shit

4719
05:46:25,740 --> 05:46:27,740
or you violate their boundaries in some way,

4720
05:46:27,740 --> 05:46:29,740
you're fucking with someone

4721
05:46:29,740 --> 05:46:31,740
who you now have to live with

4722
05:46:31,740 --> 05:46:33,740
and it's really bad

4723
05:46:33,740 --> 05:46:35,740
and you're going to ruin your own life.

4724
05:46:35,740 --> 05:46:37,740
Most people understand that.

4725
05:46:37,740 --> 05:46:39,740
I have never had any trouble

4726
05:46:39,740 --> 05:46:41,740
with anyone that I've moved in with.

4727
05:46:41,740 --> 05:46:43,740
Some of my other roommates

4728
05:46:43,740 --> 05:46:45,740
had trouble with people

4729
05:46:45,740 --> 05:46:47,740
who moved

4730
05:46:47,740 --> 05:46:49,740
in to their spare room.

4731
05:46:49,740 --> 05:46:51,740
People would move into a spare room

4732
05:46:51,740 --> 05:46:53,740
and then they'd be doing weird shit in there

4733
05:46:53,740 --> 05:46:55,740
or they'd be an asshole

4734
05:46:55,740 --> 05:46:57,740
or they'd make a mess in the kitchen or something.

4735
05:46:57,740 --> 05:46:59,740
Worst you're going to have to deal with

4736
05:46:59,740 --> 05:47:01,740
is people don't clean up after themselves.

4737
05:47:01,740 --> 05:47:03,740
Don't do the dishes.

4738
05:47:03,740 --> 05:47:05,740
And that can be really annoying,

4739
05:47:05,740 --> 05:47:07,740
for sure.

4740
05:47:07,740 --> 05:47:09,740
But that's the worst I've experienced.

4741
05:47:09,740 --> 05:47:11,740
So the worst part,

4742
05:47:11,740 --> 05:47:13,740
there's not really likely

4743
05:47:13,740 --> 05:47:15,740
to have to fight someone

4744
05:47:15,740 --> 05:47:17,740
to get your video games back

4745
05:47:17,740 --> 05:47:19,740
or whatever.

4746
05:47:19,740 --> 05:47:21,740
Yeah, I've never had

4747
05:47:21,740 --> 05:47:23,740
anything like that happen

4748
05:47:23,740 --> 05:47:25,740
with someone who just happens

4749
05:47:25,740 --> 05:47:27,740
to be living in the same house as me.

4750
05:47:27,740 --> 05:47:29,740
So, I mean, yeah.

4751
05:47:29,740 --> 05:47:31,740
Buy a katana, though,

4752
05:47:31,740 --> 05:47:33,740
to protect yourself.

4753
05:47:33,740 --> 05:47:35,740
Oh, I mentioned that

4754
05:47:35,740 --> 05:47:37,740
the break-in.

4755
05:47:37,740 --> 05:47:39,740
Well, okay,

4756
05:47:39,740 --> 05:47:41,740
I don't know if I mentioned this before,

4757
05:47:41,740 --> 05:47:43,740
but a guy who lives here

4758
05:47:43,740 --> 05:47:45,740
found a giant

4759
05:47:45,740 --> 05:47:47,740
combat knife

4760
05:47:47,740 --> 05:47:49,740
in our couch cushions.

4761
05:47:49,740 --> 05:47:51,740
Somebody's giant

4762
05:47:51,740 --> 05:47:53,740
sword knife

4763
05:47:53,740 --> 05:47:55,740
was in our couch cushions.

4764
05:47:55,740 --> 05:47:57,740
I think it probably belongs to another guy

4765
05:47:57,740 --> 05:47:59,740
that lives here but has just been away

4766
05:47:59,740 --> 05:48:01,740
for a while.

4767
05:48:01,740 --> 05:48:03,740
I think he might have just left it in the couch.

4768
05:48:03,740 --> 05:48:05,740
And it's in like a case.

4769
05:48:05,740 --> 05:48:07,740
It has a case that it's clipped into.

4770
05:48:07,740 --> 05:48:09,740
So,

4771
05:48:09,740 --> 05:48:11,740
the junkie or whatever that broke in

4772
05:48:11,740 --> 05:48:13,740
and did whip its on my couch,

4773
05:48:13,740 --> 05:48:15,740
there was a huge sword knife

4774
05:48:15,740 --> 05:48:17,740
on the table in that room

4775
05:48:17,740 --> 05:48:19,740
and it was not moved.

4776
05:48:19,740 --> 05:48:21,740
So, you know what? That's reassuring.

4777
05:48:21,740 --> 05:48:23,740
He could have had a weapon.

4778
05:48:23,740 --> 05:48:25,740
He could have stolen

4779
05:48:25,740 --> 05:48:27,740
the giant sword, but instead

4780
05:48:27,740 --> 05:48:29,740
he stole half of a rice cooker.

4781
05:48:29,740 --> 05:48:31,740
And that tells me that his priorities

4782
05:48:31,740 --> 05:48:33,740
are

4783
05:48:33,740 --> 05:48:35,740
in order and I don't have to be

4784
05:48:35,740 --> 05:48:37,740
afraid of him.

4785
05:48:37,740 --> 05:48:39,740
So, that's nice.

4786
05:48:41,740 --> 05:48:43,740
Next one is

4787
05:48:49,740 --> 05:48:51,740
They'll have like a thing on the

4788
05:48:51,740 --> 05:48:53,740
on the

4789
05:48:53,740 --> 05:48:55,740
like submit your

4790
05:48:55,740 --> 05:48:57,740
PDF and there's a box checking

4791
05:48:57,740 --> 05:48:59,740
like checked, like

4792
05:48:59,740 --> 05:49:01,740
a used slave labor.

4793
05:49:01,740 --> 05:49:03,740
If you click yes, much cheaper.

4794
05:49:03,740 --> 05:49:05,740
You get much better returns.

4795
05:49:05,740 --> 05:49:07,740
I'll check it.

4796
05:49:07,740 --> 05:49:09,740
Less money.

4797
05:49:09,740 --> 05:49:11,740
Less money for you.

4798
05:49:13,740 --> 05:49:15,740
Hey, slaves need jobs too.

4799
05:49:15,740 --> 05:49:17,740
Click.

4800
05:49:17,740 --> 05:49:19,740
It would be wrong to take that slave's job away.

4801
05:49:23,740 --> 05:49:25,740
The blacks are black.

4802
05:49:25,740 --> 05:49:27,740
We're all trying to make it in our little world.

4803
05:49:27,740 --> 05:49:29,740
Well, I guess there's no

4804
05:49:29,740 --> 05:49:31,740
ethical consumption under capitalism anyway.

4805
05:49:31,740 --> 05:49:33,740
It crushes

4806
05:49:33,740 --> 05:49:35,740
the blacks, even though it costs

4807
05:49:35,740 --> 05:49:37,740
more, but that's the price.

4808
05:49:37,740 --> 05:49:39,740
I mean, you like what you like.

4809
05:49:39,740 --> 05:49:41,740
If you if you enjoy that process,

4810
05:49:41,740 --> 05:49:43,740
that's not a problem.

4811
05:49:43,740 --> 05:49:45,740
It's just that's just how it is.

4812
05:49:45,740 --> 05:49:47,740
I mean, I do to a degree.

4813
05:49:47,740 --> 05:49:49,740
I do to a degree.

4814
05:49:49,740 --> 05:49:51,740
I mean, you know, I don't know.

4815
05:49:51,740 --> 05:49:53,740
I feel like I don't know.

4816
05:49:53,740 --> 05:49:55,740
I feel like they don't want to think about that.

4817
05:49:55,740 --> 05:49:57,740
I would say you're just not on that

4818
05:49:57,740 --> 05:49:59,740
Sigma grain set.

4819
05:49:59,740 --> 05:50:01,740
You're not gristling in the grind.

4820
05:50:01,740 --> 05:50:03,740
I'm not on that Sigma grain set.

4821
05:50:03,740 --> 05:50:05,740
I'm off the grind set.

4822
05:50:05,740 --> 05:50:07,740
That went on too long.

4823
05:50:07,740 --> 05:50:09,740
Oh, a little too long.

4824
05:50:09,740 --> 05:50:11,740
I thought they were going to have another funny edit

4825
05:50:11,740 --> 05:50:13,740
at the end.

4826
05:50:13,740 --> 05:50:15,740
After the crush is the blacks part,

4827
05:50:15,740 --> 05:50:17,740
what more did it need?

4828
05:50:17,740 --> 05:50:19,740
You needed it.

4829
05:50:19,740 --> 05:50:21,740
If you were going to continue on,

4830
05:50:21,740 --> 05:50:23,740
you should have added an even more

4831
05:50:23,740 --> 05:50:25,740
out of context bad sounding thing.

4832
05:50:25,740 --> 05:50:27,740
For me to say, yes, that's correct.

4833
05:50:27,740 --> 05:50:29,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

4834
05:50:29,740 --> 05:50:31,740
I get it.

4835
05:50:31,740 --> 05:50:33,740
It's funny. I was talking about slavery

4836
05:50:33,740 --> 05:50:35,740
and then I was talking about blacks.

4837
05:50:35,740 --> 05:50:37,740
Little did they know I was talking about blacks

4838
05:50:37,740 --> 05:50:39,740
in the context of printing.

4839
05:50:39,740 --> 05:50:41,740
Out of context, it sure does sound

4840
05:50:41,740 --> 05:50:43,740
like I'm talking about race.

4841
05:50:43,740 --> 05:50:45,740
Oh, great.

4842
05:50:45,740 --> 05:50:47,740
Because we've been going for six hours.

4843
05:50:47,740 --> 05:50:49,740
Oh, boy. Well, let's get him back.

4844
05:50:49,740 --> 05:50:51,740
I wish we weren't going for six hours.

4845
05:50:53,740 --> 05:50:55,740
We need to start cutting these shorter.

4846
05:50:55,740 --> 05:50:57,740
Yeah, this went on too long.

4847
05:50:57,740 --> 05:50:59,740
Cheesy was talking too much.

4848
05:50:59,740 --> 05:51:01,740
We let Cheesy run away with the conversation.

4849
05:51:01,740 --> 05:51:03,740
I hate that guy.

4850
05:51:03,740 --> 05:51:05,740
I don't know how to say, all right, shut up.

4851
05:51:05,740 --> 05:51:07,740
Yeah.

4852
05:51:07,740 --> 05:51:09,740
I don't know how to do that.

4853
05:51:09,740 --> 05:51:11,740
We need to reign Cheesy

4854
05:51:11,740 --> 05:51:13,740
and we need to wrangle him a little better.

4855
05:51:13,740 --> 05:51:15,740
Lesson learned.

4856
05:51:15,740 --> 05:51:17,740
Next time,

4857
05:51:17,740 --> 05:51:19,740
or no, next one is called

4858
05:51:19,740 --> 05:51:21,740
like 18 exclamation points.

4859
05:51:21,740 --> 05:51:23,740
Three, two, one, go.

4860
05:51:23,740 --> 05:51:25,740
It's too loud.

4861
05:51:25,740 --> 05:51:27,740
Is the two piece signature chicken

4862
05:51:27,740 --> 05:51:29,740
with the regular side and the biscuit

4863
05:51:29,740 --> 05:51:31,740
or the three piece tenders

4864
05:51:31,740 --> 05:51:33,740
regular side and the biscuit

4865
05:51:33,740 --> 05:51:35,740
better at Popeyes?

4866
05:51:35,740 --> 05:51:37,740
I don't need Popeyes.

4867
05:51:37,740 --> 05:51:39,740
I've got this.

4868
05:51:39,740 --> 05:51:41,740
There's sort of no Popeyes in the UK.

4869
05:51:41,740 --> 05:51:43,740
It's more of like a southern

4870
05:51:43,740 --> 05:51:45,740
restaurant, I think.

4871
05:51:45,740 --> 05:51:47,740
There might be one around here.

4872
05:51:47,740 --> 05:51:49,740
The only difference is one is two piece

4873
05:51:49,740 --> 05:51:51,740
signature chicken.

4874
05:51:51,740 --> 05:51:53,740
Two pieces tenders.

4875
05:51:53,740 --> 05:51:55,740
And I'm like proof eyes.

4876
05:51:55,740 --> 05:51:57,740
So I really really going to need

4877
05:51:57,740 --> 05:51:59,740
you to go to Popeyes right now.

4878
05:51:59,740 --> 05:52:01,740
I don't even know.

4879
05:52:01,740 --> 05:52:03,740
Both of those and tell me which one is

4880
05:52:03,740 --> 05:52:05,740
more food or better.

4881
05:52:05,740 --> 05:52:07,740
Listen, man, I can't help you.

4882
05:52:07,740 --> 05:52:09,740
Let me just run your own.

4883
05:52:09,740 --> 05:52:11,740
Let me just look real quick if there's any Popeyes.

4884
05:52:13,740 --> 05:52:15,740
Oh, there is. There actually is one.

4885
05:52:15,740 --> 05:52:17,740
There's actually two

4886
05:52:17,740 --> 05:52:19,740
in Boston.

4887
05:52:19,740 --> 05:52:21,740
Boston's big city.

4888
05:52:21,740 --> 05:52:23,740
Well, there's actually three.

4889
05:52:23,740 --> 05:52:25,740
Well, that one's kind of up north

4890
05:52:25,740 --> 05:52:27,740
north of the river in Everett.

4891
05:52:27,740 --> 05:52:29,740
So that's like not really.

4892
05:52:29,740 --> 05:52:31,740
Okay, there's actually three.

4893
05:52:31,740 --> 05:52:33,740
Okay, but I mean,

4894
05:52:33,740 --> 05:52:35,740
there's a lot of restaurants around here.

4895
05:52:35,740 --> 05:52:37,740
I've never been to one.

4896
05:52:37,740 --> 05:52:39,740
I went to one Popeyes one time

4897
05:52:39,740 --> 05:52:41,740
in like Virginia and I thought it was good.

4898
05:52:41,740 --> 05:52:43,740
But I couldn't tell you shit

4899
05:52:43,740 --> 05:52:45,740
about what's on the menu.

4900
05:52:45,740 --> 05:52:47,740
Give and take cancellation hour

4901
05:52:47,740 --> 05:52:49,740
I'm the evil shadow

4902
05:52:49,740 --> 05:52:51,740
dragon Medeus

4903
05:52:51,740 --> 05:52:53,740
here to cancel

4904
05:52:53,740 --> 05:52:55,740
give and take.

4905
05:52:55,740 --> 05:52:57,740
Fuck. Once give and take

4906
05:52:57,740 --> 05:52:59,740
said

4907
05:52:59,740 --> 05:53:01,740
the more

4908
05:53:01,740 --> 05:53:03,740
people that are dead

4909
05:53:03,740 --> 05:53:05,740
the better

4910
05:53:05,740 --> 05:53:07,740
and once

4911
05:53:07,740 --> 05:53:09,740
give and take said

4912
05:53:09,740 --> 05:53:11,740
I don't want to kill

4913
05:53:11,740 --> 05:53:13,740
I just want to kill

4914
05:53:13,740 --> 05:53:15,740
I just want to kill

4915
05:53:15,740 --> 05:53:17,740
I know

4916
05:53:17,740 --> 05:53:19,740
I think that what this tells us is that

4917
05:53:19,740 --> 05:53:21,740
give and take is a lot less

4918
05:53:21,740 --> 05:53:23,740
cancelable things than Ben Saint

4919
05:53:23,740 --> 05:53:25,740
but

4920
05:53:25,740 --> 05:53:27,740
she went to bed late

4921
05:53:27,740 --> 05:53:29,740
last night because she played a lot

4922
05:53:29,740 --> 05:53:31,740
of fire emblem so

4923
05:53:31,740 --> 05:53:33,740
maybe that's something

4924
05:53:33,740 --> 05:53:35,740
cancel her

4925
05:53:35,740 --> 05:53:37,740
yes cancel her

4926
05:53:37,740 --> 05:53:39,740
Did I did I mention that on

4927
05:53:39,740 --> 05:53:41,740
Friday I streamed for 10 hours

4928
05:53:41,740 --> 05:53:43,740
my stream went on for 10 hours and it was

4929
05:53:43,740 --> 05:53:45,740
horrible.

4930
05:53:45,740 --> 05:53:47,740
Somebody mentioned that in my chat

4931
05:53:47,740 --> 05:53:49,740
that you streamed for 10 hours

4932
05:53:49,740 --> 05:53:51,740
I hated it and upon hearing that

4933
05:53:51,740 --> 05:53:53,740
I realized that I didn't want to suffer the same

4934
05:53:53,740 --> 05:53:55,740
fate so I only had like a 4 hour stream

4935
05:53:55,740 --> 05:53:57,740
No I don't recommend it at all and you know what's really

4936
05:53:57,740 --> 05:53:59,740
there was a part

4937
05:53:59,740 --> 05:54:01,740
where I accidentally fucked up making a save state

4938
05:54:01,740 --> 05:54:03,740
and I like destroyed

4939
05:54:03,740 --> 05:54:05,740
I heard that yes I lost my save state

4940
05:54:05,740 --> 05:54:07,740
I saved at the wrong time I saved at

4941
05:54:07,740 --> 05:54:09,740
a game over and I had to restart

4942
05:54:09,740 --> 05:54:11,740
the in game save and I had not made

4943
05:54:11,740 --> 05:54:13,740
the in game save in a long time I literally

4944
05:54:13,740 --> 05:54:15,740
lost like 2 hours of progress it was

4945
05:54:15,740 --> 05:54:17,740
I was so angry

4946
05:54:17,740 --> 05:54:19,740
and the game okay the other thing

4947
05:54:19,740 --> 05:54:21,740
about it is that the game

4948
05:54:21,740 --> 05:54:23,740
I mostly

4949
05:54:23,740 --> 05:54:25,740
have liked battle network 2 more than 1

4950
05:54:25,740 --> 05:54:27,740
but I'm at a point in the

4951
05:54:27,740 --> 05:54:29,740
game where it's near the end and it sucks

4952
05:54:29,740 --> 05:54:31,740
dog shit it's literally it's worse than

4953
05:54:31,740 --> 05:54:33,740
the first one actually because

4954
05:54:33,740 --> 05:54:35,740
I've gotten to a point where

4955
05:54:35,740 --> 05:54:37,740
there's no more new maps

4956
05:54:37,740 --> 05:54:39,740
they just you log in and it's near

4957
05:54:39,740 --> 05:54:41,740
the end and they just are like oh shit

4958
05:54:41,740 --> 05:54:43,740
there's ice all over the net now there's a bunch

4959
05:54:43,740 --> 05:54:45,740
of different colors of ice and

4960
05:54:45,740 --> 05:54:47,740
to break the ice you have to get these colored

4961
05:54:47,740 --> 05:54:49,740
things and it's

4962
05:54:49,740 --> 05:54:51,740
they literally just make you run

4963
05:54:51,740 --> 05:54:53,740
through one dungeon to the end to get the thing

4964
05:54:53,740 --> 05:54:55,740
and then you come out and you go through one other

4965
05:54:55,740 --> 05:54:57,740
dungeon to unlock the thing and then you got to

4966
05:54:57,740 --> 05:54:59,740
back through the first dungeon to get another thing

4967
05:54:59,740 --> 05:55:01,740
and then you go through the second dungeon

4968
05:55:01,740 --> 05:55:03,740
and then you just send

4969
05:55:03,740 --> 05:55:05,740
you back and forth like go find this guy he's over

4970
05:55:05,740 --> 05:55:07,740
there in this place you've already been oh

4971
05:55:07,740 --> 05:55:09,740
go tell the guy that sent you to find me

4972
05:55:09,740 --> 05:55:11,740
that I'm fine

4973
05:55:11,740 --> 05:55:13,740
and then you get there and there's like oh cool well now that I know

4974
05:55:13,740 --> 05:55:15,740
that he's fine here's an item go bring it to him

4975
05:55:15,740 --> 05:55:17,740
and

4976
05:55:17,740 --> 05:55:19,740
I streamed for 10 hours and I literally

4977
05:55:19,740 --> 05:55:21,740
like I barely unlocked

4978
05:55:21,740 --> 05:55:23,740
any new territory it was all just back

4979
05:55:23,740 --> 05:55:25,740
and forth to places I'd already been before

4980
05:55:25,740 --> 05:55:27,740
it's so bad and then

4981
05:55:27,740 --> 05:55:29,740
on top of that this fucking save state

4982
05:55:29,740 --> 05:55:31,740
which is my that part's my fault

4983
05:55:31,740 --> 05:55:33,740
but um the save state thing happened

4984
05:55:33,740 --> 05:55:35,740
and I lost sounds

4985
05:55:35,740 --> 05:55:37,740
like a terrible it was not I had a fun stream

4986
05:55:37,740 --> 05:55:39,740
but maybe someone enjoyed me getting

4987
05:55:39,740 --> 05:55:41,740
angry about it

4988
05:55:41,740 --> 05:55:43,740
silver lining

4989
05:55:43,740 --> 05:55:45,740
yeah my fire emblem stream

4990
05:55:45,740 --> 05:55:47,740
the map

4991
05:55:47,740 --> 05:55:49,740
was very difficult and I had to restart

4992
05:55:49,740 --> 05:55:51,740
like a bunch of times and

4993
05:55:51,740 --> 05:55:53,740
after the four hours was over I had only

4994
05:55:53,740 --> 05:55:55,740
completed one map

4995
05:55:55,740 --> 05:55:57,740
hmm so I wasn't

4996
05:55:57,740 --> 05:55:59,740
prepared to do another one but that was

4997
05:55:59,740 --> 05:56:01,740
that was still enjoyable in itself

4998
05:56:01,740 --> 05:56:03,740
because sometimes fire emblem is just

4999
05:56:03,740 --> 05:56:05,740
really tough and like the strategy

5000
05:56:05,740 --> 05:56:07,740
has to evolve with your

5001
05:56:07,740 --> 05:56:09,740
many losses and you're like okay

5002
05:56:09,740 --> 05:56:11,740
so I know that they're gonna do this and their

5003
05:56:11,740 --> 05:56:13,740
reinforcement is gonna appear here so I need

5004
05:56:13,740 --> 05:56:15,740
to do this and that and I need to be lucky

5005
05:56:15,740 --> 05:56:17,740
that was the only really

5006
05:56:17,740 --> 05:56:19,740
annoying thing was that sometimes the enemies

5007
05:56:19,740 --> 05:56:21,740
would crit me and kill me in one hit and I just had

5008
05:56:21,740 --> 05:56:23,740
to be lucky before I could get

5009
05:56:23,740 --> 05:56:25,740
into a good position where I could like

5010
05:56:25,740 --> 05:56:27,740
control the situation that control the pace

5011
05:56:27,740 --> 05:56:29,740
of the fight that's kind of what I don't

5012
05:56:29,740 --> 05:56:31,740
really like about I used to really

5013
05:56:31,740 --> 05:56:33,740
like tactical like grid based

5014
05:56:33,740 --> 05:56:35,740
RPGs like that and I think one of the reasons

5015
05:56:35,740 --> 05:56:37,740
that I don't play them anymore I mean first of

5016
05:56:37,740 --> 05:56:39,740
all I just kind of stop playing

5017
05:56:39,740 --> 05:56:41,740
a lot of games in general but I don't really feel

5018
05:56:41,740 --> 05:56:43,740
like getting back into them because they're just really slow

5019
05:56:43,740 --> 05:56:45,740
and they just take really long about

5020
05:56:45,740 --> 05:56:47,740
one battle in one of those games is like a really

5021
05:56:47,740 --> 05:56:49,740
long engagement but I guess

5022
05:56:49,740 --> 05:56:51,740
that's fine it's tactical

5023
05:56:51,740 --> 05:56:53,740
and you're making decisions the whole time

5024
05:56:53,740 --> 05:56:55,740
I think it's better than running

5025
05:56:55,740 --> 05:56:57,740
back and forth and redoing content

5026
05:56:57,740 --> 05:56:59,740
in a pointless wild goose

5027
05:56:59,740 --> 05:57:01,740
to change sort of situation like what you're going through

5028
05:57:01,740 --> 05:57:03,740
I mean what I'm going through is complete

5029
05:57:03,740 --> 05:57:05,740
horseshit so yeah maybe

5030
05:57:05,740 --> 05:57:07,740
yeah probably

5031
05:57:07,740 --> 05:57:09,740
I do not want to sound like I'm defending

5032
05:57:09,740 --> 05:57:11,740
what battle network 2

5033
05:57:11,740 --> 05:57:13,740
is making me do

5034
05:57:13,740 --> 05:57:15,740
the worst

5035
05:57:15,740 --> 05:57:17,740
the worst possible thing to pad out the

5036
05:57:17,740 --> 05:57:19,740
the length so if you

5037
05:57:19,740 --> 05:57:21,740
ever heard like oh this game takes this many

5038
05:57:21,740 --> 05:57:23,740
hours and this other game takes that many

5039
05:57:23,740 --> 05:57:25,740
hours now you know

5040
05:57:25,740 --> 05:57:27,740
how much padding the second game has

5041
05:57:27,740 --> 05:57:29,740
there's a part where

5042
05:57:29,740 --> 05:57:31,740
you break some

5043
05:57:31,740 --> 05:57:33,740
ice and then

5044
05:57:33,740 --> 05:57:35,740
you find

5045
05:57:35,740 --> 05:57:37,740
I don't even remember

5046
05:57:37,740 --> 05:57:39,740
you finally get the ice to break a thing open

5047
05:57:39,740 --> 05:57:41,740
and you reach this NPC you couldn't reach before

5048
05:57:41,740 --> 05:57:43,740
just on a map that you've been to before

5049
05:57:43,740 --> 05:57:45,740
you have to go back to this map and go all the way

5050
05:57:45,740 --> 05:57:47,740
through it and find this NPC and the NPC

5051
05:57:47,740 --> 05:57:49,740
is like

5052
05:57:49,740 --> 05:57:51,740
yeah to break that other color ice

5053
05:57:51,740 --> 05:57:53,740
you need a heat

5054
05:57:53,740 --> 05:57:55,740
program look for a heat

5055
05:57:55,740 --> 05:57:57,740
program and

5056
05:57:57,740 --> 05:57:59,740
the only

5057
05:57:59,740 --> 05:58:01,740
okay what you what it turns out you have to

5058
05:58:01,740 --> 05:58:03,740
do the heat

5059
05:58:03,740 --> 05:58:05,740
program

5060
05:58:05,740 --> 05:58:07,740
belongs to this

5061
05:58:07,740 --> 05:58:09,740
you have to go

5062
05:58:09,740 --> 05:58:11,740
you just have to think of this on your own there's no hints about it

5063
05:58:11,740 --> 05:58:13,740
it's a grill

5064
05:58:13,740 --> 05:58:15,740
like an electric grill

5065
05:58:15,740 --> 05:58:17,740
at a campground

5066
05:58:17,740 --> 05:58:19,740
contains the heat program you have to go there

5067
05:58:19,740 --> 05:58:21,740
talk to a program that you just have to

5068
05:58:21,740 --> 05:58:23,740
figure this out you have to go inside

5069
05:58:23,740 --> 05:58:25,740
back into the grill talk to the program inside

5070
05:58:25,740 --> 05:58:27,740
the grill he'll tell you where

5071
05:58:27,740 --> 05:58:29,740
his boss went

5072
05:58:29,740 --> 05:58:31,740
that has the heat program so you go and you

5073
05:58:31,740 --> 05:58:33,740
you gotta go through another map that you've been to before

5074
05:58:33,740 --> 05:58:35,740
find the boss there

5075
05:58:35,740 --> 05:58:37,740
and then come back to the grill

5076
05:58:37,740 --> 05:58:39,740
and talk to him and he's like oh thanks

5077
05:58:39,740 --> 05:58:41,740
you found my boss well here here's the program you're looking for

5078
05:58:41,740 --> 05:58:43,740
it you just

5079
05:58:43,740 --> 05:58:45,740
you just have to think oh there was a grill

5080
05:58:45,740 --> 05:58:47,740
at the campground

5081
05:58:47,740 --> 05:58:49,740
I wonder if that's where the heat program and

5082
05:58:49,740 --> 05:58:51,740
I mean I'm sorry a grill is just such an innocuous

5083
05:58:51,740 --> 05:58:53,740
thing I wouldn't think like

5084
05:58:55,740 --> 05:58:57,740
when I heard that hint I had absolutely no clue

5085
05:58:57,740 --> 05:58:59,740
at all I had no inkling

5086
05:58:59,740 --> 05:59:01,740
at all like oh

5087
05:59:01,740 --> 05:59:03,740
where would something hot be like yeah I guess

5088
05:59:03,740 --> 05:59:05,740
when I say it out loud it sounds obvious

5089
05:59:05,740 --> 05:59:07,740
but like almost no attention at all

5090
05:59:07,740 --> 05:59:09,740
was drawn to the presence of this grill it's just

5091
05:59:09,740 --> 05:59:11,740
a thing that would be at a campground

5092
05:59:13,740 --> 05:59:15,740
yeah it's

5093
05:59:15,740 --> 05:59:17,740
I mean I haven't played the games I don't know

5094
05:59:17,740 --> 05:59:19,740
how

5095
05:59:19,740 --> 05:59:21,740
familiar you would have become with the campground

5096
05:59:21,740 --> 05:59:23,740
was there anything

5097
05:59:23,740 --> 05:59:25,740
leading you in that

5098
05:59:25,740 --> 05:59:27,740
or did you just have to remember it on your own

5099
05:59:27,740 --> 05:59:29,740
I had been to the campground before

5100
05:59:29,740 --> 05:59:31,740
and there is a cut there is a little bit

5101
05:59:31,740 --> 05:59:33,740
when you get there like your friends

5102
05:59:33,740 --> 05:59:35,740
like you have to gather up some ingredients

5103
05:59:35,740 --> 05:59:37,740
to cook some food on the grill

5104
05:59:37,740 --> 05:59:39,740
but I mean

5105
05:59:39,740 --> 05:59:41,740
I don't know maybe somebody else might have figured out

5106
05:59:41,740 --> 05:59:43,740
for me it was like

5107
05:59:43,740 --> 05:59:45,740
it doesn't seem remarkable at all

5108
05:59:45,740 --> 05:59:47,740
that there's a grill at a campground

5109
05:59:47,740 --> 05:59:49,740
that screamed to me like

5110
05:59:49,740 --> 05:59:51,740
oh this is a thing

5111
05:59:51,740 --> 05:59:53,740
where I would obtain fire

5112
05:59:53,740 --> 05:59:55,740
if I needed some in the future

5113
05:59:55,740 --> 05:59:57,740
I don't know

5114
05:59:57,740 --> 05:59:59,740
I didn't put it together

5115
05:59:59,740 --> 06:00:01,740
maybe somebody would have

5116
06:00:01,740 --> 06:00:03,740
but it seems like really obtuse and like

5117
06:00:03,740 --> 06:00:05,740
I didn't like it

5118
06:00:05,740 --> 06:00:07,740
I didn't like it they could have hinted at me

5119
06:00:07,740 --> 06:00:09,740
a little bit better than just being like

5120
06:00:09,740 --> 06:00:11,740
a heat program

5121
06:00:11,740 --> 06:00:13,740
okay good luck

5122
06:00:13,740 --> 06:00:15,740
next one

5123
06:00:15,740 --> 06:00:17,740
is called the munchie minute

5124
06:00:17,740 --> 06:00:19,740
3, 2, 1, go

5125
06:00:19,740 --> 06:00:21,740
okay so at first I thought it was just a joke

5126
06:00:21,740 --> 06:00:23,740
but now with it being mentioned

5127
06:00:23,740 --> 06:00:25,740
on Ben's stream as well as

5128
06:00:25,740 --> 06:00:27,740
on Ben's tweets

5129
06:00:27,740 --> 06:00:29,740
chat GPT just keeps mentioning it

5130
06:00:29,740 --> 06:00:31,740
so

5131
06:00:31,740 --> 06:00:33,740
is the munchie minute real

5132
06:00:33,740 --> 06:00:35,740
is that something that existed

5133
06:00:35,740 --> 06:00:37,740
I mean I know it wasn't

5134
06:00:37,740 --> 06:00:39,740
about Ben Shapiro owning

5135
06:00:39,740 --> 06:00:41,740
a liberal snowman

5136
06:00:41,740 --> 06:00:43,740
but

5137
06:00:43,740 --> 06:00:45,740
was there a munchie minute

5138
06:00:45,740 --> 06:00:47,740
is that a thing that existed on the PCP

5139
06:00:47,740 --> 06:00:49,740
no

5140
06:00:49,740 --> 06:00:51,740
I know it's funny

5141
06:00:51,740 --> 06:00:53,740
okay I google munchie minute

5142
06:00:53,740 --> 06:00:55,740

06:00:55,740 --> 06:00:57,740

5157
06:01:25,740 --> 06:01:27,740
my top 4 nursing

5158
06:01:27,740 --> 06:01:29,740
shirt tips I don't know what specifically

5159
06:01:29,740 --> 06:01:31,740
you would need tips about that

5160
06:01:31,740 --> 06:01:33,740
on but maybe

5161
06:01:33,740 --> 06:01:35,740
everything's gonna be a top 5

5162
06:01:35,740 --> 06:01:37,740
sure I mean

5163
06:01:37,740 --> 06:01:39,740
I don't take issue with the top 5 format

5164
06:01:39,740 --> 06:01:41,740
but what do you need tips on

5165
06:01:41,740 --> 06:01:43,740
nursing

5166
06:01:43,740 --> 06:01:45,740
first of all I didn't know there were special shirts for it

5167
06:01:45,740 --> 06:01:47,740
and I don't know what tips you would need other than

5168
06:01:47,740 --> 06:01:49,740
get one

5169
06:01:49,740 --> 06:01:51,740
but you know what I'm not gonna watch the video

5170
06:01:51,740 --> 06:01:53,740
so I have no

5171
06:01:53,740 --> 06:01:55,740
room to criticize next one is called

5172
06:01:55,740 --> 06:01:57,740
but my heckin copywriter

5173
06:01:57,740 --> 06:01:59,740
you know so

5174
06:02:01,740 --> 06:02:03,740
sorry that got me

5175
06:02:03,740 --> 06:02:05,740
3 2 1 go

5176
06:02:05,740 --> 06:02:07,740
the best part

5177
06:02:07,740 --> 06:02:09,740
what was that last bit

5178
06:02:29,740 --> 06:02:31,740
what was that last bit

5179
06:02:31,740 --> 06:02:33,740
I couldn't understand a single word

5180
06:02:33,740 --> 06:02:35,740
maybe it's cause my headphones

5181
06:02:35,740 --> 06:02:37,740
it's very close to my ears

5182
06:02:37,740 --> 06:02:39,740
his point was

5183
06:02:39,740 --> 06:02:41,740
the important part of making blue rays

5184
06:02:41,740 --> 06:02:43,740
is reminding people

5185
06:02:43,740 --> 06:02:45,740
that Trixie can't make blue rays

5186
06:02:45,740 --> 06:02:47,740
and digi heads don't get to have anything good in life

5187
06:02:47,740 --> 06:02:49,740
and I agree

5188
06:02:49,740 --> 06:02:51,740

06:06:51,740 --> 06:06:53,740
it's not just cheesy

5305
06:06:53,740 --> 06:06:55,740

5306
06:06:55,740 --> 06:06:57,740
you know it's easy

5307
06:06:57,740 --> 06:06:59,740
