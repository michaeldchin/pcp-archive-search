1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Listen, listen, I'm not out there every day, you know, put on my heart,

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,180
hard hat, I'm not out there, you know, getting a jack hammer to the roadside to install

3
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,100
some more plumbing. I'm just out there rubbing lotion on old people, rubbing lotion on dead

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,300
people, just trying to get them all lubed up for the afterlife, you know what I'm trying

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:52,020
to say? God, you know, you know when you're a kid and you don't know better and you don't

6
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
know what's rude, and you have a grandma, and you just want to touch her flabby little

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,800
elbows and her arms and her forearm, you just want to fucking get your all grubby hands

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,320
all up in there with some lotion. Well, you know, she's got flabby skin, you know, she's

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:20,840
got skin hanging off her and you just want to go rub all around. Why? Why? Alright, alright,

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,920
guys, here's the intro. Guys, I've been working on an intro, I've been waiting for the day

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,260
when Nate would finally leave us alone for once, and I've got the intro. Here, let me

12
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,900
know what you think. I hope you're recording all this. Oh, oh, oh, I am. Slippity slap,

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,340
put on a hat. Slippity slap, put on a hat. It's time for an episode of the PCP, guys.

14
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:50,420
Wow. I'm so upset, I'm such a virgin, no one will have sex with me, you know, I'm going

15
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,480
to die alone, I'm so upset about it, and I think I might just have to resort to some

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,080
sort of outward acts of violence. What do you guys think? Do you guys think that I should

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,240
do something brash and reckless due to the fact that I have so much inward self-loving

18
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
based on my fact that I'm a virgin? Talking about weapons of mass destruction? No, I'm

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,520
talking about like AK-47s, I'm talking about like tech nines. I think we didn't sync our

20
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,060
audios yet. We didn't, we can do another show. Yeah, like we said, like we were just talking,

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,860
we're bringing the A content today, like syncing the audio on the show. Alright, on the count

22
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,620
of three, let's say good podcast. One, two, three, good podcast. Okay, let's just say

23
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,980
good next time. One, two, three, good. I want you to know that I made air quotes around

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,260
a good podcast. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, listen. Hello everybody and welcome to the

25
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,960
Procrastinator's podcast, none of that is in the podcast, this is the podcast now. I

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,380
hope not. No, why? Because look, how does it look? Okay, we all know that we're having

27
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,800
a good time, we're having a great time and we want to bring it to the people, but you

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,840
know, you know that Nate comes, but Nate listens to the episode, and what's his takeaway? Oh

29
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,820
yeah, right. These guys can't run a podcast without me. Oh, without me, it just descends

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,820
into chaos, unprofessionalism, and we can't, we can't have him tighten his iron grip any

31
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:26,360
further, will strangle us. The hallmark, the poster child of sheer madness and chaos is

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,160
us doing a cold open laughing. That's what you can easily use no hand wave away, that's

33
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,620
pure unorganization. He'll hear that and he'll take off his headset and he'll put it down

34
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,740
and he'll look out the window sadly and he'll shake his head and he'll say things have really

35
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:51,240
gone downhill around here. The ideal PCP intro for Nate is all this like solemn in change

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,660
wearing, you know, prison jumpsuits, looking down on your keyboard, not even looking up

37
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,780
at the audacity recording, and him just blathering away for 35 minutes while we just whimper out

38
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,800
affirmative yeses and mm-hmms. I think we should start with a liturgy. I think we should

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,240
start with prayers. Oh yes, yeah. Well, let's start with like saying who's on the podcast,

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,640
and then we can start by starting about the, we can start, I'm, hello, it's me, Hippocrite.

41
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,560
Oh, they know us. I'm ready, yeah. There's Mage, there's Tom, there's Ben, there's Munchy,

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,040
and there's also a secret guest. No, don't tell them about me. You know what's going

43
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,900
on? Is every time Nate's away, we destroy the podcast and make a fool of our own self.

44
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,100
I don't want to make a fool of myself. I want to, whoa.

45
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,980
Look, let's dismantle more PCP's. We want to make Nate feel like shit, and the only

46
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,940
way to make him feel like shit is to make him feel smugly superior. It's going to feel

47
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,820
smugly superior. He's going to be secondhand embarrassed for associating with such degenerates.

48
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,340
Guys, guys, you're talking about him? He already won.

49
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,340
No.

50
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
Oh gosh.

51
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
That's true.

52
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,160
Welcome to the Procrastinate's Podcast, everybody. This is the new Procrastinate's Podcast.

53
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,920
Merry Christmas. This is the beginning of the episode, and nothing has been in the previous.

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,680
We sure have been talking for two hours prior to this recording.

55
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,760
We haven't been talking at all about no one in particular. It's me, Hippocrite. Today,

56
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
we have with us, Mage.

57
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,580
I am alive.

58
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
We have Tom Oliver.

59
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,580
And we have Hippo.

60
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,220
We did it. We did it, guys. We did it. We did it without he who shone off me name.

61
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,300
Hey, it's me, Munchy, doing also the Procrastinate's Podcast intro while Hippo's doing it. Next,

62
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
we have Hippo.

63
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Next, we have Ben St. Hi.

64
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Hi, I'm Hippo.

65
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
Next, we have Ben St.

66
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Even when he's not here.

67
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
Next, we have Mage.

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,900
We're wrapped up. He's our abusive boyfriend. He leaves his mark on us.

69
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:57,020
Dude, I have the ultimate in shitty podcast audio quality right in front of me. I ordered

70
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,740
food, and it came just before we started to record, and I'm hungry, so I'm going to take

71
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,660
a big old bite of this chicken burger.

72
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Oh.

73
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
All right, get ready.

74
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Chicken burger.

75
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm going to eat through the entirety of the podcast to make it really bad.

76
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
We already did that. That was a bonus episode.

77
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,020
Remember everyone's favorite bonus episode, talking while eating?

78
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,140
Can you believe this terrible thing that Hippo did? Wouldn't it be so funny if I would

79
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,180
do this thing in the entire podcast? We already have done that and charged for it.

80
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,420
This is a teaser trailer. Go to the bonus PCP to see that for real.

81
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,100
Wait, Hippo, you got to say the line. We remember we used to advertise the bonus episodes,

82
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,980
and you would be the one to make the trailer for it.

83
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
You know, talking with your mouth full every single time.

84
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,460
Hey, you know what I want to talk about? I want to talk about how this is not well-munchy.

85
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,180
It's so cool that you fucking hate the PCP, even though it's not even true, but it's easy

86
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,940
for people to take that away, even though that's not what I mean ever.

87
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,140
We all hate the PCP, man, but not real.

88
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,140
It's cool.

89
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:08,860
I want to talk about how the PCP's views are stagnant and how I want everyone to not have

90
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,460
that happen anymore. So let's discuss how it's the fans fault for that.

91
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:21,900
Okay. If we do that, we'll drive away, we'll drive away, if our views are stagnant, it

92
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,460
just means that we've got our dedicated fan base.

93
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,460
Right, we have our cult.

94
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,980
Yeah, we're not gaining new ones, but we've got the old ones that are on lock. We've given

95
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,500
them Stockholm Syndrome, and now they can't escape. We've got the sunk cost fallacy, and

96
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,940
now they've invested too much time listening to us, and now it would be a waste to stop.

97
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,660
You know, I'm not trying to gain YouTube here, I'm not trying to get the PCP to launch

98
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,820
into PewDiePie, Tobuscus level. I just like seeing numbers go up, that's my one and only

99
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,820
goal here.

100
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,940
Literally, why are you talking like you're up at four in the morning looking at pornography

101
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:09,820
on your 1998 AOL internet connection, and you don't want your parents to wake up?

102
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,500
Listen, some people, they jack it to Fuda, some people jack it to Femdom, I jack it to

103
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
the Procrastinaires podcast.

104
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, every time?

105
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Every single time, yeah.

106
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:29,020
Alright, unironically, the PCP to me feels like the niche content that is like lesser

107
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,980
than all of the small other projects that we do. Like the PCP is the offshoot from the

108
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,700
podcast, I Am Games, and like everything. Like it feels like this is the least viewed

109
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,860
out of all of the smaller projects that we do.

110
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,180
I don't even think it's true though.

111
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,180
It's not the least viewed, but I know what you mean. Like, Tom, I think when we were

112
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,700
talking about this, you brought this up, and I wholeheartedly agree that the PCP is not

113
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,140
really an enterprise in and of itself. It's sort of a well or a cistern, or like a sewer,

114
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:14,260
if you will, like a sewage drainage pipe where like our other projects will garner attention,

115
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,660
and then people that are interested in that will follow us down the drain and end up here.

116
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,340
Yeah, this is like the end of the funnel. Except the end of the funnel is usually how

117
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,460
you get the money, so.

118
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,500
But okay, but consider this, we did have smaller numbers before, and then we got big numbers,

119
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,460
and then those big numbers turned into normal numbers, and now we have those now. Do you

120
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,300
think that that's purely just from people finding our individual content? Because there

121
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,420
were a lot of people back in late A, saying like, oh, I'm a big PCP fan. Dude, I showed

122
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,180
my friends the PCP, and they were like, holy shit, I didn't know people could be this funny.

123
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,700
And then they turned three years old the next year, and they stopped watching. But the point

124
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,820
is, is that people used to watch the show, like, not independently from our own stuff,

125
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,220
but they thought it was like, you know, the main content. And who thinks the main content

126
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,420
is the PCP anymore?

127
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:19,460
Let me pause it an actual theory about this. I think I might have the answer. Like, these

128
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,620
days, what are we all doing these days? Like, we're doing, like, I'm chugging away on vapors,

129
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,060
which I want to talk about that in a minute. But like, you know, mostly lately we've been

130
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,180
working on Endless War, which is so niche. You know, like, Hippo, you've stopped making

131
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,300
like, mainstream YouTube stuff. Tom, you've pretty much, you've stopped making YouTube

132
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,980
stuff and you're working on a Zoomy game now. Maid, you've been dead for a while. I think,

133
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,540
I think maybe back in the day, when we were growing, it was when we were doing like, you

134
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,340
know, mainstream consumable products, you know, like Hippo was making Hippocrite video

135
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,380
game reviews and stuff. Tom was doing like tech reviews, you know?

136
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,340
True. I don't know, though, because like...

137
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,940
Just for the record, I am working on something, but it might not come into fruition anytime

138
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,500
soon, so I'd like to keep it for the most part a secret, but I'm not just sitting on

139
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,700
my hands for the most part. Don't worry.

140
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,580
Maid, you've never heard of a thing that takes a while to do.

141
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:34,500
Maid, you gotta follow Maid on Twitter for those amazing androgynous, confused characters.

142
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,900
Boys who don't know what a boy is. Yeah, they're going to be...

143
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Excuse you.

144
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:48,140
I don't know, because like, we weren't like, super big in those fields. Do you think it's

145
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,700
the idea that we were making stuff, like, created an environment where it seems like

146
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,820
we're cool, and now we're not cool because they don't see stuff?

147
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,260
Well, all I was suggesting was just that, you know, we as a collective were getting

148
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,700
more views through that more mainstream digestible content. However, I think there's something

149
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,940
to be said, yeah, for the perception that, you know, we are all YouTubers, which was

150
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,460
never really true, but it was maybe truer at some point in the past than it is now,

151
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,180
that we were all YouTubers, and we were all embarking on this YouTube adventure together,

152
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,500
you know? We were like a guild of some kind on this unified quest, and like, we've all

153
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,420
diversified our shit, and like, we've all gone in all these crazy fucking individual

154
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,820
directions now, and it's maybe a little less like that.

155
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,540
I thought of a counterpoint that scares me. Yeah.

156
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,340
I was going to say, sure, we were making more mainstream content.

157
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,460
I hate quiet munchies so much.

158
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,140
Raise your fucking voice.

159
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,620
Listen, I'm in a high-rise apartment in downtown Boston. I'm making Mad Bank. I'm the vice

160
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:05,260
president of TripAdvisor, and I don't need this sort of this rabble rousing and all these

161
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,860
screams and these maims coming from you lower class. I'm just trying here to make a quick

162
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,900
buck.

163
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Why don't you get Munchie off? Let's get the rowdy fucker on here instead.

164
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,020
Oh, I hate that guy.

165
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,620
Me too, man.

166
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,220
I thought for a moment, like, you know, oh, sure, we were making more mainstream stuff

167
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,380
before, but you know, people like niche stuff. People surely like our stuff now, because it's

168
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,340
more interesting. But then I thought for a second, maybe they don't. Maybe they don't want to get

169
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,300
you dumb, dumb, because a lot of people don't like it.

170
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,580
Well, sure. But I'm saying, you know, you would think that maybe your core audience would appreciate

171
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,060
what you're doing now, but I would think there's probably a lot of, like, for instance,

172
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,260
hippo fans who don't really, maybe not dislike his comics, but don't really like, oh, he's not

173
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,700
doing game reviews. Okay, bye. Sure, yeah, with Munchie fans who are like, oh, you know, I don't

174
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,260
like, you know, he's not doing an arm retrieval or, you know, whatever. I mean, think about it,

175
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:11,500
like, go way, way back. Like, the foundation of the PCP was the horseshoe crew, and everyone,

176
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,940
it was all YouTube. Like, everyone, you know, everyone who found us in the horseshoe days found

177
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,620
us through YouTube, maybe not everyone, but almost everyone, you know, everyone that found us once

178
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,180
the PCP became a thing, you know, in the postponement, they all found us through the PCP on YouTube.

179
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,820
Like, most of us were on YouTube making YouTube stuff, you know, people have found me through the

180
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:38,380
the Sonichu lecture, and come come here through that, and that's YouTube. So, you know, and it's

181
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,380
I mean, it makes sense. It's obvious when you lay down like that, but it's just kind of, I don't know,

182
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,340
startling in a way to think, to maybe some people, we've just completely abandoned what made us good,

183
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,740
and we're going to be the stars of YouTube videos, I mean, like, like, how how they lost their spark,

184
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,460
or, you know, like, fall straight. Yeah, yeah. Like, like, Ben St. Stop doing My Little Pony

185
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,860
Reviews, and he became a pokey tuber. Like, that is just great. It's scary. It's scary and a little,

186
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,980
almost like, nauseating. Not not in the sense that like, oh, you make me sick, but it's just kind

187
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,980
of like a sickening thought. Like, yeah, there's probably a lot of people, maybe, you know, people

188
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,740
that have like seen my, say, the Sonichu video, and think that that's what I'm about. And like,

189
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,580
the fact that I'm not doing that means that to them, I'm effectively dead. It's like, I've effectively

190
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,180
quit doing anything as far as they're concerned. I really, I really dislike, like, I don't mind

191
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,300
the fact that people do that, but like, it annoys me, just conceptually. This idea that on the

192
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,860
internet, it's, it's like, if you're not creating a constant stream of something, if you're not

193
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,700
maintaining a presence, then people immediately forget about you. And you'd need to be like,

194
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,340
the best of the best of all time for people to actually care. And even then, they'll just get

195
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,540
mad that you're not uploading frequently enough. Well, I understand, because if like, you know,

196
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm watching a YouTube creator or YouTube channel, and he's making one type of content,

197
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,140
I'm going to subscribe to him because I like that content. And if he totally shifts gears,

198
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,220
it's not that I'm thinking, oh, this guy is terrible. This guy's lost all his creative

199
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,380
inspiration. She's like, well, I didn't sign up for this. I hate having the mentality applied

200
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,900
to me, but I absolutely apply it to everyone else. I'm just as guilty of this as anybody else.

201
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,460
And it's interesting. Well, I don't expect the people to suddenly like my comics. I expect that

202
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:35,740
to be a completely different thing. I just, when it was like what I was doing, if you stay away from

203
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,620
the internet for even a week, people are like, what the fuck? And I'm like, shut up. You don't

204
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,940
know how long it takes to do anything. Yeah. Right. Right. Well, I mean, how could they?

205
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:51,660
A little kid, John Tron made like a post like back on normal booths like way a long time ago,

206
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,260
talking about his like upload schedule. We can't talk about John Tron anymore.

207
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,380
I heard he said some bad things. When PewDiePie way back on normal booth, oh,

208
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:08,220
wait, shit, went to a buskets, oh, wait, shit, when, um, when, um, when Harvey Weinstein,

209
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,980
oh, wait, shit, non-descript internet YouTuber celebrity. Yeah.

210
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,340
He was discussing his upload schedule and he was talking about how like, yeah, I'm sorry,

211
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,820
guys, like I fucked up. I shouldn't have said I would have a bi-weekly schedule. It's, you know,

212
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,260
that's bi-weekly. Yeah, bi-weekly schedule. It's way too short of time to make a good video. And

213
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm like, bi-weekly, I can, that's like two weeks, dude. You could do anything in two weeks.

214
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,900
That's what you're talking about. This just makes me think of, uh, like, like the new T-Bap,

215
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,780
like Tom, you said it, like the, like the old T-Baps, we made them in a weekend. We, we rushed

216
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,700
them out. We had deadlines and we stuck to them religiously. The new one has no hard deadline.

217
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,860
And for that reason, it's taken us like, like for the better part of a year. I mean, we haven't,

218
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,340
we weren't working on it for a long time after, right, but you know, it's been a long fucking time.

219
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,820
And it's like shit, man. We, we all need, we all need the deadlines of a weekly children's

220
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,140
cartoon to whip us all back into shape, I think is what we're getting to here. There's definitely

221
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,500
something to be said about a deadline. Please, please, please rescue yourself from my scorn.

222
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,780
Surely this P-Bap is more intensive. Well, I mean, obviously. Yeah, okay. But however, you know,

223
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:32,300
counter to that. I somehow doubt that like, it will be, you know, a more of a hit. Like, I don't,

224
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,260
like, even though more work has gone, like this, this, this T-Bap is not going to get like, you

225
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,580
know, insane views or anything proportional to the amount of work that was put into it. Not,

226
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:49,340
not even, not by a long shot. I mean, that's just because you dropped off the map of pony reviews

227
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,020
and people wouldn't be expecting it, except the small amount of people who that played

228
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,740
the Frog Frashions fans. I imagine if it does blow up and all the Pony people are just like,

229
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,860
oh my god, these guys are great. I wish they were T-Baps back and Phantomore can finally make his big

230
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:11,500
cameo revisit on analysis anarchy. Oh, no. Do we have to go back? Do we say something, mage?

231
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,340
Yeah, I wouldn't, because I feel like there will not be a good time to remind you this,

232
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,820
because we'll always be talking about something. You are going to put me on blast and I'm just,

233
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,820
I'm really scared and I want to get that band-aid off. Don't, we don't have to do that right now.

234
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,740
We don't have to, I have written down here. I will, I will, stop hurting me. I will get to it.

235
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,420
All right, mage. Stop hurting me and hurt me already. I'll tell you how you broke, I'll tell

236
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,780
you how you broke my heart. Oh no. Yeah. I was in, we were in, you know, we were in, I was in

237
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,940
New Los Angeles City for Slimer Nailia, right? The, the, the, the week of Slimer Nailia.

238
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,340
And who do I see? Who do I see in the RFCK Discord, but none other than mage,

239
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,660
Uwu. And I get so happy, I'm so happy. I'm like, mage finally joined the Discord.

240
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,500
She finally took my advice, joined the Discord and listed killers, became purple, like, like,

241
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,300
it was always her destiny. And then I see that, no, it's just a troll. It's just Shawnee. It's

242
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:23,100
just Shawnee, that wily trickster god putting on one of his many hats, one of his many disguises.

243
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:31,180
And I was crestfallen, crestfallen, mage. So, so, so that's what I didn't do.

244
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,740
That's right. That's right. And now I'm putting you on blast for it.

245
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:42,620
Well, I, I don't understand. I'm not sure if I should be apologizing.

246
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:49,260
I guarantee you should. If, if only you had joined the, the thing already,

247
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,260
then there would be no confusion. I, I made it clear I have no interest

248
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,860
in fighting people over slime things. You can farm. You can farm.

249
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,900
She's already lifted in real life, Ben. A Discord server just doesn't satisfy the urge for mage

250
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:08,220
anymore. Instead of slime, mage, you should join my server, the, the mud puddle, and become a mud,

251
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,460
mud knight. No, no, no, no, no, there's no fighting. There's no fighting. The mud puddle is all about

252
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,060
just wallowing in, in, in the swamps and doing nothing on Discord. Mage needs to start her own

253
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,900
purple server where everybody fights with Pokemon skeletons. You gotta, you gotta start a gang that

254
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,300
just fights with the bones of Pokemon that you dig up. The, the, the, the violent violets,

255
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,020
they'll be the gang. Oh shit, yeah. Here's, like the other day, because like last PCP we talked about,

256
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,700
the Discord's going to war. I riled up my boys and, and I created some lore for my server,

257
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,860
the mud puddle. And then we're like, we're like the Abyss. We're like the, the, the downtrodden,

258
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,780
like, dregs of human society covered in filth and muck, swallowing in the dirt. And we're here to

259
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:03,180
drag you all down and drown you and make you into a, into a bunch of gross shit. And that's us,

260
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,180
and that's what we're here to do. And you have to be a mudblood. You can't be like special or

261
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:13,180
anything. You have to be a freaking loser. And mud is better than slime and mud cannot be defeated

262
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,980
by slime because mud is endless. And it's a lot of it. And I like, I want every Discord in the

263
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,900
world to have like a cool lore and fighting style, not, not necessarily because we're going to make

264
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,100
every server a bot server where you can do stuff, but just as like a cool aesthetic thing. So you

265
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,900
can wave your flag. My server has some of that, has some like some, some vague role lore going on,

266
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,020
but it could be codified. It could be codified a lot better. We've got the rank and file soldiers

267
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,580
of the Wastoid's in Ben Stelfire. Are like Protestant Christians and Catholic Christians,

268
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,940
where, you know, we can fight a lot, you know, we can have some hard times, the rising killers

269
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,660
can kill each other mercilessly in the street over and over ad nauseam forever. But then we just,

270
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,620
we look a little bit to the, to the east and we see some Muslims and we just, like we just

271
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,580
on cue both simultaneously. And we just, we can't have that. No, sorry. Yeah, no, no, you know,

272
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,740
we may hate each other, but you know, we hate other people even more. So we have to kill them.

273
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,380
We have to team up to be able to destroy them. It's game of, it's game of Discord communities.

274
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,420
We like, we will, killers and rowdies will come together to protect their fair city from a mutual

275
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:27,980
threat. Disgusting though. What happens when the hippos invade? What happens when the mud envelops

276
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,020
in the swamp? Talk about niche content. What the fuck are we talking about right now?

277
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,260
This is the real shit. This is the raw shit. This is what we care about deeply. We want to,

278
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,740
viewer, listen, we invite you to join us on this quest of inner beauty and self-discovery.

279
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,380
You know, we invite, invite, we're inviting you into our world, into our private world

280
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,340
of, of whatever the fuck we're talking about right now. Come along. Come along. It's just,

281
00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:00,700
it's just way more interesting. Like YouTube, I see like is 100% explanations about something or

282
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,420
other. And I'm like, I don't want to explain. I want to create. That's why I like all this Discord

283
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,820
shit because it's, it's very creative and it's very silly. And it's very on the fly. And it's like,

284
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,380
you're interacting with people. It's like having a comment section, but like a real time comment

285
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,900
section, but you don't even have to stream to do it. You just talk to people live. It's great.

286
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,780
Was it, was it, you always talking to Munchie about how like Discord has changed how, how people

287
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,940
like talk to each other on the internet? It was me who told that to you. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well,

288
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,900
it was a conversation we were having. You and I. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. We're partners in this,

289
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,820
I guess. Whatever. It was, whatever. I was in, well, if it wasn't you, then I was going to bring

290
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,820
it as my own idea, but whatever. Yeah. It's interesting. I never thought about it before.

291
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,980
Like I had, I mean, has everyone on the internet migrated to Discord? Has everyone given up on

292
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,260
Skype? I'm super big. My original point was back in like Skype and stuff like that.

293
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,220
You know, you had group chats, but you had to be friend, someone in order to get into those chats.

294
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,820
And there were more like friend groups. There were some like big, you know, 100 people groups,

295
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,540
but those were few and far in between. And again, you had to be friend, so maybe an admin or a

296
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,940
member or something like that to even get into them. With Discord, it shifted away from like

297
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,420
friend groups to like capital S servers that are borderline independent communities and

298
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,980
completely communities, completely revolving around one aspect, you know, maybe a game or

299
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,260
a show or something like that, or even just, you know, common interests or, you know,

300
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,900
something niche like endless war. But the point is that they aren't friend groups per se. They can

301
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,020
become friend groups. And sometimes they are friend groups. I have some, you know, IRL friend

302
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:52,860
group Discord servers, but most of the time they are like independent communities. Yeah, that you

303
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,220
join and you can partake in, you know, in whatever you want. They're like forms interpersonal

304
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,460
connections. They're like, yeah, they're sort of like forms. They just move super fucking fast.

305
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,500
Exactly. It's weird. It's very strange. It's a very strange world we live in now.

306
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,340
I don't know. I don't know what's so strange about it. It's just sort of chatting with,

307
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,020
it's a way to communicate with like a large amount of people very easily.

308
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:25,420
It's not that easy, though, because like, it does kind of feel like Discord servers and things

309
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,740
like that have replaced internet forums to a certain extent, but it's a totally different

310
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,620
experience. It doesn't feel the same at all. Because a Discord server goes by and like,

311
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,260
you pretty much have to be there, or you miss it. Whereas like a forum, it's like people are

312
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,580
posting and it's all archived and you read through the backlog. I don't really read through

313
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,900
backlogs on Discord very much because there's just too fucking much. And it shows Ben. It shows.

314
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:55,580
What do you? What do you? Yeah, I do. I do all the time. Who's got fucking time for that?

315
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,540
Who's got time for any of you freaks? Yeah, true. Apparently you do, since you're here.

316
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,220
I'm only here for that moolah, baby. Destroyed. I'm only here for that cassola.

317
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,820
Why does everyone sound like dead and or dying physically and or mentally? Well, you're talking

318
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,420
quiet. I thought I always sounded dead or down. Let me tell you a story, Hifo. I went to Canada.

319
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:25,020
I returned from Canada and then I got ill and almost died and my fever was very high.

320
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,420
What a story. What a cool story, dude. Why were you in Canada? Just another day in the life of

321
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,540
the violent violence. Was this on a podcast that I wasn't on? Did I miss the story of why you were

322
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,180
in Canada? No, that's the thing though. Like, I haven't been in an apartment. Like, this is my

323
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:45,740
first podcast after I've returned from Canada. Yeah, Mage has been gone for a while. Mage was

324
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,020
in my time zone and didn't even say hi to me. Discussing. Making a mistake, viewers. I'm not

325
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,220
bored or uninterested or sleepy. I just am quiet today. You're getting quiet much. It feels like

326
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,460
there's a different person. Yeah, it does feel, you know, like I'd seen in Men in Black. It feels

327
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,100
uncanny. Where the bug just like wears the guy's skin. I feel like that's happening with you right

328
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,380
now. I think, I don't know if it was you, Tom, who described this to me, but I think it was at

329
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,060
your house, at DigiHouse last trip to Boston, where I was just talking, I don't know, pretty

330
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,460
seriously about college or something. Or maybe it was on an episode and everyone was aghast.

331
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,980
Everyone didn't know how to react to me. That happened on like six different episodes.

332
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,300
No one just can't. Everyone just can't. It's still doesn't sink in though.

333
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,740
Yeah. It will never sink in. Hey, hey, did we, did it, is it, is it kosher if I bring up the whole

334
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:44,700
Vic thing? Because people told me, people told me that Vic like criticized me on the college thing,

335
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,540
but I listened to what he said. And like, it was so, it didn't even feel like criticism. I don't

336
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,900
know. People, people told me like, man, Vic put the PCP on blast. And like, I was, he was pretty

337
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,500
anti-Ben with it. And I listened to it. And he's like, it's totally not. He disagrees with us not,

338
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,660
like, you know, with us, like discouraging college and stuff, you know,

339
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,340
I'm so mutual on that, by the way. I, you know, I mean, I don't know. I've thought about it in my,

340
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:20,620
my position. Like, I was never like totally against. I'm just, you know, hesitant. I'm

341
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:28,860
hesitant and, and, and concerned about the merits of it. But I'm not like totally, I don't know.

342
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,500
I guess I just wanted to say that people told me some people, people hyped that up like it was a

343
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,020
big dramatic thing. And then I listened to it and it wasn't, you know, just like everything else in

344
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:49,100
life. That I have not seen any of those videos besides hippos. And I assume due to the fact that

345
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,540
they're the college topic that are all revolving around me. And it's more fucking noise on that

346
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,180
front, which I don't really care for the other way to hear more affirmation or, or negativity.

347
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,540
Yeah. Doesn't really, I don't need that. So I've seen that, that they can help you to come out.

348
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,500
Then I've seen Digi's rebuttal. And I thought no fucking thanks. I didn't see Digi's rebuttal.

349
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:18,140
Digi's video was just a apology, general. Okay. I saw hippo's video. And his description is like,

350
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,860
he really replies to Digi and his description events sound so strange that I had no, I have no idea

351
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:31,580
what I had stumbled onto. It was so different than what I had thought. So how often do gangsters come

352
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,940
up in the discussion? It was, it was just once. It was, they were, they were talking. That was,

353
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:44,700
that was the dumbest thing by far. Well, but, but hippo, you agreed with it. You like, you were

354
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,860
like defending the argument. I was, I was defending, which again, I didn't hear his original argument,

355
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,060
but I heard your rebuttal to it. The basic gist was they were talking about college and

356
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,060
what a college degree can get you. And it like is a good reason for college. The doctors were

357
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:06,940
brought up, lawyers were brought up. And then Digi brought up like illegal doctors could only go

358
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,580
into the gangsters. And like Mae was like, what the fuck are you talking about? And Digi had been

359
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,980
like smoking weed like during the episode. And it was very funny. But I thought he had a point

360
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,500
and he was getting shut down because he was smoking weed. And I decided to defend him.

361
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,300
PCP or is this on? No, this was on Digi and Mae Pokemon Colosseum. Let's play.

362
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:31,740
Right, right, right. Okay, okay. Well, I, well, I, we probably don't need to go any further into

363
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,460
all that. You know, there's already like a, there's already a constellation of minor

364
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:42,140
videos, reaction videos about it. I just want to, I just, I just want to know if there's anything

365
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,540
I'm missing out. Is there any sort of like a knowledge bomb that Victor or did you have dropped

366
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,740
that changed the conversation? Digi, Vicks is very, Vicks is very pro college and thinks college

367
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,220
is a good idea. I mean, did the only thing that was definitely there are arguments for that.

368
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:02,300
Victor's video was that like college can be good. And he goes on to basically say that like,

369
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:09,180
the PCP in general is kind of on the downswing. And like, we're not doing enough. And a lot of

370
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,500
like, like no one would want our lives lifestyle is basically what the gist was.

371
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,260
In so many words.

372
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,940
Well, I mean, the statement college can be good is the most

373
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,260
That's pretty uncontroversial.

374
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:29,420
Right. I guess the only thing, because like, Digi made a response video and he tried not to

375
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,260
include Munchy in it at all, because it was just supposed to be his thesis on college,

376
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,540
which is just everything we've already heard, but said for everyone can hear it now,

377
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,980
not in his own house when it was like Halloween or whatever.

378
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,020
And he was just, you know, just went over the same fucking points, whatever.

379
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Okay, but there were some things that Victor said in his video that like,

380
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,020
weren't 100% accurate to like what we've been saying and stuff, I guess, and she was trying

381
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,740
to clarify that. I don't mean the reason the Victor thing was a big deal is because he went

382
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:05,340
into all of us for like, not producing content. And the fact that some of us that was saying

383
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,660
college is bad. And like, you're not successful. So how can you say that you idiot?

384
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,300
And it was like a bit like, incendiary. I thought it was funny, because like Victor is

385
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:20,060
too chuckly to seem like an actual dangerous man. Like if he had a knife, he'd be laughing,

386
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:25,180
I'd be laughing along with him. So like, it was, you know, it was just a little,

387
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,660
like slight drama bump, like brony style drama. It's not even actually a thing.

388
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:38,700
It's not, yeah, it's not, if you watch a video, like, at first I was like, I don't know, like the

389
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,260
only thing that felt weird is that it's some of the stuff Victor had say at the time felt like he

390
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,700
was just like, because I haven't talked to him since Radcon. So it was like, between Radcon and

391
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,420
now, did he suddenly like get on a different wavelength or something? But it was fine. It was

392
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,540
not a big deal. It's not even worth talking about right now. That's how unimportant it is.

393
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:05,100
It's so hard to keep up tabs with Victor. Granted, I haven't tried that hard. I mean,

394
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,700
I guess if I wanted to do that, I would be watching the, you know,

395
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,140
Vic and Hope, the Vic and Hope channel, but I haven't been watching any, any such like,

396
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,340
Let's Play videos. I've recently outlawed Let's Plays for my life. I've made a restriction

397
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:25,180
where I can no longer watch them as a mental health. Yeah, I jumped back into them. I like Vic

398
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:31,420
and Hope. I don't watch it because it's breath in the wild and it sucks to look at. But yeah,

399
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,900
and the Digi and Main stuff. I like a bit of Let's Play talking about shit,

400
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:44,620
because it is kind of like, it's a weird format because they're friends and they know you.

401
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,620
And when they talk about you, it's kind of like you're listening in on a conversation,

402
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:56,860
but they're making it public. It's such a weird, you would never get that in a formal podcast,

403
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:03,100
necessarily. It feels more like a conversation that you, you, you just have like the key to, to,

404
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,500
to snoop around in the back and listen to them. I'm actually going to rescind. I'm going to rescind

405
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,060
my last statement that it's so hard to keep up with the Victor. It's actually, I assume,

406
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:21,100
I assume it wouldn't be that hard if I tried at all. 100% my fault. I used to fucking watch a Digi

407
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:27,660
bro every single day it came out. I was the most religious team Victor fan of all time. Victor's

408
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,180
my spicy bro. Victor is an official spicy bro. But what have I done to keep him tabs with them?

409
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:41,660
I haven't fucking messaged him and probably literally a year, if not more. I have not been

410
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,060
listening to his podcast. I've not even been attempting to keep up with him. I've just assumed,

411
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,940
you know, haha, he's not on discord or at least I don't think he's in the server,

412
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,060
right now. No, no, I, I know he has a discord account, but I think he made one specifically to

413
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,180
join the, the PCP discord, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm, that's probably true. Yeah, I don't think

414
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:08,780
that he's on it. He's, he's notoriously like not on the net. Yeah. So I think if I were to text him

415
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:13,180
or something, it would be a gale of time, but this is just, I don't know. This is another example of

416
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,340
just, I assume things are hard so I don't do them and therefore my life is terrible. Yeah,

417
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:25,260
yeah. Radical. I rescind everything that I said. Victor is an angel. Let's start the podcast over.

418
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,300
Yeah. Hey guys, welcome to the PCP. Here we've got Ben. Bye. This is sketchy later.

419
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:42,060
Just Ben, just, just Ben. Ben is the only one here. I don't, I, no, I'm not trying, I'm not trying

420
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,540
to make this all about the discord. I'm not trying to make this an rfck thing or anything,

421
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,620
but I do really want to talk about the fact that I was up all night last night making slimeoid

422
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,660
battles and this past week we really slimeoids and I'm just so fucking excited. I'm just so

423
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:03,340
fucking enthused. Ben, hold on. I'm gonna let you finish. I'm gonna let you finish. Yeah. We do have

424
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,300
our own show, you know. What are you, what are you talking about? We can just talk about this on

425
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,380
rfck. There's no reason. Why can't I talk about it here? I wanna fucking share what I'm passionate

426
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,700
about with my fucking friends, you piece of shit. Okay, no problem. Okay. What I'm saying

427
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:25,260
is that it's basically the entire topic so far has been like rfck. No it fucking hasn't. What the

428
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,660
fucking talking about. It's been, it's been prevalent. It's been prevalent. No, it has not. It has been

429
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,740
ancillary and best. Continue.

430
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:42,860
Quite Munchy is like such a, like a psychopath. He's such a piece of shit. You know what happened?

431
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,820
Munchy has stolen so many dads. He just is a dad now. That's what we're experiencing.

432
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,700
What are you talking about? Listen guys, I'm not trying to be stern right now. I know you're not

433
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,540
trying to but like the fact that- I can be fun too. I'm just one of the boys. You know I'm just

434
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,260
one of the boys. Guys, what are you playing now? It's Mario still playing. Listen to this

435
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:11,500
wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh, it's funny. It's weird that Munchy being the youngest one is

436
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,060
currently doing the hello fellow kids. I know. I think so. Ben, do you know if there's a

437
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,460
discord server that I can join and play in browser for free and that might be text based

438
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,820
based on old mud type games? Do you know- I might have heard of- Oh yeah, the mud puddle. Go to

439
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:35,100
discord.com.com. Splash. Ben, what are you talking about? Slymoids. I just- I don't know. I just-

440
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,820
Someone ask me something about them. I just want to gush about them. Dude, what the fuck?

441
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:46,380
Dude, what the fuck? Sweet Mouse messaged me like two hours ago being like,

442
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,300
hey, so I want to make the best Slymoid I can make for when Slymoid battling becomes a thing.

443
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,940
Let me ask you some questions about Slymoid Brains. How does Slymoid Brains work? And I was

444
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,660
like, oh my god, I'm so fucking enthused to tell you all about how Slymoid Brains work, dude.

445
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,060
I was like, man, this- this brain does this and that. This one sucks. This brain is pretty good

446
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,420
if you want to do this kind of thing. And I don't know how this is going to work yet, but probably

447
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,140
this brain will be- This brain's like nature's-

448
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,620
Basic, more or less. You can- you can- you can choose all the different parts. You can- you

449
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,820
assemble your- your Slymoid from all these different parts and you get to choose what kind of brain

450
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,460
it has. And depending on what kind of brain you give it, it will have- well, it has different like

451
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,780
personality behaviors when you interact with it and it like behaves- it's gonna like behave

452
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,420
differently and it's gonna have like a different AI sort of- sort of controlling it. Um, it's so

453
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,860
so fucking cool. I'm just so fucking jazzed about it 24 hours a day.

454
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,660
It's good that you actually finished the thing you were trying to do because you've got a lot of

455
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:51,500
stuff to- to- to get done and you're always like- you've been like stressing out about Slymoids for a

456
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:58,220
while. So yeah, that's good to be done. The end of season one was when I started working on Slymoids

457
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,740
and then- It's been a while. Yeah, it was like a long- and then like season two came out and the

458
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,580
code was all different and I got frustrated and then I took another crack at it and I realized

459
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,340
that like it needed to interact with the database and the way I didn't understand so I got my friend

460
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,340
John to fucking show me how the database works and then I went back to it and I realized that nothing

461
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,500
I had written would work with how I now understand the database to work so I had just fucking redo

462
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,140
it all from scratch and then the other like a week ago or two weeks ago now maybe or something

463
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,580
like that I finally finished it and then- and then it comes out and everyone loves it. Everyone's

464
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,980
making their slime but it's not like okay now it's time for the most arduous task of all taking

465
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,180
everything I've done and build- and building upon it to create Slymoid battle system. Okay,

466
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,620
I'm gonna have to throw out everything I did before and start from scratch and then I tested it

467
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,980
and like everything that I made from battle system actually worked fine and it just needed

468
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,860
minor tweaks and it was done in like a day and a half so that's coming out really soon. Ben and I

469
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:55,660
hung out a week ago when you're listening to this and I can confirm that every 30 minutes

470
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,340
when there was like a slight lowland conversation like a two second gap here you just sigh and say

471
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:07,100
oh when Slymoid battling comes out like you'll all see you'll all rue the day you picked on little old

472
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:16,220
Ben at the same. Yeah. You'll all realize the fool you know yourselves returning me down for

473
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:22,700
for junior prom. Yeah exactly. When I just showed up with my new Slymoid wife. The whole motivation

474
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,820
for this was that when Jenny shot you down that was the moment you decided someday I'm gonna have a

475
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:36,380
discord server. Jenny I miss you you bitch! Ben I just want to know when are you doing your sabbatical

476
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,780
you've been talking about sabbatical for like three fucking months and I have not I have not

477
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:47,900
seen you turn hide nor tail. You know the truth okay so when we recorded when we recorded that

478
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,980
17 hour nightmare horror show rfck episode. We're gonna do that again I hope you know.

479
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,100
No we're not I'm never playing sprawl ever again. No we're not we don't we don't do

480
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,860
brawls. Okay well when we recorded that yeah I talked in the conversation about how I wanted to

481
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:10,060
take a sabbatical from the internet and the truth is that I kind of have been like I haven't been

482
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:18,060
like on my discord very much I haven't really been like doing much on the internet so I just

483
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,700
I don't know I just didn't like at the time I thought maybe I would announce like okay I'm

484
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,020
unplugging from the internet and I'm going away for like you know a month or two until

485
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:32,620
shit's done but then like I don't know just something clicked in my head like maybe a week

486
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:39,260
or two ago and like suddenly I fucking buckled down and I got slymoids done and I like I did like

487
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:45,980
two new vapors pages in like three days and that was like you know a recent record that was I couldn't

488
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,940
believe how long it had been I had let that shit lie fallow for so long it was I can't

489
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,500
fucking believe how long it went without drawing a new page I hate it I fucking hate it but I'm

490
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,220
but it's okay but it's okay because I'm back so I'm fucking back and slymoids are done and it's

491
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,940
all about the vapors now you know what you know it's slightly also too bad which is also almost

492
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:10,620
done you know it's like you're disturbing bin yeah for for our relationship as humans is that you

493
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:16,140
can like log off from the internet from the internet softcore and I view no change in the

494
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,980
amount of time that like we interact in fact it almost goes up in a way I haven't been logged off

495
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,500
I just have not been engaging with like I haven't really been on Twitter you haven't really been

496
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,500
in my discord I've just been like there was a lot of wasting of time on the internet and now

497
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,940
you're using the internet for the constructive purpose I didn't view it as wasting of time

498
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,820
I just I viewed it as like you know arranging of time I well at that like like being on Twitter

499
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,420
and being in discord like that's how I like interact with people but yeah I think maybe

500
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,620
it was cutting in it was I was doing it at the expense of like you know working on shit

501
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,820
and I mean you're I mean you're supposed to interact with people right you're not supposed

502
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:07,740
to just work and not talk to anyone right no yes I think yeah that's something very important

503
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:15,420
and yet at this moment I feel so much better about things since I've stopped doing anything

504
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:21,180
since I've stopped communicating with people and just been working instead well I mean I feel if

505
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,380
you if it's been so long I was I was in balance yeah you were I was in balance I was in balance

506
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,220
and I've tilted the other way now and and it'll feel good for a while until you start feeling

507
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,740
the longing for social interaction I mean you know you gotta balance the back out

508
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:43,820
moderation in all things as I'm sure you know like no I don't know moderation I can't do it I can't

509
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,980
do anything but not like I can't I can't do anything without throwing myself into it completely

510
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,380
and being like this is what I am now then there are huge and the same goes for the everything I can't

511
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,500
like I can't like tape or something back I just if I if I if I tape or something back at all if I

512
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,380
push something even slight if if something goes behind anything else in my mind's eye it's gone

513
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,780
it's gone and I don't touch it I'm a hundred percent on board with this horrible mentality

514
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,340
it's horrible it's it's ruined everything there's a huge difference between talking to people in

515
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:23,020
your discord fan server and talking to your friends there's I would say that like what is

516
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:28,620
important for you to do sure like networking and and you know like community management quote

517
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:33,340
unquote is important but I would say what most people mean when they say you guys talk to people

518
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,140
you can't just focus on your art is just talk to your friends and get more input even just for

519
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,700
your art it's important to have second opinions and stuff like that it's not so much people are

520
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:48,540
thinking oh yeah go post on forums you got you gotta you gotta go post on some forums uh you know

521
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,740
you meet your form post quota for every comic page you make it's more like you gotta have

522
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:00,380
more fucking human action genuine ones watching a presentation uh some guy was making this point

523
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,860
that like artists are terrible at like networking or like making time in person to like talk about

524
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,380
their craft um he was this thing was specifically talking about like actors he was presenting

525
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,140
something like actors thing but he just like it said applied to artists in general because he was

526
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,420
saying like you know the most of the time that like when you're an actor and you see other actors

527
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,260
is when you're like going for a role and you all want to kill each other because we're all fighting

528
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:31,980
like there's never a time when you can just talk about your craft in a like normal kind of friendly

529
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,860
way and like artists in general are bad right if you're if you're an actor and you're doing like

530
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:43,980
some performative art or something you know your art and your job means you're interacting with people

531
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,900
like right now you know i'm talking to other humans right now i'm talking to hippo ben tom and mage

532
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:55,260
like i can like trick myself and they're thinking all right that's that's good enough human interaction

533
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:59,900
you know i've got my fill for today no more please and just go back to working on you know endless

534
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:06,300
work code or whatever it is that i do but i mean i'm not trying to say that this podcast isn't you

535
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,180
know good or that we shouldn't do and it's not good for our friendship or anything i'm just saying

536
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,380
like this is not really you know this is way different than when me and ben were hanging right

537
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,700
this isn't shooting the shit we're all putting on a subtle performance right now we're all exaggerating

538
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,100
and regressing parts of our personality in order to be more entertaining this is not the way we

539
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,900
talk to each other off camera i don't want to glorify shooting the shit or anything like it's

540
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,620
not like i think it's like a super productive thing to do i just think your mind sort of

541
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,020
cag lugs it differently i think it's i think it's healthy to shoot the shit every once in a while

542
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:44,460
at the very least i think human interaction is important in person iRL for real i mean i would

543
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,980
say that even though we were you know shooting the shit and talking casually we weren't trying to fill

544
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:56,860
every you know silence gap with with you know content for people to drown in we did talk about

545
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,780
you know art and work stuff yesterday ben we did talk about stuff to do it was i wouldn't say maybe

546
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:08,700
productive but i mean that's how all ideas are made right you know two friends are talking

547
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,300
and they think huh maybe we should do this you know maybe they made a joke and they're like you

548
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,460
know that could turn into a real projects and boom bada bing bada boom you've got a t-bap or

549
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:25,660
something like that you know i've talked about this on the show before um it doesn't feel that

550
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:32,300
different being on here than it does just talking to someone in a normal setting because like

551
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:38,380
you're always performing right even if you're just talking to a person in real life like

552
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:45,580
you're still on it to a degree it's not like oh now i'm on but when it's my friends in real life

553
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:52,300
i'm not no i'm still like trying to be i'm still like i'm still like trying to be cool and trying

554
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:57,660
to make people like me through the way that i interact with them like that that doesn't turn

555
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,780
off no i think you turn it up or down though depending on the the context of the situation

556
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,140
well i don't think i don't think i don't think i don't think maybe aside from munchie i don't

557
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:18,620
think we really put on that much of a show um individually on the pcp because it ends up being

558
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:27,260
you know just us talking about stuff generally like i've seen in in radcons like we would make

559
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:32,540
jokes that we would make in a podcast in real life we would do funny things all the time and

560
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,860
then we would have quieter moments where somebody's just talking about something and it's like it

561
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:43,340
feels pretty much the same i mean anyway the difference is the conversation itself the conversation

562
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:52,140
topics where i would probably talk about and ask about way different things on a podcast and i would

563
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:58,380
ask someone else you know one-on-one in person or you know in a group in person just hanging out

564
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:05,260
talking casually when i'm talking here the sort of topics they bring up are usually meant to be

565
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,740
you know entertaining in one way or another either i guess i guess that's why the podcast

566
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,740
sucks is i don't think about what could be entertaining for the audience enough um i think

567
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,580
i whereas i would probably ask more i don't know personal things that i would usually want to talk

568
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:30,380
about more you know i would bring up wouldn't be necessarily be good podcast material it would

569
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,460
just be something i want to know about you what you've been doing and you know what you want to

570
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:42,380
continue to do i would be happy and talk about you know maybe some some taboo drama that's come

571
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:48,140
up recently with ben that you know we can't talk about on the show because there's none of there's

572
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:53,660
none of that by the way that's there is no i was i was wondering what it really sounded like you

573
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,060
were hinting at something no i just want to like no there's no that that's a hypothetical yeah

574
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:06,060
oh but you know what i mean right you get you get what i'm trying to yeah yeah yeah yeah

575
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:10,620
yeah it's a different sort of air it's a different i mean i mean it's not exactly i don't think i'm

576
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:16,140
putting on a character right now like i don't think that like munchie is separated from how i am in

577
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:22,220
real life i don't even think that he's particularly like some sort of like on staroids hidden version

578
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:28,940
of how i am it's just i get nervous when i get nervous i say kooky things and scream in parentheses

579
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:34,700
usually but you know when i'm off air i don't have to work i don't have to be nervous because i'm

580
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,180
just with my friends and i don't think they'll hate me if i say something wrong i mean they might

581
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:45,500
but i don't operate under the fact that they will i'm not i don't ever like i would never

582
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:51,660
consider talking with one of you guys like just off air like performing anything that's just how i am

583
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,060
when i'm talking to you guys that's just i don't know everything's like everything you do in life

584
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:01,580
is a performance even yourself sometimes if you want to be fucking if you want to wax philosophical

585
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:08,780
pseudo philosophically then okay maybe but i think there's a very clear at least in my you know in my

586
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:15,660
worldview very very distinct and clear difference recording a podcast and talking to someone else

587
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:21,500
it's not for me it's the lines the lines very blurry the lines very wide

588
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:27,580
gradient for me i mean i want to talk about just like the physical stuff i'm looking at my computer

589
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,660
screen i'm looking at a microphone right now i'm not looking at someone else's face but i'm but

590
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:38,540
i'm talking to you guys the same way that i would if i wasn't being recorded is what i'm getting at

591
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:45,180
sure i don't really think i'm i think there's still a bit of a difference just even if you don't

592
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:51,900
mean it it's still it's still maybe well maybe i can't maybe i can't accurately self assess that

593
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:58,700
it's it's a difference that nobody would ever like it's so um unique to you what you literally

594
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:05,020
actually acts like when nobody's watching right that nobody would ever know unless they spy on you

595
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:13,020
and i don't want to do that or do i what do you know now i'm interested to see if this comes across

596
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,860
at all in the way i speak when you guys like we're talking to me at during the non-recording

597
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,260
moments of icon three or even just when we were out you know doing something whatever when we were

598
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:30,860
talking casually do you sense much of a difference in the way that i am or is it all the only thing

599
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:36,220
that seems different is that sometimes on a podcast you'll have like an actual script in front of

600
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:44,540
you that you wrote and you read it but outside of that not really no i i do i don't like i haven't

601
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,700
the the things that are like recorded are like more memorable because i've seen them more than once

602
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,740
but like i do remember times when munchie is just sort of there and it's he's not like doing

603
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:01,500
boring you know yeah like like for a lack of a better term like not being haha it's me munchie

604
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,900
like how dare he not entertain the masses well i mean you're not doing that right now

605
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,820
like you're not you're not like that all the time not that he's not like being like a core

606
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:19,340
jester i mean like um he wouldn't necessarily have a thing on his mind to say next it would just be

607
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,300
like wherever the conversation is going um you know if he has something to say he'll say it if he

608
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:30,620
doesn't and he doesn't but like in a in a podcast there's this constant pressure to think of the

609
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:37,740
next thing that has to be said about this or like what you want what you want the the the public to

610
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,660
know you think about certain topics recording a podcast is like killing a vampire you're trying

611
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:48,380
to reload your shotgun while the vampire is making his moves and and and because of that you're not

612
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,620
looking at the vampire you're not trying to see where he's circle strafing or where he's moving

613
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,180
this lens you're just focused on reloading your own shotgun just shoot him with am i the vampire

614
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:02,140
we're all the vampire bin we're all the vampire no one's the shotgun the viewers of the shotgun

615
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:11,340
i i have a thing about like working and stuff you have to raise your hand before you can start

616
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:15,420
squeezing i did i've been raising it this whole time but you can't see because you're just looking at

617
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,700
the screen oh wow just another shotgun that's why you can't see your hand just another failure of the

618
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,180
medium of podcast not delivering me my raw friendship i couldn't see him raise his hand that

619
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:33,660
was crucial to my appreciation of him as a person uh my little brother who uh you may know as the

620
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:39,980
master kota who created uh runaway from snakes the video game buy it now on itchio.com slash

621
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:49,340
charlie batten uh cool guy obviously because he's my brother i like him he's making a new game which

622
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:55,420
is like oh wretched and clank-esque whoa what uh yeah he's got like a weapon wheel and he's figuring

623
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,300
out how to do like water ripple effects and stuff and he's got jumping it's really cute it's really

624
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,260
good and i'm really proud of him he needs to get in the iam games discord and get into the devlog

625
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,340
channel because we all circle jerk about our games and that and it's great motivation this

626
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:15,580
is gonna have a thousand fucking discord invite links yeah yeah yeah but uh he's doing all that

627
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:21,340
stuff and i'm like okay this is good this this means he is like still a like this is he hasn't

628
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,460
done a shade and like stopped making uh what he makes he hasn't done a shade and like stopped making

629
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:32,300
music he i i mean i haven't kept up the shade makes pizzas right he makes pizzas now he does make

630
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:38,060
pizzas yeah so like surely those aren't mutually exclusive well he's a manager so he's not like

631
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,740
making them deliberately i don't know maybe managers do maybe when it gets really busy the

632
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,500
the manager has to step out of his office he's got to like take off his suit and tie and put on

633
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:50,220
one of those blue shirts i'm like get some like flour on his hands like all right pizza it's time

634
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:56,380
fucking year i'm getting real pissed about it when is he gonna upload that 3d printed image

635
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,940
dude i want to 3d print the pizza myself i want to go to shade and be like shade i want a custom

636
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:07,500
pizza i want to request like down to the millimeter the amount of the thickness of the crust if you

637
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,500
if you pledge to shade on patreon to get a custom pizza

638
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:18,220
shade is making sick custom pizzas every month every month over you gonna say yeah yeah yeah um

639
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:23,420
so he's making a new game and he's intercoding stills which is this good thing for me because

640
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:30,380
i want to make another game um with his skills well i mean yeah it's like oh i'm not i'm not a

641
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:36,220
part of the creative process because whatever but like he is like my contractor or i'm the other

642
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,940
the other way around he is like the the muscle and i am the brains and i have to think of all

643
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:47,340
the cool shit but who's the heart and i'm just um it's it's a very it's annoying because i have

644
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:53,820
this idea for this game and i have an idea for a comic that will be you know like run away from

645
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:59,740
snakes was part of the bell jpeg comic my next comic i'm thinking oh i could make a game for that as

646
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:05,100
well and it'll be like a thing i do and and so i've got a new comic idea that is swirling around

647
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,820
in my head i've got a new game idea i've got this idea that i could like model the main character

648
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,340
in 3d and i'll be really cool do it i've got all these things going on and i can't do any of them

649
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:20,780
because i'm supposed to be doing something else with a deadline that is like eating up into my entire

650
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:26,780
december i haven't been doing anything other than working on this this one thing it sucks because

651
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:32,780
all these new cool ideas fresh and unique that i just can't spend any time working with

652
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,820
we gotta do this is what you gotta do you gotta you gotta write everything down every time you

653
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,580
have a cool idea write it down so you can get back to it when when you have i mean i have been writing

654
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,540
them down i got like google docs all the time for not writing them down and it is the most

655
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:52,460
retarded thing ever hit hippo before i respond to your actual point i just want to say whenever

656
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:59,900
you come to radcon or just after the pcp when we're recording you just splay your teeth out wide

657
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:06,380
and i just want to suckle it so badly but it's so hard i can never get it in one clean pump

658
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:15,020
it always leaves me so unsatisfied whenever i go pee so i have to hear this i get so fucking mad

659
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:20,060
whenever you're like um yeah you know i'm just like we're gonna move you like it's no big deal

660
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:26,940
i hate elk Baldwin you know you know what i mean uh and and then you know i approach you i corner you

661
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,780
to get some of that tid in my mouth and you're just like um well you know it's not really a big

662
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,980
deal so i'm not even really gonna talk about you know like whatever i'm just making the movies just

663
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,180
a script you know whatever i don't even care it is just a script i mean there's looks to it but

664
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:46,300
like i don't i don't know how to talk about it like i'm not a screenwriting analyst i didn't i

665
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:54,460
didn't cut my teeth on reviewing scripts or your shows all i know is that when you know occasionally

666
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:59,020
you'll post some work from from your or you know just talking about on the pcp chat it'll be like

667
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,820
a whole new world and and you'll post like some animated trailer that i'm not even supposed to

668
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:10,300
talk about don't worry haha uh and i'll just like lose my fucking mind because i like i don't

669
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:15,580
recognize my mind that it's like real because i don't know anything about it so i just think ah

670
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:21,980
hippo he he code it scripts that's just code word for gay sex he's just a gay person now that's what

671
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:27,500
he means because i haven't i don't know anything about it i actually see proof of it it just i

672
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:34,940
fucking go insane it's it's something i don't know how to upsell well i don't want to i don't

673
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:40,140
want like i don't want you to like fucking i don't know like like trying no no i i'll i'm okay with

674
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:47,340
talking about it a little bit it's just i don't really know how to to explain like what is it about

675
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:53,260
like i've been doing it for a while now so certain things i've learned and i've just come to accept

676
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,180
and i'm not sure which is like the most interesting part the most interesting part to me is that you

677
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:05,740
are in the industry and that is cool all this yes the pcp has built up a culture of anti-industry

678
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:11,180
for good reasons and i'm not trying to say that it's squeaky clean or anything but uh when it's

679
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:16,140
when did cartoons and movies stop being cool when did you know working in bank groups and having

680
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,700
you know a budget that stopped being cool it's nice to be in the industry you know who was in the

681
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:28,780
industry fucking don bluthy you know who was in the industry ariel from my little mermaid

682
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:35,980
i'm just trying to say some good things can happen when you got two people together fun and

683
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:43,500
in fact i uh one of the times i went to a thing for like pitching an animation show

684
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:50,460
i met an old dane danish man and he said he used to work with don bluth i was like oh

685
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,460
did you say yeah i know that guy it's not really a big deal like you're not really that special

686
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,540
because like you know like i played dragon lace too so yeah and i would be the shit out of him

687
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:03,260
and left him in the in the in the sewer yeah what if um no it was just cool it was just like

688
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:09,100
we talked about stuff um but i'm like such as idiot that i didn't think to make a connection

689
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:14,300
with him and i don't know anything about like how to contact him but you know it's one of those

690
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,580
things just one of those industry things when you're a fucking idiot and you don't have an

691
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:22,860
imdb that you look at you know it's not really a big deal you want to go and shave my balls

692
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,460
what's the thing what's the thing where like all the business people have an account and

693
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:31,100
linkedin yeah i should i should be looking at a linkedin i should be doing that

694
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,540
hippo are you gonna you have you're gonna have an imdb you're gonna have an imdb

695
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,220
and it's gonna be your writing credits oh you're gonna be a real human

696
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,020
oh the show you're gonna be on is hippocrit show like deceased

697
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:57,500
yes oh god please don't do that if it comes out don't add hippocrit to it just please don't do

698
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:03,820
that it will be funny but don't oh i cannot wait for you to get james gunned i cannot wait for you

699
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:08,140
to get james gunned down where you uh are you successful screenwriter and you make and you

700
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:14,860
make gardens galaxy three and uh then then then the the the uppers at disney see the hippocrit

701
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:20,780
show and see like i hate mud that's a terror that's a terrible substance and texture deleted

702
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:27,180
they're gonna fire you it's gonna have to happen to all of us none of us are clean we're all

703
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,180
gonna go a little bit of mud on us because i want to get into like major specifics and i don't want to

704
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:38,220
like like spoil or also like break contract or whatever i don't want to i don't want to deal

705
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:44,300
in trouble with it's not about like breaking contracts it's just like the more i talk about it

706
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:51,820
the more it becomes a thing in people's minds and if it just falls through at some point i will

707
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:58,060
have nothing and people will be like oh so i don't want i you know i i'm just being cautious about

708
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:06,300
it i understand that makes sense however fuck off and i want more but after so your your brother's

709
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:14,780
making video games and he's a coder yes he is a coder he is a unity uh 3d man uh he's very very

710
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:19,580
smart always has been smart for his age probably because he hung around with me who was years

711
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:24,540
older and therefore like when he went to school this is this has always been funny to me where he

712
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:29,660
would like talk to me about like philosophical things that i was having when i was whatever age

713
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:35,740
i was he brought those like thoughts into his younger class and nobody fucking got it and

714
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:42,220
everyone was stupid and he said guys my people in my class suck and it's been like that forever

715
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,460
like he's just smarter than everyone around him so he's calling munchie is that what you're trying

716
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,060
to say yeah he's basically my munchie that i have created he's just been giving him some

717
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:54,380
intellectual rare candies all his life you know you know that that's really cool you know brothers

718
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:58,060
are coder hey tom do you know if there's a free podcast on the internet so that someone could

719
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,220
listen to an original like i don't know uh learn code let me let me let me just think

720
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:08,540
i think there's one called uh uh killing code i think i think that's what's called

721
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,740
that that might be one i hate one of the on the host on there he just streams and doesn't

722
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:19,100
actually have any insight it's really funny i like that podcast it's pretty it's pretty good

723
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,740
there's only one episode right i listened to the first one there's two there's two i haven't

724
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:29,020
know some of the second one yet uh can i be on sometime and brag about slime oids that's not

725
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:34,860
no you can't and just talk about all the coding i did that's that's very that's a very talk about

726
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,620
all the things that i talk about all the things that i learned you have to buy the book that we're

727
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:44,620
going through and you have to talk about what we're doing in the book uh yeah but i look i look

728
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:50,860
look it's an educational buy the book i don't go buy the book okay i'm i'm i'm a cowboy i'm in the

729
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:56,380
wild west of coding python i mean i understand that's what i was doing with gd scripts and then

730
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:03,100
munchie like corralled me into being uh uh uh educated he's he's sinking his college bound

731
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:08,700
teeth into my brain and getting me to like buy a book and use curriculum it's crazy i don't even

732
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:14,140
know what's going on it's totally different it's almost like being taught you know is is less painful

733
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:19,980
and more engaging and educational than just trying bullshit and just making hackneyed code

734
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:25,980
i don't know if i agree though i had i think i i i the reason i wanted to do this podcast

735
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,860
is because there were fundamentals that i did ignore and it was going to bite me in the ass

736
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:36,380
but i will say it is way more fun to just open up g'dow and like all right how do i make this

737
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:44,060
character move and just start googling until he starts moving then to uh do a plus b in parentheses

738
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:50,140
and finish yeah it's uh worth mentioning my brother went to like coding uh university course

739
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:55,820
and he passed and is is good um but he's still like regularly when he needs specific information

740
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:00,380
will google a tutorial about how to do something i mean like that's what a lot of our comment section

741
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:06,780
on the podcast so far has been is like you have to as soon as possible abandon your your uh book

742
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,700
and just go out into the wild because that's the way you're actually going to learn how to code

743
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:16,620
sure i'm not saying that you don't learn by experience i'm just saying it's good to know

744
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:21,020
where to start it's good to have both yeah you gotta have the fundamentals i would not know

745
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:26,940
what the fuck to google if i didn't have this book and just like all right like how to code

746
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:30,700
python there would be like an there would be like an hour long youtube video about it

747
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:36,540
and that would just be some fucking schmuck explain things there is yeah there's um when i was

748
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:42,860
when i tried to learn i go like the like the first time when i when i tried to um

749
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,340
when i was when when endless war was just a twinkle in my eye and i went and tried to learn

750
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:53,020
the right way i found yeah these these youtube videos called uh automate the boring stuff with

751
01:07:53,020 --> 01:08:00,060
python which turns out i actually found that book lying around my house like later yeah

752
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:05,740
turns out that like those youtube lessons were like the guy who wrote the book sort of delivering

753
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:11,980
the first couple chapters of his book via youtube video um but i didn't get anywhere very fast with

754
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:18,940
that it was too basic and it was too slow um i probably if i had not been in a hurry i maybe

755
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:25,260
could have stuck with it i do i like i like just sort of googling shit and just like learning

756
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:29,340
like that's kind of how i do most things i just google shit and i just whatever i want to do i just

757
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:35,100
look around and try and figure out just how to do this one thing and it's all very willy nilly

758
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:41,980
and nonsense and it's it's pretty fun but i definitely have gaps i definitely have gaps in

759
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:50,140
my knowledge like um i don't know i i was talking to you earlier we were looking at the um we're

760
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:56,540
looking at the database and like he he like knew all the like for me to debug something i just have

761
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:02,380
to like make a change to the code run the program see what it does and then try and like figure out

762
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:09,020
why did it do that he had like strats he like typed something in so that like the the the fucking

763
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:15,500
my sql thing would spit out like a result explaining like what happened when the code is run

764
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:20,780
which is like i don't know what how'd you do that um would probably be helpful for me to know

765
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:25,660
right and i don't that that's that's the that's why i wanted to start that's why i stopped doing gd

766
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:31,180
script and decided to do the podcast of munchies because like there i got to the point where the

767
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:35,660
my lack of the fundamentals were compounding upon themselves and causing more issues and

768
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:41,500
like i had to go back like i could have kept going forward and like fucking like just like duct taped

769
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,540
all my code together and it would have worked but i could see like the scope of my project was like

770
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:54,380
if i keep going this way it will eventually jenga all over my my ui and destroy my code forever so

771
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:59,260
i had to go back i had to turn around i had to abandon all the cool stuff about like getting

772
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,580
attack animations and physics calculations and all this cool shit i had to go back and i had to do

773
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:09,340
a plus b in brackets uh declare variables and be like i guess i gotta learn how this basic

774
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:16,700
baby stuff works so i can go build the real shit and that's where we are right now yeah to me it's

775
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:23,900
it's like i don't even know how i could possibly like just start i mean i guess that's how he started

776
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:28,620
doing drawing right like i didn't have a good book to teach me how to draw i just started putting

777
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:33,820
pencil paper and eventually i got good but i don't think it's a stretch to say maybe if not i had a

778
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:38,460
book but you know if there was an art class at my school probably would have got better

779
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,860
way faster and way less hardship in the beginning it's interesting you say that much because i can

780
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:47,820
explain exactly what would happen if you had just done what i did because i did it um the part we're

781
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:55,020
at in the book right now where we're talking about uh functions and arguments you know uh i was just

782
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:59,980
following tutorials on how to make a platformer in godot and they would just tell you to type

783
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:05,900
these functions and i had no idea what a function is uh i just typed it out and i didn't understand

784
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,740
what arguments were because they they just assume in these videos i was watching that you know what

785
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,580
an argument is because you know how to program right wink wink and i was like no i'm just copying

786
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:18,540
what you did wink wink so like i would just get to the point they'd be like you gotta put these

787
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:23,020
arguments in i'm like why what is the point of an argument why is this happening here i don't

788
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,500
understand i'm just copying what you're saying and i understand what it does but i don't understand

789
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,660
why it does it and i was getting to the point where i would like stop following the tutorials

790
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:36,060
because the tutorial i was following the dude had a kid and just abandoned the thing mid mid like

791
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:41,340
thing so like there's no more band in the kid yeah he just abandoned the kid and kept making

792
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:46,300
coding videos for me specifically because i PMed him and he decided to keep going no so the the

793
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,140
series ended i was like well now what i do so then i like started watching another tutorial that was

794
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:55,020
like how to make a zelda clone i was trying to reverse engineer like the code from that to put

795
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:59,820
it into a platformer and i did figure out like wall collisions and stuff and i felt like a god

796
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:05,820
but eventually it was just like i still don't know what a function is i just know yeah so it's like i

797
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:12,620
gotta go back i gotta go back so like you just understand what and not why and uh it becomes a

798
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:20,540
problem i remember like coding coding like little games on multimedia fusion 2 and there was like

799
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:27,980
easy code for babies where um they spoke in in plain english like if character touches side of

800
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:35,020
screen stop movement so like they can't go off the screens like okay now i understand code um of

801
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:39,980
course i didn't but like they have these these other things which were like completely alien to me

802
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:44,140
and i didn't google them because i didn't know what google was because i didn't care enough to try

803
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:52,220
um like and gates and or gates and x or gates and things that are like the basic fundamentals of

804
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:59,580
like uh computer chips and like electronic pulses going around uh computer chips to just determine

805
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:09,260
whether something should go on or off and that's like that's uh it's hard that's that's hard to do

806
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:15,740
that's too fundamental i mean yeah but like i i i really enjoy understanding the fundamentals

807
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:21,820
because like watching my brother code he's doing all this fancy stuff and i ask him uh how like what

808
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:27,500
he's doing uh affects the thing and he'll give me some sort of explanation and i was like okay so

809
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:32,700
and then i like translate what he's doing into english that i can understand he's like yes that's

810
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:41,580
how it works i'm like sick like i love i love translating code um speak into uh like human

811
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:50,700
words like when this happens that happens oh i get it that's cool see man i am straight up telling you

812
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:56,860
miracles it's like all right computers right what the fuck miracles is what

813
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:04,220
that's how i feel every day in coding miracle in a box exactly it's magic

814
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,060
that's all needs to be said dude we're gonna be wizards that's the whole point of learning code

815
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,220
mage do you have like uh tuberculosis what is wrong with your car

816
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:24,140
uh i i don't know what's wrong with my car uh it's i have phlegm in my lungs i guess gross

817
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:30,860
how much are you selling that for oh that's not an ooh that's good that's good stuff right there

818
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:36,540
but it's like that's like that's slime adjacent that's slime adjacent that's slime adjacent that

819
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:41,740
that would go for like twelve dollars per pint oh my god no don't make this weird

820
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:47,100
weird time i just talked about your phlegm on the podcast look i'll DM you after the podcast

821
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:55,100
we can just we can discuss rates uh fucking getting colds during the the winter times it

822
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:02,620
always happens always i don't think i'm quite over mine it's my yearly tradition i step outside for

823
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:09,100
one second and i catch a cold and i die every single year oh no i did not get a cold this

824
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:15,100
season but something happened to me my one night i just slept on my head weird or something

825
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:21,260
and like the next day my neck hurt and it has not and it's just my neck hurt for like a week

826
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:25,980
it's kind of going away now it's kind of it's i can kind of i don't know i've had that but for

827
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:31,420
like two years it's the white thing i'm trying to imagine like a like a neck thing like you know

828
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:36,780
you'd folded your neck like forwards onto your chest and you were sleeping for a chest down

829
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:42,700
and your head was completely folded in on itself was like i just don't know what happened i think

830
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:47,660
i just like slept with my head like turned a little too far to the side and pulled a muscle

831
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:53,180
or something yeah i think that happened to me as well i i had to change pillows honestly because

832
01:15:53,180 --> 01:16:01,660
apparently my pillow was too hard so i had to buy a new one it just kept i just kept the muscles in

833
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:06,460
my head kept getting sore and i just couldn't sleep and it was just awful it was awful i used to i

834
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:14,060
used to have a bed that was way too fucking soft and every day i my back hurt i would wake up in

835
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:19,900
my fucking back hurt and i was like i you'd think that a soft bed is like good for you like it's like

836
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:24,860
gentle it's like gentle it's like gentle on your body you know it's like oh i just like like laying

837
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:31,420
on a cloud no it fucking killed me it killed me and it ruined my life um oh no and now i sleep on

838
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:39,180
fucking stone slab you know now i sleep in a coffin and it's red you sleep on a stone slab

839
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:44,940
and then i stab you through the heart and you ascend to god tier yeah this sleep discussion

840
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:50,380
being dangerously close to dream discussion oh if i like the way mage did this on purpose

841
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:56,700
no no you were the one who brought it up i wasn't gonna mention any dreams you you heck heck all of

842
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:02,620
you were trying to you were trying to whoa whoa foul language she's bringing the hex hex

843
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:10,140
hex on upon you the heckles the shekels for the heckles and the shekels for the heck i need to be

844
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:14,140
on that show again i came up with the name of the show i need to i need to be i need to take

845
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:20,220
my you know i've only been on the first one i keep missing all the other ones i've been on two uh

846
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:25,260
do we do them like every sunday i don't know when we do them that's why i keep missing like we started

847
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:29,900
doing them every sunday but i think we've like gotten bad no it wasn't every sunday it was like

848
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:37,340
every other sunday oh okay then i guess it's not as bad as i thought yeah that's all within industry

849
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:42,540
guidelines then if people want to see me play dark souls with restrictions that was the last one that

850
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:48,620
was pretty fun i want to i want to continue that one i really really want to be on the shekels for

851
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:55,260
heckles but i'm never i never it's it's always poor timing for me aren't you like up all night

852
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:02,540
aren't you like a nocturnal vampire sometimes but sometimes i i have to do things and i cannot

853
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:08,540
part time vampire i don't know if i buy that i'm pretty sure i've been on every shekels for

854
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:12,540
heckles and let me just tell you you're not really missing out on anything it's like it's just like

855
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:20,540
that's because i'm not there to make it good uh i i think it's pretty fun i like it i just i just

856
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:27,100
want to hang out with you guys and maybe heckle someone for the game no no well you would have to

857
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:32,460
get in the chat okay so that the concept of the show mage is that people pay in super chats to

858
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:38,380
insult us that's where the shekels for heckles come from they give us money to insult us so you

859
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:46,380
want to be in the chat and pay us money to insult them oh no i mean someone has to read out the

860
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:51,580
heckles right you can't you can't you can't heckle for free but we're not obligated to feel bad about

861
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:57,580
yeah yeah yeah we're only obligated to feel bad about the ones people pay for i i will say that

862
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:02,300
yeah i also have people who have to read out the heckles right so that's true if you want to be

863
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,700
the heckle announcer all right you could you could be that yeah that's true yeah you could do that

864
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:12,380
stream is definitely feel closer to talking to like a normal person in real life they definitely

865
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:20,140
feel like less performative than a podcast right so being on a being on a stream feels exactly

866
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:26,700
like being on a pcp to me oh it feels way less responsibility to me because streams are just

867
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:31,820
by definition terrible just that's just part of the whole kid in caboodle of streaming is that i don't

868
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:39,580
there's like a terrible as in like like name a good like okay give me a stream that you were like

869
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:45,580
wow fucking great stream dude i want to name me a fucking podcast where you felt the same i wanted

870
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:50,940
to say i have games but i am games is a bad stream uh so there is the last there are some

871
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:57,740
pcp episodes and i'm like wow fucking home run great job keep it up there are moments in streams

872
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:04,220
that are just like yeah but they're fucking seven hours of bullshit and you get i think hippos

873
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:10,860
are totally on the money that a podcast is has the same problem in that it's just long content

874
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,620
and it's long content and sometimes there's something really funny and sometimes people get

875
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:20,620
ziggiegles completely disagree i mean i mean and the same thing can happen on a stream it just feels

876
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:26,860
a little less like you know i mean even i feel like the the lack of responsibility is what causes a

877
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:33,100
lot of the funniest moments in a stream sure but i if you want to like to get the good much

878
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:38,140
well streams have streams have a big like cut it out from there streams have a big leg up on

879
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:43,820
podcasts and that streams have the jar streams have the fucking jar all right which is a miracle

880
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:49,740
did you did you turned off the jar because he thought it looked bad and i'm just like you're

881
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:53,660
doing everything he thought we thought what he thought the aesthetic of the jar looked bad and

882
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:58,540
i'm like you're missing the point here's here's a thing i don't understand i see like every now

883
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:02,620
and then i pop on twitch and like i'm following maybe like you know i'm following a bunch of

884
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,820
like artists and stuff that i just followed in a way i'm like hey this person looks all right i'll

885
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:11,740
follow him maybe you'll check out a stream once in a while and everyone's got the jar

886
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:19,660
and like tiny like tiny in a corner that you can barely see it it has it looks like a little tip jar

887
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:27,100
like my streams like i said like my screen does not fill up my my my twitch stream generally so

888
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:33,020
i'll usually have like a big black space on the sides so i use that black space that's there

889
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:39,580
anyway and i put the giant fucking jar there and it's so fucking cool because people will like pour

890
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,700
in like you know one cent bits they'll fill up the jar with ones and bits and then someone will

891
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:48,140
subscribe and it's like an event like the stream like everyone is like focus it's like a it's like

892
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:54,300
an event when someone drops like a a sub or like a like a thousand bit you know bit piece in there

893
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:59,100
and it all just like crashes into it and sends it all like spewing out because it's like squirting

894
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,660
it out because of how heavy it is just squishing it down and sending it all flying it's it's a it's

895
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:09,660
a it's a tree man what what if you you made like like it's gotta be big which was like the goblet

896
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:14,220
of fire from harry potter but it was just the jar in the middle of the screen with like some some

897
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:21,820
like a pedestal wait and people would put their name into the jar of fire i've i've got it i just

898
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:27,660
had i just had you've given me a wonderful idea because i have been pushing for it i'm almost at

899
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:35,580
a thousand subscribers on uh you know twitch.tv slash thousand subscribers or not subscribers

900
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:40,140
i was gonna say holy shit dude you're loaded as fuck yeah that'd be a lot of money that'd be a

901
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:47,100
lot of money i'm almost a five grand a month easy and i've been um well twitch takes a cut but

902
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:53,500
whatever um so they would be and i and i've been and i've said like when i hit a thousand i'm gonna

903
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:59,740
do a 24 hour you know stream to celebrate and i don't but i don't know what i'm gonna do on it

904
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:03,660
i've been thinking i thought it'd be funny if i did like a 24 hour maple story stream or like i

905
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:07,260
did it i did a really long stream of hollow knight and i've got lots of hollow on it maybe

906
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:10,940
because you do 24 hours of hollow knight and i haven't decided i don't exactly know what

907
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:17,820
but what if i just did a 24 hour jar stream where it's just the jar and we just watch the jar and

908
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:25,340
comment on the various comings and goings that occur in the jar case in point that podcasts are

909
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:33,020
objectively superior to streams no find me one fucking person who prefers rck streams the episodes

910
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:41,580
one person um anyone well leave a comment literally one person

911
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,940
you know what i'll bet there will be oh but there's actually plenty i mean we don't get

912
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:52,940
as many views on the streams uh all all the feedback it's funny like thousands of people

913
01:23:52,940 --> 01:24:01,820
watch the rfck videos but like 50 to like 70 tops show up to watch the streams and i don't know if

914
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:07,100
it's just like a timing thing right like it just seems like viewer numbers like the numbers are just

915
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:14,140
lower on twitch across the board and that's like i mean the the obvious like uh advantage of a video

916
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:19,340
rather than a live broadcast is that you can watch it at your leisure you can pause it you can come

917
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:24,060
back to it that's why i mean you can you can watch that you can watch the twitch vod is no one does

918
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:30,540
you like they're all why you put no one does that i know no one does it but like you can do it just

919
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:36,780
as easily it's i just like the site isn't set up to like funnel people into doing that the site is

920
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:41,420
set up to get people to watch people live and like the archive videos are sort of an afterthought

921
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:46,620
that's there but like the twitch doesn't want to acknowledge them the only feedback we ever get

922
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:51,900
on streams is either wow pretty good for a stream or wow wish you would record more in episodes

923
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:59,100
those are like the that's not we get four like the streams themselves we know i i mean yeah

924
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,540
nobody ever says that on a stream nobody ever says wow wish you would record more episodes people

925
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:09,100
are there there's not as many of them but there's but they're super engaged and they're super

926
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,700
they're fucking like interacting with like the community like yeah it's it's it's i mean it's

927
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:21,580
got its own it's its own thing like we couldn't rfck as it exists now would not exist if it was

928
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:32,140
if there were no streams so so there i think i don't how i guess okay we we we review the contest

929
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:40,140
on stream that's that's pretty connected but like and and you know we we talk about the game

930
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:47,180
on stream but like i don't think that's really anyone's major source of like a gaming news

931
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:52,140
or anything based on in the swore i think that's anyone's like main way to interact with the

932
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:57,100
discord server i don't think besides we would have to find a new way to review the contest

933
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:03,500
or and you need to you know like spotlight slam times but i don't think that would like if streams

934
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:09,180
were to just like disappear like the fanno gets fanno snapped i don't think there would be like

935
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:13,820
maybe there might be a handful of people who drop off you know the the bandwagon but i think it would

936
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:19,500
continue chugging along just as fine as it did before i don't think there's a lot of people

937
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:24,860
maybe it wouldn't i mean it wouldn't it wouldn't like die it wouldn't like die without i'm not saying

938
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:29,900
that it would die without oh my god it's christmas i forgot i was gonna talk about christmas in a

939
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:35,420
few days it will be christmas day i always i think that i love christmas you'll be watching this after

940
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:40,140
christmas day you don't get to do this you don't get to just cut in here and in the stream conversation

941
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:45,260
i'm actually i'm actually i'm actually done i'm actually very grateful you guys have talked about

942
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,700
rowdy focus cop killers a lot no yeah we have no yeah the thing that you said before was not true

943
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:56,940
when you said it munchie but it has become no this is not an rck thing this is not like an rck like

944
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:02,700
like like specific problem i just hate streams i think they're meandering i think they're all bad

945
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:08,220
and i hate them i don't know how you can possibly say that podcasts are just as bad when like

946
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:15,180
overwhelmingly podcasts are shorter and they are besides ours usually edited and usually more

947
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:21,740
entertaining i don't know i podcast who edits the podcasts what do you mean what do you mean by

948
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:27,820
this why why would you edit a game why would you edit a game there's always not paying attention

949
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:32,300
it's all it's just reading chat chats are a fucking curse i hate the chats on streams no no

950
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:37,260
no you that's not i'm asking why would why do people edit podcasts isn't the point of podcasts

951
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:43,260
to make the audio look or sound all right no no not like oh my fucking god they edit it

952
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:49,180
so they can edit out topics that weren't that interesting i imagine much better the pcb if

953
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:55,180
we did that there would be no pcb if we did that there wouldn't be any videos the the problem with

954
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:02,460
that specifically is that we're a rotating cast and um everybody will have different things to say

955
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:08,220
and a lot of the time running jokes come go from topic to topic so like cutting out a topic is not

956
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:13,820
as easy as it would be on a two-person show well i'm not which is why i'm not trying to advocate

957
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:19,340
my point is not to get the pcb to edit a podcast i'm not that's not what i meant i'm just saying

958
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:25,900
there's all right almost universally more effort put in well i love podcasts but i think streams

959
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:30,540
are cool i don't know what you're talking about i want to talk about they're all they're always

960
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:34,620
they're always born in meandering there's never i want to talk about i want to talk about i want

961
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:41,100
to talk about christmas now fine and how much i hate it and how much i think i like christmas

962
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:46,060
until it happens and then we get close to christmas and i'm like oh yeah lights snow i like the

963
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:51,340
aesthetic and then actual christmas then it comes for your wallet you're like this is the worst

964
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:57,580
and it's like tomorrow and i'm like oh god damn it fuck i don't want to fucking go like don't make

965
01:28:57,580 --> 01:29:04,700
me go don't make me go jesus why did you do this to me listen i don't want to like you know be that

966
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:10,140
guy who's like oh fuck my family you know it's so annoying at them you know i like my family but i

967
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:16,700
just want to say you know what we all know is the case if we didn't have family obligations we would

968
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:23,020
never hang out with our family on christmas never agreed agreed of course um no i don't

969
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:30,780
agree with that yeah but like that's because uh your family sounds pretty good it sounds it is

970
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:36,860
you got a programming brother and a cool dad that's what i know about the one the one good thing

971
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:42,060
that's gonna happen this christmas is that my mom is gonna trade me her shiny swab blue

972
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:49,180
i'm gonna have a lucky shiny swab blue i'm gonna evolve it into ulteria and i've decided i thought

973
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:55,020
long and hard i thought long and hard i considered many names for a shiny a shiny ulteria and i almost

974
01:29:55,020 --> 01:30:00,700
went with dawn but i think i'm gonna go with glory i'm gonna call it glory it's gonna be the coolest

975
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:07,980
thing ever and that's it that's what i'm gonna call my one pearly gates i i like my family don't

976
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:12,540
get me wrong i'm not saying this is like a like i'm so annoyed by my family that i have to spend

977
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:17,900
time with them like oh mom i just want to play my nintendo switch i just this is the reason

978
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:23,260
why halloween is great is because you could it's a holiday which is fun in and of itself it's fun

979
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:26,620
to be festive every once in a while and you can hang there's no you know you're not gonna go to

980
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:31,420
your fucking parents for halloween it's not the type of holiday you can just hang out with your friends

981
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:37,340
and you know eat black eyes while while watching an iam game stream or being online that's all

982
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:42,700
you have to do in halloween what's a black guy uh what we were fed by digi and me it's a meatball

983
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:52,300
with olive on it oh those are weird but for christmas i okay you know i don't mind going over to my

984
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,900
families you know you know have christmas day you know open presents or whatever but i really just

985
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:02,060
want to i i what i want to do they just want to hang out with ben and tom at digi's house

986
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:06,940
well digi's not there and just make a muck out of the place that's what i wanted that's what i'm

987
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:12,220
looking forward to you know yeah it's gonna be fun to be with old people you know it'll be nice to

988
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:18,540
catch up but like that's not what i'm about that's not what i want to do on the lord's day well i think

989
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:23,740
part of that might be because you also have thanksgiving which is exactly the same thing

990
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:29,660
hey and that and that's kind of close by we don't have that so like this is the family time of the

991
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:35,740
year i look forward to i already did i already did think i already did thanksgiving a month ago

992
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:41,580
i'm sick of it i'm fucking sick of it i want to i want to i want to state my opinion as to why

993
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:47,500
i like christmas do you understand there i want to complain about something well you can go on

994
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:55,020
first yeah i like i like i like christmas a lot because um i am not a fan of winter i snow

995
01:31:55,020 --> 01:32:00,620
is aesthetically pleasing but there's not a lot of snow in the uk uh regardless it's like it's

996
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:09,900
damp it's dark it's cold it's windy it's not my kind of season and it's absolutely dreary and sad

997
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:15,900
and christmas when christmas comes around everyone decorates with shiny bright lights

998
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:22,140
and then there's happy holiday music playing as annoying and obnoxious as it is like i can't say

999
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:30,860
i hate it um and it's just like the whole place everywhere i go it's all just like bright and

1000
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:37,180
shiny and happy and all lit up everyone's in the mood and it's just i like how christmas looks i

1001
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:43,500
like i like being outside on christmas i like that whole part of it 100 what always hits me though

1002
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:49,020
it's like straight after the new year is at least in the fainia and i guess in uk as well straight

1003
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:54,220
after a new year is like all the festivities and everyone takes down their decorations and

1004
01:32:54,220 --> 01:33:00,140
be back to the mundane and then i realize how absolutely sad and quiet and dreary the rest of

1005
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:06,220
the winter is because like nothing nothing of importance or significance or festive happens

1006
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:13,820
up until like i don't know spring and i mean you got valentine's day that's everybody loves valentine's

1007
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:22,140
to heck with it it's still in all i guess it's february so now that's not spring but you know it's

1008
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:29,420
still like a whole a whole month of nothing and except for sadness and sockiness and it's just

1009
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:34,940
it's really sad and and and i miss christmas during that month see mage the interesting thing that

1010
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:40,780
is like you're missing the american perspective right because in america what happens is that uh

1011
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:46,060
there's there's nothing like that we've we've all realized that this is a problem and we did

1012
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:51,580
what we always do to solve problems in america which is throw consumerism at it so and in america

1013
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:56,060
as soon as halloween's over it's instantly christmas the next day until christmas and then once

1014
01:33:56,060 --> 01:34:01,420
christmas over it's valentine's day but the post the post the post christmas the post christmas

01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:17,660

1017
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:24,140

1018
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:30,460

1019
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:37,180

1020
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:43,500
winter and that's exactly how i feel every single moment i'm out in the cold which is to say

1028
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:35,980
um i don't go outside enough the weather seasons like you go outside and after it's rained it has

1029
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:40,700
this very specific smell that's true yeah yeah but that's like a little bit different i can like

1030
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:45,180
seasons have their own specific smells like i go outside and i can smell winter and it's like

1031
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:50,700
this crisp fresh air and it's it's so good well i don't smell that but i do feel that

01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:57,420
like like i can feel it on my skin like ah yes that's that's like sharp but not quite sharp enough

1033
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:02,540
to cut me and draw blood i think i know what you're talking about i have a terrible sense of smell

01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:07,580
and my nose is constantly plugged up and my life is terrible we don't want to know why i have a high

1035
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:12,540
pitched voice it's not because i'm naturally gay though that it does play into it just my nose

1067
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:33,660
look man my the status of my metabolism is everybody's business but my um ben just comes

01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:50,780
fours and just beg for it but i'm not gonna do it ben i'm gonna say you you either you either die

1071
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:55,980
heroes live long enough to yourself stop keto that's what you're doing this is a slippery slope

1072
01:39:55,980 --> 01:40:00,700
and you're about to abandon all that you care for just to get a fucking croissant he already did he

1073

i ate like one fucking starburst yeah we're some artisan some artisan candy you handed

1077
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:29,340
guys guys speaking of candy at one point like in aziz store like they were stocking like those huge

1078
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,820
actual marshmallows that you like put on a stick and over a fireplace and i bought them and they

1079
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:38,380
were delicious and they don't sell them anymore and i was like this was my one chance and thankfully

1080
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:42,940
i took this chance and i had those marshmallows and they were great how how big are we talking

1081
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:49,740
really big like a like a like a like a like i don't know like a tennis bowl i guess someone like a

1082
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:56,140
tennis huh okay these are huge the the hugest marshmallows you say that really say that again

1083
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:04,700
say that again huge no i didn't have the magic you're exhaling at the time it was once in a lifetime

1084
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:08,780
it's one we've got to move on yeah you cut it on tape though so you can read it's true we can

1085
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:14,700
relive that on at our leisure yeah yeah are we doing questions are we doing voicemails voicemail

1086
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:21,820
time yeah it's voicemail right now all right all right all right speaking of being a shit person

1087
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:29,660
we've got some fucking asshole doing something terrible he's trying to make his cat vegan let's

1088
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:35,420
listen to this no i call to get your input on a grave moral quandary you see i'm shifting into

1089
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:40,140
veganism because i feel uncomfortable making the moral distinction between animals we keep as pets

1090
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:45,340
and those who are born into factory farms loser you say that i love animals but among the animals

1091
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:50,540
that i love is the house cat an obligate carnivore whose nutritional needs are only supplemented by

1092
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:55,260
animal products additionally according to the 10 seconds of research i've put into the subject

1093
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:59,900
most commercially available vegan cat foods do a horrible job of fulfilling their dietary needs

1094
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:05,580
and are very unhealthy and harmful for the cat in 100 years when the revolutionaries overthrow

1095
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:10,300
the meat industry and the world is tossed into utter vegan chaos will probably create an appropriate

1096
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:15,420
substitute but for now i'm reminded of the vilification of goblins as a race that can only

1097
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:21,180
how long is this voicemail making them an objectively evil force and forced to grapple

1098
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:26,140
with the question do i deny my convictions and therefore justify any act that goes against

1099
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:32,300
my moral convictions including murder or do i embrace my utilitarian doing and strangle my

1100
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:36,860
sister's cat for the greater good all right here's the deal if animals can't be vegan

1101
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:47,740
if you're if you have a pet if you own a pet and it needs to eat human flesh and you're not okay

1102
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:53,340
with giving it human flesh then you shouldn't have that pet don't kill it obviously just give it to

1103
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:58,140
someone else wait who said it needs to eat human flesh well i'm just making a metaphor comparison

1104
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:03,420
like like other people can relate to the idea of not feeding their pet human flesh if it needs

1105
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:10,780
that here here's the fucking deal dude cats again as you said are carnivores you you cannot get them

1106
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:19,500
fucking some kitschy quirky vegan cat food that will kill them and fuck them up don't do it you

1107
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:26,380
absolute idiot so the only choices are to get rid of that cat through either murder or through

1108
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:33,500
trading bartering but but or to just kill yourself if you if which is if you if you own a cat and you

1109
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:39,500
feed it meat you are contributing to the meat industry that's what he said like he has to

1110
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:44,060
choose between his ideals and his cat he's really he's really struck on something important here

1111
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:49,660
give the cat to a good loving home that they won't that will actually care about them yeah exactly

1112
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:55,180
or just or just put it outside and close but here's but here's the thing if you can if you give the

1113
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:59,500
cat and close the door if you give the cat to somebody else you're also contributing to the

1114
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:04,380
meat industry because you're enabling the sales of meat products to continue well why don't you

1115
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:08,220
just shoot everybody in the fucking so that's what i'm saying vegans need to just kill everybody

1116
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:16,540
or kill themselves stop thinking about it this but if you own the cat but if you own the cat you're

1117
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:21,660
and and you don't want to help the meat industry you are you are being complicit by your cat ownership

1118
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:26,060
in in all right perpetuate this wasn't even a real question why are we giving it an answer

1119
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:30,940
this guy was obviously trolling all of us and we're following okay here's the real i think it's

1120
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:38,140
a real i have more i foolishly have more faith in our audience than that okay i don't know like i'm

1121
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:42,700
trying to say made a goblin slayer google vegan cat food and give it to your cat because it's a bad

1122
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:49,180
idea and don't do it and also yeah i think i think the takeaway here that i believe is probably true

1123
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:52,860
is that if you don't believe in the meat industry and you're not willing to support it i don't think

1124
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:57,500
you can own a cat yeah i mean you have to find unless you're gonna like unless you're gonna

1125
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:01,100
like be catching mice for it or whatever and feeding it to you so unless you're gonna do like

1126
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:05,660
grass roots cat but that's like that seems like even worse let's let it be an out there just let

1127
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:11,100
it be an outdoor cat and hunt for itself cats do that true yeah that's true hey just invite rats

1128
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:15,980
into your house i'll be the first thing to do is is that one of the reasons i don't think it's

1129
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:19,660
there's probably not the only reason but one of the reason he stayed for being a vegan so he doesn't

1130
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:25,260
like that there's no difference between the animals that are like house pets and the ones that are

1131
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:32,780
being killed on mass and i don't know i guess i don't understand like why that's weird for some

1132
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:38,380
animals we just like more like i don't think humans like like cows that much you think they're cute

1133
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:44,380
it's like dogs are smarter than dogs generally we kill pigs and we don't kill dogs the the biggest

1134
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:49,900
problem i have with this line of thinking is the idea that animals are a group that have

1135
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:56,060
anything to do with one another like we group them together as animals uh for convenience and

1136
01:45:56,060 --> 01:46:02,540
we invented that group to say that all animals deserve rights is like all like all animals

1137
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:09,180
deserve the same treatment is like saying all things like you could you could extrapolate it

1138
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:14,700
further and further to late to two other things some people actually do it to like plants as well

1139
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:19,660
and then they die instantly because there's nothing they can eat right i mean that is the

1140
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:26,060
closer to meat than plants i heard that interesting is that that must be why they're so delicious

1141
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:35,820
i'm saying okay listen i'm doing i'm i'm i'm on tape being pro animal however i'll maybe that

1142
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:40,620
weird if you ate a dog i mean you know people know i would eat a dog if you offered me if you

1143
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:46,940
offered me some dog i would eat it it that's why why is that weird mage i'm not trying to be edgy

1144
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:52,300
here why is that why is that i know i know it's it's kind of like a i know when you think about

1145
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:56,700
it it's a bit of a double standard yada yada i don't know i don't like thinking about eating dogs

1146
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:01,900
though it's like it's i once saw like a show that like i think it's like an extreme factor and like

1147
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:06,940
all you had to do was like eat an egg but then the egg was an unborn little baby duck or something

1148
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:14,220
and it's a delicacy somewhere and i just i couldn't stomach it it's just well the like i said it before

1149
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:19,340
like pigs pigs pigs are smarter than dogs and they're like they're they're like more

1150
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:25,900
fucking emotional and like until intellectual and are just like cerebrally better and more

1151
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:31,100
complete as beings than dogs are just but because they're ugly you know we think it's

1152
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:36,060
we think it's gross to kill a dog and eat it but we just fucking have a lot of dogs doing

1153
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:42,220
i think it's just because it's not fair it's bullshit it is not fair um i i support dog

1154
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:51,900
treating animals well before like it's even i mean i don't you know the reason dogs are like

1155
01:47:51,900 --> 01:48:00,540
weird to eat uh like generally is because for millennia they were useful for us for like hunting

1156
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:06,620
and and being like a you know a friendly associate to help uh to do stuff around the

1157
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:10,380
tribal camps it's like why are you eating your gun yeah it's like it's like eating your gun

1158
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:14,060
and they don't have a lot of meat on them and they're more lean it's like why would you eat that

1159
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:19,020
when you can have this big fat fuck who's full of meat it just makes so much more sense to eat that

1160
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:24,620
guy so we do that because it's sensible we we bred pigs and cows to be well yes we are meaty

1161
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:30,220
and delicious and we bred dogs to be you know useful no yeah i mean they or whatever we'll

1162
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:35,420
start it off pretty useful in terms of like running around and stuff but like this we did all that

1163
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:41,420
stuff because it was like handy and like efficient for for everyone and then as soon as we like didn't

1164
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:47,500
need to survive we started thinking like you know like things were said in their ways dogs were now

1165
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:53,660
things that were our friends and pigs and cows we eat but now that we don't need to survive we

1166
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:59,100
don't think about like the efficiency in the we're too emotional because we can afford to be emotional

1167
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:04,460
we can afford to not live a meat eating lifestyle even though in the past that we would probably

1168
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:13,100
just starve to death this all all i'm saying is i eat pig i don't care dogs and cats dumber than

1169
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:20,540
pigs qed if i would eat a dog or a cat because it would be a hypocrite not to he here's my here's

1170
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:27,660
my deal i'm you know it's unfortunate that we are we are being so mean to these animals you know

1171
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:37,820
mean but as a human i can eat meat my ancestor ate me it's pretty human core to eat me and there's

1172
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:44,140
one thing i care about most in this world it's about being a human so you want me to stop being a human

1173
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:49,980
i'll kill you so don't ever bring me this vegan shit ever again in my fucking face if you want me

1174
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:55,260
to stop eating me and roasting over a fire kill yourself humans humans don't need me they can get

1175
01:49:55,260 --> 01:50:00,220
by without it sure they can they can they can be fine are you are you are would you say it's not

1176
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:04,780
human core go out and hunt a big wilder beast are you saying that's not human core that's pretty

1177
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:09,180
human core okay it's pretty human but you know there's there's probably lots of ways to be human

1178
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:16,780
core you know like uh uh uh raising a cornfield and plowing it with your with your uh domesticated

1179
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:21,500
ox munchy and making millet out of it is pretty human core also to play devil's advocate munchy

1180
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:27,100
what's what's more human core than going out of rate to specifically not eat you could what other

1181
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:32,220
species does that but a human you would say being vegans the most human core thing you can be

1182
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:38,940
that's fair i'm saying you know this this discussion ties right back in to my two

1183
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:43,820
essential factors of being a human it's you have to eat bread and own a dog and you know

1184
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:50,060
the two worst decisions you could make in your entire life agreed if you don't have those and

1185
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:55,340
you're not a human uh and and you know if you eat your dog you'll still be a human but you know

1186
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:59,260
what you should have owned it instead that's my feelings we're gonna play the next one no this

1187
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:06,140
guy is a little bit hard to understand but just brace yourself attention all right you know what

1188
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:12,380
you should do you should ask the fans which topics are our favorites and maybe one or twice a year

1189
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:17,900
you should do an episode we'll just talk about that a continuation of that for example i just

1190
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:26,060
love you guys rambling about how your fitness life is going what's dieting taking how i can

1191
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:33,660
improve my life for example i love that fucking nate recipe for the cereal sometimes i do this

1192
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:38,940
and i love it i just love getting fitness shit from you guys are you also really listening to the

1193
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:44,780
wrong podcast about video game experiences that you had and stuff like that so yeah just

1194
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:51,020
do a continuation of some things some things we love them guys want to hear more oh we'll be the

1195
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:58,860
best oh please do that i would love you forever i i is this ironic i can't tell no i well i mean

1196
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:08,540
i assume it isn't because uh people do like um things i i feel like this is something we could

1197
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:14,940
try and implement which is not necessarily having a hard line topic of discussion um but to have

1198
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:21,260
like little corners like in hello internet like a regular reoccurring thing that they can bring up

1199
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:28,780
we can bring up every so often relating to a specific uh topic such as fitness like ben you

1200
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:35,420
just do it um anyway you bring up keto a lot but like if people like that it could be like that's

1201
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:41,180
this will be like oh it's the food out like not the hour but like the food call like segments

1202
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:45,500
like we have played little jingles at the beginning of our segment like doing is the fuck why don't we

1203
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:51,340
do that why don't we do that why don't i have that queued up why don't i have a little keto jingle

1204
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:57,260
that i play when i fucking mention keto i can't believe i'm so fucking dumb that i haven't done

1205
01:52:57,260 --> 01:53:01,820
that already i can't i can't believe either that you have never thought about having segments like

1206
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:05,820
ben how we never listened to it before it's just that there's nothing like we can talk about

1207
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:11,260
consistently about it is your only experience with podcasts this podcast that you record

1208
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:18,540
no okay well well but not every in fact most podcasts i listen to don't have segments

1209
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:23,180
most of the podcasts i listen to have segments so it seems weird to have someone not be familiar

1210
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:30,060
with the idea i mean i am familiar with the idea as i think should be clear okay um um

1211
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:34,540
but yeah i think i think that could be be pretty cool something we should probably

1212
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:39,740
maybe we should run like a poll maybe we should i don't know have like what is your favorite

1213
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:46,700
procrastinator recurring topic or i don't know i don't like ask for that right now the number one

1214
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:52,380
result would be monchi going to college i guarantee you for the meme well no no i think nobody i think

1215
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:57,100
people are against people hate hearing about that or no maybe that's just us that hate talking

1216
01:53:57,180 --> 01:54:01,100
i hate talking about it i hate that i just brought it up right now i hate talking about it

1217
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:05,580
people tell me people would ask for comment or rules three is what is what we've had people

1218
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:10,380
already asked about okay let's do that again so i can completely not have the same opinion that i

1219
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:15,340
did last time because i completely disagree with how i thought before i mean i think i think that

1220
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:19,500
would be interesting now that the dust is settled i don't think i have anything else to say about

1221
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:24,140
it i think two is stretching it she too was stretching i think the problem with two is that

1222
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:28,060
comment or rules i talked to digi about this at one point i said comment or rules one no i think

1223
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:33,260
was monchi i said this comment or rules one was ironic and funny and we were having a good like

1224
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:37,820
joke about it i like we were like we're kind of serious but not really taha he he this is funny

1225
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:43,020
comment or rules two everyone was angry and we were like being like legit about it and i was very

1226
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:47,180
confused being on that episode because i thought it was gonna be more taha he he but it was not it

1227
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:51,500
was very much like comment or rules two was like we're drawing the lines in the sand and i was like

1228
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:56,300
i thought we were supposed to really want what do they want to drink monsters for oh

1229
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:06,380
shit monsters for baby sign me the fuck up that's a segment we got to have the monsters for a

1230
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:13,740
segment for now on every episode for ever for a segment monster ever we got we got we got to

1231
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:18,460
get we got to get we got to get six tin to make a little jingle for it or something we could have

1232
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:22,940
like a whole jingle episode or we have so many different jingles and and topic things we could

1233
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:28,780
we could have like uh the 60 second dream time when mage has to say her dream within 60 seconds

1234
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:33,660
you have yes you have 60 seconds every episode to talk your dreams and you have to cram into 60

1235
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:37,660
seconds we cut you off we ring the buzzer and and if you don't if you don't cram it and we

1236
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:43,660
boot you off the episode hey everyone it's like it's like a death rate i haven't been on the last

1237
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:49,420
couple episodes is there like a overarching like voicemail story arc of some guy going to hit on

1238
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:53,020
a girl and like he's like asking for advice something is that is that something that that

1239
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:59,340
happened a while back by one guy i mean one spark one spark so i don't know if i had a weekly thing

1240
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:05,980
going for a while okay well this is no but there was there was a guy there was a guy asking about

1241
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:12,060
like advice about how to hit on the girl or like he really wanted to date this girl and i think he

1242

because let me tell you me gene i'm the next number one fan and defender of the character of

1267
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:52,860
tommy oliver from the mighty morpher power rangers jen and it's recently come to my attention dude

1268
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:59,740
that's one of your members not only runs a channel under the name of tommy oliver but it's its legal

1269
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:08,940
name brother and he's not even a power ranger fan creator meaning toom if you are listening to this

1270
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:15,900
this is your one and only warning brother you need to delete that channel and legally change

1271
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:23,260
your name dude or start making some power ranger videos man i'm gonna body slam you and put you

1272
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:28,300
in the act so hard your freaking head will pop off dude and then i'll spear you through a table

1273
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:34,620
brother i mean serious business here mean gene i've already taken one youtuber down brother

1274
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:41,340
oh which one you got one month to get your act together jack a lot of times

1275
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:46,460
as that the gauntlet's been i mean that was definitely a challenge but like i gotta say first

1276
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:50,860
of all thank you for the gracious window of opportunity you know most people go with like a 24

1277
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:57,660
hour did you make a power rangers video at some point i did i did do like a half-assed halloween

1278
01:59:57,660 --> 02:00:01,900
episode where i was reviewing the power rangers halloween episode which was just a wrapping

1279
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:07,580
pumping guy which was funny uh so i guess technically i have made power rangers content

1280
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:14,380
and i do already win the bet or the win the challenge beforehand you've gone away from

1281
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:20,380
your your power tuber yeah yeah you've won you've already won the only question is is

1282
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:27,820
tommy oliver aka macho man randy savage aka the green ranger going to kick your ass anyway um

1283
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:32,300
that's the only question left i guess so i guess we're just i could have to wait an entire month

1284
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:36,780
now to find out i don't even have to like do anything i just have it's already happened

1285
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:42,700
yeah the we have the gears that have been set in motion yeah so it's time to watch them back

1286
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:46,780
lean back and that's the easiest challenge i've ever participated in i just be like but by the

1287
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:53,100
way it's done this is this is unrelated but but it factors into you yesterday when me been in kazi

1288
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:57,980
we're all hanging out in boston kazi brought up a very interesting thing that you do on instagram

1289
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:04,300
which which me and ben left really hard at wait what i never knew about i didn't even know you

1290
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:10,540
were on instagram because i don't use it yeah uh we really enjoy the hey what's up guys just go

1291
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:15,500
back from the gym right for another q and a sesh just you know post your comments and we are just

1292
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:23,980
okay okay uh kazi made it sound like like to hear her tell it like every day you go to the gym

1293
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:29,020
whoa and then you get home from the gym and you pop on instagram and say sup guys just home from

1294
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:35,980
the gym for a little q and a well that that is literally only i mean i only do the q and a's

1295
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:41,820
on friday that's why it's called q and a friday and and i've only ever done it back from the gym

1296
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:49,820
that one day so i mean if by every day you mean one day the day that happened to be brought up

1297
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:58,140
then yes i do it every day tom it was hard to believe so we had to pull up one and like the

1298
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:03,660
very first video we saw on your instagram stories you saying ah i just got back from the gym guys

1299
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:12,940
q and a i don't know it just left me scratched in my head like what is it wait how many questions

1300
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:18,220
are there when he goes to the gym and that is a q and a every day oh god i i i wish i had the

1301
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:23,420
self-confidence to think i was worth having a q and a every day i'd probably be so much

1302
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:27,900
further in life if i cared about myself that much i thought it was some sort of like marketing the

1303
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:31,420
community management thing where every day after the gym you're just so pumped up you're like yeah

1304
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:34,380
i just can't wait to answer some questions like you're on the treadmill and you're just going

1305
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:39,020
fast and fast like i gotta get home so i can read my fucking q and a question i like this fictional

1306
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:44,220
facsimile of me that exists now and i want to become closer to it i've you've given me a goal to

1307
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:51,660
aspire to it's legendary that's linking the description to tom yeah q and a

1308
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:59,340
um all right okay so we were talking a lot about discord wars and i have no idea what the genesis

1309
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:04,860
of these discord wars were but there were a lot of voicemail so i picked two here for you to uh

1310
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:13,340
some some both sides of a of a hunggoing war so this is like keyblade how do you do i'm here as

1311
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:19,660
a representative of the market how do fan discord i've been hearing a lot about this pcp discord

1312
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:26,060
war that's brewing and i'm here as the market mod to officially declare our neutrality in this

1313
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:33,020
conflict all right i agree remember what the markets can do for you well what you can do to

1314
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:38,620
market yourself all right that is all the whole problem with market how do being a part of this

1315
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:43,420
is that market how do is not technically a pcp product right because i do it with my friend

1316
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:49,100
mad who has nothing to do with the pcp so it's pcp adjacent but i mean you're on it and you're on

1317
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:56,220
the pcp so it's pcp it's pcp adjacent yeah you know it's totally pcp adjacent but it's not pcp

1318
02:03:56,220 --> 02:04:03,820
itself is arm retrieval pcp adjacent or is it a pcp spinoff i would have is it a pcp is it a

1319
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:09,660
pc property that's a good term copyright you know that's a good question i guess i wouldn't consider

1320
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:14,220
it i want it because it doesn't i would call it's adjacent but it's about as adjacent as you can

1321
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:20,220
possibly fucking get yeah without being incorporated yeah it's like it's arm retrieval is like on the

1322
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:26,860
level of adjacency of like the give and take streams i was like i don't think that's really a pcp

1323
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:32,540
thing but it is arm retrieval is not pcp adjacent it's like a pcp spinoff it's like it's evolved as

1324
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:39,340
a product as a result of it whereas market how do wasn't entirely separately uh you conceived

1325
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:45,100
endeavor market how do is yeah it's like a totally separate thing that just sort of got entangled it

1326
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:51,420
was caught in the orbit yeah while they're not a huge section of the viewer base there are there is

1327
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:56,860
a considerable amount of people on the arm retrieval fandom who have not are not like pcp heads

1328
02:04:56,860 --> 02:05:02,620
and they just are homestuckers and they just found it through you know like you know i'm stuck

1329
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:08,060
yeah yeah real jealous yeah that's what you gotta do well about this discord war

1330
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:12,380
i hadn't heard about this discord war but i guess they better whip the hellfire hamlet up into a

1331
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:19,740
frenzy there's killers what are you talking about there are well there are killers and there are

1332
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:24,780
people and there are like people that were there before rfck that have no that are sort of killers

1333
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:30,780
in spirit but have no like real gang affiliation ben how are there people in your discord server
