00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, your favorite

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,380
and most lucrative friendship simulator. I am the best guy ever and today we're joined

3
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:44,120
by Lethal Roarumage. Hello. How deadly of you. And Tom Oliver. I am here, I am, games

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,920
are pumping through my blood and my veins and my brain and my synapses are firing up,

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,080
up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A select start. Let's do this. Why is it

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,280
never just hello with you people? Why can't you just say hello? Because you got, you have,

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,760
you have the domination, the sole proprietor license to use hello. The rest of us have

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,760
to come up with something clever every time because you, I think there's a, I feel a spirit

9
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,680
of one upsmanship that I want to be the best and to trounce everyone else with my magic

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,160
comedy skills. I don't usually succeed or anywhere close to it. Right, right, no, no,

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,160
me neither. It's, it's, Mages just takes the, the safe effective route every time it works

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,600
and she keeps going with it and we just keep botching it, trying to be entertaining clowns.

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,160
I gotta queue up that sound bite. She's such a normie. No, no, no. One day I'll have that

14
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,200
sound board actually working. I should take Bitterthorn's advice and get that stuff set

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,280
up. Yeah. How have we gone 131 episodes and not have a sound board? It just seems some

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,040
people don't like the idea of a sound board. I don't like the sound of some people like those

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,960
people and the words they're making about sound boards. Did you just hear that noise? No, I did

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,640
not. Why? What was it? It was my alarm for the podcast. It was supposed to be an hour before

19
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,640
or like half an hour before, but I'm guessing, I'm guessing the time. No, no, no, no, I'm guessing,

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm guessing what happened is Daylight Savings. Oh, did that, why is it Daylight Savings like

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,520
switches like every fucking week of the year is what it feels like? Can we talk about time zones

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,160
and how they're bullshit and how people know? I don't get it. I don't understand. Just watch that

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,320
video. How is this so complicated? There's a great video by, what was it? Some fuck who was it?

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,680
It's like, it's like, why time zones suck or something about like, why making a clock sucks

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,160
or something like that. Why making a clock sucks. I was, it was, it was, it was something about why

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,160
programming like a digital like timekeeper is like such a pain because the rules of time zones

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,520
are so crazy. It is. And actually, I remember like, I think that like the most, so there, first of all,

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,760
like there's, there's just straight up time zones, then there's Daylight Savings time, which does not

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
stay like consistent between places. Then there's like, like London has its own kind of system where

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
it like switches actual time zones or something. Then there's, and I think the worst example of all

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,920
was like, I think it's, it's actually the Gaza Strip. Actually between Palestine and Israel,

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,200
I think they actually are in different time zones. And it's like, now you have to get political with

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,720
what time you decided is in like this region of the world. And it's like, well, shit, man, I didn't

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,120
sign up for this. It's interesting. Whatever video that is, it's great. Like, I remember, like, I

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,160
remember even like weirder is that like back in the day, I was big into conspiracy theory videos,

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,040
and I watched them all the time. And I watched this one conspiracy documentary called Chimatica.

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,960
And in it, there was this guy who was talking about how clocks and time itself is a conspiracy

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,480
about how like, what way I don't remember exactly has been forever, but I just remember him,

39
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,760
like, he's like, we're all slaves to the watch. And that time is an unnatural way of like humans

40
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,520
to like track things. And like, it was developed specifically to keep us like tethered to like

41
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,760
a false reality. And that like humans are supposed to be more organic in their experiences. And we're

42
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,600
all like fucking ourselves over and like getting loose in touch with our chakras by being a slave

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,320
to the watch. The thing about that is the thing about that is there is a nugget of logic to that.

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,680
They're like, there is a core that sort of makes sense. Because it's true, the 24 hour day cycle

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,880
that we all do everything to it is reasonably artificial. But it's like, we've got to organize

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,880
society some way. And this seems like a pretty reasonable way to do it. Apparently not if you

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,920
want to keep those chakras blitzed. That's what I learned from that. That was also that was also

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,480
the documentary that talked about Admiralty Merit or maritime admiralty law. That was some

49
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,520
fucked up. Do you ever hear about that that conspiracy? Okay, as conspiracy know, what's

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,200
the deal? Okay, so the idea between maritime admiralty law is that everybody technically has

51
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,560
two names. You have you have your personal name, then you have your corporation name. And they're

52
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,800
the exact same thing, except your corporation name is all in capital letters. And like, like on your

53
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,920
birth certificate and stuff, it's in all capital letters. And the theory behind this is that every

54
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,920
the reason you need a birth certificate in the first place is because every human being who's

55
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,120
ever been born is technically not just a human, but also a piece of collateral that the government

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,200
takes out against its loans. And so whenever they're referring to you in all capital letters,

57
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,040
they're referring to the technical corporation of your personhood. So I guess the corporation is

58
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,320
people after all, exactly. But like the thing is, is that like, these people also believe that if you

59
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,880
go into court, when you're summoned to court, they're summoning you the corporation and not

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,680
you the human being so you can just not go or just show up and be like, I'm not the person,

61
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,440
like you're trying to talk to the corporation and they're not here is just me the person and I'm

62
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,000
going to ignore these things that's like, like jury nullification that like, you're not supposed

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,520
to know about it. But I think I think that's the idea. But I think it's also bullshit, you know,

64
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,080
it doesn't sound like that's going to hold up. No, no, no, no, when the cops come, I say,

65
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,600
no, no, no, no, no, I just didn't show up to my, you know, murder court appearance because

66
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm the person you're looking for the corporation exact Nate best man that that guy's elsewhere.

67
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,440
Yeah, okay. That guy's based out of like, I don't know, Dublin or something. If you want to have

68
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,680
some good sillies, go go search climatic. It's like a 2009 documentary. And it's it's some crazy

69
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,840
shit, dude. You know, this just reminds me of I think I've said it before, but there's it's a

70
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,320
if it's a separate thing, but it just reminds me of like, in Japan, there's a law that's

71
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,320
effectively like you're not allowed to drive like something about like in rain, you're not allowed

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,440
to drive too close to the edge of the road or something. And but like the wording of the law

73
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,120
is something that is like, drive not near the edge of death in the rain for there the skid demon

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:09,360
lies. Oh, God, imagine how much cooler history class would be if our laws were written like that.

75
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Holy shit. It was something like that, at least. Yeah, look it up. It's one of the it was in like

76
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,080
one of those like, like sounds fake, but is real laws that's like of antiquity or something.

77
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,280
The best shit. The best pretty good stuff. Hey, guys, I want to yeah, I just want to close the saga.

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:35,360
I bought candy corn. Oh, have you eaten it? Yes. Yes, I have. What's the conclusion?

79
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:45,920
It's okay. It's like, it's quite different from what I expected it to be. But it's not as bad as a

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,160
lot of people made it out to be. To those who are listening, it sort of reminds me of the candy

81
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,680
called irises in the opinion. It's not exactly the same. At least the ones I bought, they have a

82
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,160
very strong honey taste to it. Honey taste, okay. Yeah, so it might be because of that.

83
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,680
Made, you know, you have to do now, you have to get the companion candy to the candy corn,

84
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,280
which is the candy pumpkins. They always come together. So now you're going to go on another

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,240
epic quest to get the candy pumpkins. Yeah, which tastes more ubiquitous. It is more ubiquitous,

86
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,600
but those are everywhere. They taste almost exactly the same. So it'll be a probably made of the same

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,160
material. A largely useless quest, but I'm sending you on it anyway. I have the option to refuse.

88
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,120
You could, but you'll disappoint me. I appreciate the seasonal timeliness of this whole quest,

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,600
which I guess is why it came up, because it's a Halloween candy thing. Yeah. But it gets me in

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,080
the spirit. Although this episode will be airing after Halloween. So hope you're enjoying your

91
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,960
post-Halloween lull, everybody. Yeah, go to your candy bin and grab some candy corn.

92
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Everyone's on that Christmas hype now, Christmas. Oh, you're right. I forgot after Halloween,

93
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
it's Christmas season has begun, basically. You know what the best Christmas present is?

94
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,840
Donating $5 or more to the procrastinators on Patreon, we have a new bonus episode out

95
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:21,760
and edited by Mage. Oh, that's right. Over all, people. A hot coals of After Effects rendering,

96
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,240
taking their CPU to a hot sizzle. There's a lot of work there. Go do it. I didn't use,

97
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,200
in the end, I didn't end up using After Effects because it was just not agreeing. Yeah, it's just

98
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,200
me and Bentley. So were you able to get the animation stuff working?

99
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Some of it, but not the mouth flaps, sadly. It was just too much trouble. I'm sorry,

100
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
I'm sorry. There's no mouth flaps. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. That's cool.

101
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,680
I was going to say, speaking of skid demons with that law, I have a thing to bring up relevant

102
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,560
to that exact thing. I think I was visited by a skid demon actually multiple times.

103
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,000
And this is about my skateboarding exploits on my wife's skateboard, effectively.

104
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:18,160
People were roasting me in my stream yesterday about that. Anyway, yeah, so I've been out

105
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,680
e-skateboarding and it's pretty great doing Pokemon Go and loving it. But there's been two

106
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,000
times now that I've wiped out hardcore and it's been pretty brutal. The first time was definitely

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,200
the work of a skid demon. I was going up this hill I've gone up many times before, this little

108
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,600
ramp into this big parking lot that I love to just go nuts and go max speed. And on the way up,

109
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,240
there's always these grass clippings across the blacktop leading in. And on this particular day

110
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,080
it was pretty wet outside. It had rained and I go up and I just wipe the fuck out and I scraped my

111
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,760
elbow. My right elbow got a little fucked up. That wasn't that bad. That was okay. I got up

112
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,880
and I hobble away and I'm okay. But then there was a couple days ago, like three days ago,

113
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,760
when I'm just skateboarding on the sidewalk and I'm coming up and there's a group of kids in

114
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,760
front of me and I'm like, actually, I had passed these kids, I had passed these kids on my way down

115
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,440
and they were like, whoa, dude, that's so cool. And I was like, yeah, nothing personal kid as I

116
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,600
max speed away from them. And I look totally sick and cool. And then as I'm coming up, actually

117
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,520
they ran alongside me like trying to keep up. But I just room I just knew where they say

118
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,400
they're like, I don't know, like maybe late elementary school to early middle school kids.

119
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:46,320
So like 12 or so probably 12. Yeah. So that was cool. And and then on the way back,

120
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,000
I see the same group of kids and I'm like, well, they're kind of taking up the sidewalk. I don't

121
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,520
want to cut through them. So what I do is I just skate off the edge of the

122
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,560
sidewalk onto the street as I'm coming towards my place. And so normally this can be a fine thing

123
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,640
to do. But there's lots of times when the difference between the sidewalk and the road is can be like

124
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,840
over two inches. And this is one of those times. And if you if you if you're if you're going straight

125
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,000
and then you just kind of veer to the right a little bit, you get like one wheel basically off

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,920
the thing. And you I mean, the imbalance going at fairly high speed is just quite high. So

127
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,000
I did this literally just to look cool to these kids that were thinking I was I was dope, because

128
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,480
I could have just stopped and gotten off. But no, no, no, no, you got to do in one motion. As I do

129
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,600
this, the whole thing buckles, it goes like a 45 degree angle. And I just go flying into the middle

130
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,920
of the road. Just just fucking up my body bad in I mean, I scraped my hand terribly. I have many

131
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,720
wounds on it. Did you not wear gloves? I was not wearing gloves. I told you to wear gloves. You

132
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,520
did specifically suggest wearing gloves. And that would have been a very good idea. I was wearing a

133
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,120
long sleeve shirt and jeans. Thank God, because I tore up my jeans, still got multiple wounds.

134
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,640
And my elbows got a little fucked up too. But the worst by far was my hand that was not covered

135
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:20,080
in any clothes. And so I got a big gash. I've got a picture. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's not

136
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,880
of the wound. It's of my bandages. That's all it is. So there's nothing graphic there, just to give

137
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,600
people an idea of is it like my favorite animes were just wrapped up in gauze. That is what I

138
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,440
used actually. I did use gauze. Of course, of course. The shonen healing device. 100% effective

139
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,200
every time. And it's pretty cool. So you can see that in the links below people. And I just uploaded

140
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,840
it. So yeah, pretty fucked up, hurt a lot, still hurts. Definitely looks like an anime.

141
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,880
So basically what I was going to say is I think this is there was one time I was playing on the

142
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
black top as a kid where I got pushed. I was playing four squares something and I fell back

143
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,240
and hit my head and like blacked out for a second, which technically counts as a concussion.

144
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,280
But the thing is, that was probably the worst I've ever been hurt in my life, which is to say I really

145
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,640
haven't been hurt a lot. I've never broken a bone. Like this scrape like stands out as one of the worst

146
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,120
things I've ever done. And it really wasn't that bad. Just kind of, you know, got a couple of cuts

147
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,240
and stuff. And so I was just wondering if you guys have had like worse injuries than this.

148
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Like have you ever, I know Tom has had some issues where his like heart literally stopped

149
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,280
for a bit. I don't know if that's an injury per se. My body is even more suicidal than I am.

150
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,120
Have you guys ever like broken a bone while like shredding hardcore or anything like that?

151
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,120
I haven't had any broken bones, but I recall three instances where the injury was pretty

152
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,880
not fun. What happened? Okay, so the earliest I remember was back in the Violet Violins days.

153
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,440
Indeed. Yes. As one would expect. Yeah, we were in a place where we weren't supposed to be and there

154
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,440
was a lot of lumber and the lumber had a lot of nails. Rival gang territory. No, no, it was in our

155
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,800
territory. And there were like a lot of lumber, a lot of nails and I stepped on one and it went

156
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,440
straight through my foot. Oh, went through your foot. Ah, yeah. Oh Christ. Okay. I didn't even

157
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,640
realize what was happening until I couldn't lift my foot. Okay, that's pretty serious. That's pretty

158
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:38,400
serious. Yeah. And another one was I was there was a recently they cut down a giant tree and it was

159
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,960
like scaling up the logs because of course I would and I slipped, I tripped and what happened

160
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:52,560
somehow a piece of what's the outer layer of the bark. Yeah, the bark, a piece of bark got under

161
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,200
my toenails. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Anything involving toenails just like freaks me out. Yeah, it was

162
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:06,320
agree. It was it was terrible. I'm surprised it didn't fall off. At least I don't remember it doing

163
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,880
so. But yeah, were you wearing shoes? Like did it cut through your shoe or something? I was wearing

164
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,240
like, I think it's called sandals. Yeah, you were wearing goddamn woman. What are you doing climbing

165
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,360
trees wearing flip flops or something? It was it was it was summer. And the last one was quite

166
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:33,200
recent. I think it was last year. I think I was back in La Peña and my mother put a new carpet

167
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,040
in the room I was staying. And like the carpets was very slippery and a few times I was I sort

168
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,520
of slipped but I regained my balance and my mom was like, Oh, we shouldn't nail and we should nail

169
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,360
it down or something like that because I feel like one of us is going to trip. And I was like,

170
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah, we should totally do that. Do that. But same same day a bit later, we haven't done that.

171
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,600
And I was going into my room and I slipped really, really bad. I couldn't get my balance up and I

172
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:16,320
fell and I hit my hold on right side, the rib cage onto a table. And not only that, I skidded a bit

173
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:23,120
and some of my skin went off of my foot and I think I still have a scar. Hold on, let me check.

174
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,640
This carpet is evil. So the fact that the carpet was so loose, it just moved on the floor and it

175
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Yeah, okay, okay. I'm pretty sure don't have the scar anymore. But that's good. Oh, no, no,

176
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,360
wait, wait, wait, there's still a little bit of it. There's still a hint of it, but it's fading away.

177
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,040
So Jesus, I'm definitely going to have scars from this from these fucking skateboarding wounds.

178
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,040
But you know what, you know, I was going to say about this, I kind of feel like a badass. So I'm

179
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,200
kind of just happy that it happened. You know, like it wasn't that bad. Everyone needs a little bit

180
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,480
of wear and tear to be a cool guy. So you know, maybe I've been a little too pampered. I feel

181
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,120
cool. I'm happy that I do it. Speaking of scars, a weird scar I have that still hasn't healed and

182
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,120
it baffles me to this day. I was playing with my cat and this is totally earned. He bit me. And

183
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,800
he doesn't bite me hard, but sometimes just enough to break the skin. And it still hasn't healed and

184
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,320
I swear it's been like just as long as like even longer than a year now. And like the skin on my

185
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,120
foot that had completely come off, it's almost almost completely gone. There's barely anything

186
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,240
there. But these tooth scars are just still there. Are they vampire mics? Mark's on your neck. Is it

187
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,400
a vampire cat? No, no, no. It's on my arm. On your arm. Yeah, like the two little streaks on my arm.

188
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,320
I know I have no idea why they're still there. Those platelets need to get to work. Yeah, healing

189
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,920
that shit. Shit, dude. Well, how about you, Tom? Anything like this? Well, I did break my leg in

190
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,400
elementary school. How'd that happen? I constantly had this bad habit and I still do it to this day

191
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,880
of like fucking running up and down stairs with reckless abandon because I just, I got places

192
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,040
to be. I don't have time to casually go down the stairs. Fuck that shit. And so my mom was always

193
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,960
like, you know, you keep doing that, you're going to fall down the stairs. I'm like, ah, dumb bitch,

194
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,320
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. One time in sixth grade, it did happen. I did fall

195
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,240
down the stairs. I did break my leg and it did suck balls. So were you heading up the stairs

196
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,920
and then just like, oh no, I was going down. Gravity was totally out to get me that day. So you like

197
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:44,960
tumbled forward or something? Yeah, I slipped and it hurt. It was bad. And then I had to have a cast

198
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,920
for a while. And one of the things that I remember distinctly about this, I had crutches, all that

199
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:57,040
fucking bullshit, is that during the school I was at, the last period of the day, some days of the

200
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,200
week would be chorus. And I'd have to walk from once, you'd have to walk from one side of the

201
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,240
building to the other to get to the chorus class. And now I had to hobble on crutches and it was

202
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,120
very slow. And most of the time, it would take the entire period for me to crutch walk. Nobody

203
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,600
helped. Nobody waited. I would just show up at chorus and then it would be over and then have

204
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,800
to go all the way back to the other side to get my backpack. Are you kidding me? No, no, no. This

205
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,360
happened multiple times. I just like missed chorus because I just was hobbling my way from one

206
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,680
side of the building to the other, trying to get there. Well, fucking fumdus, Tom hobbling his

207
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,560
way across. Nobody helping him. Chorus sucked though. So I was totally okay with it and never

208
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,640
spoke up about it. So I'm like, yeah, if anyone ever gives me shit, I'll be like, I'm crippled.

209
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,200
Fuck you. Damn. So that was breaking my bone. What else happened?

210
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:51,240
Oh shit. Oh, when I was a little kid, I got attacked by my cat because I was a retard.

211
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,880
So Mike, I loved, my first cat was cool. He was a cool guy. He was this big fucking massive

212
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,600
death cat and I was a little wee lad of like eight years old and I loved this cat. He was

213
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,360
a cool cat. But one time we were out just hanging out with the neighbors and then their dog

214
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:15,040
tried to kill our cat. Oh shit, okay. And I had the dumb idea of running over to save

215
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,960
him because I was like, fuck you dog. Don't hurt my cat. He's the best. And my cat was

216
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,680
freaked out. So when I touched it, it attacked me because it thought it was being attacked

217
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:30,000
by another animal or something. Right. And it ripped my face open and shit. Oh fuck.

218
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,960
I had to get stitches on my eyebrow and let me tell you, that hurts like a bitch. I did

219
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,080
once get an eyebrow piercing so I can kind of relate. This is like getting your eyebrow

220
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,560
pierced like 16 times in a row. Yeah, that's way worse. It's not fun. I still have a little

221
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,560
scar there every time I squint. There's a little like fold there that shouldn't be there from

222
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,080
like a scar. It's very weird. Yeah. But I described getting my eyebrow pierced as like the worst

223
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,640
pain I've ever felt and feeling like a lightning bolt going through my face. Yeah, what it

224
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,600
felt like. Speaking about broken bones, this didn't happen to me, but I feel like I can

225
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,640
share the story. Sure. I was one time in camp and they had like the concentration camp. No,

226
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,120
no, it was regular camp. Just the buildings were like concrete or brick laid like two

227
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:27,320
story buildings with and what happened was like some boys decided to climb from the second

228
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,560
floor window to the second floor. What is with Eastern European people and climbing shit

229
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,160
where they shouldn't be doing and risking their lives. But okay, all right. From the

230
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,440
window to the balcony and we were like the girls were on the balcony were ready to sort

231
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,320
of like help them over and I was one of them and it's just it's so stupid. We should have

232
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,560
told them no, but I don't think they would have listened. Anywho, so they did doing that

233
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,880
and one boy sort of reached out and we tried to grab his hand, but we didn't manage to

234
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,120
grab his hand and he slipped and he fell. Oh God, from a second story. Yeah. And he broke

235
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,800
both his arms. What happened? He broke both his arms. Shit. He broke both his arms. Oh my God.

236
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,360
And so like you're there reaching out your hand and like he missed your hand. All right,

237
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,680
all right, mage, mage, be honest, be honest, mage. You did this on purpose, didn't you? You wanted

238
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,600
him to suffer the violent violence. No, no, no, no, no, no, I had a crush on this boy.

239
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,000
And you crushed him. So you had to see him crush below you.

240
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Oh God. No, no, it was it was. It was a weird affection thing. That's the custom I just don't

241
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,960
understand. That is seriously though, you see those videos of like Russian boys like climbing

242
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,800
on these weird like just like freakishly tall like oil rigs and shit and like hanging off with

243
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,040
one arm dangling over nothing and like giving a thumbs up with like the other hand. You see that

244
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,600
shit? I mean, that's what it reminds me of. Jesus Christ. There's a yearning for death in the Eastern

245
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,320
European population, I think. I can relate since I'm half Polish, you know, I get it. Fascinating.

246
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,760
Yeah, they called the ambulance and he, you know, wasn't in camp for the rest of the time.

247
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,200
I would hope so. Did his arms heal okay? I mean, did he? I think so. Like by the time it got out,

248
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,880
I went to actually visit him because I was I lived near the hospital. Well, not near the

249
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,400
hospital, but it was a walk away. And I went to visit him and he was already out. So. Oh, that's

250
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:38,320
good. Okay. Well, still. God damn. That's pretty fucking funny. It wasn't. He's the important

251
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,960
question that made you guys ever hook up after that? You ever go anywhere with that crush?

252
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,000
The thing is that we might have, maybe, but his mother was a psycho. So. Oh,

253
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
cockblock by mom. The worst fate. I was going to say, having both arms paralyzed can put a man

254
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,440
in a compromising position at a formative young years and will need assistance with various activities.

255
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,200
Well, I mean, okay, I guess that that's pretty much it. Any other traumatic stories? I mean,

256
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,880
there was the time that I just kicked Ben for no reason. That was pretty funny, but it wasn't

257
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,600
really a serious injury or anything. Was there anything else? I mean, I had crazy fevers when

258
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,560
I was young, but that's not the same kind of. Yeah, and axe fell on me and almost cut my head off,

259
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:33,760
but only to cut my finger instead. Oh, I mean, how bad did it hurt the finger? Not bad at all.

260
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,920
Like I still have like a scar on my finger from where it like sliced a bit of flesh open and

261
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,440
had to get stitches and everything. But like if I had not moved when I did, it would have like

262
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,320
hit the back of my neck and probably killed me. So that was cool. God was just like, no,

263
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,760
you still got another couple of decades of suffering, boy. I mean, there wasn't at one time.

264
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,080
I know I've told this before where I was just what I was on a bunk bed. I like flipped up.

265
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
I was like on the bottom bunk, but there were bars above. I grabbed those bars. I flipped upside

266
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
down as I like to do on those to like do flips. And one time I was just hanging upside down head

267
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,360
down. And I was like, this will be fun. And I just let go and dropped onto my head and nearly

268
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,240
snapped my fucking neck like for fun. I don't know what I was thinking, but it seemed fun at the time.

269
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,800
But that's how it goes. That's how it goes. Yeah, yeah, that's just really all there is to it.

270
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:35,360
Really stupid retarded ideas, I suppose. Yeah, well, I guess that's it. I guess that's it.

271
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,920
Yeah. Don't die, kids. Yeah, try not to do this. Don't do dangerous things. A little bit. If you're

272
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,280
going to do dangerous things, you know, prepare your will ahead of time and I don't know, make sure

273
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,800
it's worth it. Like I've done skydiving and could have died, but it's actually pretty safe. Safety

274
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,440
precautions. Yeah. And I did it in tandem. One thing I remember. It wasn't an injury or anything,

275
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,480
but it was very scary. So, you know, like those thermometers that have like, what's it called?

276
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,400
Mercury in them, I think, right? Yeah. And mercury is poisonous when it's like gas, right?

277
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,720
Yep, sure is. It's liquid, too. But yeah. Yeah, so I broke a thermometer and I was really scared

278
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,680
of telling my parents, so I hid it. But then, thankfully, I came clean because where I hid it

279
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,920
was the bedroom. And well, if I hadn't told them, I dread to think what would have happened.

280
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,160
You know, on that specific thing, my mom told me, you know, my mom like grew up in like the 50s

281
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,200
and 60s and stuff. Well, most of the 60s, but whatever. A point is like, when she was a kid,

282
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,040
she told me the other day, or this was years ago, she's like, yeah, well, like when we were kids,

283
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,160
we used to intentionally crack open like mercury thermometers and just like fuck around with the

284
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,880
mercury and just like, you know, play with it and like roll it around. And she's like,

285
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,880
this may have been a bad idea. Fucking terrible idea. I mean, yeah, but how the fuck this was

286
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,200
like before they knew, I guess. Yeah, it's just like, oh, because like mercury is kind of cool.

287
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,000
It's really cool. It's liquid metal. It's dope. It's pretty sick, too bad. Everything that's cool

288
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,720
is also bad for you. Unfortunately. Yeah, like dropping onto your neck from a bunk bed. It's

289
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,120
cool as hell. But damn it. It's a forbidden snack. The worst thing for you. It's a forbidden fun.

290
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,880
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. Yeah. You should title this segment forbidden fun, aka traumatic injury. Yeah,

291
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,960
exactly. I mean, those those girls who cut themselves because their emo seem like they're

292
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,080
having a good time. Yeah. Well, if it's good enough for emo girls, good enough for me, you know,

293
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,000
that's my that's my bar. Shit. So so anyone. Alright, well, what else we got on the table?

294
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,280
I got another thing to talk about. But you got you guys you guys got a I'm done. I'm done with

295
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,240
injuries. So if you want to move on to something else, please please save me from my floundering.

296
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,600
I did have a funny thing happen to me right before this episode began. And this is I got to start

297
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,920
today's episode of the PGP the Pokemon Go podcast, which is just to say that my mom calls me

298
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,840
so my mom visited me in Cincinnati recently at the legendary encounter legendary cat of being on

299
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,200
the Shekels for heckles episode and whatnot. And while she was here, I got her introduced to Pokemon

300
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,440
Go and got her playing a little bit. And she seems pretty into it. And the way I can definitely

301
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,880
tell is that she just called me asking for like help. And she she was walking the dog beanie.

302
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:45,760
And she was just like, Nate, how do I or I just got a thing I'm going to polka stops to get polka

303
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,640
balls. But I'm it's telling me max I've got max capacity for items. What do I do? So I explained

304
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,640
to where you got to throw away items you don't need you can upgrade if you pay money or you have

305
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,560
due gym battles, which I'm sure she has not done yet. Or but mostly just throw away items to get

306
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:10,880
more polka balls and stuff. So yeah, I guess what I'm saying is that was funny. And parents will

307
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,000
never get it. It's interesting, like because like Pokemon Go is one of those games that's

308
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,200
definitely like got like normie potential. Yeah, Pokemon like the Pokemon spin off game seem to

309
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,880
be good with that. Like my parents hate video games, think they're gay, think I've wasted my

310
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,320
entire life and they're not wrong. But they are both huge fans of Pokemon snap and we would play

311
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,600
that together all the time. And my mom like beat that game and played it multiple times. Wow. And

312
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:49,600
like, interesting doesn't play video games hates them a lot. But Pokemon snap for the n64 was her

313
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,600
jam. And she was obsessed with it just as much as we were back in the day. Wow. And I don't was a

314
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,480
little bit like that with racing games. He never really played much, but he always like showed an

315
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,960
interest whenever it came up, which was interesting. My dad is like into video games, but doesn't play

316
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,640
them and is in denial about it. Like my dad is just like a nerd in denial. Like at some point,

317
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,800
he got like bullied in schools who became jacked and like learned how to fight and like became one

318
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,520
of those guys. But but he was before that he was a nerd. He's left that identity behind.

319
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,440
But it's still there. He just ignores it to the best of his abilities. I think my dad

320
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,560
generally likes video games, but he doesn't play them at the moment. I remember in my childhood,

321
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,720
he would play. I don't remember the name of the game, but I think it was on a Nintendo console

322
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,680
because I remember we also had like the original Mario's that my sister and me played and he played

323
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:51,600
like this other one where you had to build like a maze sort of for tanks to battle like and and

324
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,120
then yeah, you built the battlefield basically and then you maneuvered around it with one little

325
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,520
tank while five other tanks went after you. So you had to yeah, it was quite fun. And the other

326
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,440
two games I remember him playing would be like Doom and Doom 2. So yeah, yeah, that's some good

327
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,840
I guess on Doom 3. Yeah. So, you know, the Doom series. Sadly, his computer is not strong enough

328
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,720
to handle the newest doom. So we cannot probably play that on your fucking phone these days or

329
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,480
something. I tried. I tried. It didn't run. Oh, yeah. Get a new graphics card. Just go out buy GTX

330
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:37,200
1060 slap it in your nest machine and yeah. Yes, my dad had bad might and magic for the PC.

331
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,000
Him and my uncle would would hang out together and play might and magic for the PC back in the day.

332
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,360
And that was a cool game. I played that a little bit later in life because I was a little child.

333
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,480
I ruined one of their might and magic games when I was when I was like a very young kid like

334
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,360
younger than five because I've come a long way with computers in my life. Now I can like build

335
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,280
computers. I can put them together. I can do all this cool shit with them. I'm basically that

336
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,840
IT guy right now at for I am games. It's like my job. But back in the day, they were playing

337
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,760
might and magic like three, I think, for like DOS and I came downstairs and I thought the computer

338
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,360
was hungry. So I shoved a cookie into the floppy drive and crashed the whole thing. Are you kidding

339
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,880
me? Are you fucking serious? No. Okay. Why did you think it was hungry? What a fascinating

340
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,640
I can relate, though. I had the same experience. What? Are you kidding me? Like, I think it was

341
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,440
like a what's it called? VCR thing? VCR. No, no, the tapes. Yeah, the tapes, those big tapes,

342
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:45,440
big bulky tapes. Yeah, VCR. Yeah, I thought it was hungry. So because I put like metal bits inside

343
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,800
of it instead of like a cookie because it's a metal thing. It eats metal of things.

344
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,160
Mage went to the next level. And what about like a TV being thirsty? Oh, no. Oh, God. You didn't pour

345
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:06,080
shit on a TV, did you? I pour liquid into the TV. You got to water the TV. Why? Why? It was thirsty.

346
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,680
Okay, wait, stop, stop. What made you think specifically that they were hungry and or thirsty?

347
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,720
I don't know. What was it? This is like 25 years ago. I was I'm not going to recall my thought process.

348
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,760
I was like a literal baby. Yeah, I was five or less years old. I can tell you that much. Five or less.

349
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,800
Because like, I could see think like, okay, you see like a floppy disk drive, and it kind of looks

350
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,400
like an open mouth, right? I sort of get the connection there. But like, was there something

351
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,400
on the screen that said like, feed me? I mean, I don't know. I think me and Mage both just have

352
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,840
like, like had stupid amounts of empathy as children. Yeah, I still have stupid amounts of

353
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,600
empathy. Yeah, I try and crush that feeling every day.

354
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,280
Well, for the yeah, that's good. But for the TV being thirsty, like, where did you pour the liquid

355
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,800
into? Remember back when TVs used to be like super bulky and not like flat screens. So on the back,

356
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,640
there would be like, slits to get like the hot air out. So I did that. Oh, God.

357
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,560
Surprisingly, right onto the CRT, like, like, yeah, surprisingly, dear God, it did not ruin the TV

358
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,520
because I turned it off right afterward. And I think it had time to dry. Oh, and just did anybody

359
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,840
know? Did you ever confess your crime? No one? No one knew. Oh, man, the perfect crime.

360
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,920
Watering the TV. So did did your shoving food or metal bits into the VCR?

361
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Oh, that's right. Oh, that's fucked it up.

362
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,520
What metal bits did you shove in there? Like, where did actually this metal shavings hanging

363
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,720
around? It was it was from, um, uh, I guess when you live in the desolate wasteland of the violent

364
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,360
violence, there's metal bits all over the place. A brush, a hairbrush. There we go. A hairbrush.

365
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:12,240
A metal hairbrush? Yeah, the metal is spiky bits. Oh, yes. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, so

366
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,280
oh, but this is funny because this is kind of the origin story of how I learned English because

367
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,480
once the VCR was fucked up, my parents got me cable, which had Cartoon Network in it and me

368
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,960
being four to five years old, I didn't care what language they spoke. So I, you know, it's just

369
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,720
pretty cartoons. So I watched TV a lot and that's how I learned English. So this was like a formative

370
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,400
moment of your life. If you hadn't fed the VCR, you might not even be able to talk to us at this

371
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,160
point. At least with very broken English. My God, who would have known that at this point,

372
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,920
reality is forked and there's another fork of reality where mage decided, you know what,

373
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
I guess the VCR is not hungry and then none of her life is the way it is now.

374
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,000
What a fascinating situation. The butterfly effect for sure. Holy shit. What about you,

375
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,040
Tom? So shoving the cookie into the floppy disk drive, how much did that fuck it up?

376
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,920
I guess that fucked up their game and they couldn't finish. So was the disk in there currently

377
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,000
or something? It must have been. It must have been because there's no way, because even,

378
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,240
I think about it now, there's no way that shoving something into a floppy drive would kill the

379
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,960
entire computer because all the actual components are way far away, but they must have been running

380
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,000
off of floppy disk and that just broke the game. The computer itself probably still worked.

381
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,680
Yeah, probably. Yeah, it's pretty stupid. Definitely. I've come a long way.

382
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,280
Guys, remember floppy disks? I do. I used floppy disks back in the day.

383
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,640
I used to use floppy disks. It's just so amazing now how much stuff we can cram onto disks and

384
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,640
stuff. I think a floppy disk, if I remember correctly, I think they had a limit of about

385
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,760
two megabytes if I remember correctly. It was 1.44 megabytes. Yeah, there you go. I have no idea

386
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,720
why it was that number, but that's what it was. Do you guys remember before those floppy disks,

387
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,720
like the bigger floppy disks, like the floppy disks that were actually floppy and they held

388
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,720
even less data? Oh, I remember those, but I never used them. I've never used them, but I know they're

389
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,520
real. I know they're a thing that existed. It was ironic that floppy disks were actually pretty

390
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,600
solid. I mean, they were made of plastic. You could bend them a little bit, but... Yeah, I don't,

391
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,560
I don't know. I wonder what people would call floppy disks. Well, because like Tom was saying,

392
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,760
I think the original versions were quite large and were literally floppy. They were like bendy

393
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,240
plastic. Does anybody remember the classic PSA video about piracy back in the day in the 90s

394
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,480
called, Don't Copy That Floppy? You remember the phrase, but I don't think I've seen it. It's a

395
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,400
cheesy 90s rap video about some guy telling kids, Don't Copy That Floppy. It's hilarious. Damn,

396
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,280
the 90s were a different time. It was amazing. That's hilarious, because a lot of the games

397
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,200
that I owned or got to play back in those days were bootlegs or pirated versions. Exactly,

398
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,400
there was no copy protection back in the day, so their copy protection was, Please Don't Do That.

399
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,560
The times sure have changed. We used to use rap to get kids to stop copying that floppy. Now we

400
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:21,360
use rap to get kids to smoke crack. The world's always changing. And sip that lean.

401
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,360
Well, shit. What a fascinating story. That was a great diversion or a great tangent. That was

402
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,480
absolutely delicious, delectable. I've got one other thing I wanted to bring up, which is just

403
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,600
what we were talking about right before this episode, which is about addictions, specifically

404
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:46,480
sugar. Let's talk about the worst part of the human condition. It's addiction to sugar.

405
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,360
I would argue that that's part of a larger issue. It's definitely there, but we're just slaves to

406
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,160
our biology to such a massive degree. We don't actually need sugar. Yeah, we don't actually

407
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,160
need it though, I don't think. Unless you're a bodybuilder or traveling on stuff, you actually

408
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,800
need a lot of energy. Yeah, that's true. That's true. But no, here we are. All of us, I think,

409
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,240
kind of struggle to varying degrees with resisting the temptation to eat just junk food and shit.

410
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,720
It's tough. It's real fucking hard. I can give up almost anything except for sugary stuff.

411
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,440
It's tough. Again, because I've been doing keto like Ben for the last three weeks,

412
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,680
I've had no sugar. I've become addicted to diet soda because it's the only sweet thing I can have.

413
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,880
I've been slowly easing into keto because like I still had a lot of leftover food that need to

414
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:47,040
be eaten. Like I said, I ordered the candy corn before I decided to go keto. Sure. I mean,

415
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,440
that's been lasting me several days, so a few pieces a day, so it's not going to be too much.

416
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,920
Man, there was a time in my life, and I want to get back to it. I'm working to get there,

417
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,720
and Huell and all this stuff is helping me, where I just, I had mastered this. I had conquered it.

418
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,160
I went a year without fast food. I think actually I might have eaten it one time,

419
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,880
and a year without soda, and I still don't drink soda like ever, and actually this time is what

420
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,600
broke me on soda. I just don't care anymore, but I definitely eat more junk food than that now,

421
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,960
and I just, I want to get back. This is an interesting thing about diet. It's like,

422
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,200
this is almost a problem with the internet now is that there's just so much information. I have no

423
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,720
idea what's true anymore. That's true. Because I've done research on diet, and I've tried to

424
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,840
look up things casually, just like, all right, what's the best thing to eat? And there's no

425
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,520
consensus. I was on Twitter, and this is just the most recent example of me thinking of this,

426
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,800
is I was on Twitter, and one of the people I follow on Twitter is a religious vegan,

427
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,920
like insanely vegan. All they do is just make art and products about how good it is to be vegan,

428
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,840
and fuck you if you're not vegan. They're arts great, so I follow them anyway, and I knew them

429
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,520
from like back in the pony days and stuff, but they've transitioned from pony to vegan.

430
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,160
Between two religions. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So you know, Church of Twilight to the Church of

431
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,480
Chicken, I don't know. So a shout out to them, they're great, but vegan.

432
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,080
I think all the characters, if I think about it, are probably vegan in my little pony.

433
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,320
I suppose- They eat milk products in pony shit. That's true. They're vegetarian though,

434
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,320
they're close. They're vegetarian, yeah. So yeah, so there was just a thread that they had

435
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,960
retweeted, and I just kind of looked through it, because I'm always interested. I'm interested

436
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,920
in the zealot mindset, because I want to instill it in my audience, so they'll never abandon me.

437
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,040
So I'm always taking peeks, trying to peel back the layers and figure out how to do it.

438
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,560
And this thread was just like people going back and forth fighting about

439
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,000
diet and veganism, and people are like, no, no, no, you don't understand, like the best,

440
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,440
like if you look at like ancient Asian cultures and stuff, all they would do is eat

441
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,840
like nothing but carbohydrates and sugars, and they'd live to be like 107. That's how people

442
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,720
do now. That's the most healthy thing to do. And people are like, no, no, no, we couldn't

443
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,560
evolve without eating meat, and meat's the most important thing. You can't have carbohydrates,

444
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,640
or pores that are exhaled with carbs. You got to go fats and proteins. And it's like,

445
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,840
I don't know which one's right. There's evidence on both sides. What are we supposed to do?

446
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,680
Science is not settled. It's really not.

447
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,480
So because I'm doing keto, and I'm like, am I being healthy? Because there's like a

448
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,280
huge subset of people who'd be like, you're eating the worst shit possible for you,

449
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,240
and you're going to die early of like coronary heart disease. And like, maybe that's true.

450
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,120
See, I think people, when they say like, oh, you know, your arteries are gonna get

451
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,960
clogged up with fat and stuff like that, because they've always considered like,

452
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:55,600
hold on, how to words? Let me words. So when you're consuming both carbohydrates and fat

453
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,040
in large quantities, yeah, like the fat is going to get unhealthy for you. But if you

454
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,880
just focus on just fat and not carbohydrates, I think that sort of balances out. I'm, you know,

455
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,600
I mean, I don't know. It's just, it's just someone, I'm just someone who read stuff.

456
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,160
So, you know, I'm no professional. I think that's the, the general like thrust behind

457
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,120
keto is that like, you're, you're burning fat for energy now. So it's not getting caught in

458
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,640
your body. Because if you're eating a ton of fat, but you're burning the carbohydrates,

459
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,080
your body's not doing anything with the fat and it just kind of like sticks to you.

460
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,520
Yeah, because the body priority is carbohydrates. And yeah, the fat just

461
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,880
sets in into your body. Because it's basically just sugars. Like carbohydrates break down

462
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,520
immediately into sugars and it's the easiest to process. I don't know. I'm not a scientist. I'm

463
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,640
not a smart person. So it's just like, I'm just a normal human being that is terrified of death

464
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,600
and wants to live long enough to make it to the technological singularity. But during that time,

465
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,680
I want to look swole and good and, and get some puss. So I'm just, I'm just in this,

466
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,440
this middle ground like, what do I do? How do I maximize? How do I biohack properly? That's

467
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,560
what I wanted until I can just get real technical like machine hacking with my robot limbs. I got

468
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,520
a biohack and we don't understand the language yet. So it's very fucking confusing because I don't

469
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,080
know what the fuck to do. Right, Tom? I've been going to the gym three times a week for the last

470
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,440
like three and a half, four months. That's great. That's tremendous. I'm trying to step it up to

471
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,480
five times a week at some point. I'm just lazy. Now it doesn't necessarily have to be, it's not

472
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,160
necessarily better to work out more times. I mean, there, there's different plans. So if it's

473
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,120
like easier, like with me, it's easier to work out three times a week. So I found a plan that's

474
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,040
like optimized for that. And you just do the workout that's assigned. So I'm just saying,

475
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,160
like one can, the question is not settled as like, yeah, five workouts are definitely better than

476
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,520
three works out. A lot of it depends on what you're trying to do. That's my point again. You

477
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,440
know, it's the same. It's like, what the fuck? Like how, how do you would think after a couple

478
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,000
thousand years, we'd figure out the baselines of like how this like system works. And we're not

479
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,640
even fucking close. In terms of dieting, in terms of dieting, I think during like the world wars,

480
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,040
they kind of falsified information to fatten people up or something like that. So and a lot

481
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:22,560
of people who are older dietitians, they still sort of base it on their old knowledge. And

482
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,200
but because, you know, they're the experienced people, all the newer people base it off of

483
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,840
their knowledge. And you know, it just kind of get passed on, whereas some newer people, the

484
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,560
upstarts, you know, have some new data and that's hard to believe. Here's an interesting fact

485
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,000
that is, it's not totally settled or anything, but like, so like if you're trying to gain muscle,

486
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,120
right, we all know that protein is important for that. Okay, how much protein should one eat?

487
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:54,320
Until very recently, there really was not an agreed upon answer to that. The general agreement was

488
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:01,680
a lot. And the amount that had been thrown out was like one gram of protein every day per

489
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,360
pound of body mass you have. I think it was pound of lean body mass. If you're really fat, you're

490
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,360
not going to get, you know, if you eat 400 grams of protein, that's not actually beneficial.

491
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,760
Because you got so much excess fat there. But it's but like just recently, my voice Scooby 1961,

492
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,920
who had some good time to bring him in because he's the guy who I've learned the most from over

493
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,280
the years. Everyone should listen to him if you have interest in health and fitness at all.

494
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,920
He reported in a video that there was a large, I forget what it's called, but like a multi-stage

495
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,520
like comprehensive analysis that had been done of many independent like protein analysis

496
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,280
like studies that were tracking like specifically muscle gain based on protein consumption.

497
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,040
And see, this is not totally settled. But the information that was assembled indicates that

498
00:47:51,040 --> 00:48:00,160
the ideal amount is actually 0.7 not one gram of protein per pound of body mass, but 0.7 grams.

499
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,520
As in if you weigh 100 pounds and you're lean, muscley guy, then you would want to eat 70 grams

500
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,880
of protein per day to gain muscle. And if you can eat more, but you won't get any benefit. That is

501
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,840
like basically the optimal amount. And like and the other important information that was found was

502
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,600
that because people that speculate for a long time like, you know, like way is basically milk protein

503
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,560
that comes from milk. You could eat like chicken to get straight up like muscle, you know, animal

504
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,880
protein, or you could get like like lima beans of protein, you could get like people have lima

505
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,440
bean protein you can just take. And then the analysis concluded, it didn't matter what kind of protein

506
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,680
they ate. As long as you just get that 0.7, you know, grams of protein per pound of lean body

507
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,400
mass, then you will gain at optimal speeds of muscle. And it doesn't matter what kind of protein

508
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,760
you eat. That was like the big conclusion. And like you'd think that we would have figured that

509
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,400
shit out way long ago. But only now are people starting to understand any of this shit. And

510
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,200
there's so much more to know that we don't know. And when you bring in the question of health,

511
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:14,240
specifically, health is such a complex thing. And there's so many systems that are involved,

512
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,960
like there is no going to be one answer like this is the healthiest way to live.

513
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,120
Because it's like the problem becomes is that like health, because like, no, it's not like all

514
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,000
human bodies work exactly the same way based on the region you're from, like your genetics kind of

515
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,760
like have tweaked a little bit to like better suit that environment. And then like, within that

516
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:42,000
individuals are different as well. So like, we got to like have some fucking futuristic tech or

517
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,880
just scans your body and like, all right, based on your genetic makeup and shit, this is your ideal

518
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,840
diet to keep you at peak condition. Hey, guys, here's a here's a here's a here's a conspiracy

519
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:59,760
theory for yes, since we talked about earlier. Yeah. So the dietitian sort of people in America,

520
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,920
it's it's quite a huge business, isn't it? Oh, it's panic. And if in and if everyone suddenly

521
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,640
got thin, they'd be out of business now, weren't they wouldn't they would that's certainly true.

522
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,360
So they are making people not get thinner, because they wouldn't right, right. No, this isn't even

523
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,200
a joke. Like it's I was actually going to bring this up next is that like, I think a reason a lot

524
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,840
of this alternate diet stuff is even coming up now is because with the internet, you can like,

525
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,240
there's financial incentive at this point to like delve deeper into this shit, because if you can

526
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,800
figure out the next like, diet craze, you can make a fuck ton of money off it. Yeah, which people

527
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,840
do six back shortcuts and what exactly. So like, there's, there's all this conflicting research

528
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,120
and stuff now, because everyone's like cherry picking, so their program can work. And it's just

529
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:52,080
like, again, the internet has this huge influx of information. Yeah, and I think the traditional

530
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,320
food pyramid was definitely because like there was like excess grains and like American like

531
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,480
industry. So they put grains as like the most important part so they could sell more that

532
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,600
shit. I think I think that's definitely good. And out of this swirling chaos of information,

533
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:11,360
things will emerge. I would argue though, that I think frankly, we really know the most important

534
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,840
things. The problem is, they require large amounts of effort over a long period of time,

535
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,920
because we know right now, if people, and this is available to like basically almost every American,

536
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:31,200
if you exercise probably every day, cardio and weightlifting, or maybe just both are good,

537
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:38,080
if you, if you exercise a lot, and you like eat lots of vegetables, like that really is the key,

538
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,440
just eat lots of vegetables and like beans and stuff, and do not eat junk food, like just,

539
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,880
just skip it all. Skip cake, skip cupcakes, you know, skip all that stuff, skip candy and you

540
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:55,440
just eat. I know, I'm just saying, see, that's the thing, nobody wants to do it. I mean, the really

541
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,720
disciplined like what we'd lift our bodybuilder guys, like they do it, because like it's kind of

542
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,280
important, like for whatever reason they've decided it's worth doing, worth sacrificing that stuff

543
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,680
to get these. But like to your average American who's just living their life and is like,

544
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,200
wait, wait, why are you asking me to like stop eating sugar, just that I'll get healthy, but like

545
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,280
that doesn't sound fun, and I have to do it forever. What's the fun of being healthy if you're miserable?

546
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,840
I mean, I, that's okay, see that, we need to break the, we need to break the conditioning,

547
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,840
you need to break the, the link between having sugar. No, no, no, I get you, I'm all, I'm all,

548
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:35,600
I'm all for health, it is, and it's definitely a struggle, but I would like to find a balance between

549
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,120
I ask that question, I ask that question myself all the time, like when me and Michelle go out,

550
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,760
Michelle eats like a bunny, and she'll just get a salad, and I'll be like, but I want a burger,

551
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,840
why can't I just have a cheeseburger with bacon? Why are you bullying me to get a salad, you fucking

552
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,640
asshole? Why do you hate me so much? And I just think like, I don't want to live in a world where

553
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,680
I can't eat a cheeseburger right now, so fuck it. Just get it, just get it, the lettuce wrap, it's

554
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,240
basically a salad at the end. I wish they offered that in the UK, I swear. I gotta do that. I don't

555
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,000
think they do, I don't think they offered it in the UK. That's, I've literally been living off of

556
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,240
bacon burgers and lettuce wraps. I kind of live in the ghetto, so I'm not sure they would have

557
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,680
lettuce wraps if I, if I try, but I do need to try, at least at some point. Five guys and Wendy's

558
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,200
will do it. I went to Burger King and they looked me like I had three heads when I asked for a

559
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,560
lettuce wrap, so I just walked out, and I was like, no, never mind. There's five guys and Wendy's not

560
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,280
too far. I should, I should make a trip and report back. Five guys is definitely better,

561
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,240
and it's worth it. There's five guys not too far from me. I never been there. Maybe we should both

562
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,400
try in the coming week to get there and try this lettuce wrap business. But I'm socially anxious,

563
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,680
I'll have to actually ask something off of the menu. No, no, no, it's on the menu. It's something

564
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,880
you can get there. It's not like a weird substitute. They offer lettuce wraps. Okay, okay, I'll look at

565
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,160
the menu. I look at the menu, and if they don't have it, I'm not going to ask about it. I mean,

566
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,840
every time I've asked for a lettuce wrap, they've just hit a button and it's come up on the screen

567
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,840
and it's on the receipt as well. Okay, that's a good sign. Okay, yeah, but you're in America. Maybe

568
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:17,440
they don't do that in UK. Okay, hang on. New subject real quick, social anxiety. Why in God's name

569
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,680
would it be a problem to go to a place, ask for a thing, and then to face the sheer terror in

570
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:30,720
realizing they do not have it on the menu. Just imagine the horror as their as that confused

571
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,320
look crosses their face. I don't like interacting with people. I've slowly been trying to conquer

572
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,880
this because I just like what I try and do in these situations is if like if the roles were

573
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,960
versed, I wouldn't give a fuck. So they don't give a fuck because I don't give a fuck about

574
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,360
anybody around me 99% of the time. And neither do they. I try that guiding principle. Yeah,

575
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:57,520
I try that too. I keep telling myself and that that sort of helps me just move in a public space.

576
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:05,600
I feel you. I feel you. I think, okay, don't don't give me a moment here. I think what would help

577
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:14,400
mage is if someone had a gun to your head. What helps me usually is to have someone near me

578
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,760
like next to me like a friend or something like that. That's usually helpful.

579
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,520
But it doesn't work miracles though. I still wouldn't be able to ask about the wrap.

580
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,400
I literally, you know, I used to have some, I don't know. And I still every once in a while,

581
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,000
I do like sometimes I'll just avoid going to the coffee machine like at work just like,

582
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,200
oh, there's someone there. I'll go later, which is a pussy move. And I shouldn't do,

583
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,720
but I still do do it sometimes. I think I told you guys about the time where I didn't go into a store

584
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,320
to buy myself Pokemon plushies. Yeah, even though you wanted it. Yeah. Yeah, which is so sad.

585
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,040
We all need to overcome this, you know, we all need to. How can we let anxiety about what people

586
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,560
say get in our way? I've been getting better. I mean, like, I think I talked about you specifically.

587
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,320
Yeah, just saying, just saying. It's I mean, you're never it's always going to be a struggle,

588
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,560
but like every time you push back, I find it gets a little bit easier the next time. It's

589
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,360
really it's a muscle, I think. And like if you if you don't exercise it, like I've noticed this

590
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,120
because like, I don't know, like I have a real job, I have to interact with people. So I'm kind

591
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:22,480
of forced to to exercise some of this stuff a lot. But like if I worked at home and like,

592
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,640
for example, was a YouTuber, I would like never have to go out, I would probably continue to be

593
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:33,440
an awkward weirdo and you know, who would not develop these these skills and stuff. So it's

594
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,880
kind of good that this is why I say the gun to your head is like, I try to think when I'm in

595
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,920
these situations sometimes less so now, but especially in the past, I think like, what if I

596
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,280
had to do this or I die, could I do it? And then I think, yeah, absolutely, I absolutely could.

597
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,800
And then that that I find that helpful, at least to a degree.

598
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,320
That puts it in perspective, it feels like the end of the world until you're like,

599
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:03,600
actually, it's really not. And I really I think a lot about welcome to the NHK when I'm in situations

600
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:09,200
like that, because it's basically social anxiety, the show. And, you know, I like because there's a

601
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:16,000
character in it, of course, famously, who like, just cannot do anything. He just his social anxiety

602
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,760
is so bad that he just doesn't leave his room ever. But then one time, like his sister leaves and

603
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,120
isn't coming to give him food. So if he stays there, he will just die. So basically, there's no

604
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,280
choice but to leave his room and go get a job. And he does so and he lived and actually he's way

605
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:39,440
happier afterward. So basically, what I'm saying is, hire a get biter to threaten your life and

606
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,760
say he's going to kill you. If you don't do XYZ, then if you don't get a lettuce wrap, he will shoot.

607
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,040
He'll put two in your skull. When there's no guns in the UK. At least we don't. Oh, I forgot. Okay,

608
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,760
well, what was it like? Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife. Knife are like the guns of

609
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,760
the UK now, basically. Potato Peelers. Potato Peelers. Potato Peelers. That's what it was. Oh

610
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:08,400
my God, you're right. That was a thing. Hellas. Goddamn. Sad as well. It's pretty sad. Pretty

611
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:15,120
strange. Well, shit. Do you want to want to pivot into into something that me and Digi were talking

612
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,320
about? And I want to bring it up. Actually, I was talking to Mage a little bit about it before we

613
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:24,480
started. So I guess Digi and May have been watching Pokemon analysis videos constantly,

614
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,320
because we have a computer now in the kitchen. So while they're cooking, old anime or like the

615
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,720
new one? Like the games and stuff. Oh, okay. They've been watching like just videos on like,

616
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,360
because I guess like there's a huge contingent of like the Pokemon fandom that's just dedicated to

617
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,520
like breaking the old games and finding weird shit out about them. We saw some of that and the

618
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,400
Pokemon race here on the program yesterday. But there's there's a fuck ton of that going on,

619
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,160
apparently. So they've been watching videos like that. But then I just happened to come down

620
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,440
when they were watching this video about a ROM hack of Pokemon Crystal called Pokemon Crystal

621
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,000
Clear. I've heard of that. And it was the coolest fucking shit I've ever seen in my goddamn life.

622
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,080
What's what's so cool that I haven't heard any of the details. So what Pokemon Crystal Clear is,

623
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,280
it's a ROM hack of Crystal, where you know how Pokemon Crystal usually plays. You start in Jodo,

624
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,880
you go to Council, you get like 16 badges, you can fight the leaf for it, and you go to Mount

625
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,960
Silver and fight red. Like that's the the progress of the game. Pokemon Crystal Clear changes it

626
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,480
so that you can start in Jodo or Kanto, either in New Bark or Pallet Town, you can customize

627
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,080
your character, you can choose from 25 different starters that all have different difficulty levels.

628
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:36,480
And then they've removed all the HM blocks in the entire map and edited it so you can go

629
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:42,480
anywhere you want in any order. So the game is completely open. It's like an open world.

630
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,880
Are there like, are there like levels? Like if you go to one area, will there just be like level

631
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,480
50 Pokemon? So like, well, I'm not going to go there. I'm gonna go. I think some of them have

632
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,400
like that, like the levels like scale and stuff. But I know the gym leaders can be done in any order

633
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,320
and they scale as you get more badges. So you can like you can go fight like Faulkner as the last

634
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,400
guy and have like a level 60 something Zapdos. But if you fight him first, he'll have his like

635
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,840
level nine Pidgey. So like it all scales like that. And you can rechallenge the gyms at any time at

636
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,280
any skill level. Now that's what I like to hear. Yeah. So like if you if you fight like say you

637
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,760
fight Faulkner first like you normally would and you have five badges, you can go back to the gym

638
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,800
and fight him at a level five gym level. So he has stronger guys. Fabulous. So it's fucking sick.

639
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,320
And so it's just like the best. I can't even imagine even wanting to play vanilla crystal

640
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,320
anymore because it sounds 10 times better. And then you run by default instead of walking. So

641
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,800
the movement speed is like triple nice. And there's tons of little like quality of life things

642
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,280
that enhance the sprites. The colors are more accurate. Oh, is the Pokemon Crystal the one

643
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,360
where you had to go to the mines and mine things? That's diamond. That's diamond. Okay. Yeah. Crystal

644
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,840
was like the remake, the addition to like golden silver, like the second gen games. So it's like

645
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,400
a Gameboy color rom hack. And like they just added a bunch of other little things like that. So

646
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,760
it's fucking amazing. And between that and SPV three, or just like it was just the Halo mod we

647
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,280
played on I am Games a couple weeks back where they just took Halo one for PC, reskinned it,

648
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,280
added all the guns and enemies from Halo two and three into it and like rebalance the whole

649
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,360
campaign around it and like added to the levels. Mods are just better than games. Like, like,

650
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:29,840
like, like, like the dedication of these people is amazing because like true Pokemon crystal clear

651
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:38,800
is a better idea than any Pokemon game that's come after it. Like that's just fucking sick. I think

652
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,280
based on Pokemon's track record, we basically we cannot count on the Pokemon company or Nintendo

653
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,080
to give us the Pokemon game that like we veterans would want. The rom hacks are the answer.

654
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,360
But like the weird thing is like and then like SPV three is a better Halo game than Halo four or

655
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:03,280
five by a significant degree. So it's just like, why are we playing games? We should just play mods.

656
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,840
Like how is like one person making these better like they're just better like mods are just I

657
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,720
would say I think there's there's there's something to be said that and this is not a criticism of

658
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,680
like the mods are but like the modders do have the benefit of kind of hindsight or like they're

659
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:24,480
able to take a game that was made you know 99% by someone else. They do the additional 1% of tweaks

660
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,280
that like everyone has agreed like this would make the game so much better and like they get to do

661
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,400
that. Maybe in like modern terms like like I know that I think in Hollow Knight for example,

662
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,240
like people thought that like the way that you get the final ultimate super duper extra like final

663
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:46,160
DLC DLC completion stuff was too hard. So I think they did nerf some of the bosses. That's a tool

664
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,520
that like is available to devs now that I kind of hate but they can make some of those tweaks that

665
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,960
might otherwise be like something that a modder would do. Here's here's the thing though that I

666
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,640
would argue there. I would say that Hollow Knight, this is kind of like I think Hollow Knight in terms

667
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,280
of like an indie game that we're talking about and like these mods they have more in common than

668
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,800
like a AAA game and Hollow Knight does because like what is Hollow Knight other than like someone

669
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,160
having an idea of like making a Metroidvania better and instead of just modding Symphony

670
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,480
of the Night or something they just made their own game. Like it's the same kind of idea like we

671
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,600
have these small teams of like individuals who are able to take these old concepts that like

672
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,640
modern companies are still iterating on but do it in a better way and I think it's just because

673
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,440
they're more in touch with the community and understand what people want. Yeah that's a big

674
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,480
one and I think there's like an old expression people say that it's like like with a big company

675
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,320
you you have like more manpower. What you're sacrificing is the unified vision. When you've

676
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:52,720
got like a small team or or like literally like one modder their unified vision like is able to

677
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,280
shine. So as long as they're able to like work with like other people's tools or maybe they make

678
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,160
like a really small project it can it can really shine kind of like like Undertale I guess which

679
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,440
is like a almost a one-man project or something. Yeah it's just it's core vision completely shines

680
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,240
through when you play that game or or Hall of Night with its like three-man team that made that

681
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,760
or whatever. So there's I mean I think it's just that like corporate influence and this is why I

682
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,760
think like Final Fantasy has kind of lost its way because like what was Final Fantasy? Final Fantasy

683
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:29,520
was it had a fairly big team but like they still had I don't know kind of like an indie attitude-ish

684
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,200
where like they would take some people's like weird kooky ideas like like the Sorceress and Final

685
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,600
Fantasy 8 was actually originally an idea they were going to put into Final Fantasy 7 but like

686
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,600
there was just too much shit already in that game like all right we're going to save this one and

687
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,840
then they made that kind of like the conceit like the main story of Final Fantasy 8. But the point

688
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,320
is it was just like weird shit that like people came up with and then they implemented because

689
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,040
like their their main thing was let's make an interesting game with these cool ideas that we

690
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,040
like and it like I'm not saying that they weren't thinking about like how to make a really successful

691
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:09,280
blockbuster because that definitely was on their minds but like they didn't it wasn't a Final Fantasy

692
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,040
15 that was like bait like as soon as Tabata took over not perhaps not originally with Nomura but

693
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:21,040
with Tabata it was like let's make a game that people like and will want to buy and that is like

694
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,160
the foremost thing so it's like community tell us what game we should make like tell us what you

695
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,360
want because we don't fucking know we're not auteurs we're not like creative people who are here to

696
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,800
like implement a vision no no no we're here providing a service and that's all we're here doing

697
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:43,120
you know it's the difference between like those two visions I guess something like that yeah

698
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:51,920
mods are better play mods are better yep we agreed okay guys hey uh switching topic I guess um

699
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,480
have you have you guys you probably have talked in a podcast before about Goblin Slayer right

700
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,720
yeah we I think a little bit not not too much okay because because I just I just watched the

701
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,360
four episodes that are out now okay okay what do you think I hold up but first can you like

702
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:15,360
break me on the controversy like I know people were saying rape is bad basically and so the

703
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:20,960
controversy is is to summarize it's it's this basically so the entire controversy was based

704
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,080
only on the first episode and nobody cares anymore as far as I can tell but but it was

705
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:32,080
basically this it was that the um the depiction of the violence and especially the rape that

706
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:38,080
was the big issue that you know canonically 100% does happen in episode one of Goblin Slayer um

707
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,880
was like explicit did not kind of warn people about the content because the show was like

708
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,800
advertised is kind of like a PG-13 um and then it also though I would say the rape does not

709
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,840
actually happen on screen it does technically happen off screen um and then and then uh people

710
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:02,880
felt that it also kind of sexualized and almost glorified the the rape and sexual violence and

711
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,640
normal violence okay I disagree with that part okay because you've watched four episodes now

712
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,600
yeah you've done way more research than anyone who's actually like who wrote those articles or

713
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:20,400
anything what it was like they showed just enough of that part to sort of to give people

714
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,040
idea of what was happening but they didn't glorify it they didn't sexualize it they didn't make it

715
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:33,360
look appealing at all and people who say that they did it it's just a grasping of straws honestly

716
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:39,600
like uh I feel like honestly no one would have given a shit if that scene wasn't there and people

717
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:45,840
are just being like way too sensitive about it I think I mean I if it was like PG-13 and stuff okay

718
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:51,280
I get it like like if I had been watching and that just came up without me knowing what I was getting

719
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,040
into it would have probably shocked me a little bit but like at the same time like we also have

720
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,920
anime like Attack on Titan and stuff and there's gonna be like gruesome gory shit out there it's

721
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,920
it's not surprising based on what people said though I think the answer is really quite clear

722
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:14,080
it's just that people are just super uncomfortable with rape I really think that's what it comes

723
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:23,200
down to and I I get it but I mean I don't know like it's it's weird multiple people got murdered

724
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:30,080
murdered dead they are deceased and yet the rape is the thing that people more focused on like I

725
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,240
get it I get it it's people frankly people just care more about sexual violence than just straight

726
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,720
up murder and stuff yeah that's it that's really all there is to it I think it's because when there's

727
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,000
when there's sexual assault like you know the victim could still talk about how bad it was but

728
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,160
if someone's dead they're fucking dead yeah I guess there's something there's kind of a finality to

729
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:56,000
murder that makes us kind of not care as much I sort of desensitize I think I did not pronounce

730
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,600
that right there's no murder survivors groups like making being activists and talking about how

731
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,960
murder is so which is kind of that that really sucks because like we really should be we should

732
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:13,040
be I would say opposing murder more than we're opposing rape I think that's fair to say I think

733
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:19,200
one is a worse crime or at the very least equally because there is no I don't know I'm confused

734
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:25,200
they're both terrible crimes basically but okay so the controversy aside though it's an interesting

735
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:31,200
anime I I'm actually interested to see where they're going I guess like minor spoilers I'm not sure

736
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,240
what exactly spoilers they're gonna slay some goblins basically I really like the character of the

737
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:44,640
goblin slayer he's just like not there and he's so calm and just like uh-huh yes affirmative

738
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,920
basically sort of character and then later on you find out his backstory which is very brief like

739
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,440
they didn't go you know into weepy story time but yeah you don't really need it yeah it was just

740
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,960
enough to know the fact and like I think because they didn't like the way they framed it is like

741
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:06,560
it's a story that a lot of people share he's not the only one he's not the special little boy

742
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,280
everyone like a lot of people have to go through this pain and yet people still dismiss goblins as

743
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,040
like a not a big threat and therefore he dedicates himself to slaying the goblins because no one

744
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:24,080
else does that was definitely a thing that a lot of people in the controversy were saying that like

745
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:29,760
because all those characters in episode one are kind of they're sort of framed to be like our main

746
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:36,800
character party guys and then people felt so sidelined by the fact that like oh my god guys

747
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,720
these characters like they didn't get fleshed out enough and like it was so weird to just watch them

748
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:47,200
all die when like I get why they're thinking but that litter that is the point of goblin slayer to

749
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:53,920
have they have they watched overlord specifically season three overlord probably not i was i was in

750
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:59,840
pain i was in torment what why what happened and i haven't people died and i like those people we

751
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:06,960
barely met them and the like we knew enough about them to emphasize and and empathize and you know

752
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,280
with me and empathizing with things and it's just it was it was terrible like um i guess spoilers

753
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:19,520
small spoilers for season three of overlord there's this girl and she has like she she's from

754
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,880
noble family and um but but they're falling on rough times and her parents are refusing to give

755
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:31,440
up the noble life so she has to go adventuring to to settle debts but she she has like no more i'm

756
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,400
gonna take my sisters and they're like two younger sisters they're both twins it's like i'm gonna take

757
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,720
my sisters and leave after this mission and they go to on this mission and she dies she not only dies

758
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:49,360
her body gets divided upon like the minions of the overlord and her voice is given to like one of

759
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:55,360
the maids it's just it's horrifying and then we get the scene we get the scene where like the

760
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,520
the two little sisters like oh i hope she comes back soon i can't wait we're going on a trip when

761
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:06,240
she comes back and it's just like you had to you had to go there you had to go there is to pull out

762
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,400
on your heart strings you know it's funny this whole goblin slayer thing because i haven't seen

763
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,920
the show i don't give a fuck whatever um i think i think i always thought like the reactions to like

764
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,920
rape and stuff is is overblown because like the the the shows that they talk about it's never

765
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,720
portraying rape is a good thing it's always done as like a hey look how fucking bad this is yeah

766
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:31,280
exactly so like that's the thing we're all on the same page about that like like do you know

767
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,280
that the villains and stories do bad things that's why they're villains that's always been my position

768
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:40,880
about it like let them do the bad things that just further uh you know reinforces the fact that

769
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,360
these are bad and shouldn't be done and this is a character you don't want to like doing something

770
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:50,080
you don't like yeah and there's a technically a reason why they do it because the i think what

771
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,720
what it is they there are no female goblins so they have to do this to reproduce to produce

772
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:00,080
that's in their nature that's great all right that's see that's that's kind of like disgusting but

773
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:06,160
also interesting but like okay here's my thing i was going to say can you imagine with all this

774
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:11,120
god would sell your bullshit can you imagine if the final episode of berserk 97 aired today

775
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:20,320
the shit show the shit show would be amazing the thing is okay the thing is the rape of kaspa

776
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:28,400
sorry the rape of kaska is an extremely fappable scene if if you can just like look

777
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:33,920
past the darkness that's happening but the thing is that is that is kind of the point

778
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:40,000
because it is it is it is an incredibly complex situation and i talked about this in my like

779
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,840
my videos about griffith and stuff like i said before and i stand by it it almost kind of looks

780
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:52,880
like kaska is enjoying it and it's on purpose because kaska is experiencing so many emotions

781
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,360
she has loved griffith and she's finally having sex with him and like it's it's it

782
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,920
look rapes bad how many times do you have to say it but like there's complex things going on here

783
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,600
and that's what makes the scene like so like discomforting it's literally art it's literally

784
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,000
art and look i'm sorry if like you have for whatever it's a personal thing or whatever like

785
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,840
you just can't stand rape i get it but like other people can stand it and can like you know

786
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:30,480
appreciate the the complex stuff being gotten at here and i just like this is it's literally marge

787
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:36,400
simpson turning off the tv and saying like i don't enjoy this so no one can enjoy this uh like this

788
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,920
is fictional you know there is no one actually being hurt but the thing is all this is propagated on

789
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,720
all the outrage for goblin slayer and you know the the whole thing about berserk and all that stuff

790
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:52,560
it all comes from i do think it comes from people perceiving the sexualization of the scene and like

791
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,960
the the almost glorification of it because i actually do think i do think that the author

792
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:04,880
having read the manga i've read a lot of the manga i do think that the author uh is kind of

793
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,680
sort of glorifying and sexualizing the scene i i do think that is happening the thing is though

794
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:16,000
i just don't mind it because i'm aware that like it's like yeah he's slipping in a little titillation

795
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,240
into the scene that's really fucked up i i do think that's happening but like how could he even avoid

796
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:28,240
it the man is an artist he is a mangaka this is a fictional thing that's happening no one is actually

797
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:34,000
being hurt but here's the thing this is where people this is why i understand why people deviate

798
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:41,680
from my opinion on this it's because the people who are outraged they perceive rape culture to be real

799
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:47,600
and they they think that like ah okay this is it this is what is propagating rape culture and they

800
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,400
see it and they think to themselves this is like this is going to hurt people because this is making

801
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:59,520
the problem worse you know it's it's not encouraging how much have we seen people being killed on screen

802
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:08,160
and in video games and yada yada and like i don't think i'm sorry this is my head i mean no hi that

803
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,240
that's the reasonable place to go to from there it's because it's again it's like i said it's

804
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:17,600
because nobody there's nobody left alive who can talk about how bad being murdered is yeah but like

805
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,200
i mean like the statistics it's not just because you you you see like people killing other people

806
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:29,520
on screen or in games or joke about murder or even suicide whatever it's not like it's not it

807
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,040
hasn't shaped the society to be okay with it it's still bad it's still against the law and it's

808
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,920
still a terrible thing and like we shouldn't forget but like i mean it's it's obvious and this was

809
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,720
said before but like the point of goblin slayer is these things are so evil with what they're

810
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:51,200
doing the goblin slayer is here to destroy them completely for what they have done uh it like

811
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:58,080
the thing is it is a literal anti rape message i guess it is anti but the the the sexualization

812
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:03,440
nugget in it people like like feminists and people who are really you know on this stuff they'll think

813
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:09,600
like uh you know they they say that they're saying that they're anti rape but really they're glorifying

814
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,920
it with this uh with the sexy ladies here on screen it's like ooh yeah that's that's good let's go do

815
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:21,600
that team but it's like it literally shows uh the goblins to be a bigger threat than people to give

816
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:28,320
them credit for and like how nasty and vile and terrible they really are i think that's the point

817
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:33,200
that's why the shock is like these goblins that everyone that dismisses is just little nuisances

818
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,840
they are actually these cretins i think that's the word you've just got to talk like when people

819
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,480
disagree i always think it's important to when there's a debate to agree on the terms of the

820
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,920
debate and and to be able to articulate the other person's message i think people who object to the

821
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,200
show would would concede that like yes the fact that goblin slayer is murdering them like yes it

822
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:59,120
like it's against that it's showing in that way but they would also argue that like it is also true

823
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:06,240
that the show is kind maybe even covertly or maybe maybe they'd say it's like unconscious like patriarchal

824
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:12,640
you know uh uh whatever stuff coming out that it is also kind of sexualizing and glorifying it in

825
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:18,480
you know these ways sexualized like we there weren't any sort of specific shots that i could

826
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,560
really point to that we're like that's the funny thing though it in the anime because the anime

827
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,440
is different from the manga the manga is more explicit but in the anime like you we don't see

828
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,520
actual rape happening on screen though it's it's implied to be happening and going on you know

829
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:39,040
but like we do see a girl get her clothes ripped off and she is an anime girl which means that she's

830
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:46,960
pretty attractive so like how does one how does one negotiate this to like make it clear what's

831
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:52,720
happening but not to titillate the audience yeah i don't know make her attractive i guess make them

832
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:58,640
ugly or yeah unattractive or i i guess you could like not show her body as much if you like kind

833
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,160
of show that like clothes are being ripped off but you don't show her on screen i don't even think

834
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:11,200
that would matter i think it's the idea itself has to be purged yeah i feel i feel like even if the

835
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:16,400
author had made all the steps to make it as least attractive as possible people would still have a

836
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:21,280
cow about the scene existing like it could have just been like the goblin slayer showing up and

837
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:26,000
someone ran up to him some ran in just like my wife was raped by goblins and that would be bad enough

838
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,120
yeah i suppose that's true like if the show if the show was exactly the same but we we just didn't

839
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,680
even address the whole goblin rape question and we just showed goblins murdering people

840
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:43,200
i don't think anyone would complain i think there would be no complaints which is i mean yeah people

841
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:47,200
just get fucked up about this stuff yeah like i said like we have stuff like attack on titan have

842
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:51,200
you guys seen attack on titan yeah like nobody complains about the violence and attack on titan

843
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:57,600
even though it's it's horrific and yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's just weird it's it's a weird it's a

844
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:03,440
weird thing as a culture we just get really fucked up about like sexual stuff yeah basically my

845
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:10,640
my stance was four episodes in uh minus that whole controversy non-traverse nonsense it's an

846
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:17,760
interesting show i like it it's like i'm a huge fan of the manga so i am i am like um i'm a really

847
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:23,920
big fan of like fantasy sort of rpg sort of things and you know it's set in that sort of world

848
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,560
where like they have a guild they have like a like a system with low levels and and they take on

849
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,680
quests and there's magic and it's like it's all the things i like but it's also it's also a very

850
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:40,480
gritty sort of depiction of it and that's what i find interesting that's kind of the point that's

851
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:46,720
kind of the point i'm gonna predict something uh actually most likely no one will ever care about

852
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,360
goblin slayer as much again and like i doubt like just because people care about stuff that's new

853
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,520
they don't really care about stuff that's old but i'm just gonna like if we continue the same

854
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,960
train of logic of objecting to this stuff later on in the series um there is a character called the

855
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,640
sword maiden who is like she's like a legendary warrior and she's a total badass and she's extremely

856
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:11,520
like curvaceous and like sexualized and stuff and like that that's fine i don't think people would

857
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:18,560
really complain about that but the thing is canonically she was a rape victim of goblins and

858
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,440
it's like like way in her past this happened to her it was only after that that she like

859
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,520
got strong and like became like a badass sword maiden and then like defeated the evils of the

860
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:33,200
world and stuff but she's still kind of fucked up about goblins the thing is though like i don't

861
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:39,760
know i feel like the thing is you can choose to find a fence with anything so like here's a thought

862
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:45,280
maybe uh like rape victims will be offended by this character because like oh yeah she just

863
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:50,960
got over her trauma look at them trivializing rape victims here like but the thing and then on the

864
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:57,120
other hand this character still has flashbacks to this event so like she isn't completely over it

865
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,760
somebody else might say oh look at us they're telling us that we can never get over our trauma

866
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:09,360
like what a problem at there's no way to win with the topic yeah yeah yeah i don't know what the

867
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:15,360
answer is i the answer is freedom as far as i'm right no like it's libertarian mind your fucking

868
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:21,920
own business and relax it's the idea of like these because like people who are this bent out of shape

869
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:27,760
about it are just gonna say the only answer is like this stuff is off limits it cannot be talked about

870
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,640
cannot be done but take it seriously basically basically if you were if you felt uncomfortable

871
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:39,120
by a good good good job that's what they were trying to do i think yeah it's just a question of

872
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:45,600
people maybe don't like to feel discomfort or something i mean i i don't know like i the thing

873
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:53,120
i think people's outrage makes sense if they have a worldview that i don't think makes sense so like

874
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:58,240
right well that's that's the whole problem with discussion nowadays anyways there's yeah like

875
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,200
the baseline is different so like yeah that's right that's we're not even having the same

876
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,280
conversation as like the people we're talking about would be happy so it's like it's impossible to come

877
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,840
to terms yeah i'm not saying you you know you're supposed to like it or whatever like you definitely

878
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:18,640
don't have it was not meant to be liked the scene but like come to terms with the fact that the

879
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:26,320
scene exists for a reason and the reason is not to titillate people it's just i mean so don't be

880
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,280
outraged about people we're connecting the goblins to the jews and we're just like throwing out

881
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:37,200
that whole business really you guys didn't hear i mean i mean you know i guess i won't drop any

882
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:43,360
names but there are some videos out there that specifically said like hmm big nose little vermin

883
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,480
that this guy wants to literally genocide and wipe out where have i heard of that before and it's

884
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:56,160
just like guys you need to relax there are no connections here oh my god noses oh my god

885
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,600
that all that kind of says more about the people who are looking into it yeah i said a million times

886
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:06,880
but still iran it reminds me of that whole apu controversy oh my god and you hear he's gone

887
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,680
you hear that he's gone yeah yeah i love i love how there's this amazing brain dump that came out

888
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,000
like a week before that just like totally clean the clock of this whole thing is like yeah of

889
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,640
course this is ridiculous and like a week later like and it's gone it's just where does this logic

890
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:30,560
end because now now they're saying that minorities need to be displayed within a very narrow parameters

891
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:36,400
that are of what's acceptable and like who exactly is the arbiter of what's acceptable and what's not

892
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:44,800
because at this point is a well-developed and rich character and but now because he has i guess roots

893
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,560
in like his accent and the fact that he's voiced by a white guy uh we're just opening the door here

894
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:57,680
and uh opening the floodgates to let like people pulley this is i don't know man i just don't

895
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:03,360
think this is the right direction for the people to be going with this kind of stuff it's tiring

896
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:09,600
feels very wrong okay i'm tired i'm tired yeah okay you know what i want to go lay down and

897
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,680
forget about humanity for a while well hang on before we do that we've got a couple of voicemails

898
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:18,480
to listen to oh yeah okay please cheer us up let's all right let's go to it we've i think we've got

899
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:24,800

922
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:02,160
these are all true the content is slowing down a little bit um for me it's because i'm working on

923
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:08,240
like bigger more complicated projects and i want to do we aga with stuff more but i just don't have

924
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:12,880
the fucking time to get everything done i need to get done every week basically now he's right

925
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,000
but i'm working on it uh what's your excuse everybody else Nate you just gotta stop skateboarding

926
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,080
so much i won't i need to get that pokemon go stop every day dammit all right question why don't

927
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,880
you just do a we agua while you're skateboarding just record get a laugh mic and just talk about

928
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,520
something while you're skateboarding just you know all the time there's there's something to be said

929
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,680
that i've kind of fallen into a trap with we agua where like the the point of the series was to get

930
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:47,520
a video done every week about something and like to make it cool like make it good you know

931
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,480
reasonably speaking but the most important thing was just to get a video out every week

932
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,160
at the time i took the format you failed well i did for a while a good long while like i was doing

933
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:03,040
it well um currently it's not living up to its name which is fair uh but um like i just styled

934
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,720
it after the mea math of a content that i was doing and just kept doing that and i've still

935
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:11,440
been doing that i've sort of fallen into a trap where i'm just like now i feel i'm forced to live

936
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:15,840
up to like a certain standard where the the like quality is kind of creeping up like the last ones

937
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:24,240
i was like in hawaii for uh uh and well the one after that i wasn't yeah i i need to get them done

938
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:29,600
i think your your your old habits are creeping back in i think the whole point of we agua was

939
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,240
you wanted to get it done first and the quality the quality wasn't like not that the quality is not

940
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:39,760
important but like i think you're you're obsessing over the uh intimate details that aren't necessary

941
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:45,440
i think you should just go back make weekly do what you can in a week and people will be fine

942
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,760
with it and you just need to break your own conditioning it's like sugar you're you're

943
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:55,200
you're addicted to video sugar get off that shit protein there's definitely something to be said for

944
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:01,280
that uh and i should seriously consider that stuff right now i'm not even thinking about it because

945
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,840
i'm doing something else but once this current thing is done i will have to think seriously about

946
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:11,280
that there might not be one till the end of the year depending on how things go my god i i know i

947
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:17,680
know it's disgraceful but why i'm a genius yearly all right new series i'm working on it people

948
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,880
all right that's enough about this shit i'll get back to you we'll get back i'm still doing stuff

949
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,040
every week devlogs every week after you're into devtober work on the game uh it's going to keep

950
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,400
going uh this is my life now i'm probably gonna do lots more uh i'm getting back into doing more

951
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:36,320
3d modeling stuff once this uh this demo slash alpha slash whatever ends up being is out because

952
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,720
i want to be out by the end of the month will it be out now as people are listening uh i don't

953
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,240
think so my plan is to have something public facing out on november 8th because that's when

954
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:50,320
i turn 30 i want to have some cool out i need i need something to like to uh to to to to take

955
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:56,080
off the sting of yeah yeah that's what this is it's actually a really good goal i like that a lot

956
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:01,440
i should do something similar when i turn 30 it'll be two years people two years god just that's

957
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,920
cool how about you mage what's your excuse where's your content it's a very long excuse i don't want

958
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:11,120
to get into it uh okay fair enough there's a lot of a lot of small things they're just kind of piled

959
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,560
up together basically if you want to get us to make more content the easiest ways to give us more

960
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,040
time the best way to have more times to have more money i'm just saying that's true that's for you

961
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:25,760
guys that's for you guys for me it didn't didn't matter how much money you threw at mage mage i'm

963
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,680
them that's the answer i feel bad i feel bad mage needs more convincing the way to get more

964
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:38,080
convincing is give me more time to convince her way to give me more time to give me the money you

965
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:44,240
want to give her you ain't wrong brother all right now let's go to our next one here one spars

966
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:51,040
back with another message all right one spar hit us hit us boy hey guys just uh here at home walking

967
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:58,160
around sipping some coffee this morning and uh i think i came up with a uh pretty good idea for

968
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:14,960
a new pcp intro um give it a listen tell me what you think somebody once told me the world was

969
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,480
i've heard enough that's enough thank you one spark uh you're fired

970
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,040
i think there was actually something at the end of that underlying do you think there's an

971
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:30,800
underlying message here that the new pcp theme has a strong undercurrent of detractors you know

972
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,520
there's something going on with that maybe we should i don't know revisit this issue i'm always

973
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:40,480
open to revisiting stuff and why did you guys vote for it like you know offense to the person who made

974
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:50,080
it it was good but like you made everybody liked it no not everybody not everybody sasuke pro may

975
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:56,400
just talk in mad shit on you right now please send her a scathing email about how she's bullying

976
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:04,560
you online i'm not i just didn't like a thing as much as you guys did well fair enough fair enough

977
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:08,560
um and actually you'll see him in the comments every once in a while being like yeah thank god

978
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:15,120
you shortened it today i fucking hate my own song yeah yeah so i mean if you that was gonna be the

979
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,720
case you probably should uh thought about that before you decide to make an intro of a podcast

980
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,080
100 plus episodes deep i mean it frankly it's our fault not his i guess you know if it is truly

981
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:30,320
shit well whatever um all right here we go this does blame to go around okay here we go next one's

982
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:41,520
from i really mean it is another message all right do it members of the pcb hear me now as i whisper

983
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:49,920
to you in divine doubt you will all look yourselves in the mirror and decide who you want to be today

984
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:59,280
tomorrow and when you are no longer here we all have a legacy and i'll have fever dreams about you

985
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,080
guys when i am in the retirement home

986
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:11,600
oh was he playing the xylophone while he recorded that maybe i don't i don't i don't want to look at

987
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:18,240
the mirror though oh ouch i don't like i don't like the person that stares back at me oh christ damn

988
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:22,480
that's uh that's serious that's like the opposite of what that message is about it's about becoming

989
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:28,240
your best self mage for me it's like for me it's like that clip of uh of that movie sure what was

990
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:32,960
that show like time warp time leap or something where the guy is like am i retarded and then he

991
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:38,800
looks in the mirror and then like he's in like a down syndrome guy's body um that's me so i avoid

992
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,200
looking in the mirror is what quantum leap was it quantum it was quantum leap that's the one that's

993
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:48,720
the one mage i got a fix for you by the way quick fix for the mirror uh painted purple that's that's

994
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:53,680
a good idea let's put a put a purple filter over it yeah uh is that is that a physical thing mage

995
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:02,000
or is that like an emotional thing like both okay well that's sad uh i'd say work on that in some way

996
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:09,440
if possible please i am i am i i i make peace with my loathing of myself well that's always good to

997
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:15,920
hear uh all right next making peace is step one step two is declaring a war on it and crushing it

998
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:22,400
entirely i'll i'll i'll hit it when it doesn't see it exactly you know i actually do think about uh

999
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,600
his points fairly frequently like when i look back like will i look back on like for example we

1000
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:33,680
aga was with much love some of them a bit some of them not as much like what i'll what i i mean

1001
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:38,160
you know what's my best work you know like the for me i think my best work is like the gurren

1002
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:45,760
login videos i really like my final fantasy 15 uh what is it unchained unflamed whatever it was

1003
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:51,280
i love that video um i don't know some of the some of the oh the the musical stuff like the

1004
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:57,120
smash bros stuff i really love uh i don't know so like so like yeah i do think about like what do i

1005
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:02,640
want to like have my legacy be in terms of like youtube and then also like what's the point of

1006
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:09,200
the content overall like entertainment is good and that's a valuable service but i mean whatever

1007
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:13,360
i've talked about this a bunch you know i i'd like to think that i'm making a positive difference

1008
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:20,000
in the world and not just you know being i mean my whole goal right now and the reason i stopped

1009
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,960
doing youtube pretty much entirely is because i was just like well the only thing i care about

1010
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,960
is like am i going to be satisfied when i'm dying that what i did in my life was worth it

1011
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:35,600
yeah and youtube was not the answer so i was like well i won't make as much money and i by not shilling

1012
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,720
on youtube but fuck it the money is not going to make me happy when i'm fucking dying of cancer

1013
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:46,720
from cell phone radiation exposure at 45 it's like we're all gonna die that way it's a bouncing act

1014
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:51,920
because like i mean for me i'm i'm currently sacrificing large amounts of my time to work at

1015
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:58,000
my day job programming um which is fine but none of it is really adding to much of a legacy that i

1016
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:04,320
value particularly much but i i'm i'm basically sacrificing that time to obtain the money that

1017
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:10,720
i feel will allow me to springboard into you know doing that stuff more and building something that

1018
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:17,760
i value and i'm glad that i worked on and stuff so i don't know like there's a balancing act i guess

1019
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,880
you don't want to like literally die and then you like because if you literally die making your art

1020
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,120
then well then you won't get as much made and so that might be less but on the other side if you

1021
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:31,920
if you spend too long working on your normie job or whatever and you save a bunch of money and then

1022
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,320
you switch then like maybe you've wasted too much of your life you know if you've done that and you

1023
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,880
you're coming out below what you would have if you'd just done it say uh it's a struggle for sure

1024
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:46,240
yeah well i'll also you know thought about such things but i'm sort of like like i said i'm sort

1025
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:52,640
of at peace with the idea of like um i don't regret my life up till this point even though i feel

1026
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:58,720
like i wasted a lot of it though you know defined wasted i'm happy with what i've done in a way but

1027
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:04,160
at the same time i know that i'm just another drop in the ocean i'm not gonna break any new grounds

1028
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,800
or there's not going to be much left of me once i leave this place so we kind of not with that

1029
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,800
attitude mage come on but i'm okay with that i mean not everyone is born to be a name in the

1030
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:20,880
history books you know take take for example like look at like toby fox for example so sure

1031
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:27,920
right now undertale is a huge meme um like it's a good game everybody likes it um and you know

1032
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,360
whatever and it's a meme so people talk about it a lot will undertale make much difference in the

1033
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:40,320
long run of like humanity you know will it because like it's pretty almost objective that like

1034
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,880
undertale for example is like more influential than like all of us so like okay fair enough

1035
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:51,280
but even something like undertale like it's just a game right so like will it it was it

1036
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:57,600
has been given as a present to the pope so right so it cured world peace finally was solved uh we

1037
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:04,640
did it no i think undertale it does like you know we i think i think it has staying potential it's

1038
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:10,560
definitely going to be remembered in many years by a lot of people and who knows when it's relative

1039
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,560
i guess yeah like when the heat death of the universe happens like literally nothing will

1040
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:20,320
remain so you know except undertale except undertale except undertale yeah him and the

1041
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,160
pope will be floating out in space with this copy of undertale the heat death of the universe is

1042
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:33,360
sans it is sans yeah it's a heavy topic it's a heavy topic i don't know just try i say i say

1043
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:38,080
try to make the world around you a better place don't be a burden on the people

1044
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,800
that you know or that you care about be be of benefit to them and there's lots of ways to be

1045
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:47,360
of benefit not strictly financial there's lots of ways to do it so as long as you feel that you're

1046
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:52,480
contributing and that you're making the world better around you than it was when you get there

1047
01:39:52,480 --> 01:40:00,400
as opposed to worse neutral is okay but you want to be a plus then let's go yeah yeah okay let's go

1048
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:05,040
on to the next one this is from uh from a rupt rupt so much so much for making us happier

1049
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:13,920
okay so bullying bullying do you guys ever get bullied in high school middle school or

1050
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:19,120
shit like that and like i'm not trying to be repetitive because you guys probably got a lot

1051
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:25,280
of this question on twitter um back the day but it's just that i don't understand how bully

1052
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:36,720
works because just fucking fight the guy okay like fighting a bully is exactly a win-win situation

1053
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:45,440
because either the guy can lose to you or you you can be seen as a hero who fought a fucking bully

1054
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,840
and like people will like you because people don't like bullies in general it's just a question

1055
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:54,160
just a question like i don't understand how bully works it's probably because it's a us problem

1056
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:59,600
at a i live in south america but it's just a fucking question but i love you guys i'm not in the us

1057
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,880
but okay that's true well okay i can i can answer this question yeah the people the people who are

1058
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:10,960
targeted by bullies by people especially in the west they're targeted because they're pussies

1059
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:16,080
and they're not gonna fight back yes that's true that that cut out for me i didn't hear

1060
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:21,760
they're targeted what uh the people who get targeted by bullies they get targeted because

1061
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:28,320
they're pussies and they won't fight back for the most part yeah i can tell you my story with bullying

1062
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:33,840
there was a there was a girl i think she was my age i'm not sure she got on my case for who knows

1063
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:40,480
what i really really no reason at all uh but and she was smaller than me so you think you think i'd

1064
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,960
have no problem however the problem with her was she was never alone she was always with guys like

1065
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:52,560
let's say i was 14 and she was 14 and she was with guys 19 years old way bigger than me at least

1066
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:58,560
two of them at at each side with her at no point was i able to sort of fight her back and even

1067
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:06,560
actually i did fight her back and um she she need me in the forehead with her knee

1068
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:14,560
and it is it wasn't just physical you know and it was also psychological she psychologically

1069
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,640
tormented me and the fact that she wasn't in school or in my neighborhood i could never

1070
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:23,200
see her coming i didn't know when i'm gonna meet her but she was never alone and whenever i did

1071
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:29,280
it was never in a public place where people could help me it was it was it was it was mortifying

1072
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:36,320
it was just like i felt i never felt so helpless when i was in my life she's sort of like i think

1073
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:41,200
she was kind of like what broke the you know uh jokingly why i left violence streak in a way

1074
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:46,640
sure sure did you i mean uh i'm just curious did you like talk to like your parents or like

1075
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,200
school people or anything like that school people are irrelevant she wasn't in my school

1076
01:42:51,200 --> 01:43:00,400
i did talk to my mom once or twice i told her about it um and you know my mom tried to help and

1077
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,520
we actually went one time she you know saw the bruise on my forehead so she went we went out and

1078
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:14,000
tried to find her and uh she she we did find her and uh she she talked to her and she was giving

1079
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,800
my mom such a you know shitty eating grin that my mom um couldn't help herself and smacked her

1080
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:26,880
across the face but because of that we weren't able to go to the police because my mom would get

1081
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,640
in trouble for hitting a minor god all right she kind of blew it by doing that because it would

1082
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:36,240
have been good to go to the police the violent violence runs in the family holy shit uh the next

1083
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,440
time i think the last time i saw her was during camp not the not the same year as you know the

1084
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:45,760
whole incident with the arms things uh but that was i should have dropped her off at sue story

1085
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:52,640
i almost ended up in the same um building as her but thankfully we didn't so for the the whole week

1086
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,480
my my mission was to avoid her at all costs to let her know that i was there but for the last

1087
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:04,960
i think two days i blew it or rather it wasn't my fault it was it was my counselors of the house

1088
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:12,640
fault because he was he was he was like he was almost i he was a helper so i think he was a teenager

1089
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:18,320
almost an adult young adult person and there was some for lack of a better word skanks in my house

1090
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:26,240
literally sucking up to him probably sucking up to him lads he yeah so he was very much on their

1091
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:33,840
side and they were friends with that girl so i had no chance women's sexual uh uh advantages

1092
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:40,160
can definitely be weaponized in situations like this it's a unique advantage uh like if a guy comes

1093
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:45,520
to you and has an issue and a girl disagrees and she'll fuck you i'm just saying i'm just saying

1094
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:50,400
you who are you gonna who are you gonna go with i did i did complain to the higher ups at the camp

1095
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:58,400
and the and the person i complained to she was in charge of our house and uh uh she she said she

1096
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,640
lived in the same neighborhood as the girl and she was like oh but you know she she she never

1097
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:09,120
seemed like she was trouble and like but she is and yeah they couldn't really help two faced

1098
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:16,400
bitch yeah the basically it just sounds like like to to the guy's question it's just like

1099
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:23,280
there they they find people who can't defend themselves in this way uh yeah like they specifically

1100
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:28,400
target people who seem vulnerable because if they yeah like if you're if you're a real bully

1101
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,640
like if you find someone who gives you resistance you don't bully them you bully someone else

1102
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:39,200
exactly yeah and i don't like i guess i see his point i guess like just i mean i got bullied in

1103
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:45,840
high school all the time because i was a pathetic little bitch and uh yeah and it was not cool yeah

1104
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,440
it's not like it's totally my fault i blame myself the bullies in the movies and children's cartoons

1105
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:55,680
whatnot that they were the portrayed it looks so easy that all you have to do is stand up to them

1106
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:59,840
and be top dog and stuff like that but it doesn't work out like that even if you beat them today

1107
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:05,520
then you have to beat them the next day and the thing about a bully a bully is inherently

1108
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:11,280
immoral with what they're doing so like if you like beat up a bully they will go play the victim

1109
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:17,920
and then you have become the aggressor or or or they'll get their friends to help beat you up

1110
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,400
the next time it's not going to be a fair fight next time i mean yeah that that's definitely true

1111
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:27,280
i was never i don't know i lived a pretty coddled childhood and i was never really bullied um but

1112
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:33,600
there was there was one time i had a pogo stick beating crap out of ben oh well yeah i was the bully

1113
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:40,880
and that's taking him he loved it though um there was uh there was one time in uh uh element no

1114
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:46,640
middle school like sixth grade or something when um in uh i was i had a pogo stick for some reason

1115
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:52,640
i was pogo sticking in class when i shouldn't have been just for fun why this guy uh uh just

1116
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:59,120
he he i stop he looks over me and he just calls me he's he i think he's white i could be wrong

1117
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:06,160
he just calls me n-i-g-g-e-r he just calls me that and i'm just like uh what what okay what do you

1118
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:11,120
mean sir what what's that about and uh i didn't understand i knew what the word meant at that

1119
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:16,400
point but i didn't know what that was about but that was the extent of it he just called me that

1120
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:21,120
and then moved on i didn't get like harassed i didn't get like physically assaulted or anything

1121
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:26,240
of that nature so i had a pretty it was pretty lucky it's pretty lucky i feel like his he'd heard

1122
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:31,040
his dad say that word it's like i want to try this out in real life yeah probably something like that

1123
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,600
i think he was white like i i i don't know he had slightly tanned his skin it's probably like

1124
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:43,840
armenian or something i don't know um yeah so that's that's it for me i guess yeah all right i

1125
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:49,040
guess we'll just go on to the next fucking call here oh uh did i already play this one yeah that

1126
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:55,680
was erupt okay next one is uh vacuum vacuum all right we've got two more here all right let's uh

1127
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:02,720
let's get this shit rolling so nate recommended this book called the 48 laws of power it's a

1128
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:09,520
fucking sick read really uh really fun to read super inspiring also no one else is allowed to

1129
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:16,880
read it uh this book is cut off from the public now if anyone tries to read it i will fuchsia your

1130
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:22,240
if you know what i'm saying uh i take offense to this voicemail because i'm the one who

1131
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:26,880
recommended the 48 laws of power because i was reading it and it's fucking great i i think he

1132
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:33,600
like i did meme like i quoted a sam hide joke about the 48 laws of power i have not actually read

1133
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:39,280
the book though i would like to i've heard it uh i mean it's fantastic yeah yeah uh it's good but

1134
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:43,760
you know but speaking of power just you probably are aware of this but it was interesting tom that

1135
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:48,480
with that bullying thing you said that you blamed yourself um for getting bullied and like

1136
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,240
like i i get what you're saying i get what you're saying and and surely you're aware that like

1137
01:48:54,240 --> 01:49:00,400
like if someone murders you because you're i don't know like walking out late in a bad neighborhood

1138
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:07,280
like sure you can blame yourself but but like the the the bad person is more so the the other person

1139
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:13,920
so it's like it's it's it's it's smart to take responsibility for the bad things to happen because

1140
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:19,920
only you can change your own behavior but of course like morally speaking uh it's it's the

1141
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:25,680
aggressor yeah morally but i yeah there's an extent of what you can do my situations the

1142
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:33,200
situations i was in were were definitely exasperated by my own uh naivete and general idiocy so there

1143
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:40,080
was there was a fair bit of my own stupidity that made a lot of these things happen i think it

1144
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:46,400
reminds me of like there was there was i don't i don't i sort of disagree with i mean like sort of

1145
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:51,680
like there's an extent of responsibility you can take but also you can't take all of the

1146
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:56,320
responsibility for instance with the with my bully that storm entity throughout the years whatever

1147
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:01,920
yeah like all i did was talk to her once and it was it was because i took some advice about

1148
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:07,360
someone saying oh you made you know you should stand up to yourself more because you're so meek

1149
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,800
and i did i took that stupid advice i i and you know i think what happened is like i never knew

1150
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,840
her we never saw each other before and she had the goal to sort of call after me and be like hey

1151
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,560
you have stupid shoes or something like that and i snapped something back at her and that's what

1152
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:27,520
started it and now because of that because of that did i deserve all that did i deserve all of that

1153
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:34,080
torment she gave me well i don't think so like in the Machiavellian sense like i'm sure there were

1154
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:39,920
tactical moves that one could make to theoretically like resolve the situation and i would i would

1155
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:45,120
never say morally you're responsible it's just that you know like maybe there were things that

1156
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,800
could be done that if you had known about maybe if you like literally had a future site you could

1157
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:53,600
know what would work and what wouldn't um and so like you know like in the grand scheme of like

1158
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:58,800
the cause and effect of one's entire life like yes you are quote unquote responsible for what

1159
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:04,800
happens just like like sure like a kid who's born like in the poorest fucking region of Africa

1160
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,160
and stars to death like okay maybe there's something he could have done to like get him out of that if

1161
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:14,800
you know whatever he had like known what to do at certain times but like no one would ever blame

1162
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:20,080
the kid for like you know what what happened to him or anything it's kind of a yeah i don't know

1163
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:26,240
where where it's not whatever you get the point you get the point so i mean yeah like there's

1164
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:30,000
there's this book that i haven't read but i've been hearing more about in case you nice dad made a

1165
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:36,480
video about the author recently um what's called i think it's extreme responsibility or no extreme

1166
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:41,200
ownership i think is what it's called it's just about like completely owning uh it's kind of more

1167
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,920
for like leaders in life like owning your subordinates mistakes and stuff and taking complete responsibility

1168
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:51,280
for everything happens to you there's a i believe in that philosophy a lot in thinking like i'm always

1169
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:56,160
saying like nobody gives a fuck about you in this world it's up to you to make it or to die in the

1170
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:03,200
streets and that that's because like tactically speaking it's up to you to manage your life 100

1171
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:10,640
percent like nobody else is going to do it uh and you cannot expect help um but but but there's a

1172
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:16,080
separate thing to like condemn bad actors like the world shouldn't be bad and full of like

1173
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:20,800
evil people who do bad things but those people have their own motivations you can't control them

1174
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:26,880
you can only control yourself so it's just about assessing the reality while recognizing that things

1175
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,680
are bad and you can do both those things at once i think so i don't know i think we all agree i'm

1176
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:37,520
probably just going in circles here anyway yeah anyway that wasn't really that guy's question

1177
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:42,880
what is vacuum mask again he was asking about like he was just mentioning a book he liked the

1178
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,600
book no one else 48 laws of power right 48 laws of power that's right no one else is allowed to

1179
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:52,800
read it yeah i mean the more people that read it the less effective the book does become it's true

1180
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:57,120
is that true yeah because like it's about it's all about manipulating people that's the 48 laws of

1181
01:52:57,120 --> 01:53:04,560
power all about i believe in uh uh what's the word uh ethical manipulation of other people

1182
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:09,440
the first the introduction of this book is that ethics are bullshit throw away morality okay well

1183
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:18,160
you know so i i hear what he's saying but my my my compass guides me towards a better future for

1184
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:25,520
all people all right which i 48 laws will work on you good to know for the future you know that's

1185
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,640
that is kind of fascinating how does one how does one read this book and get to that first

1186
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:37,360
lesson about like discard morality like like uh Machiavelli uh and the prince uh or i think it's

1187
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:41,840
i think it is like another transaction whatever people know it as the prince the prince is about

1188
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:47,120
like it's not saying it discard morality it's saying i think play the tactical game

1189
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,920
outside of what says to it's the same thing it's like it's amoral you just have to apply it

1190
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,840
as best you can like i don't think about it in terms of moral i don't think you can like that

1191
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,240
makes you immoral to follow its advice or anything it's about what you do with it i'd say you have

1192
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:07,280
to like disregard because like a lot of it if you read the book with a moral lens yeah everything in

1193
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:12,880
it is like reprehensible but if you read it it's just like this these are tactics in like the game

1194
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:17,440
that we're all playing whether we want to or not it's a strategy guy i was gonna say because in in

1195
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:22,400
regards to the prince it's specifically made for like for like uh like up and coming rulers and

1196
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:28,400
like people who expect to like control you know populations and stuff and like the thing is it's

1197
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:34,080
literally impossible to be like perfectly moral when you're a ruler because every move you make

1198
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:39,440
will help some people and will like sort of punish other people like for example if you're a dictator

1199
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:44,320
of the world right now like what do you do about the coal industry and the fact that we're losing

1200
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:48,800
coal jobs those coal workers are suffering but like we kind of don't we kind of want to get

1201
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:55,120
away from coal so like what's the solution uh like i i guess the solution is like retrain those

1202
01:54:55,120 --> 01:55:01,440
people in jobs that like they you know can do that is for like a more you know green economically

1203
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:06,960
sustainable pathway for it but like what about the people who don't want to stop doing coal and

1204
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:12,400
they just won't like what do you do that the answer is nothing some people get fucked is the answer

1205
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:17,360
i mean that is the ethic i think that's the ethical thing if like you're if your business goes away

1206
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:23,600
yeah and you refuse to stop doing it uh then perish uh tinted obama image like like that's

1207
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:29,840
yeah that's just like like you're an idiot you know uh i mean you're right like that's what's

1208
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,720
going to happen in the real world so like you could you could choose to live idealistically

1209
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:39,520
or you could think about what are the optimal ways to live your life and you know strategize

1210
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:45,520
for them and i'm aware that like a lot of like like oh coal's going away just get another job

1211
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:49,280
but like where that runs into conflict is like you got people who are like man

1212
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:53,120
my daddy's been a coal miner and his daddy and his daddy this is why i was born to do

1213
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:57,680
i'm a human man like humans to some degree are built to settle down doing something you know

1214
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:02,080
once they hit a certain age and stuff it's it's pretty fucked up to ask people just to change

1215
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:06,720
their whole life at a certain point and a lot of people i think can't handle it understandably

1216
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:14,560
you just have to you know there's no getting around it like yeah sorry you know life ain't

1217
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:21,200
fair that's really what it comes down to yeah it's not all right we got one more one more fucking

1218
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:28,800
message from uh it's from drunk nard war let's see what he has for us nard war i enjoy your interviews

1219
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:38,240
what's what what's up hey christmas guys oh i just wanted to say you guys are the fucking coolest

1220
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,880
hey thanks really kind of fucking gay actually

1221
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:52,400
what it's doing right this is the best friendship simulator man could ask for

1222
01:56:53,360 --> 01:57:00,640
i don't get out much i don't have no friends but where i'm listening to the procrastinators

1223
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:10,560
podcast i feel like i have friends i feel like i feel like a real real boy i feel like

1224
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:18,720
uh

1225
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,520
where's he going with this i think i understand why he doesn't have friends yeah i'm walking in the

1226
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:36,080
do do nard war i get it uh wow amazing that was an interesting call

1227
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:44,000
and that's pretty intense it makes me it makes me think about the ethics of making a friendship

1228
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:50,960
simulator such as this podcast uh like because let's say this podcast didn't exist and no podcast

1229
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:57,120
existed and this man had like he didn't have i don't know like video games didn't have tv didn't

1230
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:02,160
have podcast didn't have anything and he just sat there lonely i wonder if he'd be more motivated

1231
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:06,960
to go like make friends and so we're kind of doing a disservice you know you know what i mean

1232
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:13,200
where we're doing in the pursuit of power one of 48 loves power there you go tom it's not

1233
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,880
not even exaggerating one of the laws of power they talk about is uh to to to psychologically

1234
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,040
manipulate people is to find what people are missing in their lives and become it and that is

1235
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:30,080
what we are doing that okay see that makes sense and that's fair um but again one can do that in

1236
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:35,280
ethical or a non-ethical way i think like there are some standards one can arrive at like our

1237
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,360
podcast and moral because they're making the world a worse place because people are less incentivized

1238
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:43,200
to go out and make real human connections and make friendships which will be infinitely more

1239
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:48,560
rewarding than listening to a podcast um like sure it's profitable for us but then again how

1240
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:52,880
much of the responsibility is on us i think is a fair question to ask well i was watching a video

1241
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:56,800
last night they just randomly came on i was watching one of my vlogs make sure and uploaded

1242
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,920
correctly and then autoplay immediately went to this other video that was talking about uh

1243
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:05,120
morality and what can be a moral question and the two conditions he was talking about in the

1244
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:14,240
video was that it has to be a conscious act and it has to have a uh a impact on someone's like

1245
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:20,240
not that standard of living but like uh something that does like with people's happiness like very

1246
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:26,640
rude of something okay and i would say podcasts do have an effect on people's happiness uh but

1247
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:33,200
the effect you're talking about of like making people less like interested in going out and

1248
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:37,680
finding friends is not a conscious act so i don't think this would be a moral thing i think it would

1249
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:43,280
just be an amoral effect of podcasts in general because no one no one's making a podcast is actively

1250
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:48,320
being like i'm going to stop you from having friends okay you know what that that's true maybe

1251
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:53,760
immoral is the wrong word but it is fair to ask is it detrimental to society that is probably

1252
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:58,160
makes questions i guess yeah i you know i guess i just want to say to drunk nard war

1253
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,560
try to go like he said he has no friends okay fair enough fair enough what have you done recently

1254
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,840
to work on that you know it's the same thing i'd say to a guy who's like sad that he doesn't have

1255
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,160
a girlfriend or whatever like what have you done recently to fix it maybe you're trying really hard

1256
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:20,000
in the past but like have you like here's a thing when i when i moved out to ohio i i just focused

1257
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,680
on work for a long time but then after a while i'm like you know i would actually like to like

1258
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:28,880
make some friends and connections and maybe fuck a bitch you know out here once in a while so what

1259
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:33,040
i did for a while i i never did anything with this because like i i met michelle beforehand and i

1260
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:38,240
don't know just that's haven't really needed to go out and do stuff since then um but like uh

1261
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:43,840
i joined a bunch there's like there's it's like meetup.com or like meeting.com or something i think

1262
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,720
it's meetup.com yeah it's just a website where you can like go to meetings and like it's just people

1263
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:53,280
who go there they post about like clubs they have and they just accept you know people who want to

1264
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:59,520
come hang out like why try that kind of shit you know i think it's totally worth it yeah if you if

1265
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,080
you like don't have like a passion that like gets you up every morning and you're doing it and you

1266
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:08,640
like and even if you do have a passion but it doesn't introduce you to other people i think people

1267
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:14,400
have an inherent need to socialize kind of in person agreed uh so accept that reality about

1268
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:21,360
yourself as a human being and and and coldly tactically attempt to resolve it uh it's like uh

1269
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:26,880
yeah it's like it's like uh the great man uh Aaron Burr said in Hamilton i am the one thing

1270
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:32,240
in life i can control and that it's true for all of us so go if you have problems you can't change

1271
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:36,400
the world you can't change the conditions but you can change yourself in response to those conditions

1272
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:42,400
indeed so become better yeah that's really all there is and i that's really the answer to all

1273
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,520
these things it's just you know like on an individual level it's fair to say this to people

1274
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:52,640
but what i what i just wonder is like on a large scale will these kind of messages actually make

1275
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:58,000
the large difference and kind of make society happier and better i don't know i mean if everybody

1276
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,040
on like maybe people are just society would change as well i mean yeah like that's the thing

1277
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:08,080
every individual could could possibly do these things but on a mass scale the question is will

1278
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:12,480
they and will it make the difference the problem i've always had with going out and meeting people

1279
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:16,240
and i think i mentioned this on a tweet like last year and it still kind of holds true

1280
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:20,880
is that the question i had posed was how do you meet people how am i supposed to meet people when

1281
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:25,120
all the people i'd want to meet are staying in their house on their computer all day like i am

1282
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:30,400
good question good because like you've got to ask yourself like if you do the meetup thing

1283
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:34,560
like i uh one of the things i i wanted to join i know i've said this before but was a bunch of

1284
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:40,560
like atheist like uh like meeting groups and stuff like the like the like the like the free

1285
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:46,160
thinkers of ohio or something oh man those guys must be great i i well that that's the thing like

1286
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:52,080
who do you think is at these things like who do you think is there who who knows the atheist

1287
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:57,120
activists but but you know what i mean that's probably true but here's the thing here's the

1288
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:04,080
thing like sure maybe everyone there is a nerd or maybe there's some actually cool people there

1289
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:10,560
because i'll tell you this my anime club in college was mostly not great people i mean they

1290
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:14,160
they were fine but they were not really great friends of mine i didn't really like yeah i agree

1291
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:22,160
completely at like two of those anime club meetings like early on when i first started going i met

1292
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:27,440
like my all my friends happened to be there because like these were people who have a passing interested

1293
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:32,640
anime so they thought they would check it out this is in sophomore year of college i met them there

1294
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:37,760
and we became buddies for life and so like it's not like i intersected with people who were like the

1295
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:43,680
ideal people at anime club who were always there it's that it was an opportunity to meet like-minded

1296
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:50,800
people and the way to succeed on these things is to take many opportunities because you know i don't

1297
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,960
know maybe the fucking girl of your dreams gentlemen will be like at this fucking atheist

1298
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:59,760
hardcore meetup because like maybe her friend dragged her there she's not really that interested

1299
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:05,760
but she is there that one day and you gotta take that chance you gotta have lots you don't win if

1300
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:11,040
you go to law of averages that's exactly it i was gonna say even you can lose any one hand of poker

1301
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:16,560
but it's about about winning the war long term you give yourself the chances to to meet friends

1302
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:22,160
and go do stuff so for the love of god get out there and try something it's so much better than

1303
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:28,000
trying nothing and a lot of people probably have who are sad and sitting at home but i don't know

1304
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,840
try to mix it up take some of these advice i will i will say that like i've said this a bunch of

1305
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:38,720
times in a bunch of different situations for me the hardest part of anything is starting uh even

1306
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:42,960
things that i like like the like every day when i want to work on my game or do art or even that

1307
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:48,240
like things that like i feel are my sole reason for existing for drawing breath yeah it's still

1308
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:55,120
for my mindset starting and getting that motion going is pain and it sucks and i don't want to

1309
02:04:55,120 --> 02:05:00,400
do it i'd rather just stay in bed and do nothing and be a piece of shit just because i'm a weak

1310
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:06,480
flesh prison person and it's accepting that is the important first step yeah like there was an

1311
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:13,200
interesting book uh called the five second rule by mel robbins i think it was a buy you don't have

1312
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:17,280
to read the book because i can sum it up for you in literally like five seconds sick uh the idea is

1313
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:21,920
that like she had stumbled across this idea of like if you if you're because like what happens is

1314
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:26,240
that when you want to do something that's hard your brain instantly starts making excuses for you

1315
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:30,240
to convince you you don't have to do it uh there's very rarely a time when you want to do something

1316
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:34,640
and your brain will make excuses to do it because we're just all lazy by nature it sucks because

1317
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:38,320
we don't want to expend energy because we're all fucking monkeys at the end of the day indeed so

1318
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:44,320
the idea was that you count in your mind or count out loud backwards from five and once you get to

1319
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:50,000
one you immediately physically move uh even if you do the task you need to do does not require

1320
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,440
physical movement because the the act of counting breaks the mental state that you're in like making

1321
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:59,760
excuses it forces your brain to stop thinking about those and do something else and then the

1322
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:05,040
physical movement puts you into a different state yeah at that point you can start doing something

1323
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:09,280
those things make a big that's a good idea that's a good strategy try that everybody try that when

1324
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:13,520
it comes to these hard decisions uh you know that that that also works amazingly well and it's

1325
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,960
instantly actionable it doesn't take any longer three two one and i'm moving yeah all right i uh uh

1326
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,120
that remind uh in the extreme ownership thing like Casey Neistat in his interview with a guy who's

1327
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:27,840
like a marine sergeant or something he asked him like what's one recommendation uh he said like

1328
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:31,920
to succeed and like to get up and go and take ownership of your day because a lot of what he

1329
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,480
talks about is like success not just like owning your mistakes though that they're hand in hand

1330
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:42,240
it's like he's like it all starts with the first decision of the day and like when you fail on that

1331
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:46,240
you are prepared to fail the rest of the day with like all the other challenges you face and you

1332
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:50,960
like won't get you done but when you succeed at the first challenge of getting up and then you

1333
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:55,600
succeed at the next challenge of i don't know making your coffee or having your healthy breakfast

1334
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:02,240
or or working out or whatever like every success encourages you and feeds into the next one so to

1335
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:07,520
succeed from right out of the gate in the morning helps him a lot and can feed into all this kind

1336
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,480
of positive motion and uh and productivity and stuff so yeah uh it's a good idea i'm gonna try that

1337
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:18,320
i'm gonna try that all right well with that that was the end of our fucking podcast i guess
