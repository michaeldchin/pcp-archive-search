1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can't guarantee that.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The coolest thing about having sex with 28 year olds is that there's 20 of them.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Greatest hits guest medley going on today.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now you're going to be demonetized.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That was part of the plan.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is that a pun? Is that a pun about demons?

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We were sent here by Nate Bestman to demonetize the PCP.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Defund the police? No, defund the PCP.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Defund the cop killer.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That was part of the cat cake.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Speaking of demons, I've watched Hell of a Boss. You've seen that show?

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's the other show by Vivzi Pop.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right, Vivzi Pop.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She did the has been hotel pilot, which is going to be turned into a real show on Netflix or something.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hell of a Boss is in hell with imps and demons and killing and swearing and blood and gore and sex.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's cool, but it's on YouTube and stuff.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's actually really good. I would say it's not just good for an internet show, it's just a good show.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Somebody told me it's better than a has been hotel.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes, absolutely.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A has been hotel is kind of like a weird, confusing mess.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The pilot of Hell of a Boss is a bit similar, but episode one onwards, it's actually well written and good.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's like a good show and it's like, wow, I want to have an imp sona now.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I don't want to like it.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think the premise in Hell of a Boss works better than in has been hotel.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because having a hotel feels a little force.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why do I give a fuck that these demons want to become good people?

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There's really no emotional connection to that.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But in Hell of a Boss, it's like, you can explain again.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hell of a Boss is a boss of a small team.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And he's the hell of a boss.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And their job is to go into the human world and assassinate people.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it's like Monster's Inc.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, except with killing.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They go into the human world, assassinate humans on the request of dead, vengeful spirits in Hell who are like,

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I hate my old boss.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's why I, that's why, and he made me die or something.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So I want you to go fucking kill him.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, fuck yeah.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They go in through a portal.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They kill him.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's their job.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But the show focuses on the characters.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sounds like a great job.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a fun job.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a fun time.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And the characters are great.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There's at least two Vriskas.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So I like it.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Vriska count two.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ding, ding.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It dings the Vriska meter twice.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If it gets to eight, then I'll be like, wow.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's hit the Vriska minimum level.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
To be acceptable media.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I didn't watch the Vriska lecture.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The fuck's a Vriska?

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Well then you don't know.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Vriska is a character archetype of like a mean girl who is secretly good in intentions,

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
even if they fuck up a lot in real life.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And they just, you know, it's complicated, but that's generally it.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is she a manic pixie dream girl?

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is that what a Vriska is?

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, no, no.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She's like Batman but a girl.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's, it's more, I mean, it's closer to a, it's closer to a, what's the, what's the anime like girl that is mean to you?

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yandere?

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's what it's called.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's closer to a Yandere, but it's not really that either.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a Sun Yandere.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Whatever.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know the anime.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Those words don't mean anything to me.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sun Dere is like, they, they don't like you at first and they do like you.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Vriska isn't always like that.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think they just sort of, they have a cold outer shell where they put on like a,

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
a performance of being the best and being the coolest and being smarter than you.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And it's very like kind of mean, spirited and, but secretly they are like very fragile and emotional,

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but they try to hide it.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Rainbow Dash is kind of a Vriska, you know?

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Kind of like my mom.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A little.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
A lot like my mom.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I could relate to this one.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Nice.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think I had enough of Vriska in my life.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Nice.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is why we needed, we need a Nate here because,

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Gotta do the Cheesy Man's mom lecture next.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That gave me, you could do that one.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, you already did it.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Cool.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We needed a Nate here because he's an expert on Japanese.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Colloquialism.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Japanese stereotypes.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I know Sun Dere and Yandere and that's it.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I know what both of those are.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's two.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But that's it.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I know there's like a bunch of other ones that like, there's like Q Dere, but I have

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
no idea what the fuck that means.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Q Q Anandere.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Q Anandere.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There's all these.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Q Dere is like QB, like Fox, right?

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's like the anime girl that's like Q Anandere.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's like the Fox that loves you.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Speaking of anime, I feel like that's a great segue or before we get too deep into the

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
story.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to mention on the episode that Road to Radcon, the book is out.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Eleazar, show the picture.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Show the cover art by Michi Fossard.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Bam.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There it is.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The Road to Radcon book is out.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's printed.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have it.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,400
I have a box of them here in my house and I made an announcement on Twitter and I want

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,960
everyone to be aware that if you are, if you were a $100 Radcon 4 backer, you must

125
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,280
if you've changed, we'll send them to you.

126
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,520
If you change your address, log in to your Kickstarter account and send us a Kickstarter

127
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,600
message saying here's my new address, send it here instead and then I'll send it because

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,240
it's been like a year and a half.

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,360
So I think a lot of people might have moved since then.

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,760
So I just want to put the message out to everyone so I don't end up sending a bunch of copies

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
to the wrong house.

132
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Yeah.

133
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,120
I saw you announce that on Twitter and that means you finished the part that you wrote

134
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
yourself, right?

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Yeah.

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,760
I finished, I wrote the fifth chapter which is the longest, it's the longest chapter

137
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,600
by far because it had to, you know, had to wrap up all the densely woven narrative threads

138
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
that were dangling.

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,760
The longest and best by far, right?

140
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Absolutely.

141
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,240
Well, they're the same thing.

142
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
Those two words mean the same thing.

143
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
He goes good.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah.

145
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,680
All you need to do is write screw Flanders a hundred times and any work becomes better.

146
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:30,840
I, yeah, I wrote it and also I guess I'll, I'll try to get a post on the website.

147
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,800
I think I want to post like the PDF version for people to read like the final chapter

148
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,280
because we never published the final chapter.

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,480
Oh, I'll post it.

150
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,800
I'll post the text version somewhere along with like the full resolution cover by Mishi.

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,920
I was like, I admire this cover.

152
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I was just admiring this cover.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,400
The full resolution that contains the full resolution to the story.

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,400
That's, it's, it's true and you get both, you get the, you get the double whammy.

155
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,520
I'll, I'll try, maybe I'll post that like on, maybe I'll post a link on that on Twitter.

156
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I'll post it on the website.

157
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,080
I feel like that belongs on the website.

158
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Okay.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Okay.

160
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Fuckin' backers, get me your fucking change of address.

161
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Notice.

162
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Okay.

163
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Notices if you need to.

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,760
What's left on the Radcon for docket?

165
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
What's left to do?

166
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Is it just the dojian and the music video?

167
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,320
The dojian and the music video and the OVA, the crown jewel, the crown jewel, the OVA

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,800
with the animated intro.

169
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,480
Oh my God.

170
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,560
It's, it's true.

171
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,240
It's have, it's real.

172
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's real.

173
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Don't forget though.

174
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
All the pieces.

175
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Don't forget about the Brony lecture.

176
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Ah, yes.

177
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,740
Oh, how can we forget?

178
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,240
Who could forget the Brony lecture?

179
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
Well, luckily for us, that wasn't on like the guaranteed, this will happen.

180
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
So we are conscious, are clean.

181
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,320
It's, it technically, it by the, by the most literal reading of the rules, it is not a,

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
it is not a quote unquote broken promise.

183
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
So it's fine.

184
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Yeah.

185
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
You two, you two did the best you could to try and get it out.

186
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,480
So none of the blame lows on you.

187
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
I mean, yeah.

188
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
I mean, even if it was, I mean, I fucking did everything, I did, we did everything.

189
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:25,080
I possibly could about that, but oh well, nothing, nothing to be done at this point.

190
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Yes, the dojin is in the works.

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,000
We've got a script to look over.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,640
We have a script written by the PCP dating sim people or some of them.

194
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,640
And we need to, we need to approve it.

195
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Ah, yes.

196
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
The experts.

197
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,720
I've been, I've been busy this week because I've been moving, I've been moving again.

198
00:10:50,720 --> 00:11:00,440
And I have, with the help of Munchy and Kazi and a bunch of their, their roommates, I,

199
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,800
I have moved into my new and theoretically, I mean not permanent, but like one year, theoretically

200
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
one year lease and it sucks.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,560
It sucks so much.

202
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,960
It's, it's complete shit.

203
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Oh no.

204
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Oh no.

205
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,480
The lease or the place.

206
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,240
Oh, well, the lease is normal.

207
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
It's not great, but it's a, it's, but it's a mostly normal lease.

208
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,720
The places, I mean, I'm making the best of it, but like I get in here, I call it my landlord

209
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,320
and I'm like, Hey, you told me I can move in today.

210
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,280
She's like, no, you can't move until tomorrow.

211
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,480
I'm like, you told me I can move in today.

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,120
I got my moving van only for today.

213
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,520
And she's like, well, you can move in, but I haven't cleaned the floor and I'm like, fine,

214
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm off the floor.

215
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,280
So I move in and it's like, the floor is like stained.

216
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,400
It's dirty.

217
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
It's gross.

218
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,800
The walls are a little bit uneven.

219
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,720
They're a little bit kind of like bowed out at places.

220
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,760
The paint, it's a little bit peeling.

221
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,440
The kitchen, the floor is pretty grimy.

222
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,920
The floor is grimy, dirty kitchen constantly smells like, like propane for some reason.

223
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,720
Uh, uh, you know, the windows are all kind of like, not tech, they're not falling apart,

224
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
but they look like they're falling apart.

225
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,040
Um, well, I don't know.

226
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,280
There's fucking like ceiling tiles missing.

227
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,600
The fucking property manager comes out and talks to us about like all the guns he has

228
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,720
and about like how he was like a sniper and a paratrooper in a bunch of wars that he can't

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
tell us about.

230
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,200
Cause he was like special ops, secret agent.

231
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,800
Uh, he's got, he's got the fucking POW, MIA flag flying from his, from his like office.

232
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,360
Did he show you his fat cock too?

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,840
I didn't ask, but I'm sure he would have.

234
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,520
You only heard about that.

235
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,040
Um, we, we, it went with the thing.

236
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,520
You only heard about that in legends.

237
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,240
Can't, can't tell you about that one too, uh, too much, uh, classified info.

238
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,440
So would you, would you in trouble?

239
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,560
So, you know, I mean, uh, it's, I mean, I cleaned it up a bit.

240
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,520
It's like, it's livable.

241
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,440
The kitchen, the kitchen sucks.

242
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,560
Uh, I don't, I don't like it.

243
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,240
Isn't that, uh, your normal living conditions?

244
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
It's, it's, it's a downgrade.

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,960
It's a downgrade, uh, the, the location is great.

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,000
It's right in the middle of Austin, which is like right in the middle of every bus

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,120
line, you know, it's like a good, it's a good location, but I don't know, I said what town

248
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm in.

249
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,080
Um, but, uh, everything else is on every door, apparently the place, apparently the place

250
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,720
has bad reviews that I just didn't look into.

251
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
I don't know.

252
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,640
I don't, I don't remember, I don't remember it being this bad when I like

253
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
toward it.

254
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,080
Uh, I think, uh, yeah, I think it was, it was furnished when I saw it.

255
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
So it gave me the illusion that it was better.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,360
I didn't pay that much attention to the kitchen.

257
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,000
I was mostly looking at the room.

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,840
So I like kind of didn't notice.

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,800
And also I was just desperate because I like, I have to find a place to move by the end

260
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,300
of this month.

261
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,120
And then I ended up not even being, yeah, so I think I just kind of had rose colored

262
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,640
glasses on when I looked at it.

263
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I don't know.

264
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm making the best of it.

265
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:21,720
Uh, worst case scenario, I mean, I think my gut feeling is that this place is run by

266
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,640
like a slumlord who will try to scam me for in whatever way she can.

267
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,480
So probably, I think there's probably no way I'm getting my security deposit back without

268
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,080
like a legal battle anyway, even if I do everything right.

269
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,880
So maybe I'll just say like fuck it and like find a different place and like just, just

270
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,000
say fuck the security deposit.

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Fuck my lease.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll, I'll leave when I want to, uh, uh, uh, but I, I dunno, I'll have to be, I guess

273
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,280
I'll have to have some more, maybe, uh, if I can even muster the, the strength to go

274
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
on.

275
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,520
It must be fucking awful if it's too bad for you.

276
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,000
You do have, uh, you do have internet, right?

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
Cause that's the only thing that matters.

278
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,280
Actually, uh, actually no, actually I'm, uh, uh, I should, I should have internet or

279
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,000
like some, the other guy I live in here said that we do, but like it doesn't work and I

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
need to figure it out.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,400
And at the moment I'm, I'm on the internet via a, uh, my, using my phone as a hotspot.

282
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
So I'm burning data.

283
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
No.

284
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,600
So I'm burning data like super fast, uh, that's, uh, that's not good.

285
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
No, it's terrible.

286
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,120
No, it's pretty bad.

287
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
You can even say that's, that's mad.

288
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I might.

289
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
If I were so inclined.

290
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,560
Sounds like, sounds like the first two weeks on my last place, because I was doing something

291
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
very similar.

292
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,120
I was using my own phone data, just to use the internet cause my computer tower just

293
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,120
couldn't pick up the wifi and it was incredibly annoying and, yeah, well I, I, I, supposedly

294
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,120
there's supposed to be wifi and maybe there will be soon.

295
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Um, I don't know.

296
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,960
But I gotta say the guy, the guy who's like on the same floor as me, I might have mentioned

297
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,360
this before, but like this, this place has another room that I also saw that is like

298
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,840
the most terrifying apartment I've ever seen.

299
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
It has no windows.

300
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,880
It is an entirely interior room with absolutely no windows.

301
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Oh my God.

302
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,640
Isn't that against code or something?

303
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
I don't know.

304
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
I don't know the code.

305
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
There's no windows.

306
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:38,960
I don't know the building code, uh, but he's in there and he seems perfectly chipper about

307
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
it.

308
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,560
So, I mean, if he's happy, I'm happy for him.

309
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Well, it does sound like it'd be perfect for you, somebody like you.

310
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,240
There is, there is, there is technically a window, but it's not a window to the outside.

311
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,080
It's a window into the kitchen.

312
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,400
So like from the kitchen, if he opens his window, you can like look into his room.

313
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,160
What's the fucking point?

314
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I don't know.

315
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,760
That's, uh, I don't know.

316
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Very interesting design.

317
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,160
It was the kitchen built on later, onto the side of his room.

318
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
It is horrifying.

319
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
It is horrifying.

320
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
It's the worst thing I've ever heard.

321
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
It's terrible.

322
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,040
Well, you see, this is, uh, when you're a landlord, these are like the useful life hacks

323
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,280
you can use to save money and building stuff.

324
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,240
It's, it's, it's too big to be a closet, so it must be a bedroom.

325
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,640
You need to take notes for the day that you become a landlord yourself.

326
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
One day.

327
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Yeah.

328
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
I should be taking notes.

329
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
I should be taking, slumlord.

330
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm, I'm, I'm, I think slumlord is the right, is the right word.

331
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,520
When are you going to become a comlord?

332
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Am I right?

333
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,560
Uh, I know.

334
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,000
Unfortunately, I, I was standing on that, the, on the path of like, you know, you got

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,040
to, you got to go the dark path of the light path meme and there was slumlord or comlord

336
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,280
and I, I took the wrong.

337
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
I took the wrong turn.

338
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
You're the little kid in the middle.

339
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
You took the wrong turn.

340
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Yep.

341
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Yep.

342
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Ben St. slumlord or comlord?

343
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
It's, it's up to you.

344
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I chose, I chose wrong.

345
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Uh, I chose wrong.

346
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,000
Speaking of house horror, of horrible things happening in the house, I was a fucking, fucking

347
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,880
idiot today and I, and I'll never forgive myself.

348
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Uh, we have a cupboard and all of our trays and, and baking trays and shit are stored

349
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,240
in there and in the middle of the pile was a plastic one and, uh, I was cooking sausages

350
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,040
and hash browns for breakfast this morning and I put the hash browns on a plastic tray

351
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
in the oven.

352
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Oh no.

353
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
And I melt.

354
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Oh God.

355
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Did it, did it just.

356
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Yep.

357
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Well describe the fallout.

358
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Describe the fallout.

359
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,640
Imagine just gray lava falling down onto the oven everywhere.

360
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,360
Oh, delicious.

361
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,200
My parents are coming back tomorrow.

362
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,640
Uh, I've, I've managed, I spent an hour ripping plastic off of the fucking, uh, shelves in

363
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
the oven.

364
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,320
You know, like the greater shelves, just fucking ripping it and I've cut my hands open.

365
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,800
I burned my fingers on it in panic.

366
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,680
My hands are just fucked at the moment and I don't know what to do.

367
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,840
It sounds like a, just a, like a typical Wednesday for me.

368
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Exactly.

369
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, I would, I would say no, I was going to say just, just turn the oven back on and

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,520
like just melt it off, like let it drip off and melt off and burn off.

371
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
But then like, you'll, you'll kill yourself with toxic fumes.

372
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Exactly.

373
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,040
That's why I'm going to do that.

374
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,680
So I've, I've taken as much off as possible and I'm going to have a go with a screwdriver

375
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,240
and a hammer and try and chisel the bits that are still stuck on later on.

376
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,760
If you have like a metal scrubbing pad, like a metal brillo pad or something that might

377
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,720
be what you need to scrape it off.

378
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,840
It's thick, full chunks of plastic.

379
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,160
It's like as thick as like a Lego brick, basically, just like surrounding the metal bars.

380
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
It's really bad.

381
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,240
Luckily, like there was a tray at the bottom with like a heat proof sheet in it.

382
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,840
So like most of it, a lot of it dripped onto that.

383
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,200
So I just peel it off and stuck it in the bin, but can you, can you just take the grate

384
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
off?

385
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,520
You put the plate on a grate and then it dripped through the bars onto the tray.

386
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,120
So can you just take that grate out and maybe replace it with another one?

387
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Yeah.

388
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,720
That's what I'm going to do when my parents get back, I'm going to be like, I'll pay

389
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
for it.

390
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I fucked up.

391
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Yeah.

392
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,720
If I, if I can't sort it.

393
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,800
Just don't even mention it to him, just like, just clean it.

394
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Make sure there's no evidence of it.

395
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Don't even tell him.

396
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,200
Yeah, but I don't know if I'm physically capable of cleaning it enough.

397
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm not strong enough.

398
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,200
It sounds hard enough that I would consider like, fuck it.

399
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,000
Like, like the grate is dead.

400
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,920
I just got to get a new one.

401
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,200
Has the plastic, like when it drooped down, did it curl around the metal bars?

402
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Yeah, exactly.

403
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
That's what it is.

404
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
There's plastic shell casing.

405
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,800
So there's no way to like lever it off.

406
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,760
Some of them were like half done and I managed to lever it off and like pop it and it was

407
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,200
quite satisfying to do it, but it's just fucked.

408
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
It's like gripping.

409
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Yeah.

410
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Let me see if I got a photo of it.

411
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,700
I got a photo of the one that is slightly better and there's just like little bits of

412
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
plastic.

413
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,200
This is after an hour's work of ripping shit off of it.

414
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, crunchy.

415
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
I think it's just easier to buy a new one.

416
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Yeah.

417
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Yeah, probably.

418
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
They're like 20 quid.

419
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
It's fine.

420
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Yeah.

421
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
It's like what?

422
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Like one big titty commission.

423
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Okay.

424
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
You got the bag.

425
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Okay.

426
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
The one thing that I would maybe say might help in this situation other than buying

427
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,200
is if you have an outdoor like fire pit, if you like put it over the fire pit in the

428
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
in the in the like the same idea melted off, but like in the outdoors.

429
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,200
So the fucking flat burning plastic gases could dissipate.

430
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
I don't know.

431
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Yeah.

432
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
So you just you damage the ozone layer instead of your health.

433
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
And my neighbors just look over the fence and they see me fucking cooking plastic off

434
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
of a sheet on the barbecue.

435
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
It's my own goddamn business.

436
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
God damn business.

437
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Absolutely.

438
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,200
You could just wave the toxic fumes at them.

439
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Like a big fan.

440
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It's melted plastic.

441
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Get away.

442
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Castle doctrine.

443
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
If they look over your fence, you're allowed to shoot them.

444
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
It was a complete morning moment.

445
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Like, you know, when you wake up in your dozing, you're not thinking because I went through

446
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
like three sheets and that one's too big.

447
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
That one's too small.

448
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
This one's plastic.

449
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
And then just didn't register that.

450
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Just real, real morning moment.

451
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah, exactly.

452
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,200
You should have just done the Adam Ragusea just fucking throw your pizza dough right

453
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,200
on the grate and let it fucking like droop through the bars and just cook your fucking

454
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
zig, cook a zigzag pizza, man.

455
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Yeah, I should have just done that.

456
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
The hash browns would have been fine.

457
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
I ate them.

458
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I ate them anyway.

459
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
There was a slight plastic, plastic taste, but.

460
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Oh God.

461
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Oh my God.

462
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
So what are you even worried about fumes for then?

463
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Fuck it.

464
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Yeah, I guess.

465
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
This is going to be the last Simsies podcast.

466
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Now you're going to be radioactive.

467
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
You're going to gain superpowers.

468
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You're slowly dying from the plastic poison going into his veins.

469
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I have wasted, I have wasted many a dish by cooking it and then immediately transferring

470
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
it onto a styrofoam plate, which it then melts.

471
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
And then I'm like, well, now it's got fucking melted styrofoam.

472
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,200
I just got to throw it in the fucking garbage.

473
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Melted styrofoam is good for you.

474
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I hear it build her immunity.

475
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Why are you spoiling it?

476
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Make it mean to us.

477
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,200
If you eat styrofoam as a kid, you can't get COVID.

478
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I read that in an article.

479
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I used to.

480
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I read that.

481
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
That must be why I haven't got COVID.

482
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah, I heard this from infowars.com, so it's very reliable info.

483
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Yeah, and he's on a war against info, so why would he lie?

484
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Yes, yes.

485
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I got my second vaccination.

486
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Oh, finally.

487
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Oh yeah.

488
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Me too.

489
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
That's cool.

490
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
How long did you go between shots?

491
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Longer than, well, I'm trying to think.

492
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
I got my first one in July and my second one a few days ago.

493
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Damn, that's a pretty big break.

494
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Is it because like the availability?

495
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
It's weird.

496
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I made my first appointments.

497
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Maybe it was in June.

498
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Man, I can't even remember.

499
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,200
But for some reason, they're saying like in the UK, at least, they say at least seven

500
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,200
weeks between a jab or six weeks or something.

501
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Told me three.

502
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Yeah, I don't know.

503
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,200
I've heard conflicting reports about how long you're supposed to take in between.

504
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Can you wait even longer than that?

505
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,200
I'm sure people would want to get it as soon as possible.

506
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Maybe there's some scientific reason why you should wait.

507
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Well, maybe people in the UK are weaker than Americans.

508
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
That's probably it.

509
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
They probably are weaker.

510
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
I mean, they did lose to Americans.

511
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Mine was exactly two months between them.

512
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
The first one, I was completely fine.

513
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,200
The second one completely fucked me up for four days and I felt the worst of seven years.

514
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
No symptoms at all from either one.

515
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
So powerful.

516
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
So invincible.

517
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Neither did I.

518
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
I had like a bit of an arm numbness the first time and then a bit of an arm numbness the

519
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
second time and that was it.

520
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I had a bit of a bruise.

521
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,200
I had a little bit of a bruise where they jabbed me the first time and that was the end.

522
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I woke up with a 40 degree fever and a migraine that lasted two whole days and couldn't eat

523
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
anything.

524
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I had fucking weight.

525
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I had an erection for like three hours after I got on mine.

526
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,200
I had an erection that lasted more than four hours.

527
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I had to go to the hospital.

528
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,200
They complimented me on my massive erection I had.

529
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
This erection is COVID proof.

530
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
That's what they told me.

531
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You went to the hospital.

532
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
They just complimented you and you like...

533
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I wasn't there for treatment.

534
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I was like, you check this out.

535
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Sometimes the best medicine is reassurance.

536
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,200
You go in for cancer and they'll be like, oh, what a handsome life.

537
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
What a big strong boy and boom, cancer gone.

538
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I prescribe you a high five, bro.

539
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
You're kind of an epic bro.

540
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
You're a brofist right now.

541
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Don't leave me hanging, little guy.

542
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Oh, you're going to get...

543
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm going to leave you hanging.

544
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I'm going to leave you hanging.

545
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
COVID's no joke.

546
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
COVID's no joke, guys.

547
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Let's get serious.

548
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Oh, my bad.

549
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I had a very vivid imagining of going to a doctor's

551
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
and you tell them, jeez, I think something's wrong with me.

552
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
And then they pog.

553
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
They just do a big old pog right in your face.

554
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
And it's so inappropriate.

555
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
And they're like, what?

556
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
You're supposed to help me.

557
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
It's like, oh, pog.

558
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Oh, pog.

559
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Cool.

560
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
It's the first time I've gone to treat this.

561
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Fuck, yeah.

562
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,200
This is supposed to make you feel better.

563
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I want to remind you of your favorite thing, streamers.

564
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Pog medicine, perfect.

565
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Secure for everything.

566
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
True.

567
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Not wrong there.

568
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I think German is the cure for everything.

569
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
That's what I did when I was ill.

570
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I watched German for like 6,000 straights.

571
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Yeah, how did the dollhouse go?

572
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
I saw some of the first stream of that.

573
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Oh, it was wonderful.

574
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
It was really good.

575
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
It was beautiful.

576
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
It was good.

577
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,200
I liked it.

578
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I jumped in to watch it, and I hadn't seen the intro, and I was like, how are these...

579
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I didn't quite understand how the commands were working, but I got the gist of it.

580
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
They made a...

581
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I thought it was pretty wacky.

582
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:02,200
They made a stream on the 30th of last month talking about behind the scenes of the set

583
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
and how everything worked.

584
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
That's interesting.

585
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Yeah, it was really interesting.

586
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
They got all the people involved to come in.

587
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I might be interested in watching that, actually.

588
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
They're doing the whole thing.

589
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:22,200
They're uploading full highlights of it on German's channel now, so you can watch cut-down versions of it without all the waiting for people to vote.

590
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
And then they're also doing a cut-down version of the behind-the-scenes, I think.

591
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,200
So, there's going to be a perfect four-hour playlist of just, oh, there it is.

592
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
All preserved in its history.

593
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:40,200
It's just such a weird concept that I might have to check it out.

594
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
I'm so glad we're watching it.

595
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I want a cut-down version of the cut-down version, and then cut that one down.

596
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
It just gets better.

597
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
It just gets better.

598
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
That's what they say.

599
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
That's the right writing advice.

600
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Always got to cut it down.

601
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I don't think so.

602
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
The shorter the better.

603
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I don't think it will.

604
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Yeah, always, always, always.

605
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I thought the longer the better.

606
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Are you contradicting yourself, Ben?

607
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I love Moller.

608
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I do love Moller so much.

609
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Big Moller.

610
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I wanted to Moll me.

611
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
He's so fucking smart.

612
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,200
I haven't thought about Moller in years.

613
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I just happened, yeah, I just happened to see, last night I just happened to see someone be like Loll at Moller.

614
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Moller and Rags, and some other guy I didn't recommend, doing an 11 hour stream where they dissect, I guess among other things,

615
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,200
but Jenny Nicholson's I Didn't Like the Joker video, which is like 20 minutes long.

616
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I don't know.

617
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Her video was 20 minutes, how long was their thing?

618
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
11 hours.

619
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Was it word by word?

620
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,200
The name of their stream is Every Frame a Pause, so it's...

621
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
It's the worst name I ever fucking loved.

622
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
They lean into it.

623
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
They lean into the whole like, yeah.

624
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I hate that.

625
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Oh my god.

626
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I hope, what's the name of the guy who did Every Frame a Painting?

627
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
His name is like, something.

628
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Tony, Tony something.

629
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Tony for Tony.

630
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Tony is a dog or something, right?

631
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Sure, maybe.

632
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
He's probably rolling in his grave.

633
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,200
He's probably not dead, but if he was, he probably would be rolling in his grave.

634
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
He's rolling in his grave.

635
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Yeah, he's rolling in his grave.

636
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
No, the content.

637
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
He's rolling in his, yeah, he's rolling in his Sega's editor movie job he has now.

638
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I just, I just, I checked out the comments on this one through, and like,

639
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Asmad Moller fans are among the most annoying people I've ever seen on Twitter.

640
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,200
They are like, they are like a singularly despicable cohort.

641
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,200
They're like Elon, they're like Elon Musk fans, but like, even more petty.

642
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,200
They're like, they're just, they're just there, they're there to get in a fucking semantic argument with anyone

643
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,200
over like, what the definition of objective is, and they will fucking cite sources at you.

644
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
You're so bad.

645
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Give me a fucking headache.

646
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Yeah.

647
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I was, I was watching Sean's video about Teal Deer, and I've, I'd watched that a while ago,

648
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,200
but I had forgotten quite how pedantic and insufferable that guy sounds.

649
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Teal.

650
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Teal Deer that is.

651
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Yeah.

652
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm not, I've seen that video.

653
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I've seen him.

654
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:37,200
It's just so like surface level, like completely getting everything wrong and being so smug about it at the same time.

655
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
So snarky.

656
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
I have seen Patricia Taksin's video about rags.

657
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
The other guy who was in this mauler stream.

658
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Uh, uh, they're, they're not good.

659
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:56,200
But is that, is that kind of like, I can't, I don't know how to describe, like, I think of fedora tippers,

660
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,200
but like, it doesn't really do their, their like annoyance, their insufferableness justice.

661
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Yeah.

662
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
They're badly complicated way.

663
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
It's a monster sippers, not fedora tippers.

664
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Monster sippers.

665
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Enough of these fedora tippers.

666
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Look at some monster strippers.

667
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Yeah.

668
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:27,200
But, um, I got, I really hope that, um, they do an EFAT video on, on the one analysis video I made about, um, Amber from Vincible.

669
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Do you guys know about this?

670
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Oh yeah.

671
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Yeah.

672
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
I've seen you get in some arguments of over that one.

673
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Yeah.

674
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Cause there's this like, black girl in invincible and that's a problem.

675
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Right on its face.

676
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
We were off to a bad start.

677
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Yep.

678
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah.

679
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Cause she's black and she has like, um, I don't know, she sticks up for herself.

680
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
That's, that's terrible.

681
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Oh God.

682
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Can't, can't accept that.

683
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Was it, was it your video that Miss Anthropony made a reference to?

684
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Not, not really.

685
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,200
He mostly was talking about my tweet that I made, the one where I thought like, if you need this character,

686
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
you don't have that much really, you don't have that my relationship experience.

687
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,200
And I made that tweet like to purposely piss off people cause I love pissing off people on Twitter.

688
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
I think it's hilarious.

689
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,200
I tried to always make one like, one like mad worthy tweet every week cause it's, it fuels me.

690
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
You know?

691
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Fuck you.

692
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,200
And then you, you must, uh, you must really love tweeting at Ben because he's always pissed off at Twitter.

693
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,200
No, me and Cheesy, if Cheesy ever made, Cheesy would never make me mad on Twitter.

694
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Cheesy would never, would never do that to me.

695
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I'll tweet out vapors.

696
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Yeah.

697
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Kind of shit.

698
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
And then it'll be like a picture of the vapors.

699
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Cheesy knows that I am constantly walking a razor's edge.

700
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:57,200
And if I were to be disturbed in that, if I were, if my surface, if my delicate surface of the lake of my spirit were to be disturbed in such a way, I would never recover.

701
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Um, yeah, fucking, it's a type, bro.

702
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
It's a, it's a back and forth if you want.

703
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Oh God, you know, speaking of which, about like kind of like making people mad, you know what's like the worst kind of like people to like the worst kind of commenters are the ones who like reply back with a fucking essay.

704
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Like with several tweets, like a fucking paragraphs of why your point is bad.

705
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
I literally do never read.

706
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
I never read anything beyond a one tweet.

707
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
They ever fucking reply.

708
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Gabe, I, I, okay.

709
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Obviously last month I talked a bunch about like the whole Chris Chan is trans thing and the whole debate with, with, with Dylan, Dylan Thomas.

710
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Did I, did I mention that I looked into the, like the evidence that people use about why Chris is faking it?

711
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:54,200
You did talk a little bit about some of the evidence, like the, the, the, the, she said one time that she.

712
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Okay.

713
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Uh, was faking it.

714
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:10,200
And the evidence was that years ago she mentioned maybe the evidence was that maybe that one time 10 years ago before she was trans, she was like, I'd like to pretend to be a girl.

715
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
That's the evidence.

716
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Yeah.

717
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Uh, okay.

718
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
All right.

719
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Then I won't, I've said it before that I won't get into a whole thing, but that's my worst kind of commentary is that guy of which there's a, they've started to slow down.

720
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I've started to, I've started to not have to, um, I've started to not have to delete comments every day about that.

721
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Uh, I had my policy.

722
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I didn't, I didn't delete comments just because they like misgender, like casually, like, like, like thoughtlessly.

723
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
But I would if they posted a comment just to argue, like, actually you're wrong and Chris is faking it.

724
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Here's why.

725
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Like, no, not allowed, not allowed on my comment section.

726
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Uh,

727
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I can't believe, uh, you put so much effort into deleting comments.

728
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Yeah.

729
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
A lot of work to me.

730
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Yeah.

731
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Well, you know how many, you know how many volumes of the vapors you could have done finished now?

732
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
So many.

733
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Yeah.

734
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Too busy focusing on, on people who are angry at you.

735
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
We could have had vapors 17 by now.

736
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Uh, I wish.

737
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Oh, you know what?

738
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
All right.

739
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I could have sold, I could have sold so many copies of mini mice.

740
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I, uh, that reminds me, I have not been listening to any episodes of the PCP except for the one that dropped two days ago.

741
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,200
And I listened to the segment where you talk about, um, going to mice, right?

742
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Yeah.

743
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,200
And, uh, and it sounded, it sounded pretty rad and it got me, it wanted me to ask you.

744
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,200
It was pretty rad and I was totally vindicated because when, when I went to mice previously, I was like, I hate this.

745
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I hate being an attendee.

746
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I hate like being asked to buy stuff.

747
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I don't want to buy stuff.

748
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,200
And I, when I got there, I was like, oh my God, what if I, what if I get there as a vendor and I'm selling and I'm like, this is just as bad.

749
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,200
I like every, like I'm just miserable no matter what.

750
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
No, I was totally right.

751
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Being a vendor is cool and fun.

752
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Although I did, I didn't get, I didn't get to like talk to that many other like, I was hoping to maybe get to socialize with more like tablers.

753
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,200
And I only got to do that like a bare little bit and just like the people right to the left and right of me because I was busy the whole time.

754
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I didn't get to like walk around and meet people that much.

755
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
But other than that, I was, I was vindicated.

756
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Anyway, what were you saying?

757
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I wanted to ask, like, how do you, how do you feel about, how does that make you, do you feel like, do you have the energy now to make more fucking, do you feel like making more comics because of that experience?

758
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Yeah.

759
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,200
You think like, like, yeah, maybe I should get Vapor's Tria out as soon as possible or something.

760
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Well, it, well, it made me think, yes, but it specifically made me think something that I already thought, but even more strongly, which is I need to finish Phantom's Revenge so I can finish Slime and Punishment so I can print the book form of Slime and Punishment and sell, and maybe sell, maybe sell that at the next one.

761
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Oy vey, you should look up if there's any other smaller conventions in your area.

762
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,200
There probably are Boston, pretty vibrant city.

763
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
There's not. Yeah.

764
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Mice was like the main one that I was aware of.

765
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
There might be some smaller ones.

766
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:19,200
I mean, you know, even, even mice was significantly reduced, even, even, you know, this long into the whole COVID situation, you know, due to the COVID situation.

767
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,200
So smaller ones might not even be happening, even if they otherwise would.

768
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,200
But even, even smaller than mice, but mice are pretty small.

769
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
The gamer's got a point there.

770
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:47,200
We had, we had a running joke at my old house where one of my friends, the joke was just that you would mention blue mice at him and he would go, and he would get aggravated by the mention of blue mice.

771
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,200
That was a fucking great bit.

772
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
I don't even know where it came from.

773
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Was it Manchurian candidate code word that activates his secret agent training?

774
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Something like that. Yeah.

775
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Blue mice.

776
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Nobody likes blue collar workers, just like blue collar mice.

777
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,200
My housemate, Dan, we realized he was a shithead halfway through the year when I lived with him.

778
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
And we started calling him Crooked Daniel.

779
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
And he'd laugh it off all the time.

780
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
He was a very simple man.

781
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Crooked Daniel.

782
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Yeah, exactly.

783
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,200
And he wasn't the very, the cleverest guy, but it was tight.

784
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Yeah, he was quite crooked.

785
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Was he like cheated, like cheated, cheated cards?

786
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:36,200
No, he was just stupid and like morally not right in lots of ways.

787
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
He just didn't treat girls correctly.

788
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Morally right, yeah.

789
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,200
That's the most British like insult nickname.

790
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Crooked Daniel.

791
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Well, that's a Trump insult.

792
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
That's what Trump would call you.

793
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Oh, okay.

794
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Crooked a Hillary.

795
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Like he was so easy to trick on things.

796
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Like we went to a nightclub once and as we were coming out, he was like, oh, that was a great night.

797
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
And I was like, yeah, apart from the bit where you kept spitting on that girl and calling her a pig.

798
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
And he went, what did I actually do that?

799
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
And I was like, no, of course he didn't.

800
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
You fucking moron.

801
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
And then we got back to the house.

802
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
He believed you.

803
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Yeah, I know.

804
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
He believed me.

805
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't understand.

806
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
He believed it.

807
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Don't you remember?

808
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Yeah, I went, don't you remember?

809
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Don't you remember not doing that?

810
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Well, I suppose I could have.

811
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
I did drink some alcohol.

812
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,200
That is exactly the kind of thing I would have done.

813
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Exactly.

814
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,200
But we got back to the house and somebody had written Crooked Daniel in, like, fridge magnets on the fridge.

815
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
And he, like, ripped them off really angry.

816
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
It's the only time he ever got upset about it.

817
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
And, like, stormed out his room.

818
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,200
You should have convinced him that he's the one who put Crooked Daniel in the refrigerator.

819
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Don't you remember writing this?

820
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Did I?

821
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Wait, wait, I have to.

822
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Okay, this is a bizarre story about not remembering things.

823
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,200
And I'm sort of embarrassed to tell it, but, like, it doesn't even seem like it's about me.

824
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I don't know what happened.

825
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:03,200
The first night I moved into this place, I go to sleep and I wake up in my kitchen, in the filthy kitchen, on the floor.

826
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,200
I'm lying on the kitchen floor and my new roommate, my Brazilian roommate, is like, hey, are you okay?

827
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
And I'm like, what?

828
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Huh?

829
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,200
And I look around and I realize that, like, my head is on the welcome mat and there's a pair of, like, snow pants.

830
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
I don't know whose snow pants they are.

831
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,200
But there's a pair of, like, snow pants that I'm using as a pillow.

832
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,200
And I'm in my underwear, lying on the kitchen floor, and I'm like, no, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

833
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
And I go back to my room and I go down to sleep.

834
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Had you drunk anything?

835
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
And I don't know how I got there.

836
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,200
I was a little bit drunk, but I wasn't, like, because I remember coming home and going to sleep in my bed,

837
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
even though I was a bit drunk.

838
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,200
I guess I must have, like, sleepwalked into the kitchen and gone to sleep.

839
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
And I was just like, I've never done that before.

840
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
I'm not aware, ever having sleepwalked anyway.

841
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
I think that propane leak.

842
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
That's what happened, I think.

843
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I think that propane leak in your apartment needs to get sorted soon, if that kind of shit's happening.

844
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
It does.

845
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
It smells a little bit.

846
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Wait, wait, wait.

847
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Are you Crooked Daniel?

848
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,200
I was feeling very crooked that night.

849
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,200
I was feeling very crooked that night.

850
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Crooked Ben is what they called me.

851
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Imagine you're my fucking, you're my new roommate and you walk into the kitchen and I am, like, asleep on the kitchen floor.

852
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
I feel bad.

853
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
I feel bad.

854
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Oh, no.

855
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Yeah, literally the first night.

856
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Perfect first impression.

857
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
Now he's asleep longer.

858
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
It could have gone smoother.

859
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
It's pretty accurate.

860
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I don't know, dude.

861
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Shit was really weird.

862
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
I was afraid.

863
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,200
Come back the second night, been sleeping across the, like, the grill.

864
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I was afraid that the next night I would wake up in some other wacky place with no explanation.

865
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
It's a cursed house.

866
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Yeah.

867
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Moves you around without you knowing.

868
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Some adventures at night.

869
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
It's fine.

870
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Cool.

871
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Jesus.

872
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,200
There was a crooked man who lived in a crooked house.

873
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
His name was Ben St.

874
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,200
My neighbors, I guess my neighbors, this house, like, across the parking lot from me, like, yesterday, Saturday.

875
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Just this house was just having, like, this fucking block party.

876
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,200
It sounded, I couldn't really see over their fence, but it sounded like they were, it sounded like an arena full of people.

877
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,200
Just, like, blasting music that the entire block could hear.

878
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Just, like, shit.

879
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,200
It was just some little backyard.

880
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Like, I don't know how they must have packed so many people in there.

881
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,200
But it was, like, the loudest party I've ever heard.

882
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I mean, it was far enough away that it wasn't, like, a huge problem for me or anything.

883
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
We almost got arrested for doing that during COVID.

884
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
That happened at our uni house.

885
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,200
My housemate was a nutter, and he'd get high and drunk and shit every single night.

886
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,200
And he had about, I think it was, I think the grand total was 39 people over.

887
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,200
And most of them in the garden, but a lot of people in the house.

888
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
And our house was fucking tiny.

889
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
And the-

890
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,200
This sounded like a hundred, hundreds of people.

891
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
It sounded like a stadium chair.

892
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Listen, I had to sleep through these regular parties.

893
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I think, like, 20 people can sound like a million, depending on the amount of alcohol and music.

894
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Yeah, maybe.

895
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
Yeah, maybe.

896
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,200
It's funny, because, like, two months ago, we hosted, like, a punk show at my current place.

897
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
That's so awesome.

898
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
And it was fucking, it was crowded as fuck.

899
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,200
And, like, people told me after that, like, there's, like, an apartment complex.

900
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Like, maybe a block away from where I live.

901
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,200
And people in that complex could hear the fucking band, including that fucking loud.

902
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
And-

903
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
That sounds like a punk band, yeah.

904
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Yeah, we want to host another one, like, maybe a Halloween themed one.

905
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
Right?

906
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
That sounds pretty cool, actually, yeah.

907
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Yeah, some people shot of it.

908
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,200
I posted this on the Ben St server, so if you're in there, you're missing all these exclusive content.

909
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,200
But, um, yeah, some people were there that kind of, like, recorded the whole thing.

910
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,200
They're kind of like, uh, what's it called, all gas, no brakes types of guys, you know?

911
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
You guys have ever seen those videos?

912
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Kind of like a Yig Studio type of concert recording.

913
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Okay, it's like Yig Studios, but good, if you will.

914
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Uh, hard to imagine.

915
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
It could be such a thing.

916
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Hard to imagine.

917
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Hey, I'm Trixie the Golden Witch, and I'm interviewing people.

918
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Oh fuck, what's my line?

919
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,200
Uh, the-

920
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,200
Wait, I thought, uh, I thought Yig Studio videos were good.

921
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,200
Yo, Trixie, um, she lives in Southern California now.

922
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
I should invite her to the next punk show.

923
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,200
Yeah, you should get her to rap for you.

924
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Look, she could be the opener, like, look, we'll get you free.

925
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,200
You just gotta, like, take the vaccine first.

926
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,200
She'll do it, she'll do it at a loss.

927
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
She'll do it at a loss.

928
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,200
She'll drive, she'll pay for gas, and drive, like, 30 hours there and back.

929
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
It's not about the money, so.

930
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,200
Yeah, to do the song about Pikachu.

931
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
That one's funny.

932
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
She has to do-

933
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah, get her to do the Pikachu song.

934
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Okay, she gotta do the Pikachu song.

935
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,200
I want her to do the-

936
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,200
Get her to do the Pikachu song, and the song about how she spends all her money on weed.

937
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
But it's okay for song-

938
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
Perfect.

939
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Yeah.

940
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
That's perfect.

941
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,200
At the show, at the show, there was one band who did the cover of the Johnny Test opening theme song.

942
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Awesome.

943
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Bass.

944
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Yeah, I remember I was, cause I was kinda like, I was the emcee of the night, so I was, like,

945
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,200
running around, making sure everyone's having a good time, make sure everything was fuckin'

946
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,200
organized and whatnot.

947
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
And then I heard the beginning of-

948
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,200
You were the producer.

949
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Yeah, basically, I was the producer.

950
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
I was the Riley of the night, if you will.

951
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Hell yeah, hell yeah.

952
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
Yeah, yeah, the code, my code name.

953
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
So, I was just running around, and I hear the opening of the next song, and I'm like,

954
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
oh, they're doing a cover of American Idiot, and-

955
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
But then, like, they'll probably hear it all.

956
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Wait a second, does that sound hilarious to American Idiot?

957
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
This is Johnny Test theme.

958
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
I don't even know the Johnny Test theme song.

959
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,200
It sounds like American Idiot.

960
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,200
It's literally American Idiot.

961
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,200
It has, like, the same instrumental as American Idiot.

962
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
His best friend is a talking dog.

963
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,200
Johnny Test, the Chad, the Chad to Dexter's beta, if you will.

964
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Yeah.

965
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,200
They have, like, the same posture, too, yeah.

966
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:13,200
I can see it so clearly, him doing, like, the Chad, the Chad beetle-like stride, and Dexter

967
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,200
just, like, his head down, like, his arm slump, just, like, it's a little squat.

968
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,200
The version Dexter.

969
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Johnny, yeah, Johnny Test's sisters look exactly like older female versions of Dexter.

970
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
They have the orange hair.

971
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,200
They do.

972
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
They're, like, the labor-fed version.

973
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,200
In some way, or rip-off.

974
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200
Yeah.

975
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Yeah.

976
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
True.

977
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Johnny Testies.

978
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Suck on these Johnny Testies, if you will.

979
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
That's what I said.

980
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,200
Yeah, I know.

981
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,200
That is what you said.

982
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,200
But then I said it louder, so it was funnier.

983
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Damn it.

984
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
Yeah, true.

985
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Fucking dominant males.

986
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,200
It's technically iterated.

987
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Yeah, get out of here.

988
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,200
It's a man's world.

989
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Don't blame me.

990
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,200
This is a man's world.

991
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
Blame the patriarchy.

992
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,200
The real villain.

993
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,200
See, it's fine.

994
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,200
Rampant misogyny's fine if we say it's a joke.

995
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,200
What did I see?

996
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:11,200
I saw a screenshot of a TikTok of a girl, like, rolling her eyes in disgust, and the text was,

997
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:20,200
like, me, my face when men complain that the patriarchy they created doesn't let them, like,

998
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
be emotionally vulnerable.

999
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
True, true, true.

1000
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Get over it.

1001
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
You did this.

1002
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,200
You made your bed, and now you got to lie in it, alright?

1003
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,200
You wanted this.

1004
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:39,200
You can't complain about high male suicide rates if you're always calling everyone a manlet, dude.

1005
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,200
That's not how that works.

1006
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
True.

1007
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,200
I don't care about high male suicide rates.

1009
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,200
That's why I'm okay with calling everyone a manlet.

1010
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,200
I just don't care.

1011
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,200
That's, um, now that's, um...

1012
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Now that's base.

1013
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Now that's what you call aggressive.

1014
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,200
Base?

1015
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,200
That's what you call a cheesy moment.

1016
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Took the cheese.

1017
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,200
A real cheesy moment.

1018
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
A real cheesy moment.

1019
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,200
So what took the cheese pill, finally?

1020
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,200
Cheese pill.

1021
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,200
What flavor it is.

1022
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,200
Cheese pill does what Ben does for his diet.

1023
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Exactly.

1024
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,200
That's his keto diet.

1025
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Cheese pill is like, when you, you know, it's like, you know, capitalism is bad because

1026
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,200
we like capitalism keep happening.

1027
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,200
A little goblin spaceman might show up and, like, murder everybody.

1028
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,200
That would be a real problem.

1029
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,200
That's end stage capitalism right there.

1030
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,200
That's the real goal.

1031
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,200
That's his name.

1032
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
That's the goblin's name.

1033
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,200
First name, end stage, last name, capitalism.

1034
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,200
Capitalism?

1035
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
End stage, capitalism.

1036
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,200
That was like a great comic book character.

1037
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Yeah, it's, yeah, from a great comic.

1038
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,200
Um, oh yeah, uh, let's talk about Villainverse now.

1039
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,200
Sure.

1040
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,200
Um, did you...

1041
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Oh, I gotta tell you my, I gotta tell you my new address for my copy.

1042
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
Yeah, yeah.

1043
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
That I bought like a year ago.

1044
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Yeah, I gotta send back to my PO box.

1045
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Um, you and like two other people.

1046
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
I don't know why.

1047
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
For some reason.

1048
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Um...

1049
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
It should have, it should have just gone to my PO box.

1050
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Did you renew, did you renew your PO box?

1051
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Did you...

1052
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
Yes, I did without meaning to.

1053
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
Unfortunately.

1054
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
So that's $80 down the drain.

1055
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,200
You should, uh...

1056
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,200
I guess I can get a transfer to a different location maybe.

1057
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,200
You should, uh, do the, the items thing where people just send you random stuff to your

1058
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,200
PO box and just open it in front of a camera.

1059
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,200
I mean, by all means.

1060
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
By all means, people.

1061
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Everybody loves, uh, unboxing videos.

1062
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Yeah, just send random crap to Ben St.

1063
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Uh, don't send Anne Frax.

1064
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,200
Do not send Anne Frax to Ben St.

1065
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:49,200
My PO box mainly exists to be a receptacle for undeliverable, uh, vape, vapors copies

1066
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,200
and, uh, endless war pin cop shipments.

1067
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,200
And now, and now Radcon, Road to Radcon books.

1068
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,200
It just, it's where, it's just where the ones that don't make it to their destination arrive.

1069
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Like battered and like shredded and torn up.

1070
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,200
If, uh, if somebody sends, uh, poop to your PO box, then it'll be more like a PU box.

1071
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,200
A poop, a PU box.

1072
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:17,200
If you got any poop to send, please send it to Gamers Tavern PO box, which is in the description

1073
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
of every one of his videos.

1074
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
He's the poop guy, not Ben.

1075
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Yeah, that's why I call it a PU box.

1076
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,200
PU box.

1077
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Boom, there you go.

1078
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,200
A poo box.

1079
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,200
A poo po-o-p-o-p box.

1080
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,200
There's a, there's a lot of different directions.

1081
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
U-P-P-S.

1082
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Poop po-o-box, am I right?

1083
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,200
You, they call it U-P-S because of U-P-S.

1084
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
C-E-R-S.

1085
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,200
U-U-P-P-S, am I right?

1086
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,200
Hey, pee-pee poo-poo fecal funny, am I right?

1087
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,200
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

1088
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Base, red held.

1089
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:56,200
I just remembered, uh, Gib, uh, did you already talk about how you conquered Mario 1

1090
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,200
on that stream, uh, the other day?

1091
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Oh, I didn't talk about that yet.

1092
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,200
I played Mario and I beat it.

1093
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
Legendary.

1094
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Mario.

1095
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Good, good.

1096
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
Finally, real gamer moment.

1097
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,200
Now, now beat the Lost Levels and then we'll talk.

1098
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,200
Now beat Sonic the Hedgehog.

1099
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,200
No.

1100
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,200
No.

1101
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
Now try.

1102
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:19,200
The, the, the process of beating Mario 1 was, uh, arduous.

1103
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,200
I got all depressed.

1104
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,200
I mean, for other reasons, but it was sort of like coincidental.

1105
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,200
I couldn't beat Mario.

1106
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,200
That didn't have anything to do with Mario.

1107
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
It just happened.

1108
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,200
It was just sort of like, I was sad at the time and it was just sort of like, uh, and

1109
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
also I can't beat Mario 1.

1110
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Oh, you know, guys, I'm going to have to.

1111
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Will the horror never end?

1112
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
Which one of those days?

1113
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
I came back the next day and I beat it real quick.

1114
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Okay.

1115
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,200
I was, I was there for the first stream and I gave you some advice because I'm kind of

1116
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
the, the gamer.

1117
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,200
You're a bit of a gamer.

1118
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,200
He's kind of, he's kind of a gamer, um, and he owns Tavern, if you will.

1119
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,200
What, how long did it take you to beat Mario 1?

1120
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Cause I've never beaten it.

1121
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,200
The first stream, I'd beat the worlds one to seven and I think it was a four hour stream.

1122
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:16,200
And then, uh, the second stream, I think I'd beat it in like an hour.

1123
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,200
So maybe five or six hours, I guess.

1124
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,200
World eight is really tough because there's no mushrooms for the majority of it.

1125
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:30,200
So if you get hit once through any of the worlds, you will die and you only have three lives

1126
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,200
if you game over.

1127
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,200
So you've got to get through four worlds without getting.

1128
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,200
There are a couple of mushrooms in world eight, but they're all hidden in, in this world.

1129
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Yeah.

1130
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Once I, once I knew where the places where they were hidden were, it was just a case

1131
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:48,200
of dodging the hammer brothers to get to them, um, without taking a single hit and then

1132
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
keeping the fire flower.

1133
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
It was tough.

1134
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,200
It was very stressful right at the end.

1135
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,200
I think I got a little lucky with the final jump, but it was very pog.

1136
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
The final jump over Bowser.

1137
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:06,200
The final jump through the many hammers and fire of Bowser as he jumped towards me and I was losing space.

1138
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:12,200
I could either accept my fate and die or jump and hope I didn't get hit and I didn't get hit.

1139
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,200
So I did it.

1140
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
Good job.

1141
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,200
You're, you're now a better gamer than Ben St.

1142
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
No.

1143
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Finally.

1144
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
No.

1145
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I, I, I beat, I made the sun.

1146
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
I made the sun in Noida.

1147
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
I made the sun.

1148
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
No.

1149
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,200
You're a polymorphine.

1150
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,200
Yeah, but in that game.

1151
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,200
That pales in comparison to beating Mario one.

1152
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
Really does.

1153
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,200
You know, Ben, you're pathetic.

1154
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
You're an embarrassment.

1155
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Ben, you're kind of a fucking lame.

1156
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,200
You kind of big version energy coming at you right now.

1157
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Oh, no.

1158
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah.

1159
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,200
I fall down the pit and get absorbed by the dark side.

1160
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,200
Fall down.

1161
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,200
That I also did, by the way.

1162
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,200
I played more than to Undertale.

1163
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,200
I played more than an hour of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and didn't kill myself.

1164
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,200
So I'm the true gamer here because that game is insufferably terrible and anyone who likes it is a moron.

1165
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
I, a week.

1166
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Well, I guess it would have been maybe a week and a week and change ago.

1167
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,200
I went down a big, huge rabbit hole where I was just listening to,

1168
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,200
I was just going through all these different games, RPGs mostly,

1169
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:24,200
just trying to find the perfect, the perfect background music to steal for Phantom's Revenge.

1170
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:31,200
I, I, I kind of know that the demo used the cholera theme from Pokemon,

1171
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,200
which is a good track and it fits that part of the game.

1172
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,200
But I need, I need like, what do I need?

1173
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:43,200
I need, I think I need like, sort of just a, something like that for like the main part of the game.

1174
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
But then I need like a sad theme.

1175
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,200
I need like a, I think I need like two different boss themes.

1176
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,200
And then like kind of a sad, like melancholy theme, like fighting Gwyn at the end of Dark Souls.

1177
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,200
And then sort of maybe like a happy kind of intro.

1178
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:05,200
If you want the inspiration for good music, you should listen to the soundtracks of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6.

1179
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Those were, those were where I went initially.

1180
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,200
I was like, because that's, that's the exact kind of music I'm thinking of, but it's too iconic.

1181
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,200
And I don't want it to be like, I don't want you to be like, oh, this is Chrono Trigger music.

1182
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Like, like if no one had ever heard those tracks, I would probably just steal it.

1183
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,200
Dude, to Chrono Cross.

1184
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Well, I think,

1185
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,200
Can I get good music? You should go to Beethoven.

1186
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
You should go to the real musicians.

1187
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,200
I was, I was kind of, okay, because I was like, the Cholrest theme is good,

1188
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:40,200
but like there's no, the other Pokemon songs don't really like, aren't really what I'm looking for.

1189
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:48,200
So maybe I could just find one game, like a semi obscure game that just happens to have a few different tracks that like kind of do

1190
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,200
fulfill what I'm looking for.

1191
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,200
And then there will, it will have like a sense of like musical unity throughout all of them.

1192
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:59,200
And I was, I was listening back to like the Xeno Saga soundtrack, which is very generic.

1193
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,200
It's a little too generic, honestly. I'm not sure if it's, if it's good.

1194
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:10,200
If you want a soundtrack to an obscure, old RPG, I have one.

1195
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,200
Let me just look up the name because I reviewed the game a while ago.

1196
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
I think it's called something arc.

1197
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,200
It's for the Super Famicom.

1198
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,200
Arc the Lad? No.

1199
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Shining Arc?

1200
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
I forget exactly.

1201
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,200
It was only released in Japan.

1202
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,200
It wasn't released outside of Japan as far as I know.

1203
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
I spent like, I spent like two days.

1204
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:48,200
I spent like two days just kind of like, I was looking for like other RPGs that were scored by the same guy who made Xeno Saga.

1205
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Some of the Xeno Saga soundtracks are really good.

1206
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Like the final boss name of it is really good.

1207
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,200
I just found the name. It's called Mystic Arc.

1208
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Mystic Arc. I'll check it out.

1209
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,200
The final boss name is really good, but a lot of the other stuff is very generic.

1210
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,200
And I'm like, I don't, I don't want to mix and match too much because like that one's very orchestral.

1211
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:11,200
But other ones that I found were very like chiptune, like SNES stuff.

1212
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,200
And I'm like, what, what's the, I guess I, I don't know.

1213
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,200
I would rather not mix aesthetics too much.

1214
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:26,200
I reviewed Mystic Arc on my website. It was published by Enex in Japan only.

1215
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,200
I played this game back in 2014 and I was pretty impressed with the soundtrack.

1216
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,200
It has, in my opinion, one of the best soundtracks for the Super Nintendo.

1217
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,200
And pretty much nobody knows about this game.

1218
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,200
So if you use music similar to it, nobody's going to recognize it as far as I can tell.

1219
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:53,200
I was, I was the, the, the, the unicorn that I was hunting would be like a, like an NES or SNES era RPG with a kind of epic soundtrack,

1220
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,200
but also like a sci-fi theme would be the best.

1221
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:09,200
So, uh, uh, Star Ocean seemed like the closest, but like I listened through and I don't know, I wasn't super like the Star Ocean soundtracks weren't speaking to me.

1222
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Very big, very biggie.

1223
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Did you try the Fantasy Star series for the Genesis?

1224
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,200
No, but that's a great suggest. I didn't even think of that. I will, you know what?

1225
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
That's a great idea.

1226
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Fantasy, Fantasy Star 2, 3 and 4 were released for the Genesis and I think the first one was released for the Master System.

1227
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,200
That is a thought right there. Okay.

1228
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Have you thought about doing nightcore versions of My Little Pony songs?

1229
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Actually, yes. Um, I was, I am, um, uh, what was it?

1230
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:57,200
There were two that I was like, I, I was thinking that maybe like the final credits theme could be a, what was it, um, the unicorn song, the, um,

1231
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,200
the one, the song that we parodied for Phantom Reviews, uh, hearth-swarming Eve.

1232
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:10,200
Uh, let the grandma remind you.

1233
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
I don't remember what it's called. That one.

1234
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
I don't remember that one.

1235
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:21,200
That was from the, each one of us has something special, has something different that makes us rare.

1236
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,200
Um, I think it's from the like season three finale.

1237
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,200
It's a good, it's a good song.

1238
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Um, I could, I could just, well, you know, if it's a YouTube artist, I wouldn't just steal it.

1239
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,200
I would contact them and be like, hey, what's your use policy?

1240
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Do you mind if I use it? Do I need to pay you to use it or something?

1241
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,200
Um, uh, uh, but I don't know.

1242
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Again, it's like, I found like an eight-bit remix of it that is good, but it would be weird if I used like an orchestral score,

1243
01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:01,200
but then I had like this one, like any, like Game Boy, like eight-bit mix in there in the mix and like, I don't know.

1244
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Uh, uh, there's, there's another one that I got really stuck in my head and I couldn't, but it's like, it's unpopular.

1245
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:16,200
It's not one that got heavily remixed by the fandom because there's not even a single eight-bit remix of it.

1246
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,200
There's not a single chiptune remix, which is the mark of whether people, whether the community likes something or not.

1247
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,200
It's the song from when the Cutie Mark Crusaders get their marks.

1248
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,200
It's, you know, they are mark one way or another.

1249
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,200
That's, that song's so good. That song fucking rules.

1250
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,200
Uh, uh, uh, the ultimate reward?

1251
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
No, I think it's called We'll Make Our Mark.

1252
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,200
Um, and there's just not that many remixes of it.

1253
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,200
I mean, that's like devastated.

1254
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,200
That, that's like a post-peak brony art stuff.

1255
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,200
It's slightly, slightly post-peak.

1256
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,200
Yeah, but not like post-fandom death or anything.

1257
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,200
This is years, years, that was, that was years.

1258
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:12,200
I mean, that was when I was still watching and I fell off like before a lot of people did.

1259
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Um, I don't know, I've had, I've had that song stuck in my head for at least a week now.

1260
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,200
It's a masterpiece. It gives me goosebumps.

1261
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:32,200
You can actually go from a serious style to like an eight-bit style because the final boss theme for Earthbound,

1262
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:41,200
it starts off with like an intense complex rock tune and then it slowly morphs into like a eight-bit chiptune thing.

1263
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,200
I always really liked that particular song for that reason.

1264
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,200
I recommend stealing music from shitty licensed Game Boy Advance games.

1265
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
Like this. Like robots.

1266
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Yeah, I just, I just listened to, yeah, listened to the robots theme. It's really, it's last.

1267
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Yeah, nobody's gonna recognize this.

1268
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,200
The other, the other song that I was, the other eight-bit remix I was thinking,

1269
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,200
maybe I should put this in the game, was the eight-bit mix of a, of a big iron.

1270
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Because I realized that the story of Phantom's Revenge is basically the story of Big Iron.

1271
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,200
It's the story of a stranger come to down to do some business with a big iron on his hip.

1272
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
Uh, I was like, it's perfect.

1273
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,200
The iron is a katana.

1274
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,200
The iron, the iron is a katana and it's called, it's named Platinum.

1275
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,200
So it's like, it doesn't quite fit, but like it's, it's pretty, it's close enough.

1276
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
And it's made of Japanese folded steel.

1277
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
Kind of like.

1278
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Which contains iron.

1279
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
So, you know.

1280
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
Kind of like.

1281
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,200
I play Dwarf Fortress. I know what iron, what iron makes.

1282
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,200
Kind of like how in cowboy movies or rip-offs of samurai movies,

1283
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,200
you are taking the cowboy and then you're ripping it off with your samurai pony.

1284
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,200
That's right.

1285
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Great artist steel.

1286
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,200
It's the logical progression.

1287
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,200
From samurai to cowboy to pony samurai.

1288
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,200
You know what they say, uh,

1289
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,200
imitation is a sincerest form of flattery.

1290
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
And that's why you should steal the robots.

1291
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,200
There's only so many, there's only so many stories.

1292
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,200
There's only seven stories that humans have ever told.

1293
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,200
And one of them is, is big iron.

1294
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,200
I don't want to think about that seven stories thing.

1295
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,200
I had to write a dissertation for university and it was 8,000 words talking about that shit.

1296
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,200
And it made me fucking miserable.

1297
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,200
Just right, just right big iron.

1298
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:29,200
I got two, I got two of those, I got two of those 8,000 words for you right now.

1299
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
Big iron.

1300
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
You're welcome.

1301
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
Yeah, every story.

1302
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,200
Yeah, it's called the Bible.

1303
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Just write that.

1304
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Actually it's the mono myth from Joseph Campbell's book,

1305
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
The Hero of the Thousand Faces.

1306
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Thank you very much.

1307
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Mono.

1308
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Mono myth.

1309
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Mix yourself some bitches.

1310
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:58,200
More like mono is a hoax to, I don't know, get COVID vaccines?

1311
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,200
There's no mono vaccine.

1312
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,200
There was the burgeoning of a joke there.

1313
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Somewhere in there.

1314
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
You were getting close.

1315
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Oh man.

1316
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:16,200
If you ever get sick with mono, just switch to stereo.

1317
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,200
I rewatched the Noah Caldwell-Gervais video

1318
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:25,200
where he goes through the Knights of the Old Republic games and talks.

1319
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,200
He read the original mono myth essay by what's his name.

1320
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:36,200
And then he, by Joseph Campbell, and he goes through the Knights of the Old Republic games

1321
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:44,200
and he explains like, wow, it's not so much that the mono myth was a thing

1322
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:53,200
that is just in all stories that Lucas used as a template for Star Wars.

1323
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,200
It's that like, Lucas took the literal wording of that specific essay

1324
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:03,200
just like outlining the mono myth and like literally made it into the movies.

1325
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,200
And that's literally what Star Wars is.

1326
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,200
That's why George Lucas is a genius.

1327
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:17,200
I mean, he's rich and you're not, so you don't get to criticize.

1328
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,200
But wealth is a sign of greatness, isn't it?

1329
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:27,200
And it works in reverse too.

1330
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,200
That's something sad, that's something sad that happened this week.

1331
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Me and my friend got drunk and we watched episode three.

1332
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
And the saddest moment I've had in a few years was,

1333
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,200
I was realizing that the prequels are nowhere near as funny as I thought they were.

1334
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,200
They're just boring and bad.

1335
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
Yeah.

1336
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,200
If you watch the Plinkit reviews too many times,

1337
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,200
you just sort of associate those funny moments with the thing

1338
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,200
and you actually watch it and it's like, oh yeah.

1339
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,200
He's not here with me.

1340
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:01,200
Okay, speaking of, I watched, I watched this at the Munchie house,

1341
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,200
aka the Munchhausen as I am calling it in my head.

1342
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,200
I watched, not the original Pokemon movie,

1343
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,200
but we watched the 3D remake of the Pokemon the first movie.

1344
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,200
The fuck, I didn't know that was a 3D remake.

1345
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,200
Yeah, I saw the ads for, or I saw that it was being made a while ago.

1346
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,200
I didn't know it actually got made, but there it was, on Netflix.

1347
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,200
And we were like, whoa, and we watched it.

1348
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,200
And it's so fucking bad.

1349
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
It's so fucking bad.

1350
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
I can't believe it.

1351
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
I felt so...

1352
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:41,200
And what 3D, is it like Detective Pikachu 3D or CG video game?

1353
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
I haven't seen that 3D.

1354
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,200
It's very plasticky 3D.

1355
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,200
Is it like a Berserk, the new Berserk anime?

1356
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,200
No, it's...

1357
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,200
Have you seen that loop in the third, like Traders to that loop in the third movie,

1358
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,200
where it's like CG but like looks nice?

1359
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,200
It's like that except the designs are terrible

1360
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,200
because they're the original 2D Pokemon designs and they do not work in 3D.

1361
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,200
Oh my god, alright.

1362
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,200
Yes.

1363
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,200
Even just the thumbnail on this.

1364
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,200
They also, they're...

1365
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,200
Yes.

1366
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,200
That does look pretty bad.

1367
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,200
But there's a thing.

1368
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:22,200
You could tell that they bought the rights to some very expensive and high-end smoke and flame effects.

1369
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:30,200
And there's this same, very similar smoke effect that every fire attack

1370
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,200
and every time there's an explosion,

1371
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:37,200
you can tell they're using the same plug-in to do the effect.

1372
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,200
They were really proud of it and they lean on it really heavily.

1373
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,200
This looks awful.

1374
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,200
It does look pretty bad.

1375
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,200
Those stupidly long Sugimori eyes.

1376
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,200
Like where the eyes are really, really tall.

1377
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,200
That just does not work in 3D.

1378
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,200
They really don't.

1379
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,200
But like...

1380
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,200
Okay, they changed...

1381
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,200
I know they changed some things because I know

1382
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,200
that in the original,

1383
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:09,200
they have the iconic scene where Ash makes the joke about the Minnesota Vikings.

1384
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
And there's no...

1385
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,200
And Jesse and James don't dress up as Vikings in this version.

1386
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,200
So it's not like exactly one-to-one.

1387
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
Yeah, I know.

1388
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,200
It's a shame.

1389
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,200
But it's mostly the same.

1390
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:27,200
And it's just so funny how like Mewtwo...

1391
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,200
Literally, the plot of the movie is

1392
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,200
they get invited to a place

1393
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,200
and they go there and there's a fight

1394
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,200
and that's the movie.

1395
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
That's the movie.

1396
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,200
Mewtwo just builds...

1397
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,200
There's no reason why Mewtwo builds a castle.

1398
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,200
He just...

1399
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,200
I guess he just felt like it.

1400
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
He's like,

1401
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
I'm gonna do this weird thing.

1402
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
I'm gonna get some strong Pokemon

1403
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,200
by like inviting just some random people to my island and cloning them.

1404
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,200
And then we'll have a big slap fight.

1405
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,200
He wants to build a kingdom of the clones

1406
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,200
because he feels left out of the world, I guess.

1407
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,200
Yeah, he wants Pokemon deserved to rule the world

1408
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,200
and I'll get the strongest ones

1409
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
and I'll kill the humans.

1410
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,200
That's the...

1411
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,200
No, it's not.

1412
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,200
It's just sort of mostly fighting.

1413
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,200
He could get and clone Pokemon so easily.

1414
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,200
Like the whole beginning of the movie

1415
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,200
is a montage of him...

1416
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,200
I think this is new to the remake,

1417
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,200
but there's a whole montage of him

1418
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,200
basically stealing Pokemon for Team Rocket.

1419
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,200
He kidnaps so many Pokemon.

1420
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,200
So there's no problem for him

1421
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
to just go out and get as many as he wants.

1422
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,200
He's the strongest Pokemon.

1423
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,200
He could get them,

1424
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
but instead he does this stupid thing

1425
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
where he does this fucking like,

1426
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,200
oh, come to my fucking castle,

1427
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
yee, yee trainers,

1428
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
and behold my majesty.

1429
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,200
So they can have a set in for that first Pokemon movie in 19...

1430
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,200
He wants an army.

1431
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,200
It's bizarre and he builds like an evil castle.

1432
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,200
It's like, why did you do that?

1433
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,200
Why did you have to make like a big evil castle?

1434
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,200
Because he's a villain.

1435
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,200
Who are you trying to impress?

1436
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,200
They do do that.

1437
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,200
Why did you put a windmill on your dark castle, Mewtwo?

1438
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Like what does the windmill power?

1439
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,200
How is it...

1440
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,200
It's the computer screens.

1441
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,200
Oh my god.

1442
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,200
Why is...

1443
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,200
He's...

1444
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,200
Is that Jerma?

1445
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,200
Yeah.

1446
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,200
He's doing the Jerma face.

1447
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,200
He looks like that Dragon Quest movie except that rule.

1448
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Oh god, that fucking me and that movie,

1449
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
oh god, we have history.

1450
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Yeah, not the ending of that movie, my god.

1451
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,200
I just couldn't...

1452
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,200
I just kept thinking like,

1453
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,200
my parents, I think my mom,

1454
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,200
took me to see that Pokemon movie in theaters as a little kid

1455
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,200
and I just couldn't think,

1456
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,200
she must have been so bored.

1457
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,200
Like this is so boring.

1458
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,200
The plot like...

1459
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
I remember when...

1460
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Half the movie, wait, let me finish.

1461
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,200
Half the movie is they're having a fucking slap fight in slow motion

1462
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,200
and like the unimportant side characters are just observing being like,

1463
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
oh, why are they fighting?

1464
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,200
Watch someone slap each other.

1465
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,200
Oh, living beings fight with each other.

1466
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,200
Slow motion slap.

1467
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,200
Oh, but why are they fighting?

1468
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,200
They're both living beings.

1469
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Slow motion slap.

1470
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,200
Oh, because living beings,

1471
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,200
they compete.

1472
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,200
Slow motion slap.

1473
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,200
Oh, but don't they know that they live in the world together with one another

1474
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,200
and are both living beings?

1475
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,200
Can we just get along?

1476
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,200
It's really just like,

1477
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,200
why can't we just all get along the movie?

1478
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,200
Well, it's a typical neoliberal propaganda.

1479
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:23,200
It's you set up a conflict where a bunch of people are mind controlled

1480
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,200
to fight each other

1481
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
and then you opine philosophic on like,

1482
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
oh, why must living beings fight each other?

1483
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,200
Because you fucking mind controlled them to do that.

1484
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,200
These are like hypnotized clones

1485
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,200
that you made specifically to do this.

1486
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,200
This doesn't make any point.

1487
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,200
Once I had started playing the Pokemon games,

1488
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,200
I went back on the movie

1489
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,200
and I was like, why are they fighting their clones?

1490
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Shouldn't they team up against the ones they're super effective against?

1491
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
What's the point of all this?

1492
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,200
They just do it.

1493
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,200
They just slow fight each other because it's symbolic.

1494
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,200
The point of the movie is just that Mewtwo is cool

1495
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,200
and they wanted to make a movie about him.

1496
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,200
That's basically it.

1497
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
I know, but...

1498
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,200
I still like the first movie.

1499
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
It was just a marketing thing.

1500
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,200
Something about the atmosphere.

1501
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,200
It's bad.

1502
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
It's terrible,

1503
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,200
but the atmosphere of some of the locations is like,

1504
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,200
ah, cool.

1505
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,200
Wouldn't that be cool if it was real?

1506
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,200
I don't know if you remember this or if this happened,

1507
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,200
but did they give you Mewtwo cards when you went to watch the movie?

1508
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,200
Absolutely.

1509
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
Ancient Mewcard.

1510
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,200
100%.

1511
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:36,200
I think I had one inside of the VHS copy of the movie.

1512
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,200
Well, they gave it to me at the theater.

1513
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,200
I watched it in theaters and they gave me an ancient Mewcard,

1514
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:48,200
which I no longer have, but I did have for quite a while.

1515
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,200
I have mine.

1516
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,200
In fact, the other week I was going through my old Pokemon cards,

1517
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:59,200
looking for any valuable ones that I might have.

1518
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:04,200
I do have a Charizard and stuff,

1519
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,200
which is not in the greatest condition.

1520
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,200
It's not Shadowless and it's not First Edition,

1521
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,200
but it might be worth...

1522
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,200
I could maybe get a couple hundred for it if I wanted to sell it.

1523
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,200
Is it still that valuable?

1524
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,200
You just gotta hold until you're like a hundred years old

1525
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,200
and sell it for a thousand.

1526
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,200
The really rare ones in really great condition sell for like $10,000.

1527
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,200
Oh, shit.

1528
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,200
Well, I remember years ago I decided to sell my entire Pokemon card collection

1529
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:38,200
and I went on eBay looking up prices and everything seemed like it was worthless,

1530
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:43,200
like five, ten bucks for like fifty, a hundred cards.

1531
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,200
I mean, it depends on the card.

1532
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,200
How long ago was that?

1533
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,200
There's been a bit of a bubble.

1534
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,200
That was like ten years ago.

1535
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,200
You should do it.

1536
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,200
You should check it now because now it's like...

1537
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,200
Now it's like so at the point that like locations like Target

1538
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,200
will only sell you like one deck or one booster pack because they're...

1539
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,200
Yeah, I think demand has risen.

1540
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,200
Yeah, yeah.

1541
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,200
Maybe the prices went up now.

1542
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,200
Yeah, it might be worthwhile to check right now.

1543
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,200
But I only had Gen 1 cards anyways.

1544
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,200
Because I stopped collecting after Gen 1.

1545
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,200
I had a few Gen 2.

1546
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,200
I had a few from after that, but not that many.

1547
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
I had for some reason.

1548
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,200
I think I actually did had a few Gen 2 cards,

1549
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,200
but they were in Japanese weirdly enough.

1550
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,200
I actually had a bunch of like...

1551
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,200
From even before Pokemon cards were a thing,

1552
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,200
I had books of hockey and football cards

1553
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,200
that I think like an uncle or something gave me

1554
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,200
thinking that they would eventually become valuable.

1555
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:52,200
I think they just bought like an entire run of some random set

1556
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,200
of like a few different like sports series of cards.

1557
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,200
Just thinking like cards are a collectible item

1558
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
and they become valuable eventually.

1559
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,200
So just hold onto these until you're...

1560
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,200
And then you'll have a bunch of money.

1561
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,200
That was the boomer version of Bitcoin.

1562
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,200
Yeah.

1563
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,200
That was...

1564
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,200
Yeah.

1565
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,200
Oh my God.

1566
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,200
I've already made collectors.

1567
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,200
Monchi told me that his...

1568
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,200
This is a funny story.

1569
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,200
His 4chan uncle gave him $40 worth of Dogecoin

1570
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,200
and said,

1571
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,200
You're not allowed to sell this for a year

1572
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,200
because this shit's going to the moon.

1573
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:28,200
What do you mean by 4chan uncle?

1574
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,200
Oh, you don't...

1575
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Monchi has an uncle that he lives in the 4chan.

1576
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,200
He has a 4chan uncle.

1577
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,200
I think he's talked about that on the PCP before.

1578
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,200
Yeah, he has.

1579
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,200
He has, yeah.

1580
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,200
Monchi's famous 4chan uncle.

1581
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,200
That's pretty fantastic.

1582
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,200
Yeah, fake fan.

1583
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,200
Fake fan confirmed.

1584
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,200
Fake game and girl tabbed.

1585
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,200
You know what Pokemon thing I like?

1586
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,200
I like Destiny Deoxys.

1587
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,200
That was a stupid movie,

1588
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,200
but it was in a cool sci-fi scene.

1589
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,200
And Munchlack was there.

1590
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,200
And there was Plustrel and Miner

1591
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,200
running around in bins.

1592
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
And I was like, this is nice.

1593
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,200
And Deoxys is scary.

1594
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,200
I think...

1595
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,200
I think first movie was the only one I ever saw.

1596
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,200
I've seen some of the one with Entei

1597
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,200
and the Anons.

1598
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,200
But I watched that much later.

1599
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,200
I just caught it on TV.

1600
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,200
I just assumed that all the other Pokemon movies

1601
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,200
were going to be bad.

1602
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,200
And even the first one is not that good.

1603
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,200
They are.

1604
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,200
But most of them are better than the first one.

1605
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,200
I would honestly be surprised

1606
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,200
if the other ones weren't better than the first one.

1607
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,200
I don't think it's just like normal kids movie bad.

1608
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,200
I think it's like a spectacular failure.

1609
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,200
I remember liking...

1610
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,200
I think the second one was the one with Lugia, right?

1611
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,200
Yes?

1612
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Yeah, I remember liking that one.

1613
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,200
I think the third one might have been the one with Entei.

1614
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,200
Is Pokemon 2000 the one with Lugia?

1615
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,200
Yes.

1616
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,200
And then Pokemon Forever is the one with Celery.

1617
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,200
Is that the one with Celery?

1618
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,200
That's Pokemon Forever.

1619
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,200
Whatever the fucking little green one is.

1620
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,200
Pokemon Forever is the one with Celery.

1621
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,200
That's Pokemon Forever.

1622
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,200
Yeah.

1623
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,200
See, I only saw the fucking...

1624
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,200
I think I caught the ending of that one somewhere

1625
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:08,200
where Professor Oak is a young person

1626
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,200
because they travel in time or something.

1627
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:14,200
I remember the one joke in Pokemon 2000

1628
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,200
where the fucking ancient prophecy is all like,

1629
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,200
oh, if we can't calm down Moltres, Articuno, or Zapdos,

1630
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,200
the world will turn to Ash,

1631
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,200
which is basically saying the world is going to be destroyed, right?

1632
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
But then Misty interprets it as like,

1633
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
oh, that means Ash is the chosen one,

1634
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,200
and then Ash is like,

1635
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,200
oh, I wish my mom named me Richard instead of Ash,

1636
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,200
because it doesn't want to be the chosen one.

1637
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,200
That gets the official Gamer's Tavern Seal of Approval.

1638
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,200
Who wrote this movie, Gamer's Tavern?

1639
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,200
Because it sucks.

1640
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,200
Probably.

1641
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,200
They didn't even have...

1642
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,200
The 3D remake doesn't even have the iconic scene

1643
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,200
where Jesse and James are dressed up as Vikings

1644
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,200
and Ash says,

1645
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,200
I thought they were only in Minnesota.

1646
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,200
It's the confirmation that Pokemon takes place in the real world.

1647
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
I can't believe.

1648
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,200
Mewtwo is from South America.

1649
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
They know about Minnesota.

1650
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,200
It's a huge deal.

1651
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:13,200
I didn't know that the Japanese were such big fans of American football.

1652
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,200
I don't know why the Japanese would write that in their script.

1653
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,200
That's crazy.

1654
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,200
It is crazy, but they were very, very faithful.

1655
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Mewtwo is basically just Sephiroth.

1656
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,200
No.

1657
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Are they?

1658
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,200
I never played a game.

1659
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,200
He doesn't want to destroy everything with a big rock.

1660
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
He's way worse.

1661
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
He wants to make a clone so that he can have friends

1662
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
and live in his own little kingdom, basically.

1663
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,200
And then he flies off and he's never seen again.

1664
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
Except in Mewtwo Returns.

1665
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,200
Mewtwo strikes back.

1666
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:51,200
I typical dark, broody, badass villain that hates everything.

1667
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,200
He's basically Shadow the Hedgehog.

1668
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,200
He's basically Eggman.

1669
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
He's basically like a villain.

1670
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,200
He's basically Stitch from Lilo and Stitch, the ultimate life form.

1671
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,200
The Hedgehog.

1672
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,200
Yeah.

1673
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,200
That's what said, Stitch.

1674
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,200
It's a high idea of you were an experiment by a government entity

1675
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,200
or something and you're upset about that.

1676
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:16,200
There's way more going on with Sephiroth.

1677
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,200
Because Sephiroth is...

1678
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
Obviously, Sephiroth is better than Mewtwo,

1679
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,200
but Mewtwo is like a condensed version of that.

1680
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Babies for Sephiroth.

1681
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
Very simplified version of it.

1682
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,200
Yeah, he's babies for Sephiroth,

1683
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,200
which is also a baby game for babies.

1684
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:36,200
I enjoyed the first movie just because I was a big fan of Pokémon at the time

1685
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,200
and I thought Mewtwo was pretty cool.

1686
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:44,200
And it's cooler if you played the games first before you watched the movie.

1687
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,200
I was thinking...

1688
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:50,200
And if you read about Mewtwo's origins in the game, text files,

1689
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,200
there's a lot of lore behind it.

1690
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:59,200
So seeing the lore on the big screen was kind of cool.

1691
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,200
It's true that the plot for the movie is bad.

1692
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,200
Yeah.

1693
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,200
I gotta read.

1694
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,200
I gotta play a video game to know what's going on.

1695
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,200
Damn it.

1696
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:13,200
The Pokémon first movie might have been the first feature length anime I'd ever seen.

1697
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
I guess that might be the truth for most people,

1698
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
but that's probably true for me.

1699
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Yeah, probably it was for me.

1700
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:22,200
I think mine was the Manafi movie because I'm a zoomer.

1701
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,200
So that's the one that I saw.

1702
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,200
Manafi?

1703
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,200
What the fuck is that?

1704
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,200
There's 150 Pokémon, god damn it.

1705
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,200
Four?

1706
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,200
I was on Gen 3, I think,

1707
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,200
because Ruby version was the first Pokémon game I ever bought.

1708
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,200
And I was like...

1709
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:44,200
I can't believe the PCP is still talking about Pokémon in this era.

1710
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,200
Mewtwo wants to create an army of strong Pokémon,

1711
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,200
but only picks Gen 1 Pokémon.

1712
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,200
Plot hole kind of cringe, really.

1713
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,200
Sounds a little bit like a white supremacy to me.

1714
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,200
True.

1715
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,200
True.

1716
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,200
I liked the fairly recent one they did a few years ago called Pokémon,

1717
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,200
The Power of Us.

1718
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,200
That was a fun movie.

1719
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,200
That one was just like a genuinely good anime movie.

1720
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,200
Why would Power of Us?

1721
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,200
What?

1722
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,200
The Power of Us?

1723
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,200
No, us.

1724
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
As in like all of us.

1725
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Ass catcher.

1726
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,200
No, us.

1727
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
The Power of Us?

1728
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
The Power of Us.

1729
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,200
I think I...

1730
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,200
Is that the one that's actually well-animated?

1731
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,200
Yeah, it's well-animated and it's just like a cat.

1732
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,200
It's just Ash and Pikachu and they go to a city and they meet all these really...

1733
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,200
It's Ash and Pikachu.

1734
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,200
You know what I think of when I hear that title The Power of Us

1735
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:39,200
is how almost every anime and Japanese video game that is inspired by anime,

1736
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,200
the plot always comes down to the power of friendship.

1737
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
That's exactly what it's about.

1738
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,200
Conquering everything.

1739
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,200
That's exactly what that movie is about.

1740
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,200
I kind of hate that.

1741
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,200
Let's just really cliched and played out at this point.

1742
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,200
Yeah.

1743
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,200
Maybe it was actually The Power of Us.

1744
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,200
Yeah.

1745
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,200
And it was just...

1746
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,200
The Power of the United States.

1747
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,200
Yeah, because...

1748
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
Propaganda.

1749
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,200
Ash is from America.

1750
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,200
You know.

1751
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,200
You know what?

1752
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,200
The Power of Us.

1753
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:09,200
The prophecy says that if we don't calm the birds, the world will turn to us.

1754
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,200
Oh, but it actually meant the US.

1755
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,200
It meant there was supposed to be...

1756
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,200
There's all these characters.

1757
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,200
Periods there.

1758
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,200
All these characters, and they all have different reasons for not liking Pokemon.

1759
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,200
And Ash introduces them to like,

1760
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,200
No, Pokemon are based, see?

1761
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,200
And they're like,

1762
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,200
Oh, oh, he's right.

1763
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,200
Cool.

1764
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,200
And then he turns to the camera and says,

1765
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,200
Especially based when you go out and buy Pokemon-related stuff.

1766
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,200
Isn't that right?

1767
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,200
Exactly.

1768
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,200
God.

1769
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,200
See, all these movies are just the products of capitalism.

1770
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,200
They're just...

1771
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
True, true.

1772
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,200
...might of products.

1773
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,200
Oh my God.

1774
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,200
I'm about to coom right now.

1775
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Game receiver, keep talking.

1776
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Then I better stop talking.

1777
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
All right.

1778
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,200
Have you guys...

1779
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,200
And it was mentioned a couple of fucking minutes ago,

1780
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,200
but have you seen the CGI Dragon Quest movie?

1781
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,200
Yes.

1782
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,200
Is it a CGI Dragon Quest movie?

1783
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,200
Yeah.

1784
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,200
Yeah, it's also on Netflix.

1785
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
Is it good or bad?

1786
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,200
It's awful.

1787
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:12,200
If you wanted a fateful adaptation,

1788
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,200
it's not really fateful to the game.

1789
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,200
Well, I mean, it covers...

1790
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,200
It's like a speedrun.

1791
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
It's like watching a speedrun, basically.

1792
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,200
It's the most unexpected metatwist I've ever experienced

1793
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,200
in a piece of media.

1794
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,200
I wish that the twist was done in the middle of the movie,

1795
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
because then I felt that we made everything

1796
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,200
10 times more interesting.

1797
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,200
But like...

1798
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,200
It's the twist.

1799
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,200
Spoiler it.

1800
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,200
Spoiler it.

1801
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,200
But basically, it was a video game the whole time.

1802
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Dragon Quest is actually a video game the whole time.

1803
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,200
That's the twist.

1804
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,200
Oh, my...

1805
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,200
Okay, so basically what they do is that

1806
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,200
they just tell the whole story of that specific Dragon Quest game.

1807
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,200
And then right at the end,

1808
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,200
the final boss is about to show up like,

1809
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,200
oh, I'm summoning my master through this portal.

1810
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,200
And then our protagonist,

1811
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,200
who has his chosen one son,

1812
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,200
throws their destiny to the fucking portal,

1813
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,200
and it stops the final boss.

1814
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,200
And then out of nowhere, the game freezes.

1815
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,200
And only our protagonist moves.

1816
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,200
And this weird-looking virus guy shows up.

1817
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,200
And he says,

1818
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,200
yeah, this whole thing has been a simulation the whole time.

1819
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,200
You're at some sort of like Dragon Quest theme amusement park.

1820
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,200
And I'm a virus created by a troll.

1821
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,200
And I just came here to tell you...

1822
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Oh, it became the Digimon movie.

1823
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,200
I like this better when it was called Space Funeral.

1824
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,200
And the virus basically says like,

1825
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,200
yeah, so anyway, I just want to tell you,

1826
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,200
Dragon Quest is kind of gay and lame,

1827
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,200
and you're a loser for playing this game.

1828
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,200
And then the guy...

1829
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,200
Then, unironically...

1830
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,200
But that is true.

1831
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,200
Unironically, the message of the movie

1832
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,200
is that you're actually a very special person

1833
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,200
because you play Dragon Quest.

1834
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
Oh, no.

1835
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,200
I'm not joking.

1836
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,200
He's very special.

1837
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,200
No, he's not.

1838
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,200
I'm not joking.

1839
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,200
Because like, this flashback happens at the end of the movie,

1840
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
at this part of the movie,

1841
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,200
because he remembers that like,

1842
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,200
oh, I love my fucking video game,

1843
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
because you have a wife in the game, right?

1844
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
Me too.

1845
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,200
That's right.

1846
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,200
Like, oh, I love my video game wife.

1847
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,200
I love my video game children.

1848
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,200
Even though in the movie,

1849
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,200
he has played the same game like multiple times.

1850
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,200
He has played every remake version of this game,

1851
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:20,200
and now he's in the little simulation for it at amusement park.

1852
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,200
And what's so weird is that in the flashback,

1853
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,200
it shows him as his current age,

1854
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,200
and then it shows him at every point of every remake,

1855
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,200
and now he's at the amusement park version.

1856
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,200
And he's just the same age.

1857
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
So it's like, did he not age?

1858
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,200
Has he just been the same age the whole time?

1859
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,200
What is this movie trying to paint these people as?

1860
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,200
When you play Dragon Quest, you don't age.

1861
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,200
But what you said before,

1862
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
this is a, the movie is a recreation

1863
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
of a specific Dragon Quest game.

1864
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,200
I forget which number.

1865
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,200
Which game is it?

1866
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,200
Is it full?

1867
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,200
I think it's full.

1868
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,200
I think so.

1869
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,200
Wait.

1870
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,200
I think it's Dragon Quest.

1871
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,200
Isn't it five?

1872
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,200
It's a...

1873
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,200
Yeah, it's five.

1874
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,200
It's five.

1875
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,200
It's five, yeah.

1876
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,200
Yeah, five is the one where you get married and have kids.

1877
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,200
Yeah, yeah.

1878
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,200
So it's gotta be that one.

1879
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,200
I like that.

1880
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,200
I played the DS remake of that game.

1881
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,200
And in that version...

1882
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,200
Yeah, I also played that.

1883
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Yeah, in that version of the game,

1884
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,200
you have a third wife option,

1885
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
because in the original, you only have two,

1886
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,200
which is like,

1887
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,200
does the blonde hair grow next door,

1888
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,200
or like this rich guy's like blue-haired,

1889
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,200
keeler daughter, right?

1890
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,200
But in the DS remake,

1891
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,200
they give you the third option.

1892
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,200
They give you this spicy sister of the blue-haired girl.

1893
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,200
And I was like,

1894
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
oh, I like her because she actually has a personality,

1895
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
unlike the other two girls

1896
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,200
who are bland as fucking cardboard.

1897
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,200
Personally, I prefer them not to have a personality.

1898
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,200
Whoa.

1899
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,200
Just like in real life.

1900
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
Speaking of multiple romantic partners,

1901
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
I've been playing Persona 5 Royal,

1902
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,200
and I've successfully managed to date

1903
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
every single woman in the game at the same time.

1904
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,200
So I'm the biggest comeback on Earth.

1905
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,200
And it feels fantastic.

1906
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,200
Yeah, I've seen Let's Play

1907
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,200
is where people have done that.

1908
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,200
Yeah.

1909
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
It's pretty wild that they let you do that.

1910
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,200
I think that's required

1911
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,200
if you want to 100% the game, right?

1912
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,200
There's a challenge for doing it.

1913
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,200
You get reward coins,

1914
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,200
and you can unlock concept art and stuff with those.

1915
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,200
And you get an achievement

1916
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
for dating every single woman at the same time.

1917
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
Do all the girls know

1918
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,200
you're dating everybody else?

1919
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,200
There's a scene on Valentine's Day

1920
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,200
where you show up to where you live,

1921
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
and there's 11 women standing in front of you

1922
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,200
all with presents for you.

1923
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,200
Yeah, and then they murder you.

1924
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,200
Yeah, they all roast you,

1925
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
and then it cuts the black

1926
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,200
and you're all bruised and beaten up.

1927
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,200
So they beat the shit out of you.

1928
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,200
What's the name of that one anime?

1929
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,200
That's a video game where it's a light novel

1930
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,200
where you date every girl,

1931
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
but they all murder you or something.

1932
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,200
Is it called Yandere Simulator?

1933
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,200
School days, right?

1934
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,200
So you don't get a school days pulled on you?

1935
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,200
No.

1936
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
Yeah, the only thing...

1937
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,200
Is that...

1938
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,200
Go ahead, Gib.

1939
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,200
Sorry, I was interrupting.

1940
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,200
Go ahead, Gib.

1941
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Go ahead, Gib.

1942
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,200
Okay.

1943
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,200
The only thing I know about Persona 5

1944
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,200
is this copypasta right here about this guy

1945
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
who was convinced that Persona 5

1946
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
helped him to cure his autism.

1947
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
Was it Persona 5 or Persona 4?

1948
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,200
Oh, God.

1949
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,200
I think it's 5.

1950
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,200
I've been playing 5.

1951
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,200
Yeah, that's 5.

1952
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
I would say the opposite.

1953
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,200
Yeah, I was going to say the opposite.

1954
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,200
I think Persona causes autism, doesn't cure it.

1955
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,200
I know.

1956
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,200
That's why this is really funny.

1957
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,200
It is a funny copypasta.

1958
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,200
This guy is clearly doing very autistic things

1959
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
but believes that they are acting

1960
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,200
similar to the main character

1961
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,200
in a way that their life is being improved

1962
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,200
by copying what he's doing.

1963
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
He makes a social link chart

1964
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,200
of all the people he knows in real life.

1965
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,200
Well, if he's getting better,

1966
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,200
then I guess that's good for him.

1967
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,200
I hear people...

1968
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,200
I don't think he is.

1969
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,200
I think people actually do do like social...

1970
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
Well, not a social link chart,

1971
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,200
but I think people who are all about networking

1972
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:02,200
have Excel sheets of everyone they know

1973
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,200
with their business number and whatnot

1974
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,200
but also have a little fact about

1975
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
the last time they talked to them.

1976
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,200
Oh, they had a dog.

1977
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,200
So if I see them again,

1978
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,200
I'll ask them about their dog or something.

1979
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,200
So you mean the people that are really successful

1980
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,200
in business are all autistic?

1981
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,200
True.

1982
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,200
True.

1983
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,200
100%.

1984
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,200
He says,

1985
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,200
I'm pretty far in my social link

1986
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,200
with the girls in the apartment next door.

1987
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,200
Probably six or seven with both of you.

1988
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,200
I left a calling card too,

1989
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,200
like in the game,

1990
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:32,200
to let them know I was going to steal their hearts.

1991
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,200
Oh, God.

1992
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,200
How do you know this isn't a joke?

1993
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,200
Because it's on 4chan, so it's true.

1994
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
That's the funny thing about the 4chan.

1995
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,200
I want to believe it's true.

1996
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
You can believe it whether or not.

1997
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,200
I like the one green tech story

1998
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
about the guy who has a pocket watch.

1999
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,200
He's at a bar,

2000
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,200
and then a guy comes up to him

2001
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,200
doing small little snickering.

2002
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,200
Hey, buddy, you got the time.

2003
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,200
And he pulls out his pocket watch,

2004
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,200
and then he turns around to his group of table

2005
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,200
and says, oh, I was right.

2006
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,200
It was a pocket watch.

2007
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,200
And then everyone laughs at him.

2008
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,200
And then he ends as a green tech story saying,

2009
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,200
why does everyone hate pocket watches?

2010
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,200
What a good green tech.

2011
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,200
Oh, my God.

2012
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,200
I mean, just own it.

2013
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,200
You got to just own it if you want to.

2014
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,200
Just own it in a pocket watch.

2015
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,200
Yeah.

2016
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,200
But about the Dragon Quest movie,

2017
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
that plot twist reminds me of,

2018
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,200
you know, this is spoilers for Star Ocean 3,

2019
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,200
but near the end of Star Ocean 3,

2020
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,200
they reveal that the entire universe of Star Ocean

2021
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,200
takes place in a video game.

2022
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,200
And I remember at the time when this plot twist happened,

2023
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,200
everybody hated it,

2024
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:46,200
because there were Star Oceans 1 and 2,

2025
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,200
and there was all this lore built up.

2026
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
And then 3 came along and said,

2027
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,200
oh, all that lore is basically fake,

2028
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,200
because it doesn't exist.

2029
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,200
Does it imply that all the other Star Oceans

2030
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,200
also take place in a video game?

2031
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,200
Yeah, because the third one is,

2032
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,200
it's in the same universe as the first two.

2033
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,200
I was going to say,

2034
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,200
either they're all in a video game,

2035
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,200
or maybe it would be a little cool

2036
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,200
if there was one like that,

2037
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,200
but instead of like, oh, all the games are in a video game,

2038
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,200
it's like, no, just this one is a video game

2039
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,200
that exists in the universe of all the other games.

2040
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,200
I'm pretty sure it's all of them,

2041
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:25,200
because the Star Ocean has its history.

2042
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,200
Instead of using the regular date system,

2043
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,200
they use like SD or Star Date, I think.

2044
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,200
I'm not sure if it's Star Date,

2045
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,200
but they have a timeline.

2046
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,200
But the cool thing is,

2047
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:40,200
when your characters discover this at the end of Star Ocean 3,

2048
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,200
they eventually leave the video game world,

2049
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,200
and they go into the real world,

2050
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
and they fight the developers of the game.

2051
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,200
You're joking.

2052
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,200
I think they kill them.

2053
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,200
They're fucking joking.

2054
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,200
Yeah, that really happened.

2055
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,200
The thing is, the developers have like...

2056
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,200
Does the game end immediately when you do that?

2057
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,200
The developers in the game have like god-like superpowers.

2058
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:08,200
They gave themselves those powers with their game development skills.

2059
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,200
That's pretty magic.

2060
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:14,200
Yeah, they do this twist in Simpsons is a video game.

2061
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
Oh, yeah.

2062
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,200
Yeah, they have to go fight Matt Groening

2063
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,200
before they fight god.

2064
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,200
They mean that Simpsons is okay?

2065
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:26,200
No, the one that came out for Xbox and PS3,

2066
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,200
Simpsons is a video game.

2067
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,200
The one that has like fully animated cutscenes.

2068
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,200
It's just called the Simpsons game.

2069
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,200
It's the EA1.

2070
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,200
Well, there's a ton of games just called the Simpsons game.

2071
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:41,200
Okay, the one that came out like the last Simpsons video game.

2072
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,200
I'm pretty sure there was no other game made after this one.

2073
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,200
That was the last one?

2074
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,200
Yeah, I think so.

2075
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,200
There's Simpsons games for the Super Nintendo, the Sega Genesis.

2076
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,200
Yeah, I don't know that old shit.

2077
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,200
I'm talking about the Xbox 360.

2078
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,200
Look, you fucking boomer fuck.

2079
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:05,200
It's called the Simpsons the game for PS3 or Xbox.

2080
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,200
And it's not great.

2081
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:11,200
And there's also a Simpsons hit and run, I think.

2082
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,200
The Xbox 360.

2083
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,200
That's my one.

2084
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
Everybody knows hit and run.

2085
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
Yeah, everybody knows hit and run.

2086
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,200
Is there only one hit and run or is there multiple?

2087
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Wait, is the Simpsons game the one that has the Spore guy in it?

2088
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,200
Yeah.

2089
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,200
Will Wright.

2090
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,200
Yeah, he's like a boss in one of the levels.

2091
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,200
Yeah, I have seen those cutscenes.

2092
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,200
That sounds pretty cool.

2093
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,200
Matt Groening summons.

2094
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,200
Isn't it like a GTA?

2095
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,200
No, that's hit and run.

2096
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,200
Well, there's like the Springfield is like the hub world and you can just roam around and walk around.

2097
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:50,200
But you go to different places and activate levels.

2098
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,200
Is it more like SpongeBob battle for the key bottom?

2099
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,200
Yeah, you get the different family members.

2100
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:58,200
I think they have different abilities that unlock different areas.

2101
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:02,200
Yeah, because Bart finds out that they're in a video game.

2102
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,200
He finds the guidebook for their game and then he's like,

2103
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,200
Whoa, Rad, we live in a video game.

2104
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:14,200
I'm going to use my Bartman powers to break into the museum with Homer.

2105
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,200
Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.

2106
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,200
He was great as a kid.

2107
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,200
I'm not sure if it holds up.

2108
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,200
I think it's fine.

2109
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:26,200
This was like, I guess it came out during Zombie Simpsons era.

2110
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:30,200
I mean, I think the game came out like around the time the movie came out.

2111
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:34,200
I like that during the Matt Groening boss fight, he summoned Zoid Bergenbender to fight you.

2112
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,200
That's funny.

2113
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:42,200
And they spout like bad quotes about the Simpsons being worse than future armor and stuff like that.

2114
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,200
It was true at the time.

2115
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,200
There's a part of the game.

2116
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:50,200
There's a part of the game where they go into another video.

2117
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:54,200
There's a part where they go into several video games, but there's one part where they go into like a sewer system.

2118
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,200
And there's like a Mario ripoff like walking around in the background.

2119
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,200
There's like a Sonic ripoff on a hamster wheel.

2120
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,200
There's whole levels parodying various things.

2121
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Like there's the Katamari parody level and stuff like that.

2122
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:12,200
It sounds like a great game to play if you're a gamer expert.

2123
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:18,200
Yeah, if you walk by, I remember the quote that if you walk by like the Sonic guy, you hear him say like,

2124
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,200
I met the Shadow version of myself.

2125
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:22,200
Turns out to be a nice guy.

2126
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:30,200
You know, Mario and Sonic were in the Simpsons in the 90s.

2127
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,200
They made a little cameo.

2128
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:37,200
Yeah, when Bartz wants to steal a bone storm, was it?

2129
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:42,200
Yeah, he wants to steal like some kind of Mortal Kombat clone game.

2130
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,200
Oh, I talked about that in my dissertation.

2131
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,200
Oh, I talked about that episode.

2132
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,200
Oh my god.

2133
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,200
Why?

2134
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,200
That's one of the two of the seven stories that ever humans have ever told.

2135
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,200
One big iron to the bone storm episode.

2136
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,200
Only two stories.

2137
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Well, there's five.

2138
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,200
Well, there's five more.

2139
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,200
Exactly.

2140
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,200
There's five more when nobody remembers them.

2141
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,200
Those are the two best ones.

2142
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,200
Those are the ones that work.

2143
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,200
Yeah.

2144
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,200
We have been going for almost two hours.

2145
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:26,200
So we could move to voicemails anytime unless anyone has any objections.

2146
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:32,200
I want to talk real quick about these new things I'm cooking up with Villainverse.

2147
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,200
Tell me if you guys ever heard of, you guys know what a chick track is?

2148
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,200
Yes.

2149
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
Yes.

2150
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,200
No.

2151
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:44,200
So it's basically like these mini comics created by this like crazy Christian artist.

2152
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,200
And the way that like chick tracks would be...

2153
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,200
Jack Chick.

2154
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,200
Yeah, Jack Chick.

2155
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,200
Jack Chick was the artist's name.

2156
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,200
Yeah, and he...

2157
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,200
Oh, wait.

2158
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,200
I think I know those.

2159
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,200
Yeah, the way that he...

2160
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,200
I heard of this.

2161
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,200
Jesus didn't believe him because he told him the truth.

2162
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,200
Yeah.

2163
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,200
Or is that something else?

2164
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,200
It's these little things.

2165
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,200
And the way these things are spread is that you would just find them randomly like on bus stations

2166
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:09,200
or like in bathrooms or just be on the ground, right?

2167
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,200
And that's kind of like the point.

2168
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:14,200
You're supposed to just find them in random places, right?

2169
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:18,200
So everyone has found one at least at one point in their life or like found like rip,

2170
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,200
like just something similar.

2171
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,200
There are comics that are supposed to convince you to come to Jesus.

2172
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,200
Right, basically.

2173
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,200
But they have...

2174
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,200
It's very like...

2175
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:30,200
I think even this guy was kind of like extreme for most Christians at the time.

2176
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,200
Yeah.

2177
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:35,200
Because he goes into very like bizarre places and he has a chick track for everything.

2178
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:42,200
Like anything you could think of, he has made like his own like little Christian comic about it, right?

2179
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:50,200
And so basically I have made my own chick track, my own villain verse chick tracks, right?

2180
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,200
Bass.

2181
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,200
Yeah, yeah.

2182
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,200
Okay.

2183
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:59,200
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to send them off to as many people as I can in hopes to spread it, right?

2184
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,200
And I've made like a little...

2185
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,200
Like coronavirus.

2186
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,200
Yeah, like coronavirus.

2187
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,200
So you're going to just randomly leave them out for people to find?

2188
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:16,200
Well, I thought of like going into like Barnes and Nobles and like going into their manga section.

2189
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,200
Oh, this is cute.

2190
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,200
Yeah.

2191
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:25,200
Picking out like certain manga that I think like are similar to villain verse and just stuffing one in there in the manga.

2192
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:28,200
So when people like grab it, it comes down.

2193
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,200
They're like, oh, what's this?

2194
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,200
Right?

2195
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,200
Like I just want people to find it.

2196
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,200
Oh, this is great.

2197
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,200
I like this a lot.

2198
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,200
Yeah.

2199
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:40,200
And for my patrons, I was going to like, I guess make it kind of like my equivalent of a sticker club.

2200
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:45,200
Like, oh, if you're at this, if you're at this tier, I will mail you like five of these.

2201
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:52,200
Although I think I'm going to switch it to only three of these because these motherfuckers really like they eat printer ink like a motherfucker.

2202
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:56,200
They're not, they are not like nice to print.

2203
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,200
They're kind of expensive to print.

2204
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,200
Right.

2205
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,200
Exactly.

2206
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:06,200
But it's a tree like for the $5 amount, which actually, Ben, you get, you got some too because you're at the $5 amount.

2207
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,200
Oh, yeah.

2208
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,200
Yeah.

2209
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:12,200
Could you, I mean, could you photocopy them instead of printing them?

2210
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,200
Is that an option?

2211
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,200
Yeah.

2212
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,200
I mean, doesn't photocopy and also use ink?

2213
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,200
No.

2214
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,200
Really?

2215
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,200
Yes.

2216
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,200
What about a laser printer?

2217
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:27,200
Oh man, my printer is fucking ancient.

2218
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,200
How does a photocopy not use ink?

2219
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,200
Yeah.

2220
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,200
What is on the paper then?

2221
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,200
Yeah.

2222
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,200
Uh, something, I don't know, something else.

2223
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,200
Nah, it uses ink.

2224
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,200
Nah, it does not.

2225
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,200
It does not.

2226
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,200
It does not.

2227
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,200
It does not.

2228
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,200
It's not like a receipt printer from a show.

2229
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,200
It uses maybe a different kind of ink, but it surely uses something.

2230
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,200
I know laser printers.

2231
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:54,200
Okay, they use, right, they use toner, which is a, it's a different, it's a different thing and it's not as expensive as printer ink.

2232
01:40:54,200 --> 01:41:00,200
I know laser printers use a powder, but I'm not sure if it's more expensive or less expensive than ink.

2233
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,200
Yeah, that's toner.

2234
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,200
That's toner.

2235
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:12,200
I've been trying to like look, cause I heard there's like, you could subscribe to like ink, like an ink subscription where they send you like a cartridge like every month.

2236
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:20,200
Well, they send you, I don't know how much they fucking send you, but like, and it's way cheaper than like buying and buying ink yourself.

2237
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:25,200
And I tried to look for a subscription and I think I found one and I typed in what type of printer I have.

2238
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:29,200
And they're all like, yeah, your printer is not eligible for the subscription.

2239
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,200
And I'm like, fuck.

2240
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:35,200
Just, just, just buy a load of pens and then pour all the ink into the top of your printer.

2241
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,200
It'll work.

2242
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,200
Oh yeah.

2243
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,200
Just like a cartoon.

2244
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,200
Yeah.

2245
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,200
I think what I was going to do is just buy a bunch of pens and draw it individually.

2246
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,200
Trace it.

2247
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,200
What am I a fucking cartoonist?

2248
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,200
I ain't doing that shit.

2249
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,200
You heard of tracing paint?

2250
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,200
You heard of a light box?

2251
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,200
That's how you used to do it.

2252
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,200
That's how milk oil did it.

2253
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,200
You bastard.

2254
01:41:53,200 --> 01:42:00,200
Just send it, just send it off to a monastery to be illuminated, illuminated like a manuscript.

2255
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:09,200
I'm going to, I bought like that, you know, that there's like an ink refill kit that you can just grab a cartridge and just refill the ink in it.

2256
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,200
And it seems to be way cheaper than just fucking buying cartridges.

2257
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,200
Right.

2258
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,200
So I found out how to.

2259
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:21,200
I remember years ago I used to take cartridges to the mall to get refilled with ink.

2260
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,200
But I haven't done that in a long time.

2261
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,200
That's cool.

2262
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:28,200
What store like refills your cartridges?

2263
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,200
I don't remember exactly the store.

2264
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,200
I guess some kind of office supply store.

2265
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,200
It was a man behind the bin.

2266
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,200
Office depot or something.

2267
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,200
Interesting.

2268
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:44,200
He just gets live squids and he squeezes them over the cartridges.

2269
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,200
There'll be 50 dollars.

2270
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,200
Yeah, like the squids from Mario Kart.

2271
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:56,200
It's kind of like when people have to siphon gas out of a car, they like have to suck the squid a little bit.

2272
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:59,200
So like the ink comes out and then they start pouring it.

2273
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,200
Wow.

2274
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,200
Squid sucking.

2275
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,200
Dude just fucking banging my door and I don't know why.

2276
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,200
Oh my god.

2277
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,200
Yeah, so I'm making these little.

2278
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,200
Never mind.

2279
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,200
I'm making these little chick tracks.

2280
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,200
Gonna be sending them around.

2281
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:18,200
Hopefully you find them soon at your local whatever the fuck.

2282
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:24,200
I wonder if you put these in books and stuff at a bookstore, would that be considered illegal?

2283
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,200
Well as long as they don't get caught.

2284
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,200
No, it's not illegal to get caught.

2285
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,200
It'll be littering at most.

2286
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,200
You'll be fucking shot.

2287
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,200
And nobody will ever find you.

2288
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:45,200
I've been thinking about because I need to get, I'm so like, there's like an urge in me of like, if I'm not in a costume, marketing a comic, am I really marketing the comic?

2289
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:47,200
So I need to kind of like how I had.

2290
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,200
So become a villain in real life.

2291
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:56,200
Yeah, kind of how I had like pasta, the clown, marketing bungalow and I need like my own little marketing guy for villain version.

2292
01:43:56,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Oh, there are a couple of episodes back.

2293
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,200
I mentioned clown vis.

2294
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,200
Oh yeah.

2295
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,200
How can I forget?

2296
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:12,200
It's too bad Cheezy isn't here to appreciate this clown Elvis costume thing.

2297
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:15,200
Oh, I follow him on Instagram now.

2298
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,200
You should have.

2299
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,200
Did you find out about him from Gamers Tavern?

2300
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,200
Yeah, yeah, I found it out from that episode.

2301
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:28,200
I think one of my friends commented on that episode saying like, oh, you guys talk about clown vis and Cheezy's not on.

2302
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,200
Blast for me.

2303
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,200
Yeah, exactly. You should have been there.

2304
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:34,200
Well, I guess I can't go back in time gamers.

2305
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,200
We're talking about it now.

2306
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:39,200
But I'm thinking about this.

2307
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,200
I'm thinking about making-

2308
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,200
You should have your own costume like clown vis does.

2309
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:47,200
I do. I have pasta with clowns.

2310
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Well, there you go. You should wear that all the time.

2311
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:53,200
See Gamers Taverns, this is how I know you haven't read Bungalow and Luna.

2312
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,200
Fucking got him.

2313
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,200
Got him.

2314
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,200
Are you sure? You got me.

2315
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:02,200
I haven't read anything. I don't, I don't read.

2316
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,200
It's a long going boomer.

2317
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,200
I can only read things with pictures.

2318
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,200
I can't read any fucking book.

2319
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,200
I can't read words.

2320
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,200
I can only read things with moving pictures and sound.

2321
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:17,200
The only things I read are like little dialogue boxes and RPG games.

2322
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,200
Yeah, exactly.

2323
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:23,200
If anything beyond that, a little too complicated for my little brain.

2324
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:28,200
But yeah, I'm just going to fucking sneak these bad boys into everything.

2325
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:32,200
And I was thinking about making like a fucking costume like a villain marketer.

2326
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,200
You just got it. You got a lower cost.

2327
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:37,200
You got a lower printing cost by any means necessary.

2328
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:41,200
Yeah, I mean, that's why I'm investing in the refilling kit and just doing that.

2329
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:47,200
Like I watched the video and they said that yeah, you could like refill your ink cartridge at least like 30 times.

2330
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,200
That's pretty good.

2331
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:57,200
I think that's a cool fun way to like promote yourself is to just leave stuff like this in random places.

2332
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:05,200
Like just go to a table in a courtyard somewhere and just leave this stuff on the table and somebody's going to find it.

2333
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:11,200
I really just like making like kind of video content for marketing.

2334
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:15,200
I was thinking about, I dressed up as like some sort, I make like a mask, right?

2335
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:24,200
I wear like a suit and I run, I stand in front of like grocery stores giving out these little chick tracks, right?

2336
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,200
Trying to convert people to the villain.

2337
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:31,200
And then my friend was also in a villain costume will pop up and be like,

2338
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,200
yo, don't get your chick tracks from this guy.

2339
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,200
Get him from me.

2340
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,200
I'm the real villain marketer.

2341
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:44,200
Then we start fighting and we literally try to beat each other up in front of like public kind of like a mega 64 thing where they just do like ridiculous ass shit

2342
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
in public.

2343
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,200
Yeah.

2344
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:53,200
And then people call the cops and you kill one of the cops.

2345
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,200
Yes, exactly.

2346
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:59,200
If there's footage of me like in a villain mask getting arrested, that'd be pretty rad.

2347
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,200
That would go viral.

2348
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:05,200
That's what you gotta do.

2349
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:09,200
You gotta pull that thing with the better call Saul.

2350
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:14,200
You fucking do the thing where you get on the news because you climb up the sign.

2351
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,200
You fake saving someone.

2352
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,200
Yeah.

2353
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,200
But it said you fake killing someone.

2354
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,200
You keep throwing someone off of a billboard.

2355
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:28,200
I'm gonna get on top of a fucking billboard in my neighborhood and spray paint it with Reed Villain first.

2356
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,200
What does this mean?

2357
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:37,200
Well, as Ethan Ralph proved the best content is filming somebody getting arrested.

2358
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,200
Base Ethan does it again.

2359
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,200
Oh my god.

2360
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,200
Okay.

2361
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,200
I can't believe this, but you will never guess.

2362
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,200
Sims, you might know.

2363
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:57,200
You will never guess who responded to the Kickstarter message saying, hey, tell me where to send the Road to Radcon book.

2364
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:02,200
You will never guess who was like, here's where to send my Road to Radcon book.

2365
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,200
May.

2366
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Oh.

2367
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:07,200
She's like, she's like, send it to my parents.

2368
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,200
Here's the address.

2369
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,200
I'm like, okay.

2370
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,200
I guess I will.

2371
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:13,200
The gunt wife herself.

2372
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,200
She's back for the grade.

2373
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:19,200
She's back and she wants, she wants a damn book.

2374
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:25,200
Well, yeah, because I sent out a message to everyone saying like, if you, if you paid this much, you get the book.

2375
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,200
She did.

2376
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,200
She is a backer.

2377
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,200
She is a backer.

2378
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,200
She is a backer.

2379
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,200
So she's entitled to it.

2380
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,200
That's the rules.

2381
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,200
I can't believe she wants it.

2382
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,200
That's so funny.

2383
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,200
I don't, I don't get it.

2384
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,200
But whatever.

2385
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:42,200
I mean, she still thinks she's friends with you, right?

2386
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:48,200
No, she blocked me because I tweeted that thing about how she doesn't like black people.

2387
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,200
I mean, where was the lie?

2388
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,200
I guess.

2389
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:58,200
Well, no, there's an uncomfortable truth that she just can't, she can't cope with.

2390
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,200
That does confuse me then.

2391
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,200
Like what?

2392
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,200
Yeah.

2393
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,200
Why would she ever want to see that?

2394
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,200
I don't know.

2395
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,200
Maybe she'll just shit on it.

2396
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,200
I don't know.

2397
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,200
I hope so.

2398
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,200
I just don't, I don't think there's any.

2399
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,200
She's obviously a, I don't think there's any.

2400
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,200
I don't think there's any.

2401
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,200
She's obviously a big fan of the PCP.

2402
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,200
Maybe she.

2403
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,200
I mean, who isn't?

2404
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,200
Maybe she helped.

2405
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:25,200
Maybe she helped Trixie with the writing and she wants to see like, I want to read my part.

2406
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:31,200
The fruits of my labor and perhaps, perhaps.

2407
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:34,200
Am I not entitled to the fruit of my labor?

2408
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,200
That's true.

2409
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,200
All right.

2410
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:41,200
I feel like we should, we should be getting on to voicemails soon.

2411
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,200
What do you, what do you dudes think?

2412
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,200
Okay.

2413
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,200
Cool.

2414
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,200
Sweet.

2415
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,200
Sweet.

2416
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,200
Well, I'm good.

2417
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,200
I'm good.

2418
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:53,200
Here's the first one, the first one, which I will post in general.

2419
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,200
Cybershell was here.

2420
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:58,200
This would go on for another couple of hours before we got to voicemail.

2421
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:06,200
Thank God that fucker is nowhere near this holy place.

2422
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:10,200
The first one is called is water wet?

2423
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:13,200
Three, two, one, go.

2424
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,200
I'm going to revive a dead meme here.

2425
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,200
Is water wet?

2426
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,200
No.

2427
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,200
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

2428
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:25,200
Wetness is a property that water applies to other objects.

2429
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:29,200
It doesn't make any, it contradicts our human sensibilities.

2430
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:33,200
Yeah, if wetness means it has water on it, then water doesn't have water on it.

2431
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,200
So it's not wet.

2432
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
You say that water can be wet, right?

2433
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,200
It's like, it's like saying, can fire be drunk?

2434
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:42,200
Or like, can salt have water on each?

2435
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,200
No.

2436
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,200
It's like, if they're touching.

2437
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,200
How many holes does a human body have?

2438
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:53,200
I feel like I've seen a Vsauce-esque video about water is wet.

2439
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,200
And it was actually interesting.

2440
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:56,200
This isn't interesting.

2441
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:58,200
Yeah, I get it.

2442
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,200
Okay, on a purely technical level, I understand.

2443
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,200
Thanks to the voicemail.

2444
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:05,200
Next one is called Ben St. After He Learned.

2445
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:09,200
Is it called half full or half empty kind of thing?

2446
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,200
Ben St. After He Learned.

2447
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:11,200
Yeah, it's a semantic argument.

2448
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,200
Ben St. After He Learned.

2449
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,200
There's 9,860.

2450
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,200
Is water a sandwich?

2451
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,200
Hot dog is a sandwich.

2452
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,200
Hot dog is a sandwich.

2453
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,200
I fucking hate the whole sandwich argument.

2454
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,200
I hate it so much.

2455
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,200
Water is a sandwich because each molecule is sandwiched

2456
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,200
between two other molecules.

2457
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,200
Precisely.

2458
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,200
Oh my god, I don't care.

2459
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,200
Ben St. After He Learned.

2460
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:38,200
There's 9,862 frames of low rent witch made.

2461
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:41,200
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2462
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,200
Like, Vegeta, the Scouter.

2463
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:56,200
I liked how this voicemail was only 3 seconds long.

2464
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,200
I liked that too.

2465
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:02,200
That water question should have been 3 seconds long.

2466
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,200
Yeah, exactly.

2467
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,200
Maybe a voice grail that one.

2468
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:09,200
What a king.

2469
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,200
What a king.

2470
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,200
What a king.

2471
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,200
The only criteria is just be sure.

2472
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
Yeah, the shorter the better.

2473
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,200
The next voicemail is called

2474
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,200
An Honest Review of Bee's New Album.

2475
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,200
Three, two, one, go.

2476
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:29,200
It's pretty good.

2477
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,200
No, pretty good.

2478
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,200
I don't think so.

2479
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:35,200
A lot of the charm that was missing from like the Yig.

2480
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:38,200
Because I listened to it and I thought it was embarrassing.

2481
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:41,200
Yeah, the charm that are all that one.

2482
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,200
I love Pikachu.

2483
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,200
I thought it was pleasant to listen to.

2484
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,200
I thought it was really embarrassing.

2485
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,200
It sounded like a fucking middle schooler wrote the lyrics.

2486
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,200
And she didn't write her own beats.

2487
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,200
Solid.

2488
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,200
There's six and a half or seven out of ten.

2489
01:52:55,200 --> 01:53:00,200
It's like something a high schooler might be a little proud of.

2490
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,200
Well, Ben, you have to look at it.

2491
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,200
Everything is relative.

2492
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:09,200
It's like maybe this album is better than her previous work.

2493
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:13,200
I think it's not even better than the Yig.

2494
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,200
It's actually more embarrassing than the Yig stuff.

2495
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,200
Because the lyrics are like so stupid and like something an idiot would write.

2496
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,200
Pop culture references.

2497
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:26,200
I read, oh my God, the tweet about can anyone decode my nerdcore bars?

2498
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
It's like a reference to Pokemon.

2499
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,200
Oh, God.

2500
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:30,200
I can hate nerd.

2501
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,200
Oh, shit.

2502
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,200
Got it.

2503
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,200
Got it.

2504
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:38,200
The Pikachu, I'm sorry, a functioning adult should not write those Pikachu lyrics.

2505
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:39,200
I'm sorry.

2506
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:44,200
Like you should fucking be ashamed of yourself.

2507
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:45,200
Next.

2508
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,200
I guess I'll just have to take your word for it.

2509
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:52,200
Because I hadn't heard the Pikachu rap when you were talking about it earlier.

2510
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:59,200
I was just imagining like a rap, but it's like from the perspective of Pikachu who could only say Pika and Chu.

2511
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,200
That would have been fun.

2512
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,200
Yeah, that'd be funny.

2513
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:07,200
You have to be a funny, that could be a funny novelty song that's like 30 seconds long.

2514
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:16,200
I did listen to a little bit of the Pikachu one and it was quite shocking, you could say.

2515
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:26,200
Someone should get a picture of Anthony Fantano, turn his yellow shirt into purple,

2516
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,200
photoshop Ben's face over Anthony Fantano.

2517
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,200
You can make him bald too.

2518
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:36,200
And in the background, add the cover art for Bee's last album.

2519
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:40,200
I didn't listen to the whole thing.

2520
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,200
I didn't listen to the whole thing.

2521
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:47,200
I listened to the two track, the one about Pikachu and the one about how she spends all her money on weed.

2522
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:51,200
And I was just like, I don't know.

2523
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:55,200
I was like, sounds like shit.

2524
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:57,200
There was something you already know about that, that's just a fact.

2525
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:05,200
There was some lyric in one of the songs that was like a vague allusion to like burning bridges and throwing away her phone and losing all the contacts,

2526
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:08,200
which I thought was funny just in the classic terms.

2527
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:13,200
I think that's the, I don't know, that's in one of the, yeah, I heard that part.

2528
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,200
It's like, yep, true.

2529
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:22,200
I'm disappointed the Pikachu song didn't have the excellent joke of like, hey, do you like Pokemon?

2530
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:25,200
Good, because I Pikachu in a shower.

2531
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:29,200
It's, I mean, the rhymes are like literally like Dr. Seuss shit.

2532
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:37,200
It's like Dr. Seuss shit with like a little bit of like, a little bit of like changes the meter up a little adds like some extra, an extra syllable here and there.

2533
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,200
There's some twiring.

2534
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:39,200
That's it.

2535
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,200
You're right.

2536
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:41,200
Sure.

2537
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,200
Yeah, sure.

2538
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,200
You should make a diss track then.

2539
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:47,200
So you do it.

2540
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,200
Here's what I'll say.

2541
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:56,200
Here's how it's bad to the point that I think if I wrote a diss track, I think I could write bars about as good.

2542
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:59,200
So that's how, that's how bad it is.

2543
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:05,200
Well, I'll take your word for it because obviously you're the number one Yig Studio fan.

2544
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:06,200
True.

2545
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,200
Okay.

2546
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:12,200
Next one is called additional note on B's album, something I just noticed.

2547
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,200
Three, two, one, go.

2548
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:24,200
Oh, and the first track is titled dollars falling out of my pockets, which I would personally like to believe as a reference to Ben St.

2549
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:31,200
paying off her patrons in order to get them to unsubscribe.

2550
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,200
I doubt it.

2551
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:33,200
I doubt it.

2552
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:37,200
I think it's just an illusion to losing the money out of her pocket.

2553
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:38,200
Yeah.

2554
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,200
It's spending it all on me.

2555
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,200
It's gone.

2556
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,200
Loathe.

2557
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:43,200
I don't understand.

2558
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:53,200
I don't understand how she makes so much money from Patreon and Substack and I mean, she's probably got like two subs to her only fans or whatever.

2559
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:59,200
And YouTube ad revenue and gets an allowance from her mom on top of it.

2560
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:06,200
Parents just pay for everything and still is broke and has to fucking beg on Twitter and be like, guys, please buy my new album.

2561
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:07,200
It's actually good.

2562
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,200
I promise.

2563
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:12,200
I'm broke and I don't know how do you even spend that much money on?

2564
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,200
How do you do it?

2565
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,200
She already covered that in the first song.

2566
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,200
She spends it all on weed.

2567
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,200
She's probably pulling it for the whole family.

2568
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,200
How do you do it?

2569
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,200
How do you do it?

2570
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:26,200
You get overcharged so you don't know what you're doing, probably.

2571
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:27,200
God damn.

2572
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,200
Okay, whatever.

2573
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:32,200
Next voicemail is called...

2574
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,200
I'll post it there.

2575
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,200
It's called MFV.

2576
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:40,200
Sorry, I just got to take a second to load.

2577
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,200
Come on and load.

2578
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,200
Come on and...

2579
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:45,200
Okay.

2580
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,200
Here comes the load.

2581
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:48,200
Here comes the load.

2582
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:51,200
Three, two, one, go.

2583
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:55,200
Hey guys, this is my first voicemail.

2584
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,200
Hope I'm doing it right.

2585
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,200
Yeah.

2586
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,200
This voicemail.

2587
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:00,200
You're killing it.

2588
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:01,200
I'm going to tell a joke.

2589
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:06,200
It's my first time telling a joke so I hope you're going to do it right.

2590
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:11,200
You can do it, buddy.

2591
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:17,200
What does the rat say when meeting another rat?

2592
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:20,200
Cheese to meet you.

2593
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:23,200
Cheese to meet you.

2594
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:25,200
Cheese to meet you.

2595
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,200
Do you approve?

2596
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,200
Yeah, it was pretty good.

2597
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:32,200
That was the first joke he ever told in his entire life.

2598
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:35,200
So I give him a lot of credit for that.

2599
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:38,200
Well done, young man.

2600
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,200
Here's to many more.

2601
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:45,200
I thought that was Gamer's Tavern's message at first.

2602
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,200
Why would he drop this joke here?

2603
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:49,200
He could have just said it on the podcast already.

2604
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,200
He didn't know it was going to be on the episode.

2605
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:53,200
I didn't know.

2606
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:57,200
Next one is called Oh How the Best Have Fallen.

2607
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,200
Three bests and quotes.

2608
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:02,200
Three, two, one, go.

2609
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:08,200
Nate calling a woman ugly over Twitter because she doesn't look like an anime character.

2610
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,200
I didn't expect that of him.

2611
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:18,200
I wonder what kind of audience that cultivates a fucking based one.

2612
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:27,200
Yeah, I saw his tweet about the Faye Valentine actress who he called Lagoblina.

2613
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,200
Oh, no.

2614
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:35,200
And then his follow-up tweet was like, he was like, we all knew this would happen.

2615
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,200
Damn.

2616
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:41,200
I can't believe Nate's a racist, holy shit.

2617
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,200
It's just vegan.

2618
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:45,200
I mean, I don't know what that means.

2619
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,200
I genuinely don't know what that means.

2620
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:53,200
Gablina or Gablina is like a joke about mixed-race people.

2621
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:58,200
No, there's no way that's what he meant.

2622
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:59,200
There's no way.

2623
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:05,200
I've heard that used as just a meme to disparage a woman's appearance in general.

2624
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,200
I've mostly seen it like Americans look like this.

2625
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:14,200
They're Gablinas or Gablinas and they're mixed-race or something.

2626
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:15,200
I don't think.

2627
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:19,200
I remember seeing that joke on Poll a lot, which I guess makes sense.

2628
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:22,200
Maybe he's just racist against women.

2629
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:25,200
Why there was a word for that?

2630
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:32,200
I've only used that term when posting drawings of my goblin girl character and saying El Gablina because she is a goblin.

2631
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,200
Is that okay? Is that acceptable?

2632
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,200
I'm gonna say yes.

2633
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:40,200
No, it's anti-Semitic to draw goblins.

2634
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,200
When have you drawn a goblin girl?

2635
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:45,200
I'm gonna check your Twitter right now.

2636
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:48,200
It's been a long time, not recently.

2637
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,200
I usually retweet everything you draw.

2638
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:53,200
Maybe I'm thinking one of the Saiyan characters you draw or something.

2639
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,200
Would you say it?

2640
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:59,200
I thought you had drawn one recently and maybe it was a Saiyan character.

2641
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:03,200
Yeah, very goblin-adjacent is Saiyan.

2642
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,200
It was green and it had long ears.

2643
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,200
Well, that's not a fucking Saiyan then.

2644
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:11,200
Well, I don't know.

2645
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,200
Hang on, hang on.

2646
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,200
Two seconds. Where's the last one I did?

2647
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:18,200
Oh my god, it was like six months ago. Never mind.

2648
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,200
There you go.

2649
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,200
There's a goblin.

2650
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:28,200
Well, let's call that a goblina.

2651
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,200
That's kind of like a...

2652
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:34,200
That's the Akira Toriyama art style, isn't it?

2653
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:36,200
A little.

2654
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:39,200
I'm big inspired by Toriyama, so I guess it might see through.

2655
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,200
The hair reminds me of Bulma's mom.

2656
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,200
Yeah, it's kind of based on that.

2657
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:48,200
This reminds me of something across between Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball Z.

2658
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:52,200
Yeah, I see that. I see a little tinge of Toriyama in there.

2659
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:56,200
I like the picture you drew of Zelda with a fat ass and there's a tiny penis.

2660
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:58,200
That was a fun commission.

2661
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,200
That was pretty funny.

2662
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,200
I thought that was funny.

2663
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:05,200
People were kink-shaving the guy who commissioned it in the comments and I was like,

2664
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,200
that's not cool. It gave me money.

2665
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,200
It's not cool.

2666
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:10,200
It's kind of funny, but it's not cool.

2667
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:12,200
It's funny. It's fine.

2668
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,200
Whatever, yeah.

2669
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:20,200
Okay, next voicemail is called Grief Cliff.

2670
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:23,200
Three, two, one, go.

2671
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:27,200
Hey, this is Grief Cliff here in the United States.

2672
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,200
Government needs to make me a 420 star general.

2673
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,200
This is my plan. Here's how we could have saved the exit.

2674
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:34,200
The exit?

2675
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:36,200
We knew the Taliban was coming in.

2676
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,200
They had all the trucks and the jeeps and they're trying to take it over the airport.

2677
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:45,200
So what we should have done is we take all the TNT in the world, just all the TNT in the world,

2678
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:48,200
and we put it on the airport. We just put it under there.

2679
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,200
Simple so far.

2680
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,200
And then we put a little pressure plate on that and we fly the plane out.

2681
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,200
And then they're like, ah, we won.

2682
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:55,200
And they're like pew, pew, pew.

2683
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:59,200
And they're firing their guns in the air and one of them steps on the pressure plate.

2684
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,200
Yeah.

2685
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,200
Yeah.

2686
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,200
Then it's game over and then we win.

2687
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:06,200
Then we go back in and then do it again.

2688
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,200
Just repeating this problem.

2689
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:11,200
After the first time, they might not fall for it.

2690
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:13,200
And they go on and get on that.

2691
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:15,200
They fall on it like three times.

2692
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,200
Yeah, it's a little late now, but maybe we can...

2693
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:21,200
This sounds like a Wiley Coyote.

2694
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:23,200
That's rad too.

2695
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,200
Peace out.

2696
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:25,200
Pull me once.

2697
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,200
Awesome. It would have worked.

2698
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,200
It's like lemmings.

2699
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,200
They'll just keep going onto the pressure plates.

2700
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,200
The Taliban.

2701
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,200
Just one after another.

2702
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,200
Yeah.

2703
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,200
Surely you would say landmine unless you were thinking of Minecraft.

2704
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,200
We should have just...

2705
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:39,200
Yeah, true.

2706
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:42,200
We should have just banned the Taliban.

2707
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,200
Yeah.

2708
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:49,200
The word for TNT connected to a pressure plate is landmine.

2709
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:50,200
Who that is?

2710
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:53,200
We should have given the Taliban weapons.

2711
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,200
Why the fuck did we do that?

2712
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,200
Yeah.

2713
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:00,200
Next voicemail is called...

2714
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,200
What is it called?

2715
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:05,200
It is called Red Five Rainbow Tommy J Call Out.

2716
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:08,200
Three, two, one, go.

2717
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:09,200
Oh my gosh.

2718
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:12,200
I bet I can make a voicemail better than all this shit that comes in.

2719
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,200
You know what though?

2720
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,200
I don't.

2721
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:15,200
Why?

2722
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,200
Because I don't have anything to fucking say.

2723
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:20,200
So I just don't say anything because I don't want to make you listen to my goddamn voice.

2724
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,200
True.

2725
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:22,200
Yeah.

2726
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:26,200
Tommy J Call Outs are a genre unto themselves.

2727
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,200
Give us more of those please.

2728
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,200
Sorry.

2729
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,200
I think so.

2730
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,200
I gotta be excited.

2731
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,200
I think so.

2732
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:34,200
Girls listen to the PCP.

2733
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:36,200
I know that.

2734
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,200
True.

2735
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:40,200
Yeah, that's like...

2736
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:42,200
I wonder if our demographics have shifted.

2737
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,200
We don't know their pronouns.

2738
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,200
Don't say anything.

2739
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:46,200
Oh fuck, you're right.

2740
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:51,200
I happen to know that Red Five Rainbow is a she, but that's just...

2741
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,200
Wait, did I say something wrong?

2742
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:57,200
She said, she's the assumed.

2743
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:58,200
She's the assumed.

2744
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,200
And you know what happens when you assume?

2745
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:02,200
You make an ass out of you and me.

2746
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:03,200
It makes a big ass.

2747
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:04,200
That's how you spell the word.

2748
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,200
It's pronounced.

2749
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:09,200
It makes a big ass that you can't even fuck with your tiny dick.

2750
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:10,200
Get out of here.

2751
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:12,200
That's relatable.

2752
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:13,200
Relatable.

2753
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,200
Can't even reach.

2754
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,200
Especially the tiny dick park.

2755
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:20,200
You make an ass out of you and I actually is how it's said.

2756
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,200
Out of you.

2757
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:22,200
Oh fuck.

2758
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:23,200
Ass-eye.

2759
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,200
Yep.

2760
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,200
No ass.

2761
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:26,200
Not ass.

2762
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:28,200
Ass is donkey, dumbass.

2763
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,200
Wait, dumbass.

2764
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,200
Okay, that was pretty mean.

2765
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:33,200
I think I'm going to unfollow you on Twitter now.

2766
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:35,200
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

2767
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:36,200
I'm not going to do that.

2768
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,200
Yeah, you're not even going to make a dent, boy.

2769
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,200
No, I would never do that.

2770
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,200
I would never do that.

2771
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:46,200
Next one is called Ben After Every Workout.

2772
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,200
Okay.

2773
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:48,200
Processing.

2774
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:49,200
There it is.

2775
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:52,200
Three, two, one, go.

2776
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:55,200
Get the pizza now.

2777
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:58,200
I mean, I mean.

2778
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,200
Yeah, that seems pretty accurate.

2779
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:03,200
Do you get the pizza now after every workout, Ben?

2780
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,200
I want to.

2781
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:07,200
You want to see the pizza?

2782
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:11,200
That will ruin the point of the workout, wouldn't it, if you get a pizza?

2783
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:13,200
Is he calling me fat?

2784
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,200
This guy's calling me fat.

2785
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,200
He's calling you a pizza demon.

2786
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,200
He's calling you a fat.

2787
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,200
Get the pizza now.

2788
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,200
He's calling you fat with a pH.

2789
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:24,200
Not if you degrease your pizza before eating it.

2790
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:25,200
It's a pizza with a pH.

2791
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,200
Fat with a pizza.

2792
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:29,200
I am fat, though.

2793
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,200
I have to start working out again.

2794
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:34,200
I have to go to the fucking hardware store and buy new bolts,

2795
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:40,200
because I stripped the bolts trying to, Alan wrench my squat rack together.

2796
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:45,200
So that's a whole fucking thing that I got to do.

2797
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,200
Thanks for asking.

2798
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:52,200
Just putting the squat rack together is a workout in and of itself.

2799
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:55,200
Yeah, only it was bad for me.

2800
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,200
Next one is called...

2801
02:06:57,200 --> 02:07:02,200
You do it like a workout, but you could do a work in when you work on your inside.

2802
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:10,200
A work in is when I boycott working out to defeat capitalism.

2803
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,200
Oh boy.

2804
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:12,200
Works every time.

2805
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,200
That'll show him.

2806
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,200
That's what I've been doing.

2807
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:18,200
That's what fatbin is.

2808
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:20,200
That's what I've been doing this whole time.

2809
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,200
Yeah, true.

2810
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,200
Next voicemail is called...

2811
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:28,200
Unlike some lectures, this one exists.

2812
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:34,200
This is from fuck the golden witch bitch at kibagorf.com.

2813
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:37,200
Three, two, one, go.

2814
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:39,200
Hey, PCP.

2815
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:42,200
I just wanted to say that it's finally here.

2816
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:47,200
A new big ol' fan lecture, Yu-Gi-Oh GX 101.

2817
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:51,200
And I just wanted to say a big ol' thank you to all y'all, you know.

2818
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:55,200
And my audience, which was most of the pro and on,

2819
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:00,200
Rito, Jelly, Eleazar, Kajoro, Nonibra, Sital, Syamed, and Shinnisaba,

2820
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:02,200
all quirky characters you may know.

2821
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:06,200
As well as a bunch of artists I commissioned for various characters

2822
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:11,200
for the lecture, Alexymillion, Asha in the AM, Sital, Doon Koon,

2823
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:15,200
Jade Moro, Jelly Beaner, Chip Wiseman, Kaiju Koon, Kajoro Bitterthorn,

2824
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:21,200
Michi, Never Paint, Nonibra, Syamed, Sporktown, and Sital for the thumbnail art.

2825
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:25,200
Thank y'all again for inspiring creators and artists out there.

2826
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:30,200
And link in the description for me, please, Eleazar. Thank you.

2827
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:33,200
I recognize about half of those names.

2828
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:38,200
That's Sean Don. I'm sure that's Sean.

2829
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:42,200
Eleazar, if you... I'm sure you can find...

2830
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,200
Yeah, put the link in the description.

2831
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:46,200
What was the name of the video?

2832
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:51,200
Well, I don't think he said... It's a Yu-Gi-Oh DX PCP fan lecture.

2833
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:56,200
Yeah, Eleazar, put the link down there in the doobly-doo.

2834
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:00,200
That could be interesting. I always liked those lectures.

2835
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:04,200
Nah, I've never been a fan.

2836
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:06,200
Not a fan. Yeah, I can't find one.

2837
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:10,200
Not a fan. I hate learning. I hate learning.

2838
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,200
Eleazar will probably know where it is.

2839
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:15,200
That's why you're so smart.

2840
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:18,200
I'm so smart that I can't learn anymore, and that's why I don't like it.

2841
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:24,200
How Yu-Gi-Oh Dual Links is censored outside of Japan. What? No way.

2842
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:28,200
Next... What? What's wrong with my fucking...

2843
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,200
I'm okay, my mouse went weird.

2844
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:36,200
Next voicemail is called Big Chicken's Egg of OK Tim Rogers Is David Foster Walla?

2845
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:39,200
And then it cuts off. 3, 2, 1, go.

2846
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:42,200
Alright, let's look at the cold, hard, objective facts here.

2847
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:46,200
David Foster Wallas is a very self-conscious man, so after all the eyes went on him

2848
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:49,200
after publishing Infinite Jest, everyone calling him a genius and stuff,

2849
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:52,200
I don't blame him for wanting to fake his own death.

2850
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:55,200
That was just a puppet that he hung in the attic.

2851
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:59,200
And then he cut his hair, he learned how to wash his hair.

2852
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:04,200
He shaved his jawbone down a little bit with some plastic surgery money that he got from Infinite Jest.

2853
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,200
He got a job translating.

2854
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:12,200
And if you look at both Tim Rogers and David Foster Wallas' writing, it's remarkably similar.

2855
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:18,200
In Tim Rogers' action button reviews where he spends four hours out of the six hours of the video

2856
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:23,200
talking about his personal life, they line up remarkably with David Foster Wallas' own life.

2857
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:25,200
So, you know, you be the judge.

2858
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:34,200
Wait, is this like the Alex Jones is Bill Hicks conspiracy?

2859
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,200
I haven't heard that one.

2860
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:37,200
Oh, really?

2861
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:41,200
I mean, you haven't heard that popular, famed conspiracy?

2862
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:43,200
That's a classic theory.

2863
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:46,200
I think I might have heard someone mention it.

2864
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:50,200
Yeah, it's that. It's like that.

2865
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:56,200
I remember David Foster Wallas be now probably in his like sixties, right?

2866
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:01,200
Maybe he wasn't he wasn't at all. I don't know.

2867
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:08,200
I remember somebody told me that I sound like the action button review guy, but I don't know if that's accurate.

2868
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:11,200
That you you absolutely do not.

2869
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:16,200
That is the Tim Rogers is the action button review guy, but you don't sound anything like him.

2870
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,200
And I don't think so.

2871
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:22,200
No, you sound like Bismarck. You sound like the speedrun YouTuber Bismarck.

2872
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:24,200
Yeah, I saw somebody mentioned that as well.

2873
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:26,200
You are the same person.

2874
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:31,200
I only watched one video of that guy and it was about Mario 64, I think.

2875
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:34,200
I think I've watched their entire channel.

2876
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:39,200
I eat that shit up. I eat that fucking speedrun YouTube video content up.

2877
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:41,200
For some reason.

2878
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,200
It's cool.

2879
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:47,200
Yeah, that and the egg studio stuff. Those are your two main things.

2880
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:49,200
Yeah, true. Yeah, true.

2881
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:55,200
Dude, the latest, the latest what you're doing dropped and I drop whatever I'm doing and I go check it out.

2882
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:58,200
Yeah, you drop whatever you're doing to see what you're doing.

2883
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:01,200
I drop what I'm doing to see what you do.

2884
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:05,200
I know we're in voicemails, but can I just say those are actually so hard to watch.

2885
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:08,200
They're like, I watched. Yeah.

2886
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:15,200
Gib, you mentioned one and I wasn't going to check it out, but I went and I looked and I watched the start where.

2887
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:22,200
Yeah, where she literally can't fucking introduce herself and Riley needs to tell her what to say.

2888
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:26,200
She leaves it in and it's not a funny outtake. It's embarrassing.

2889
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:27,200
Jesus Christ.

2890
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:31,200
It's like you're fucking struggling so much with the simplest thing. It's so bad.

2891
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:37,200
Yeah, the other thing that kind of creeps me out is that there's no eye contact whatsoever.

2892
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:39,200
Between them. Between the two of them.

2893
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,200
Yeah, between who's talking.

2894
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,200
Yeah, she doesn't look at them.

2895
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,200
She's just staring off into the distance.

2896
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:48,200
Yeah. It's weird.

2897
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:56,200
Like she's not staring at the camera and she's not staring at them and she's just kind of looking off into the distance as they talk.

2898
02:12:56,200 --> 02:13:01,200
And they're not staring at her either. They're just staring into the distance.

2899
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:03,200
Kind of to the side, into the middle distance.

2900
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:09,200
I didn't watch the whole thing, but yeah, both of the bits that I've seen are the same.

2901
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:13,200
There's just like very, very low level of like interaction.

2902
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:18,200
It sounds like she's not at all interested or cares what they're saying.

2903
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:21,200
She's just waiting for them to finish speaking.

2904
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:23,200
That's what I've heard.

2905
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,200
Next lesson.

2906
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:28,200
That's what I've heard. She's like these days.

2907
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,200
Lamal.

2908
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:35,200
Next voicemail is called...

2909
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:37,200
It's called Doid Gazers Again.

2910
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:43,200
Okay, three, two, three, two, one, go.

2911
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:47,200
Hi, this is the golden bitch, aka Doid Gazers.

2912
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:49,200
Sorry I haven't made a voicemail in a while.

2913
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:51,200
I just know something.

2914
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:57,200
Ben, that jacket that you wear in the lectures, is that too small for you?

2915
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,200
It's a half coat.

2916
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:06,200
It looks incredibly tight and uncomfortable and it also comes down to about an inch and a half.

2917
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,200
You're so fucking stupid.

2918
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:13,200
So I was thinking maybe we all donate money to Ben Sings Patreon at Patreon.

2919
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:17,200
Wait, I mean, yes it is too small. I can't afford a bigger one. Please help me.

2920
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:21,200
So that Ben can afford a new jacket for his future endeavors.

2921
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:22,200
It's like future trunks.

2922
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:26,200
So wait, Doid Gazers is back? I thought they quit.

2923
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:35,200
Well, they're out of retirement and they're apparently recording voicemails in what sounds like maybe a pool room at their local YMCA.

2924
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:42,200
I'm a huge fan of the Doid Gazers.

2925
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:47,200
What was the point of the Doid Gazers bit for that question?

2926
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:53,200
I don't know, but the coat that I'm wearing...

2927
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:57,200
I'm disappointed there was no crying baby in the background this morning.

2928
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:01,200
The coat that I'm wearing in those videos, I think you would call it a half coat.

2929
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:06,200
It's like a tuxedo coat. It has buttons on it, but it doesn't close. It doesn't button.

2930
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:10,200
It stays open and you would wear like a shirt and like a cummerbund under it.

2931
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:12,200
It's like future trunks.

2932
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:17,200
Yes, but like a tuxedo of being future trunks.

2933
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:22,200
It stays open because you're too fat to button it up.

2934
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:28,200
Well, I am now. I wasn't at the time. I was lean. I was a lean mean 169.

2935
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:35,200
If you want Ben to get a new button up for his fat, disgusting body, donate to his Patreon.

2936
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:40,200
Yes, if you want me to be able to afford a third button to cover up my disgusting gut.

2937
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:45,200
If you think Ben just looks disgusting and you want him to cover up, please donate money.

2938
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:51,200
You just fucking hate Ben and how he looks and never want to see him again. That's where you gotta send money.

2939
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:53,200
Donate money.

2940
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:57,200
You gotta make sure he can't show that atrocity to anyone else.

2941
02:15:57,200 --> 02:15:59,200
I want the money.

2942
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:02,200
Donate to Yig Studio's Patreon.

2943
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:04,200
That's all around.

2944
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:09,200
Well, it's, I mean, it's called The Golden Witch.

2945
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:12,200
Oh, is it? I thought it was Yig Studio.

2946
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:14,200
Let's see how much money they're making right now.

2947
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:20,200
It dropped another 50 this month. It has dropped about 50 every month.

2948
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:25,200
Wait, are you still getting a, are you still paying a dollar for every time it drops?

2949
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:31,200
I would. If someone contacted me and told me I'm unpledging, I would get, I would pay them to do it.

2950
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:35,200
But no, people, people are just doing it of their own free will. This isn't even on.

2951
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:38,200
I've started a revolution. It's, it's grown, it's grown bigger than anything.

2952
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:42,200
Ben, I am pledged six times. Can I have six dollars?

2953
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,200
Yeah.

2954
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,200
Yeah.

2955
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:53,200
I hate how we talked about collaborative projects recently uploaded on The Golden Witch Patreon.

2956
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,200
Only five bucks to see. What a deal.

2957
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:59,200
I bet that's awesome. I bet that's really interesting.

2958
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,200
I am going to become a patron right now.

2959
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:18,200
No, no. Julian in my discord, just, just for fun, subscribed to her sub-stack just long enough to like download all of the, all of the private, you know, posts there and just post to them.

2960
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,200
And they were just really boring. I don't know.

2961
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,200
That one was just.

2962
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:25,200
And the legendary Kiwi Farms leaker stole them all and put them on Kiwi Farms.

2963
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:28,200
Oh yes. The legendary Kiwi Farms leaker.

2964
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:29,200
Wherever you are.

2965
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,200
He's a spy in my discord.

2966
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,200
Who is this man of mystery?

2967
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:45,200
Who is this, well, this, this, this woman of mystery because his, her thing is that you need, she takes a neutral stance on pronouns, obviously, but demands consistency.

2968
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:49,200
So you just, you got to pick one and stick with it or else they get mad at you.

2969
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:50,200
Yeah, yeah, she.

2970
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:55,200
So, she, so I rolled the dice and then we landed on she.

2971
02:17:55,200 --> 02:18:01,200
So, neutral stance though. No, no skin in the game on that one.

2972
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:07,200
There was, there was just, you know, a bunch of the posts were like, I don't know.

2973
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,200
I don't know, they were annoying.

2974
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:22,200
That one in particular was like, it was like, why do movies only get, why does everyone know the director of the movie and not all the other people that worked on the movie?

2975
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,200
There's too many people to talk about.

2976
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,200
True.

2977
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:33,200
Did she upload something complaining about how a lot of music, mainstream music is made by large teams of people or something like that?

2978
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:36,200
I think that was the same essay.

2979
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:38,200
That one's a classic cope there.

2980
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:43,200
It talks about like, but in music, it's a little bit different kind of.

2981
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:49,200
Look at all these people I passionately interviewed, you can see.

2982
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:56,200
Next voicemail is called, wait, no, that one's not a real voicemail.

2983
02:18:56,200 --> 02:19:01,200
This one, wait, is that one a real voicemail?

2984
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:05,200
Wait, this was, fuck, this is one of the alternate.

2985
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:08,200
This is one of the alternate.

2986
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:12,200
They use the other website for some reason that I don't understand.

2987
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:18,200
Okay, this one is called, thank you for playing my voicemails despite my ethnicity.

2988
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:20,200
This one is loading.

2989
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,200
We're loading.

2990
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,200
We're almost there.

2991
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:24,200
We're three quarters of the way there.

2992
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:29,200
We are going to be, this is what I get for using my phone as a hotspot.

2993
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:30,200
Here it is.

2994
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:31,200
Here it comes.

2995
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,200
You got text it.

2996
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:33,200
Perfect.

2997
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,200
Three, two, one, go.

2998
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:41,200
I don't understand why some people submit a link to a different site where they upload

2999
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:42,200
their audio.

3000
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:47,200
I don't have a microphone and can't get voice meter to run correctly on Windows XP.

3001
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:51,200
I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

3002
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,200
How do you record a voicemail if you don't have a microphone?

3003
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:55,200
It's so cute.

3004
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,200
Do you have a phone?

3005
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:02,200
This person still uses Windows XP just like I was doing a couple of years back.

3006
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:06,200
Oh, this person must be doing, they must not be recording.

3007
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:12,200
They're synthesizing it with their fucking voice modulator text to speech.

3008
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:15,200
Yeah, that wasn't a real voice button.

3009
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,200
Yeah, no one sounded like that.

3010
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:24,200
Well, okay, but it's not every voicemail that uses the other website is like that, but

3011
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:27,200
maybe for this person, that's why I guess that makes sense.

3012
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,200
They hired Siri for this one.

3013
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:36,200
The next voicemail is called Hype me up.

3014
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:38,200
Hype me up.

3015
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:39,200
Please do.

3016
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,200
Sorry, it's loading.

3017
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,200
Sorry.

3018
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,200
It's just related to the hype.

3019
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,200
We're bleeding hype.

3020
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,200
We're bleeding hype.

3021
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:47,200
Please.

3022
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,200
Here we go.

3023
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,200
Here we go.

3024
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:51,200
Here we go.

3025
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:52,200
I'm getting hype.

3026
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:53,200
Okay.

3027
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:54,200
Three, two, one, go.

3028
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,200
Hey, fellas.

3029
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,200
It's not too much of a spoiler to ask.

3030
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:03,200
What are you guys projects after you're done with what you're doing now?

3031
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:10,200
I think Gibbs to walking on a lot of ghosts in dance definitely still walking on that

3032
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:11,200
that game.

3033
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,200
Yeah.

3034
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:20,200
And I would like to know so I can get excited about those because you know, currently, the

3035
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:28,200
projects are reference to like a fucking discord forum game that I don't play.

3036
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,200
Like four new reviews.

3037
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,200
I didn't watch and shit.

3038
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,200
Yeah, I'm going to do a pony review next.

3039
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:40,200
I can really get happy about that shit, but the new new stuff, I think the thing that

3040
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:43,200
I'm going to do, I'm not going to start anything new.

3041
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:49,200
Now my plan is finish, finish phantoms revenge and then doing so finish slime and punishment.

3042
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:56,200
And after that, probably I'll finish the Winnie the Pooh season one retrospective just because

3043
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:58,200
I think I can bang that up pretty fast.

3044
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:00,200
And then I want to finish Biscuits after that.

3045
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:06,200
And so that's my first you have to be working on phantoms revenge for like five to six years.

3046
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:12,200
No, I think it's I got a lot done last month and it's it's pretty close.

3047
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:14,200
It's it's close to being done.

3048
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,200
I'm not going to.

3049
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,200
I don't know exactly how three years then.

3050
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:25,200
Yeah, maybe maybe 20 early 2023 release for the alpha.

3051
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:28,200
You guys you guys want to answer this?

3052
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:35,200
I after a lot of ghosts after the the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter, then there's there's

3053
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,200
a lot of things I could do.

3054
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:42,200
And there's my secret project, which will be the hypest of all of them.

3055
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:45,200
I think once I release that once I announce what that is.

3056
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:48,200
Yeah, people will be like, oh, wow.

3057
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:51,200
Then there's certain things I need to finish.

3058
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:59,200
Obviously, the Lord of Ghosts needs a finished final chapter arc act.

3059
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:05,200
Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King needs a proper release on my website need to finish that up.

3060
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:11,200
There's another small comic that I was going to do for the Cato anthology that I didn't finish in time.

3061
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,200
I could finish that.

3062
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:17,200
Then there's another two or three different comic ideas that I want to start.

3063
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:18,200
And then there's Bill J.

3064
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:19,200
Two and then there's the Bill J.

3065
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:20,200
Book.

3066
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,200
There's a lot of things on my plate.

3067
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:22,200
That's that's human.

3068
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,200
That's too many things.

3069
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,200
That's too many things.

3070
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:26,200
You can't do all these many things next.

3071
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:28,200
I feel it.

3072
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:30,200
No, no, I'm not going to do them next.

3073
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:33,200
But there's like of them of the things to do next.

3074
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,200
There's lots.

3075
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:36,200
I just need to choose one at a time.

3076
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:40,200
What about the Mario to a stream that you said you wanted to do?

3077
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,200
Yeah, I could do that in a few days.

3078
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:48,200
I could I could stream Mario to I haven't felt like streaming in a couple days.

3079
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:51,200
That's basically content.

3080
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:56,200
That is not actually that is wasted content though.

3081
02:23:56,200 --> 02:24:01,200
If you're not streaming your you should be screaming.

3082
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,200
This money.

3083
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:08,200
Sitting alone not streaming.

3084
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,200
You should be streaming yourself screaming.

3085
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:16,200
Yeah, ice cream on top of that scary games.

3086
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:22,200
Like everybody you see on a YouTube video or a stream, they're not screaming because

3087
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
they're streaming as soon as they hit.

3088
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:25,200
As soon as they turn it off.

3089
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,200
They start screaming.

3090
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:29,200
I can't believe I'm not monetizing this.

3091
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:32,200
You're either screaming or screaming.

3092
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,200
There's never an in between.

3093
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,200
Or both.

3094
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,200
Scream.

3095
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:39,200
Well, if you're screaming.

3096
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:40,200
It's streaming.

3097
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
Then you're creaming.

3098
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,200
Willie.

3099
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:48,200
Cheen teaming teaming.

3100
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:55,200
Next voicemail is called more bell jpe type stuff.

3101
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,200
Oh, a minute 30.

3102
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:58,200
All right, I'll give it a chance.

3103
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:01,200
Three, two, one, go.

3104
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:06,200
Hey, give a you said we're sad in the last episode because we have people demanding things

3105
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:09,200
of you and ask who is going to demand things of you.

3106
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:17,200
I find the thing that most that you ever did was bail jpe.

3107
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:21,200
I love that it's like a funny adventure comic.

3108
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,200
I love how it looks and how it's pleasing to the eye.

3109
02:25:24,200 --> 02:25:32,200
I know a lot of ghosts and Clarissa are also kind of kind of similar.

3110
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:37,200
But Clarissa, I don't think you're that good drawing the human form yet.

3111
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:39,200
And the colors.

3112
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:40,200
I miss the colors.

3113
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:41,200
I don't know if I agree with that.

3114
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:42,200
Disagree.

3115
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:43,200
J pass.

3116
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,200
And the lot of ghosts.

3117
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:49,200
I couldn't understand what the fuck was happening because I never read.

3118
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,200
I never played.

3119
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,200
You don't have to fucking read.

3120
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,200
No.

3121
02:25:54,200 --> 02:26:04,200
But even then, I never read Homestuck, but I played bail jpe and I loved it.

3122
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:12,200
And if you did more stuff like more like adventure, you know, humorous and charming.

3123
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,200
Shit.

3124
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:18,200
Like adventure time dragon ball bullshit like that.

3125
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:20,200
I would be pleased.

3126
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:22,200
I would like it.

3127
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:23,200
I will share it.

3128
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,200
I will print it and I will shove it up my ass.

3129
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:27,200
Yeah.

3130
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:33,200
I agree with all the things this guy likes about bail jpe.

3131
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:38,200
I don't agree that like there's any problem with the way you draw the human form.

3132
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,200
I think I thought your drawings.

3133
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:41,200
I mean it's a little amateurish.

3134
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:42,200
Well, I mean it generally.

3135
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:47,200
The drawings in Clarissa were not going for like anatomical accuracy.

3136
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:52,200
They were going for like, you know, an expressive cartoonish look.

3137
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:55,200
And I thought it conveyed that very well.

3138
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:57,200
Very gestural and momentum.

3139
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:03,200
I really thought your drawings of specifically your drawings of the human form specifically

3140
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:09,200
your drawings of the human form in Clarissa were like a big, a big like something that

3141
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:14,200
was like, oh, wow, I didn't know Gibb could do this, but she's doing it.

3142
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:18,200
So I like strongly disagree with that particular point actually.

3143
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:19,200
Wow.

3144
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:20,200
Yeah.

3145
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:21,200
That's so nice, Ben.

3146
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,200
It's nice to hear.

3147
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:23,200
Yeah.

3148
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:24,200
Fuck you.

3149
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:25,200
And then.

3150
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,200
No, you complimented me.

3151
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:27,200
It's too late.

3152
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,200
What was the other thing he said he didn't like about?

3153
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:31,200
He misses the colors.

3154
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,200
I mean, coloring is hard, but.

3155
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:35,200
He said he couldn't read Lord of Ghosts.

3156
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:36,200
You don't.

3157
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,200
Oh yeah.

3158
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,200
The RCK thing.

3159
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:41,200
You have to read no RFCK to read Lord of Ghosts.

3160
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,200
That's like fairy bait.

3161
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,200
Whatever.

3162
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:45,200
I don't know.

3163
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:52,200
I try to make it like, I mean, I am biased in that I do know about RFCK and the history

3164
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:54,200
of the Lord of Ghosts in RFCK.

3165
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:59,200
I tried to condense it all down into the main little parts you need to know.

3166
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:08,200
And like everything that you learn about like mud and blood in like the, in, you know, in

3167
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:13,200
but second he is, is the same as what slime is in Endless Wars is not that.

3168
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:14,200
The Lord of Ghosts.

3169
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,200
It's just a parallel world.

3170
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,200
Comic.

3171
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:17,200
Of the same thing.

3172
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:24,200
It does like start its initial setup is based in RFCK, but it very clearly and simply explains

3173
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:30,200
what the setup is in a way that like you don't need to have read anything else beforehand.

3174
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:32,200
So it was pretty comfy.

3175
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:35,200
I think there's a misunderstanding there.

3176
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:41,200
There might be people who know that it's of Endless War and will immediately assume they

3177
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,200
don't know enough to get it.

3178
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,200
It's just not true.

3179
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:45,200
You should just read it.

3180
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,200
It's just not true.

3181
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:49,200
Personally, I would like to see more red man comics.

3182
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:52,200
Remember when you used to do those?

3183
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:53,200
Yeah.

3184
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:55,200
This is very easy to do.

3185
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:56,200
It's just, I don't know.

3186
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:58,200
I mean, it was, it's the same as that.

3187
02:28:58,200 --> 02:28:59,200
It's the same.

3188
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:00,200
Slime and punishment is the same.

3189
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:05,200
Like, yeah, it's set in RFCK, but the comic explains what's going on and explains what

3190
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:06,200
you need.

3191
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:10,200
You don't have to have played the game to, to, or at least that was my intention.

3192
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:13,200
You don't have to have played the game to know what's going on because the comic explains

3193
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:14,200
what's going on.

3194
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:17,200
I'd say it's a lot easier to read Lord of Ghosts than it is.

3195
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:20,200
Slime and punishment just because there's the extra layer of all the Christian lore and

3196
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:22,200
the pony stuff and all that.

3197
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:26,200
That's, that comes in later, but yeah, that's probably true.

3198
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:27,200
Yeah, that's true.

3199
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:28,200
That's fair.

3200
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:32,200
Maybe I should read Lord of Ghosts.

3201
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,200
Maybe.

3202
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:34,200
Did you buy it?

3203
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:35,200
Why not?

3204
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:36,200
What do you have to lose?

3205
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:37,200
I didn't buy it.

3206
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:38,200
Oh.

3207
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:39,200
I could read it.

3208
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,200
I could read it.

3209
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:41,200
I could read it.

3210
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:42,200
Give it the cheesy, the cheesy.

3211
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:43,200
You didn't, you didn't pluge?

3212
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,200
No, I didn't.

3213
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:45,200
You're not a plunger.

3214
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:46,200
Oh my God.

3215
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:47,200
I don't, I don't have it.

3216
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:48,200
This, this non-pluger.

3217
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:51,200
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not the common plunger.

3218
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,200
I'm not a plunger like you guys are.

3219
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,200
I am, I don't have money.

3220
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:56,200
No one pledges to me.

3221
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:58,200
What money am I supposed to give out?

3222
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:01,200
What, I give you $5 a month.

3223
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,200
What are you doing with that if not pluging?

3224
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:05,200
I am printing out the most expensive.

3225
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:07,200
You're spending it all on weed.

3226
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:09,200
You're spending it all on weed.

3227
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,200
Yeah, you got me.

3228
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:12,200
I'm spending it all on fucking weed.

3229
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:14,200
You're, you're, you're blowing it all.

3230
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:19,200
You're blowing it all on printer ink when you could be spending it on the cheaper toner

3231
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:22,200
and spending the, the excess, spending the extra on weed.

3232
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:23,200
You could have it all.

3233
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:24,200
I'm bulging.

3234
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:27,200
You can make a comic about how you spend all your money on weed.

3235
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,200
All right, I'll do that.

3236
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,200
Yes.

3237
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:31,200
There we go.

3238
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:32,200
Lord of the Ghost eventually.

3239
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:33,200
I'll get to it.

3240
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:38,200
I specifically saved as soon as I started reading Lord of the Ghost right before the kickstart

3241
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:39,200
was announced and I was like, there we go.

3242
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:45,200
I've read the very first like seven pages and then like two hours later the kickstart was

3243
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:46,200
announced.

3244
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:47,200
Okay.

3245
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:48,200
Okay.

3246
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:50,200
I'll have it in my hands.

3247
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:51,200
Yeah.

3248
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:52,200
It'll be there soon.

3249
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:57,200
I just need to wait for, uh, needs to do the artist.

3250
02:30:57,200 --> 02:30:58,200
Oh, God, me.

3251
02:30:58,200 --> 02:30:59,200
It's Ben.

3252
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:00,200
Oh, God, me.

3253
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:01,200
It's Niko.

3254
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,200
And, uh,

3255
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,200
Goku.

3256
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:05,200
Kaijukun.

3257
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:11,200
Well, uh, then, then has to finish Phantoms of Revenge first before he does that.

3258
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:16,200
Uh, I probably should take a break from Phantoms of Revenge and do the Lord of Ghost comic.

3259
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:19,200
Uh, so you might be waiting a long time.

3260
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:21,200
No, no, no, no, no.

3261
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,200
The Lord of Ghost comic shouldn't take a million years.

3262
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:26,200
Ben draws pretty quick.

3263
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,200
Well, sometimes.

3264
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,200
You're quicker than me.

3265
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:34,200
I've seen you do like, like live streams and it's like, hey, it's pretty good.

3266
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:35,200
Well, he's quick.

3267
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:37,200
I can draw quick for some time.

3268
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:41,200
The problem is he's a big procrastinator, if you know what I mean.

3269
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:45,200
I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, yeah.

3270
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:50,200
I mean, you've been moving, so I haven't expected you to get it done at this point anyway.

3271
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:55,200
I haven't been getting anything done, um, but, uh, I'm, uh, I'm settled in my new fucking

3272
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:58,200
shitty apartment that I need to get out of.

3273
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,200
So, you know, I guess I'm good.

3274
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,200
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

3275
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,200
I'm reading the Lord of Ghost.

3276
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:06,200
Problem solved.

3277
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:08,200
I'm reading the Lord of Ghost right now.

3278
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:09,200
I'm not gonna lie.

3279
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:10,200
Oh my God.

3280
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:13,200
I'm getting big villain-verse energy from it.

3281
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:16,200
A lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, uh, callbacks.

3282
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:18,200
That's what you're saying about everything.

3283
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:19,200
Guys who have a red villain-verse.

3284
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,200
Hmm.

3285
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:22,200
I'm gonna get a lot of villain-verse energy from this.

3286
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,200
Exactly what I was gonna say.

3287
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:27,200
There's drawings on a page with words around them.

3288
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:28,200
Villain-verse.

3289
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:29,200
No color.

3290
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:32,200
A prologue explaining the Lord before the main story.

3291
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:33,200
Uh, her.

3292
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,200
Very villain-verse, I see.

3293
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:39,200
Very villain-verse, very much so.

3294
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:42,200
I want to move on to the next voicemail, which is called

3295
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:44,200
A Solution to My Problem.

3296
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:47,200
Three, two, one, go.

3297
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:51,200
You say that I drink my juice.

3298
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,200
Price of my love for the price that you're willing to pay.

3299
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:58,200
But I do not piss anymore.

3300
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:01,200
I only fart.

3301
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:08,200
And my farts smell like piss.

3302
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:14,200
And as much as I would like to drink my blood,

3303
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:22,200
I think I need to hold on to what little blood I still have.

3304
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:31,200
But there is someone's blood who I can drink.

3305
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:34,200
Tommy J.

3306
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:35,200
Yeah.

3307
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:40,200
Give me the body of Tommy J.

3308
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:45,200
I will be able to survive this wasteland for a lifetime.

3309
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:47,200
It's all yours.

3310
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:52,200
It's not like the word that's currently controlling him

3311
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:59,200
is doing a good job of using it anyways.

3312
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:03,200
Give me Tommy J.

3313
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:07,200
Take it, take it already.

3314
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:09,200
Get it out of here.

3315
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:14,200
This is a really good Dark Souls NPC.

3316
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:17,200
He's got the slow speaking and the grossness.

3317
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:19,200
Dark Souls NPC would do...

3318
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:21,200
Give me the body of Tommy J.

3319
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:24,200
I love how there's all this lore, deep lore,

3320
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:28,200
that's exclusive to the voicemails that nobody is going to listen to.

3321
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:31,200
Everyone loves the voicemails.

3322
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:33,200
Some people only listen to the voicemails.

3323
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:36,200
I'm getting a lot of Villainverse 5 from this voicemail.

3324
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:38,200
That's true.

3325
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:40,200
I need to.

3326
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:42,200
Tommy...

3327
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:45,200
I couldn't see it with Lord of Ghosts, but with Tommy J...

3328
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:50,200
Tommy J is pretty high up on the villain index.

3329
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:53,200
Yeah, true. He's high on that fucking ranking.

3330
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:57,200
Not gonna lie, Tommy J is an infamous villain.

3331
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:02,200
Something else that has a lot of Villainverse energy

3332
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:06,200
is No More Heroes 1 through 3.

3333
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:08,200
What? You cut out? Fuck.

3334
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:11,200
No More Heroes. That has a lot of Villainverse energy.

3335
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:13,200
Yeah, I bet it does.

3336
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,200
I gotta play that.

3337
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:19,200
I'll probably say that while I'm reading Villainverse.

3338
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,200
Getting a lot of Villainverse vibes.

3339
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:25,200
Villainverse Chapter 2 has a lot of Villainverse Chapter 1 energy.

3340
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:29,200
You think the author of this has read Villainverse?

3341
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:33,200
If it does, I'll add it to my Villainverse playlist on YouTube,

3342
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:38,200
which is just a collection of things that just give me Villainverse energy.

3343
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:40,200
Yeah, which is everything.

3344
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:43,200
Next voicemail is just stuff.

3345
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:50,200
Next voicemail is called Good Internet Aliases 321 Go.

3346
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:53,200
Last week, BaystyleDai left a voicemail asking,

3347
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:56,200
what are your favorite Internet aliases from people in the PCP

3348
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:58,200
or PCP adjacent communities,

3349
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:01,200
and you didn't even give a single one fucking New Pymers.

3350
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:04,200
There's definitely some names that have stuck out to me as exceptional

3351
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:07,200
because they're either, they roll off the tongue, look cool written,

3352
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:09,200
are entirely unique to themselves,

3353
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:12,200
or just sound fucking cool for starters, give and take.

3354
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:14,200
Not to be a kiss-ass, but it's a solid name.

3355
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:17,200
Good pun, fun to say, and Gib is even better.

3356
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:21,200
Three letters, one syllable, yet wholly original, plus satisfying to say.

3357
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:22,200
Yeah, true.

3358
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,200
Pizza-chan, fucking Kino, super marketable,

3359
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:29,200
Rita Torpedo, son's fucking Nido, Mosquito, them snakes, classic.

3360
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,200
Nido Mosquito would be good too.

3361
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:35,200
Kip and Nate, from RFCK, just look excellent written.

3362
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:38,200
Cybershell, if you've ever heard him describe the lore behind it, it's brilliant.

3363
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:39,200
I have.

3364
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:43,200
No need, brah, it's a feel-good name, and it sounds cooler as no need.

3365
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:47,200
And to top them off, Marenpan, rolls off the tongue, ends with an M.

3366
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:49,200
You're just sucking off your friends.

3367
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:52,200
He's just like, oh, my people I know have cool names.

3368
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:54,200
Plus it's cute and adorable.

3369
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:55,200
Nah, these all suck.

3370
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:57,200
Just straight-up mean-a-cycle-arty.

3371
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:58,200
Nah, these are fucking terrible.

3372
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:00,200
Kawa'i.

3373
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:04,200
Join the PCP Minecraft server, it's like a whole fucking Pokemon game.

3374
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:05,200
Except good.

3375
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:06,200
Yeah, do that.

3376
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:07,200
Yeah, do that.

3377
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:09,200
No, those actually were all really good.

3378
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:10,200
Yeah, definitely do that.

3379
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:13,200
Hold all the babies on the PCP Minecraft server.

3380
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:18,200
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators to join the Minecraft server,

3381
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:24,200
and also to get bonus episodes, which I swear to God I will upload soon.

3382
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:26,200
Yeah, I'm still waiting for the Cybershell.

3383
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:29,200
It's not my fucking responsibility, but I guess it is now.

3384
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:30,200
Oh well.

3385
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:33,200
I mean, yeah, I could also do it, but I don't know what I would do.

3386
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:38,200
I've been waiting for the five-hour Cybershell bonus episode.

3387
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:42,200
It's so out of date now, but on the other hand, be complaining about it.

3388
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:44,200
Trixie will never truly be out of date.

3389
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:46,200
It's like wine.

3390
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:53,200
I added her, just for fun, I added her in the announcement that Road to Radcon is up.

3391
02:37:53,200 --> 02:38:00,200
I think there's basically no chance that she didn't see the Road to Radcon is published now.

3392
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:03,200
You mean she didn't block you on Twitter?

3393
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:11,200
She did block me on Twitter, but she would have seen the replies to the posts that were not by me,

3394
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:17,200
and she must surely have been like, what are these things adding me in reference to,

3395
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:20,200
and must surely have logged out and taken a look, so.

3396
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:26,200
She must have seen that Road to Radcon is out now, and I'm sure she will not acknowledge it anyway.

3397
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:28,200
I mean, if she even uses the internet anymore.

3398
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:31,200
She tweets once in a while.

3399
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:32,200
Oh no, she does.

3400
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:39,200
In fact, no, she tweeted something like that day, so no, she saw it.

3401
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:42,200
I wonder what she thinks about it.

3402
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:43,200
Probably nothing.

3403
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:48,200
She's busy working on the anime alphabet videos thing.

3404
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:54,200
She's busy making fucking grade school level raps.

3405
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:56,200
Hey, I'm a Pikachu.

3406
02:38:56,200 --> 02:38:58,200
Hey, I got a Fu Manchu.

3407
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:01,200
Hey, I'm gonna electroshock you.

3408
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:04,200
Oh, that was pretty good.

3409
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:05,200
That one was pretty good.

3410
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:07,200
Hey, it's a metaphor for something.

3411
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:09,200
Hey, it's me, Italian Pikachu.

3412
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:10,200
Get over here.

3413
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:11,200
I'm gonna hit you.

3414
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,200
I'm gonna hit you.

3415
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:13,200
What?

3416
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:15,200
I'm gonna hit you with my electrical shock.

3417
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,200
Come here.

3418
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:18,200
What the fuck are you talking about, boy?

3419
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:19,200
Hey, hey, hey.

3420
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:20,200
I'm walking here.

3421
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:22,200
I don't care about rhyme.

3422
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:23,200
Yeah, Digibro's a good-

3423
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:24,200
It's the Raichu.

3424
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:25,200
It's the fucking Raichu.

3425
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:27,200
He was wearing a wire.

3426
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:33,200
If you wore a wire, he would be grounded.

3427
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:38,200
Yeah, Digibro is a good internet alias.

3428
02:39:38,200 --> 02:39:40,200
It is a good internet alias.

3429
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:41,200
It's pretty good.

3430
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:42,200
Who's Digibro?

3431
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:44,200
Yeah, that's why it's not being used anymore.

3432
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:47,200
Yeah, Dick Masterson's also a good internet alias.

3433
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:49,200
I don't care what anyone says.

3434
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,200
Too many syllables.

3435
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,200
Sure.

3436
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:54,200
Well, it's kind of like Gibbentake.

3437
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:55,200
You can shorten it to Dick.

3438
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:56,200
Yeah, exactly.

3439
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,200
Once you establish who you're talking about, I guess.

3440
02:39:58,200 --> 02:39:59,200
Right.

3441
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:00,200
Yeah, it's pretty decent.

3442
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:03,200
Yeah, Monkey Joe's 10 out of 10 name, too.

3443
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,200
What else?

3444
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,200
I always liked Monkey, to say.

3445
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:09,200
I think a lot of people have heard of Monkey

3446
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:11,200
just because the name is so fun to say.

3447
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,200
Uh-huh.

3448
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:13,200
Yeah.

3449
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,200
Uh-huh.

3450
02:40:14,200 --> 02:40:18,200
My favorite internet alias is Ben Saint.

3451
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:19,200
Disagree.

3452
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:20,200
Disagree.

3453
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:21,200
Mine, too.

3454
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:23,200
Nah, it's just a regular name.

3455
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:27,200
Mine is Simsie Fart because Simsie Art and Simsie Boy were both taken,

3456
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:29,200
so I had to go with Simsie Fart.

3457
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:31,200
I hate this conversation.

3458
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:32,200
It sucks.

3459
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:37,200
I got Cheesy Manfredo because Cheesy Alfredo was already taken.

3460
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:38,200
That's it.

3461
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:39,200
No more.

3462
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:40,200
Next voicemail.

3463
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:41,200
Now it looks voicemail.

3464
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:45,200
It's called I Am Uneducated, but still Google these things.

3465
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:46,200
She, they.

3466
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:47,200
Thank God.

3467
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,200
Three, two, one, go.

3468
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:52,200
So Bitcoin has this cycle where once every four years,

3469
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:54,200
they have the amount of Bitcoin that they give out to miners,

3470
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:56,200
which then causes a boom in value some months later.

3471
02:40:56,200 --> 02:40:59,200
There's also an investment strategy called dollar cost averaging

3472
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:01,200
that smooths out the effects of short-term market fluctuation

3473
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:03,200
so your long-term investments are more reliable.

3474
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:07,200
Now, I know basically nothing beyond a few research expeditions on this stuff,

3475
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:10,200
but it sounds to me like this cycle makes long-term Bitcoin growth

3476
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:13,200
a pretty safe bet, at least until they give out the maximum number of Bitcoin.

3477
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:16,200
So using an investment strategy like that would be a pretty good idea.

3478
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:19,200
Hopefully, if I'm actually wrong and stupid, other voicemailers will correct me

3479
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:21,200
because I very well could be.

3480
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,200
But I think I'm justified in saying that you people keep looking at the random short-term fluctuations

3481
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:27,200
of Bitcoin and acting like they're the end of the world,

3482
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:30,200
but that's just getting distracted by what's effectively white noise

3483
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:33,200
when there are much larger patterns that you can more reliably take advantage of.

3484
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,200
So stop it.

3485
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:39,200
You're half right, but you're being, you know a little bit.

3486
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:45,200
You've understood like a basic fact and assumed that it is relevant to like everything.

3487
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:48,200
This guy just cares about being right.

3488
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:50,200
This girl just cares about being right.

3489
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:55,200
They specified, she they specified this time.

3490
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:58,200
Let's not go back to the crypto case.

3491
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:01,200
They all specify because I always get it wrong.

3492
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:05,200
So now that people do their, now the only way,

3493
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:09,200
the only way I can get it right ever is if people say it in their thing.

3494
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:13,200
So I have it here for my benefit.

3495
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:16,200
Bitcoin did rise a little bit more.

3496
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:19,200
I sold it a little bit ago and then it rose a little bit.

3497
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:22,200
So I lost out on a little bit of money, but whatever.

3498
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:24,200
Everybody loves the crypto cash.

3499
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:29,200
Bitcoin's the same, but Ethereum is blowing up more.

3500
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:32,200
I wish I had held on to my Ethereum.

3501
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:37,200
I mean Bitcoin is also, wait, what is Ethereum doing?

3502
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:39,200
It went the same way as Bitcoin.

3503
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:42,200
And then when Bitcoin was just sort of going normal,

3504
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:47,200
like up and down the same level, Ethereum has now gone up even higher.

3505
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,200
In a big old spike.

3506
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:49,200
Really?

3507
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:50,200
Mmm.

3508
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:52,200
Look at the one month.

3509
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:54,200
Oh yeah, it's up.

3510
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:56,200
It's up.

3511
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:58,200
It's up, baby.

3512
02:42:58,200 --> 02:43:00,200
It looks like it's hovering around 4k.

3513
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:02,200
Well, good for Ethereum.

3514
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:04,200
All right.

3515
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:07,200
This person is wrong.

3516
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:11,200
I was not looking at random short-term fluctuations.

3517
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:14,200
I was looking at the pattern that had held for like a month and a half

3518
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:16,200
where it was like steadily growing.

3519
02:43:16,200 --> 02:43:19,200
I mean, from like 30k to like 50.

3520
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:21,200
That's not like a random short-term fluctuation.

3521
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:23,200
That's like a serious trend.

3522
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:27,200
I mean, I understand that like you might think that in the long term

3523
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:29,200
it goes even higher.

3524
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:33,200
But at the same time, say you're like, oh, I'm going to buy Bitcoin

3525
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:36,200
in the hope that it's going to go to 100k.

3526
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:37,200
Well, sure.

3527
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:39,200
When do you buy?

3528
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:42,200
Do you buy now when it's 50?

3529
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:44,200
If you think it's going to go down to 30,

3530
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:47,200
then you can get like 50% more of a return

3531
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:50,200
if you wait for it to go down to 30 before you buy.

3532
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:51,200
I don't know.

3533
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:52,200
I think this is a...

3534
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:57,200
Well, what I learned is that the exact wrong people to find this information about

3535
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:02,200
are the people on Reddit, the Bitcoin Reddit section.

3536
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:03,200
Yeah.

3537
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:06,200
Because everybody on there is always extremely optimistic.

3538
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:09,200
Yes, they're all true believers.

3539
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:13,200
They're all like, it's going to be 100k in the next week or so.

3540
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:16,200
And then it like dropped to 46k.

3541
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:20,200
Yeah, everybody who like spends time on the subreddit

3542
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,200
is like a fucking muskite.

3543
02:44:22,200 --> 02:44:25,200
Like, oh, it solves the general problem.

3544
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:28,200
Nothing in history has ever solved the general problem before.

3545
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:30,200
It's fucking...

3546
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:32,200
Too many woke generals.

3547
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:36,200
We could have just like, you know, socialism.

3548
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,200
No, thanks.

3549
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:41,200
All we needed to do to solve poverty was just if everyone had invested in Bitcoin

3550
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:43,200
when it was new, then we'd all be rich now.

3551
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:46,200
If you look at the posting history,

3552
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:49,200
every single time Bitcoin goes up just a little bit,

3553
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:53,200
they're like, it's going to hit 100k this month and then it doesn't.

3554
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:56,200
You know, just an endless cycle of that over and over.

3555
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:59,200
Yeah, I've never looked into anything about Bitcoin.

3556
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:03,200
I just look at the number, I just look at the graph on Coinbase

3557
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:07,200
and I'm like, hmm, I'll just assume things.

3558
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:08,200
More like coin cringe.

3559
02:45:08,200 --> 02:45:10,200
It's worked out sometimes.

3560
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:12,200
Well, that's what I was doing originally,

3561
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:15,200
but then I went to the subreddits to see if I could like,

3562
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:19,200
one-up things and then I realized that doesn't work.

3563
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,200
It's better just to look at the numbers, honestly,

3564
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:24,200
because that's what everybody else is doing.

3565
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:28,200
I mean, fucking...

3566
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:33,200
I thought they had secret knowledge, but they don't.

3567
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:37,200
I mean, why would they be giving it out if they had secret knowledge?

3568
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:40,200
They'd just be using it to get as much as possible.

3569
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:42,200
Look, I looked at the pattern.

3570
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:44,200
I looked at like, okay, earlier in the year,

3571
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:48,200
it hit its biggest spike ever and then it kind of bounced down

3572
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:50,200
and then it was going up again and I looked at that

3573
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:52,200
and I was like, there's two possibilities.

3574
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:56,200
One is that the first spike was just like an initial sort of spike

3575
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:58,200
that's just going to be like the tip of the iceberg

3576
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:00,200
of an even bigger spike that's coming.

3577
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:04,200
The second possibility is that that was the spike

3578
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:07,200
and that what we're seeing now is sort of like an echo,

3579
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:09,200
a smaller spike that's coming afterwards.

3580
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:13,200
And I was like, alright, if this is an echo bump,

3581
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:17,200
then it's going to only go so high and it's going to peter out

3582
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:19,200
and I won't lose that much.

3583
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:21,200
And I might lose some.

3584
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:25,200
But if this is like the tip of the iceberg and it's going to the moon,

3585
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:29,200
then if I don't invest something, I will lose so much.

3586
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:31,200
I will lose out like so hard.

3587
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:34,200
So I was like, I feel like the risk of not investing

3588
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:38,200
are higher than the risks of investing and that's why I did it.

3589
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:42,200
And everyone is like, Ben, but you saw it go up,

3590
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:44,200
so you should know that next it goes down.

3591
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:47,200
Like you are, everyone is very, everyone's a critic.

3592
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:49,200
Everyone is a fucking critic.

3593
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:51,200
They think they're operating on a higher level.

3594
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,200
They're not, they're all reddit level, they're all reddit tier.

3595
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,200
When I go to like the tracking websites that have the graphs,

3596
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:02,200
I'll see articles that are like, oh, Bitcoin is bullish,

3597
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:04,200
but short term, it's bearish.

3598
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:07,200
And then I look at the diagrams that supposedly demonstrate this

3599
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:11,200
and it's literally just like they pick two random points on the diagram

3600
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:13,200
and draw a line between them.

3601
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:16,200
And then they'll be like, yeah, this is the trend,

3602
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:18,200
but then they'll pick two different points and be like,

3603
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:21,200
draw a line between them and then be like, or this could be the trend.

3604
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:24,200
And then they'll just be like, yeah, it's one of these.

3605
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:28,200
And it's literally just like pick two points and be like,

3606
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:30,200
is this the trend?

3607
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:32,200
I don't know.

3608
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:35,200
Nobody actually knows what's going to happen.

3609
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:37,200
They just pretend like they do.

3610
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:39,200
Yeah, it's pretty much that.

3611
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:43,200
It's for suckers like me who are just going to just see the numbers

3612
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:46,200
and then we see a thing that's like Bitcoin going to 100 by the end of the year

3613
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:48,200
and it gives me FOMO and I buy more.

3614
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:51,200
That's what it's for.

3615
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:53,200
Let the good times roll.

3616
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:59,200
It's a little more consistent, safer way of gambling your money.

3617
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:03,200
At the end of the day.

3618
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:08,200
Because when you gamble at a casino, there's like no degree of predicting

3619
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:12,200
what's going to happen, but at least with this you can predict a little bit.

3620
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:14,200
So it's safer than gambling.

3621
02:48:14,200 --> 02:48:17,200
I think we have about eight left to go.

3622
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:19,200
So let's let's move on.

3623
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:24,200
We've got the next voicemail is called Ben.

3624
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:25,200
It's your mother.

3625
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:27,200
Why are you apostrophe?

3626
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:28,200
Are you mother?

3627
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:31,200
Three, two, one, go.

3628
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:33,200
Hello, Ben.

3629
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,200
It's your mother.

3630
02:48:34,200 --> 02:48:37,200
I really want you to call me back one of these days.

3631
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:39,200
I'm really worried about you.

3632
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:46,200
I can't have my little Ben say running around all across the country without his

3633
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:48,200
clean underwear.

3634
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:51,200
Or having his breakfast every morning.

3635
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:52,200
Please.

3636
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:54,200
Sounds like Dr. Dolphins.

3637
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:56,200
Don't worry, mom.

3638
02:48:56,200 --> 02:48:57,200
I ate baby bells.

3639
02:48:57,200 --> 02:48:58,200
I ate baby bell for breakfast.

3640
02:48:58,200 --> 02:49:00,200
I found those dirty magazines underneath your bed.

3641
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:01,200
Gross.

3642
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:04,200
I'm not going to throw them out, but we need to talk about what you're reading.

3643
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:05,200
We truly don't.

3644
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,200
Okay, son.

3645
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:07,200
Goodbye.

3646
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:08,200
Oh, geez.

3647
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:10,200
Well, that could have gone right.

3648
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:11,200
They found slime and punishment.

3649
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:14,200
Yes, they found the vapors under your bed like Ben.

3650
02:49:14,200 --> 02:49:15,200
We have to talk about this.

3651
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:19,200
I sounded exactly like the police officer from German's Doha stream.

3652
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:22,200
That's the exact same voice.

3653
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:23,200
I said it.

3654
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:26,200
She sounds like Dr. Goh from Venture Bros.

3655
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:27,200
True.

3656
02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:28,200
True.

3657
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:31,200
Well, all those people are Ben's mom.

3658
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:34,200
Whoa, no way.

3659
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:37,200
Next one is called Hi, Honey.

3660
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:39,200
Three, two, one, go.

3661
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:43,200
What would you do with a death note?

3662
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:48,200
Type in list of all the billionaires in the world.

3663
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:49,200
Just run it down.

3664
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:50,200
Yeah.

3665
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:53,200
And then realize that it doesn't have a typewriter.

3666
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:54,200
I would be...

3667
02:49:54,200 --> 02:49:55,200
You have to write it.

3668
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:56,200
Man, I would be scared to do anything.

3669
02:49:56,200 --> 02:50:00,200
I might honestly not do a single thing with it.

3670
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:04,200
Because I'm too much of a coward to set shit.

3671
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:08,200
It is lame, but you're setting shit in motion.

3672
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:10,200
Who knows what the consequences are.

3673
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:12,200
He's going to be like, what if something bad happens?

3674
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:13,200
You want that on my shoulders?

3675
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:16,200
Bad things are going to happen if you don't do anything.

3676
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:18,200
So it's kind of like...

3677
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:19,200
Yeah.

3678
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:23,200
Wouldn't the US have been able to win the war against the Taliban if they just had the

3679
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,200
death note?

3680
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:27,200
Just write down the name of everybody in the Taliban.

3681
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:30,200
Yeah, I could just death note all the Taliban.

3682
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:33,200
And then I also do it in the entire US military.

3683
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:35,200
So it's even.

3684
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:38,200
I'm not partisan.

3685
02:50:38,200 --> 02:50:44,200
You could just do it to people who are old and a heart attack would not be that out

3686
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:45,200
of the ordinary.

3687
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:47,200
So nobody would suspect anything.

3688
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:48,200
Why?

3689
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:49,200
I mean, it's a heart attack anyway.

3690
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:50,200
Why?

3691
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:51,200
You have to just like...

3692
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:52,200
Well, you know, like get rid of Donald Trump.

3693
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:53,200
Why does he need to be there?

3694
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:54,200
It doesn't have to be a heart attack.

3695
02:50:54,200 --> 02:50:55,200
We don't want him to run again.

3696
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:56,200
It doesn't have to be a heart attack.

3697
02:50:56,200 --> 02:50:57,200
It could come up with weird actions.

3698
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:58,200
True.

3699
02:50:58,200 --> 02:51:02,200
Can you write down in the death note, get COVID, like about someone?

3700
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:03,200
So gets COVID.

3701
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:04,200
Get COVID and die?

3702
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,200
You definitely can.

3703
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:06,200
Yeah.

3704
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:07,200
That 100%.

3705
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:08,200
COVID is already doing that.

3706
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:10,200
It's already killing a lot of the old people.

3707
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:14,200
No, but I would want it to kill specifically grifters, like right wing grifters.

3708
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:15,200
Sure.

3709
02:51:15,200 --> 02:51:16,200
That would be pretty base.

3710
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:21,200
It is basically killing them because they're not getting vaccinated.

3711
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:22,200
I would feel...

3712
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:23,200
I would feel...

3713
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:24,200
Steering proud is still around.

3714
02:51:24,200 --> 02:51:25,200
I don't know if I...

3715
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:26,200
I don't know if I have...

3716
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:31,200
I don't know if I have like the gall to actually like write a person's name in the...

3717
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:32,200
Even if I hate them.

3718
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:34,200
Even if I think they're an objectively bad...

3719
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:38,200
I don't know if I have it in me to be like, I'm going to end this person's life right now.

3720
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:39,200
That's why you're...

3721
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:42,200
Neither do I, but I also can't imagine such a thing existing.

3722
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:45,200
So I'd probably write it thinking it doesn't work.

3723
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:47,200
Ben, look, just give me the death note.

3724
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:48,200
I'll do it.

3725
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:49,200
Honestly.

3726
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,200
I'm good.

3727
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:55,200
I hand it and Cheesy immediately writes my name in it.

3728
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:59,200
Yeah, Ben's saying that doesn't work because that's not your fucking name.

3729
02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:01,200
Nobody knows my real name.

3730
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:02,200
Let's...

3731
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:03,200
No, this is just they do.

3732
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:08,200
I would put Elon Musk dies in a Tesla.

3733
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:10,200
It blows up and kills him.

3734
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:11,200
Yeah.

3735
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:15,200
I would do every director, every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, so it could just end.

3736
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:17,200
It would be like...

3737
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:19,200
That would not end it.

3738
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:22,200
I would kill every member of Disney as a company.

3739
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:24,200
That would maybe do it.

3740
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:26,200
Robert Downey Jr. maybe.

3741
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:30,200
When it comes to people who are just sort of stupid, like Elon Musk, I don't know whether

3742
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:33,200
like him, his death is going to be a good thing necessarily.

3743
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:34,200
They probably will.

3744
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:38,200
If he could change his mind with a change mind note, that would be nice.

3745
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:40,200
Who knowing would be cracking news though?

3746
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:41,200
If you just...

3747
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:42,200
Very interesting news.

3748
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:43,200
If you killed...

3749
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:46,200
Elon Musk blows up Tesla and Jeff Bezos.

3750
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:48,200
Rocket blows up.

3751
02:52:48,200 --> 02:52:50,200
Wait, if you just kill...

3752
02:52:50,200 --> 02:52:52,200
Phil Gates gets COVID.

3753
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:56,200
I think there are a lot of funny little creative ways for each one of them to die.

3754
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:58,200
I could do that.

3755
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:00,200
You could write...

3756
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:02,200
Oh, okay.

3757
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:03,200
I see how it is.

3758
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:08,200
Bensate is totally fine with paying taxes to send drone strikes to kill brown children,

3759
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:12,200
but he can't put one little rich white guy's name to the death note.

3760
02:53:12,200 --> 02:53:13,200
Oh, okay.

3761
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:15,200
I see how it is.

3762
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:22,200
Typical hypocrite Americans are okay with paying taxes to blow up brown children.

3763
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:25,200
So Lara is going to commonly live in the comments for this.

3764
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:27,200
I have morality now.

3765
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:30,200
Now that I have control, you always had control.

3766
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:31,200
Oh, yeah.

3767
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:34,200
That's a pretty neo-lib take of you.

3768
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:35,200
True.

3769
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:36,200
It is a little bit.

3770
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:38,200
I'm like, oh no, it's complicated though.

3771
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:42,200
No, international conflicts are complicated.

3772
02:53:42,200 --> 02:53:45,200
Maybe some of them are good actually.

3773
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:46,200
They're complicated.

3774
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:49,200
There are just some that are less complicated than others.

3775
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:50,200
I don't think...

3776
02:53:50,200 --> 02:53:52,200
Yeah, I said it.

3777
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:53,200
I said it.

3778
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:54,200
I kill Nate.

3779
02:53:54,200 --> 02:54:01,200
No, the possibility of like, say, like a second Trump term.

3780
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:04,200
I'd rather just avoid that altogether.

3781
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:05,200
Okay, let's be honest.

3782
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:08,200
Mark Zuckerberg dying would be way better for the world.

3783
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:10,200
Let's fucking not beat around the bush, please.

3784
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:11,200
You gotta admit that.

3785
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:15,200
But the thing with that, the thing with that, I guess the thing with anything is that if

3786
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:19,200
you get rid of one figurehead, there's probably going to be another one.

3787
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:20,200
And then you get rid of that one.

3788
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:21,200
You have a death note.

3789
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:22,200
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

3790
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:25,200
If Trump doesn't run in 2024, they're going to just run someone else.

3791
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:28,200
And it could be someone even worse, honestly.

3792
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:29,200
Oh, darn.

3793
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:30,200
I suppose.

3794
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:32,200
It's just sort of like...

3795
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:34,200
And there's only one page in the death note.

3796
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,200
No more.

3797
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:37,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3798
02:54:37,200 --> 02:54:39,200
You know, you know, yeah.

3799
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:40,200
Bam, bam, bam.

3800
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:41,200
What you got to do in...

3801
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:42,200
You got to like...

3802
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:44,200
You could probably set it up to make it think like...

3803
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:47,200
You could probably convince conservatives it's like a curse or something.

3804
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:49,200
And they'll probably fall for it.

3805
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:50,200
I got a good one.

3806
02:54:50,200 --> 02:54:51,200
Okay, so Trump...

3807
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:55,200
You write Trump dies, but before he dies, he writes down like QAnon.

3808
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:56,200
Like you must protect QAnon.

3809
02:54:56,200 --> 02:55:01,200
And they'll throw people a lot of like, oh no, they're attacking QAnon members.

3810
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:06,200
I killed a guy at Tesco who always IDs me when I'm buying energy drinks, even though I'm fat,

3811
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:08,200
bold, six foot three and 22.

3812
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:10,200
You have to show ID to buy energy drinks.

3813
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:15,200
Yeah, you have to prove that you're over 16 to buy energy drinks.

3814
02:55:15,200 --> 02:55:16,200
That's fucking lame.

3815
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:18,200
Bloody nanny state.

3816
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:19,200
Tell you what.

3817
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:20,200
That's true.

3818
02:55:20,200 --> 02:55:23,200
Does the Death Note ever run out of pages?

3819
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:24,200
No.

3820
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:28,200
It technically could, but like, you just write small.

3821
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:30,200
Um, fuck it.

3822
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:31,200
Aaron Hansen.

3823
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,200
Look, unironically.

3824
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:33,200
Yes.

3825
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:35,200
I would put Alex Jones in it.

3826
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:36,200
I don't care.

3827
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:37,200
I'll do it.

3828
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:38,200
No, he's too funny.

3829
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:39,200
Yeah, he's real funny.

3830
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:41,200
Like I give a fuck.

3831
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:42,200
Like I give a fuck.

3832
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:43,200
That's fair.

3833
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:44,200
Okay.

3834
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:45,200
Motherfucker be the funniest motherfucker in the world.

3835
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:46,200
I don't care.

3836
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:48,200
I think it's funny too.

3837
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:50,200
I think, I think he's hilarious.

3838
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:53,200
Like I don't think like, I don't think, um, just cause I was funny,

3839
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:55,200
it doesn't mean they have the right to live.

3840
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:56,200
That's a cheesy quote.

3841
02:55:56,200 --> 02:55:59,200
Just cause they're funny doesn't mean they have the right to live.

3842
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:01,200
Yeah, that's a cheesy moment.

3843
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:03,200
That's a cheesy moment.

3844
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:04,200
Cheesy.

3845
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:06,200
That's a real cheesy pill.

3846
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:08,200
That's an absolute cheesy moment, brother.

3847
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:10,200
Absolute cheesy moment.

3848
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:12,200
Just cause they funny, they don't deserve to live.

3849
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:14,200
What a right name of Death Note.

3850
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:19,200
Yeah, for me, it would be like, can you measure the deaths that they cause

3851
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:21,200
by being alive and doing whatever they're doing?

3852
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:22,200
No.

3853
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:25,200
Um, and I have to just be, just people have been positioned to-

3854
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:26,200
I mean, you can to some extent, right?

3855
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:27,200
Just people in position and power.

3856
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:28,200
I don't know.

3857
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:30,200
Maybe for some people.

3858
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:33,200
If people don't catch on that, if people don't catch on that you have the Death Note,

3859
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:36,200
people would just label it, oh no, the billionaire curse.

3860
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:38,200
If you reach this amount of money, you just instantly die

3861
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:40,200
and then people would just kind of accept it.

3862
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,200
I would reserve it.

3863
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:45,200
I would reserve it for the sort of person who has so much money and power

3864
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:51,200
that you couldn't even assassinate them if you had like a nation's like military.

3865
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:53,200
Yeah, James Corden, that's who I'd kill.

3866
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:55,200
Yeah, I would definitely put James Corden.

3867
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:57,200
Get that fucking guy, car crash.

3868
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:01,200
What you do is that I don't even know who that is.

3869
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:04,200
It's a very annoying British guy in America.

3870
02:57:04,200 --> 02:57:06,200
You could probably kill off a lot of very powerful people,

3871
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:08,200
but then also kill a couple of celebrities

3872
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:11,200
so no one talks about the like powerful people they just talk about.

3873
02:57:11,200 --> 02:57:13,200
Oh my God, they forgot.

3874
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:15,200
He's a British actor.

3875
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:20,200
Right in the Death Note, every single one of like the powerful evil guys in the world

3876
02:57:20,200 --> 02:57:23,200
slip on a banal appeal, hit their head, die instantly.

3877
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:25,200
That's the way they die every time.

3878
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,200
People just get really scared of banals.

3879
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:29,200
It's ironic.

3880
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:34,200
The Death Note is basically just the CIA that existed already.

3881
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:38,200
Oh, what you do is that like, I don't know, maybe like,

3882
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:42,200
you make one of them admit they're a pedophile before they die.

3883
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:43,200
That would be pretty funny.

3884
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:46,200
Or Epstein was right and then one of them dies.

3885
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:48,200
Or like Epstein, like...

3886
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:53,200
If you write something that like can't happen,

3887
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,200
then it just does a heart attack, right?

3888
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:57,200
It just defaults to like the normal.

3889
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:58,200
Yeah.

3890
02:57:58,200 --> 02:57:59,200
Yeah, okay.

3891
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:02,200
Well, since no billionaires are pedophiles,

3892
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:05,200
that could never happen, so it's impossible.

3893
02:58:05,200 --> 02:58:07,200
Okay, this is gonna fuck people over.

3894
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:12,200
I will kill one of the main cast of The Simpsons just so the show ends.

3895
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:14,200
I'll pick one at random.

3896
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:15,200
I won't say which one.

3897
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:16,200
I'll just like flip.

3898
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:18,200
I'll like Power Generator with all their names and be like,

3899
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:20,200
okay, whichever one pops up is gonna instantly die.

3900
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:22,200
I don't care if I have an emotional attack.

3901
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:26,200
Oh, but they never did nothing to nobody.

3902
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:27,200
I'm sorry.

3903
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:31,200
Isn't Bart's voice actress a Scientologist?

3904
02:58:32,200 --> 02:58:34,200
Okay, well, yeah, I guess I'll pick her.

3905
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:35,200
Yeah, she is.

3906
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:37,200
Yeah, she is, yeah.

3907
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:38,200
Okay, that makes it easy.

3908
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:39,200
Okay.

3909
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:40,200
It makes me feel a little better.

3910
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:43,200
I'll probably just like just kill off the guy ahead of sight.

3911
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:46,200
Just like, you have to like kill off certain people that like

3912
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:48,200
the whole system kind of breaks down,

3913
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:51,200
but it probably won't happen like that overnight,

3914
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:53,200
but I'm like, there's enough pages.

3915
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:57,200
Like, I mean, in Death Note, like Light is killing so many people,

3916
02:58:57,200 --> 02:58:59,200
he must have at least run out of pages by the end,

3917
02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:01,200
but he seems to not, you know,

3918
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:02,200
because it's kind of like low-key magical.

3919
02:59:02,200 --> 02:59:04,200
No, I feel like they must have addressed that at some point.

3920
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:06,200
Like, surely you run out of pages.

3921
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:07,200
Nah, it's just magic.

3922
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:12,200
He, I think he just, I think he literally just writes really small.

3923
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:13,200
Like, I think that's it.

3924
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:15,200
I just think he just can't run out of pages.

3925
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:17,200
The thing is, he does it for like 10 years, though.

3926
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:23,200
He writes in like random criminals who just like do bad, like petty crimes.

3927
02:59:23,200 --> 02:59:24,200
He doesn't, he doesn't kill...

3928
02:59:24,200 --> 02:59:25,200
Which is his first mistake.

3929
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:26,200
He doesn't kill that many people.

3930
02:59:26,200 --> 02:59:28,200
Yeah, I don't think they ever addressed it on the show.

3931
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:33,200
He might kill like, he might kill like, maybe in the tens of thousands.

3932
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:35,200
I mean, what about when he gets a potato chip and eats it?

3933
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:36,200
Like, he kills a lot of people.

3934
02:59:36,200 --> 02:59:38,200
Yeah, but like, there's so many people.

3935
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:43,200
Like, heads of like police unions, um, proud boy members.

3936
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:46,200
There's like so many people out there that you potentially could off,

3937
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:47,200
and then things would be a lot better.

3938
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:49,200
Or you could just convince people.

3939
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:51,200
Like, I feel like Superstition is going to convince a lot of people that,

3940
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:54,200
oh man, something creepy is fucking going on.

3941
02:59:54,200 --> 02:59:56,200
Well, that's the thing.

3942
02:59:56,200 --> 02:59:59,200
You might want to keep Alex Jones alive for the longest,

3943
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:03,200
just so you perpetrate this idea of the conspiracy and that froze people sent off.

3944
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:05,200
If people really thought, if people really thought that like,

3945
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:09,200
if I get like over a certain amount of wealth, I will die,

3946
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:14,200
I feel like that would, like genuinely, that would genuinely improve the world.

3947
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:15,200
Okay.

3948
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:18,200
Like, if like anyone who has over a billion dollars instantly dies,

3949
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:20,200
and suddenly everyone is like, like, I got to get rid of this money.

3950
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:23,200
I would, I would probably like look for a list of all the...

3951
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:25,200
Oh, they just lie about their net worth.

3952
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:27,200
Congress members like over...

3953
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:29,200
Yeah, they do.

3954
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:33,200
I would just look up all the Congress members over like 80 or around 60,

3955
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:34,200
and just anyone older than 60.

3956
03:00:34,200 --> 03:00:37,200
Oh, well, boom, boom, boom, just to clean the slate.

3957
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:38,200
But then you...

3958
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:40,200
Or get rid of all the like...

3959
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:42,200
Get rid of all the like...

3960
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:43,200
Yeah, sure.

3961
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:46,200
But then get rid of all the like conservative judges.

3962
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:48,200
Just one clean swoop.

3963
03:00:48,200 --> 03:00:50,200
So it just resets.

3964
03:00:50,200 --> 03:00:54,200
See, the thing, the thing I would not do is I would not do it

3965
03:00:54,200 --> 03:00:57,200
to a point where people can start seeing a pattern.

3966
03:00:57,200 --> 03:00:59,200
I would only do it for a few people, and then I would stop.

3967
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:00,200
Here's the...

3968
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:01,200
Because that's the thing that gets you caught.

3969
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:05,200
No, you bro, you won't get caught because people see patterns when they're not there.

3970
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:07,200
So anything that people like convince are a pattern,

3971
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:10,200
they are going to be thrown off as conspiracy theories.

3972
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:11,200
It's probably a lot more easier.

3973
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:12,200
But that won't...

3974
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:14,200
Just doing a few people won't accomplish anything.

3975
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:16,200
I think that's why you got to kill a lot of people.

3976
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:17,200
People accomplish enough.

3977
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:20,200
Cheesy certainly has put a lot of thought into this.

3978
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:22,200
I do, I think about this a lot actually.

3979
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:23,200
Cheesy has a lot he would do.

3980
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:25,200
Every Steam user in the world.

3981
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:29,200
See, the reason why Leg gets caught, because he didn't fucking realize

3982
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:32,200
there was a super genius, a Sherlock home motherfucker

3983
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:34,200
that also lived in his universe, right?

3984
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:37,200
There isn't an ours, as far as we're concerned.

3985
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:42,200
Unless Hillary uses her heart attack gun on me,

3986
03:01:42,200 --> 03:01:44,200
but I'll just snipe Hillary.

3987
03:01:44,200 --> 03:01:46,200
Fuck, I'll probably do that.

3988
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:49,200
You have to have a good balance of liberals and conservatives.

3989
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:52,200
Hillary would be pretty high on the list.

3990
03:01:52,200 --> 03:01:57,200
Yeah, if you off Hillary, people would be so distracted

3991
03:01:57,200 --> 03:02:00,200
while you off a bunch of other conservatives.

3992
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:03,200
You know, things would be way better if Mitch McConnell was gone.

3993
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:05,200
You'd know that for a fact.

3994
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:07,200
Yeah, sure.

3995
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:09,200
Someone else would just do his job.

3996
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:11,200
Then you off that motherfucker.

3997
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:13,200
I don't run out of ammo ever.

3998
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:17,200
I have an infinite heart attack gun on my side, just like Hillary.

3999
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:19,200
Come on.

4000
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:23,200
If we killed, whatever, yeah.

4001
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:27,200
The CIA actually tried making a heart attack gun a while ago.

4002
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:30,200
I think those were in documents that were declassified.

4003
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:32,200
How hard could it be?

4004
03:02:32,200 --> 03:02:34,200
But the thing is, they failed.

4005
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:36,200
They couldn't actually do it.

4006
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:39,200
Guys, what if you death-noted Mario?

4007
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:42,200
That would be so fucking wacky.

4008
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:45,200
Everybody playing Mario at the time would lose a lot.

4009
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:47,200
No, not Shigeru Miyamoto. Just Mario.

4010
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:50,200
Every time you put up the game, Mario dies and people get really upset.

4011
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:53,200
Everyone who's playing it at the exact moment you do it just loses one life.

4012
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:55,200
Maybe you could off.

4013
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:57,200
He just comes back.

4014
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:59,200
Nobody notices anything wrong.

4015
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:01,200
What killed me? And then life moves on.

4016
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:04,200
But you have to write his full name of Mario Mario.

4017
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:06,200
I'll probably death-not that.

4018
03:03:06,200 --> 03:03:08,200
Or his nephew, Luigi Mario.

4019
03:03:08,200 --> 03:03:12,200
I'll probably death-not all the Japanese legislators

4020
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:16,200
are stopping, like, smoking weed in Japan.

4021
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:20,200
Next voicemail?

4022
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:21,200
Sure.

4023
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:22,200
Next fucking voicemail.

4024
03:03:22,200 --> 03:03:24,200
Before the FBI knocks at my door.

4025
03:03:24,200 --> 03:03:26,200
Yeah, before we get on a list.

4026
03:03:26,200 --> 03:03:30,200
I feel like that three-second voicemail got a lot of mileage there.

4027
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:32,200
I'm eating more baby bell, by the way.

4028
03:03:32,200 --> 03:03:34,200
Of course. Cheesy bastard.

4029
03:03:34,200 --> 03:03:38,200
I'm even cheesier than a certain clown.

4030
03:03:38,200 --> 03:03:40,200
Taking the real cheese pill right now.

4031
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:42,200
Oh, yeah.

4032
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:47,200
Next one is called The Final Solution.

4033
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:49,200
Three, two, one, go.

4034
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:51,200
She exists as an artist today.

4035
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:53,200
You have to perform two games.

4036
03:03:53,200 --> 03:03:55,200
You've got the morals and you've got the aesthetics.

4037
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:59,200
Morally, Sarah says she beats Andrew Hersey out of the park.

4038
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:04,200
She is an ultra-inclusive, ultra-SJW,

4039
03:04:04,200 --> 03:04:08,200
pronouns on bio, X-tumbler, kid who-

4040
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:10,200
Oh, I'm so impressed.

4041
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:12,200
With Striga Walens and everything,

4042
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:15,200
she should make sure she's not to hurt anyone.

4043
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:18,200
While Andrew Hersey is like a lazy,

4044
03:04:18,200 --> 03:04:22,200
list-bag who explores his workers and

4045
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:24,200
it's kind of a piece of shit.

4046
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:28,200
But aesthetically, he made Homestuck.

4047
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:30,200
That is a work of art that you guys value a lot.

4048
03:04:30,200 --> 03:04:33,200
While she makes, like, a fucking gospel video

4049
03:04:33,200 --> 03:04:37,200
that people are forgetting in three days.

4050
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:41,200
So, I think that's where the conflict comes.

4051
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:42,200
I mean, I-

4052
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:44,200
And also, Ben hates women.

4053
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:46,200
That's why he prefer Andrew Hersey.

4054
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:47,200
Well, that's true.

4055
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:49,200
I mean, it's strange to put it in a moral,

4056
03:04:49,200 --> 03:04:53,200
like, Sarah Zed doesn't do what Andrew Hersey does,

4057
03:04:53,200 --> 03:04:55,200
but her Tumblr stuff doesn't make her a better person.

4058
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:58,200
Just because Sarah Zed does all the things-

4059
03:04:58,200 --> 03:05:00,200
Like, it's not-

4060
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:03,200
Like, I guess it's good to do trigger warnings.

4061
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:04,200
It's good to do-

4062
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:05,200
Oh, yes.

4063
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:06,200
It's pronouns and bio.

4064
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:07,200
Like, sure, I agree with all that,

4065
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:09,200
but, like, that doesn't make her, like, a great person

4066
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:11,200
just because she does all those things.

4067
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:14,200
Um, it doesn't make her, like-

4068
03:05:14,200 --> 03:05:15,200
Hussie-

4069
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:16,200
You might think-

4070
03:05:16,200 --> 03:05:17,200
I don't know.

4071
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:18,200
Whatever.

4072
03:05:18,200 --> 03:05:19,200
I don't care.

4073
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:21,200
I don't care if Sarah Zed is a better person than Hussie.

4074
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:22,200
Maybe she is.

4075
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:23,200
It's-

4076
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:25,200
I mean, from my perspective,

4077
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:27,200
they're content creators.

4078
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:28,200
And that's it.

4079
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:29,200
Like, I don't know her.

4080
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:30,200
Yeah.

4081
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:31,200
Or him.

4082
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:33,200
So, it's like, I'm just judging the content.

4083
03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:35,200
I like Andrew Hussie's comics.

4084
03:05:35,200 --> 03:05:36,200
Yeah, true.

4085
03:05:36,200 --> 03:05:39,200
Yeah, Sarah Zed didn't make Psycholonial,

4086
03:05:39,200 --> 03:05:42,200
so, you know, I respect it a little bit less.

4087
03:05:42,200 --> 03:05:43,200
Psycholonial is great.

4088
03:05:43,200 --> 03:05:45,200
And she didn't even mention Psycholonial

4089
03:05:45,200 --> 03:05:47,200
in her fucking Homestuck video.

4090
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:49,200
What the fuck is up with that?

4091
03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:50,200
Kind of cringe.

4092
03:05:50,200 --> 03:05:51,200
Kind of cringe.

4093
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:52,200
Was it out at the time?

4094
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:54,200
Yeah, it was.

4095
03:05:54,200 --> 03:05:56,200
She didn't even mention it.

4096
03:05:56,200 --> 03:05:58,200
I don't understand.

4097
03:05:58,200 --> 03:06:00,200
I don't understand.

4098
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:03,200
Next voicemail is called-

4099
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:05,200
What is it called?

4100
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:07,200
Uh, it's called-

4101
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:09,200
There is only a name section.

4102
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:12,200
If I put a name, it's not the title.

4103
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:13,200
Uh, okay.

4104
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:16,200
Three, two, one, go.

4105
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:18,200
All right, it's Friday.

4106
03:06:18,200 --> 03:06:19,200
Podcast comes out, right?

4107
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:20,200
Mm-hmm.

4108
03:06:20,200 --> 03:06:21,200
Now it's Monday.

4109
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:22,200
Mm-hmm.

4110
03:06:22,200 --> 03:06:23,200
I listen to the podcast.

4111
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:24,200
I'm at work.

4112
03:06:24,200 --> 03:06:25,200
I'm killing time.

4113
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:26,200
Now I get home from work.

4114
03:06:26,200 --> 03:06:27,200
I leave a voicemail.

4115
03:06:27,200 --> 03:06:28,200
I say-

4116
03:06:28,200 --> 03:06:29,200
Big mistake.

4117
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:30,200
Or whatever happened.

4118
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:32,200
I reply to you.

4119
03:06:32,200 --> 03:06:35,200
A few days later, new podcast comes out.

4120
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:37,200
I'm not on it because it was already recorded.

4121
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:40,200
Seven days later, the next podcast comes out.

4122
03:06:40,200 --> 03:06:41,200
It's fucked up.

4123
03:06:41,200 --> 03:06:42,200
My voicemail's in it, and I say,

4124
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:44,200
Hey guys, last week this.

4125
03:06:44,200 --> 03:06:48,200
And you go, last week, that was two, three,

4126
03:06:48,200 --> 03:06:50,200
four, five weeks ago.

4127
03:06:50,200 --> 03:06:51,200
Ben, what the fuck?

4128
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,200
Do you not understand your own schedule?

4129
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:54,200
No.

4130
03:06:54,200 --> 03:06:55,200
You're gay.

4131
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:56,200
Yeah.

4132
03:06:56,200 --> 03:06:58,200
The last part is true.

4133
03:06:58,200 --> 03:06:59,200
The last part is true.

4134
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:00,200
Very true.

4135
03:07:00,200 --> 03:07:04,200
Yeah, I understand why it's a bit weird,

4136
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:07,200
but I don't want to think about it anymore than you do.

4137
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:08,200
Just try to avoid saying last week.

4138
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:10,200
I don't want to think about it anymore than you do.

4139
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:18,200
So I know we're operating across a week and almost a week long temporal gap here.

4140
03:07:18,200 --> 03:07:20,200
I'm just going to pretend that it doesn't exist,

4141
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:23,200
because it's fine for me,

4142
03:07:23,200 --> 03:07:24,200
and it doesn't cause me a problem,

4143
03:07:24,200 --> 03:07:25,200
and it's your problem.

4144
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:31,200
You need to alter your life to better benefit this guy.

4145
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:38,200
I could change my life to better suit your mood.

4146
03:07:38,200 --> 03:07:39,200
Okay.

4147
03:07:39,200 --> 03:07:40,200
Better work for the collective.

4148
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:41,200
Nice.

4149
03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:42,200
Carlos Santana.

4150
03:07:42,200 --> 03:07:49,200
Okay, next one is called Untitled by Edward Edwards.

4151
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:51,200
Three, two, one, go.

4152
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:52,200
All right.

4153
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:56,200
First off, whatever you said in reply to me, Ben, you're wrong.

4154
03:07:56,200 --> 03:07:57,200
Yeah.

4155
03:07:57,200 --> 03:08:02,200
And I just like to say L plus ratio, plus you fell off, plus you're white.

4156
03:08:02,200 --> 03:08:04,200
Anyway, Gib, you're cool.

4157
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:07,200
And Tom, you're not dead.

4158
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:08,200
What do you mean I fell off?

4159
03:08:08,200 --> 03:08:09,200
What does that mean?

4160
03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:13,200
Like I'm not making the hips like I used to be?

4161
03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:16,200
I think I'm not cranking out the bangers anymore.

4162
03:08:16,200 --> 03:08:21,200
I feel like to have fallen off the big money,

4163
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:25,200
and now you're doing little baby jobs for babies.

4164
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:28,200
I think that's what that means.

4165
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:29,200
I always did little baby jobs.

4166
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:30,200
It's like a disparaging thing for like,

4167
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:35,200
ah, you used to be big, and now you're just frying burgers

4168
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:37,200
and taking shit.

4169
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:38,200
It's very specific.

4170
03:08:38,200 --> 03:08:41,200
It's a simple burger flipper, Ben's saying, how's it come?

4171
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:44,200
Yeah, you used to be big with your Christian lecture,

4172
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:48,200
but now my second one is...

4173
03:08:48,200 --> 03:08:50,200
Ben, he used to be big when you were friends with...

4174
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:52,200
Ben, he used to be big when you were friends with Digi, bro.

4175
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:55,200
Now you're enemies with Trixesis.

4176
03:08:55,200 --> 03:09:00,200
Yeah, I've definitely, that's a big downgrade for sure.

4177
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:02,200
For sure, yep.

4178
03:09:03,200 --> 03:09:08,200
Next voicemail is called a message for Gib and take

4179
03:09:08,200 --> 03:09:11,200
from BerserkChip at gmail.com.

4180
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:14,200
One, two, three, two, one, go.

4181
03:09:14,200 --> 03:09:19,200
So Gib, I just wanted to let you know that you're my favorite

4182
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:23,200
PCP member, you're super cool and smart and really funny

4183
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:28,200
and based and not cringe like it's whatever, dude.

4184
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:32,200
And something that you said in an episode years ago

4185
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:35,200
was actually what made me become a PCP fan,

4186
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:37,200
because it made me laugh so much.

4187
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:41,200
Somebody in one of the episodes was relating on

4188
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:46,200
what sumo wrestlers eat to maintain their big weight

4189
03:09:46,200 --> 03:09:50,200
and you interrupted them and just said, chicken nuggets

4190
03:09:50,200 --> 03:09:52,200
and it was the funniest fucking thing I've ever done.

4191
03:09:52,200 --> 03:09:53,200
I don't even remember that.

4192
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:56,200
So I just wanted to let you know that you're cool as fuck

4193
03:09:56,200 --> 03:09:58,200
and that you should know about yourself because you're awesome.

4194
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:59,200
Chicken nuggets.

4195
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:01,200
Come on, you're awesome, dude.

4196
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:03,200
It's true.

4197
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:04,200
Yeah, I agree.

4198
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:06,200
I really fell off after that chicken nugget.

4199
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:09,200
You fell off and you're white.

4200
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:11,200
That was the peak of her career.

4201
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:13,200
And ratio and the other one.

4202
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,200
And L.

4203
03:10:14,200 --> 03:10:17,200
And you're British, huge L.

4204
03:10:17,200 --> 03:10:22,200
Oh yeah, it's a bonus stat, negative modifier.

4205
03:10:22,200 --> 03:10:27,200
British is a minority, you're being slurry at me.

4206
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:29,200
I'm gonna fling and slurry at me.

4207
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:33,200
I'm gonna put you in a blender and turn you into a slurry.

4208
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:34,200
No, don't do that.

4209
03:10:34,200 --> 03:10:36,200
Oh, please don't do that.

4210
03:10:36,200 --> 03:10:39,200
Oh yeah, we're doing this.

4211
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:43,200
Next voice.

4212
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:45,200
Now I'm going to be chicken nuggets.

4213
03:10:45,200 --> 03:10:47,200
Chicken nuggets.

4214
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:50,200
Next voicemail is called on Jesse.

4215
03:10:50,200 --> 03:10:53,200
Three, two, one, go.

4216
03:10:53,200 --> 03:10:57,200
So are you feeling like really like planned to be the beginning

4217
03:10:57,200 --> 03:11:01,200
some like pro wrestling storyline or did Jesse have like a vague idea

4218
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:04,200
that he just improv tentatively came up with it later?

4219
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:06,200
It wasn't supposed to be the beginning.

4220
03:11:06,200 --> 03:11:11,200
It was, he started it after Horseshoe Finale.

4221
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:17,200
He did sort of start like another storyline that he abandoned.

4222
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:20,200
Horseshoe Finale wasn't meant to be the beginning.

4223
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:22,200
It was meant to be the end of the storyline.

4224
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:23,200
Right?

4225
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:29,200
I think, wait, well, is he asking whether Horseshoe Finale was planned

4226
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:33,200
to be like the whole Horseshoe saga was planned to be a wrestling thing?

4227
03:11:33,200 --> 03:11:37,200
I think Jesse just likes wrestling and he wanted to cut a promo

4228
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:39,200
because he likes doing that.

4229
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:42,200
Yeah.

4230
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:45,200
He definitely planned at some point.

4231
03:11:45,200 --> 03:11:46,200
I don't know.

4232
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:49,200
Like it's hard to remember because it's a while ago.

4233
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:54,200
But I get the sense that the first few things were just like

4234
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:57,200
or at least the cantaloupe wedding was just like

4235
03:11:58,200 --> 03:12:00,200
fucking Brony's doing reviews.

4236
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:01,200
It can do that.

4237
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:03,200
Or maybe he just thought it was funny.

4238
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:04,200
Wait, cantaloupe wedding.

4239
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:06,200
Maybe he didn't even know about...

4240
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:10,200
The one where he, where Colt Corona debuts, he comes out of the little My Little Pony tent.

4241
03:12:10,200 --> 03:12:11,200
I remember that.

4242
03:12:11,200 --> 03:12:15,200
And he talks about the cantaloupe wedding.

4243
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:21,200
And I don't know whether he was like riffing on Pony reviewers yet.

4244
03:12:21,200 --> 03:12:26,200
But at some point he thought, wouldn't it be funny if I did a whole Pony reviewer thing?

4245
03:12:26,200 --> 03:12:29,200
And then it turned into a bigger project as it went.

4246
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:30,200
Yeah.

4247
03:12:30,200 --> 03:12:34,200
I mean, if the question is like, was it planned from the beginning?

4248
03:12:34,200 --> 03:12:35,200
No.

4249
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:40,200
The Horseshoe Saga definitely like evolved as it went on.

4250
03:12:42,200 --> 03:12:43,200
Yeah.

4251
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:45,200
I think that answers the question, right?

4252
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:47,200
Yeah.

4253
03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:48,200
Okay.

4254
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:49,200
Oh, okay.

4255
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:50,200
True.

4256
03:12:50,200 --> 03:12:54,200
Next one is an image post.

4257
03:12:54,200 --> 03:12:56,200
So I'll just post it here.

4258
03:12:56,200 --> 03:12:59,200
It's called Ben Gibb and the Pig.

4259
03:13:00,200 --> 03:13:01,200
Oh no.

4260
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:02,200
Oh my God.

4261
03:13:02,200 --> 03:13:03,200
Come here, you.

4262
03:13:03,200 --> 03:13:05,200
Oh, wait a second.

4263
03:13:05,200 --> 03:13:06,200
Wait a second.

4264
03:13:06,200 --> 03:13:08,200
Come here, you.

4265
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:14,200
He's apologizing for scaring you and you're so welcoming.

4266
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:16,200
Why could I stay mad?

4267
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:19,200
Why did they drop Ben with a receding hairline?

4268
03:13:20,200 --> 03:13:22,200
What do you mean?

4269
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:23,200
Why?

4270
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:24,200
That's what I look like.

4271
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:25,200
Fuck you.

4272
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:26,200
Oh, you look like that?

4273
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:27,200
Oh, okay.

4274
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:28,200
Wow.

4275
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:29,200
Do you not know it?

4276
03:13:29,200 --> 03:13:30,200
That's the real Ben St.

4277
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:31,200
I'm a.

4278
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:32,200
Okay.

4279
03:13:32,200 --> 03:13:33,200
Fuck you.

4280
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:36,200
I'm looking at that and I'm like, that's just a normal looking guy.

4281
03:13:36,200 --> 03:13:37,200
Yeah.

4282
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:38,200
Yeah.

4283
03:13:38,200 --> 03:13:39,200
Yeah.

4284
03:13:39,200 --> 03:13:40,200
Look how bald that guy is.

4285
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:41,200
Fuck you.

4286
03:13:41,200 --> 03:13:43,200
You're the one with the problem.

4287
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:44,200
No, okay.

4288
03:13:44,200 --> 03:13:46,200
That looks like a full head of head.

4289
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:48,200
Clearly, clearly I pushed the button here.

4290
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:49,200
I am sorry.

4291
03:13:49,200 --> 03:13:52,200
This drawing has a receding hairline.

4292
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:53,200
You don't.

4293
03:13:53,200 --> 03:13:54,200
It doesn't.

4294
03:13:54,200 --> 03:13:56,200
It looks just like a guy.

4295
03:13:56,200 --> 03:13:57,200
Fuck.

4296
03:13:57,200 --> 03:13:58,200
Okay.

4297
03:13:58,200 --> 03:13:59,200
I'll fucking end you.

4298
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:00,200
I'll fucking end you.

4299
03:14:00,200 --> 03:14:01,200
Look, it's fine.

4300
03:14:01,200 --> 03:14:02,200
All right.

4301
03:14:02,200 --> 03:14:05,200
I'll fucking go to California.

4302
03:14:05,200 --> 03:14:06,200
No, you won't.

4303
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:07,200
And kill you.

4304
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:08,200
Okay.

4305
03:14:08,200 --> 03:14:09,200
You won't.

4306
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:10,200
You won't.

4307
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:12,200
I'm not doing that because I'm afraid of flying.

4308
03:14:12,200 --> 03:14:13,200
So I'm not going to do that.

4309
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:19,200
This is like that time that Maddux cropped the camera to take away his balding head from

4310
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,200
the video.

4311
03:14:20,200 --> 03:14:23,200
Did he do that?

4312
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:31,200
Well, somebody accused him of doing that, but he declined or refused the claim.

4313
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:37,200
Gib has a Lord English fucking rainbow energy.

4314
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:38,200
Yeah.

4315
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:39,200
I was going to say.

4316
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:45,200
It's like cyan, magenta, yellow, and the big spiky teeth.

4317
03:14:45,200 --> 03:14:46,200
You're so huge.

4318
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:48,200
I don't know what I'm doing with my hands.

4319
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:51,200
I'm some sort of monster out there.

4320
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:52,200
You're like floating in.

4321
03:14:52,200 --> 03:14:54,200
You're like a Lisa mutant.

4322
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:55,200
Yeah.

4323
03:14:55,200 --> 03:14:56,200
Yeah.

4324
03:14:56,200 --> 03:14:57,200
Pretty cool.

4325
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:58,200
He's cool.

4326
03:14:58,200 --> 03:14:59,200
I like it.

4327
03:14:59,200 --> 03:15:00,200
I like it.

4328
03:15:00,200 --> 03:15:02,200
I love the pig.

4329
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:04,200
Bring back the pig.

4330
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:08,200
You know, we were too hasty.

4331
03:15:08,200 --> 03:15:09,200
First voicemail.

4332
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:10,200
This is the last one.

4333
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:17,200
It's called can't afford the bus frowny face from Jamie Sims 99.

4334
03:15:17,200 --> 03:15:18,200
Jamie.sims99.

4335
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:19,200
That gmail.com.

4336
03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:22,200
Three, two, one, go.

4337
03:15:22,200 --> 03:15:23,200
Hey, Ben.

4338
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:26,200
Can I borrow six quid?

4339
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:29,200
I need to get the bus home.

4340
03:15:29,200 --> 03:15:30,200
Six quid?

4341
03:15:30,200 --> 03:15:32,200
Was that Simsie?

4342
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:37,200
Well, what's your answer?

4343
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:39,200
Cost six quid for the bus?

4344
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:40,200
Yeah.

4345
03:15:40,200 --> 03:15:42,200
That's like eight dollars.

4346
03:15:42,200 --> 03:15:44,200
Peak time in Bristol, man.

4347
03:15:44,200 --> 03:15:45,200
Peak time?

4348
03:15:45,200 --> 03:15:48,200
What the fuck?

4349
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:50,200
It's like a buck 90.

4350
03:15:50,200 --> 03:15:52,200
It's like a buck 90 to take the bus here.

4351
03:15:52,200 --> 03:15:54,200
Oh, fucking yeah.

4352
03:15:54,200 --> 03:15:55,200
All right.

4353
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:57,200
Here in communist America.

4354
03:15:57,200 --> 03:16:02,200
Yeah, in fucking miracle land or whatever the fuck it's called.

4355
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:08,200
The fucking roads are paid with gold and you pay gold to get on the bus.

4356
03:16:08,200 --> 03:16:09,200
Wait, yeah.

4357
03:16:09,200 --> 03:16:13,200
That is really quite expensive, a London fare.

4358
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:17,200
Look, if you need it for a bus ride.

4359
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:20,200
If you need it for a bus ride, you got it.

4360
03:16:20,200 --> 03:16:27,200
But you got to buy me some what's like a stupid British slop you would eat over there.

4361
03:16:27,200 --> 03:16:30,200
You got to buy me some haggis or something.

4362
03:16:30,200 --> 03:16:31,200
The haggis.

4363
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:32,200
Scottish.

4364
03:16:32,200 --> 03:16:34,200
You wouldn't find that in Bristol very easily.

4365
03:16:34,200 --> 03:16:35,200
Whatever.

4366
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:36,200
Okay.

4367
03:16:36,200 --> 03:16:37,200
You got what you.

4368
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:41,200
You got to buy me a, you got to buy me a smack bar and pee wet.

4369
03:16:41,200 --> 03:16:42,200
What?

4370
03:16:42,200 --> 03:16:43,200
I don't know what that is.

4371
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:45,200
You got to buy me a smack bar and a Kimbo with the pee wet.

4372
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:48,200
That sounds like a sex move.

4373
03:16:48,200 --> 03:16:49,200
It's when you put.

4374
03:16:49,200 --> 03:16:59,200
It's when you put a chicken pie between bread and then you put the water from the pea soup on it.

4375
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:03,200
You put some pea soup on your sandwich, which is just a pie between bread.

4376
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:05,200
Is that what you think we do?

4377
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:06,200
I saw it.

4378
03:17:06,200 --> 03:17:07,200
I saw the video.

4379
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:08,200
I've seen the proof.

4380
03:17:08,200 --> 03:17:11,200
What about a, what about a blood pudding?

4381
03:17:11,200 --> 03:17:14,200
I had Chinese food last night.

4382
03:17:14,200 --> 03:17:15,200
I actually like blood pudding.

4383
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:17,200
I tried blood pudding once and I liked it.

4384
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:18,200
Black pudding is good.

4385
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:19,200
Or yeah, black, black pudding.

4386
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:20,200
I had it for breakfast.

4387
03:17:20,200 --> 03:17:22,200
It was pretty decent actually.

4388
03:17:22,200 --> 03:17:24,200
It's good pudding.

4389
03:17:24,200 --> 03:17:25,200
Blood pudding.

4390
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:29,200
There's a difference between blood pudding and black pudding.

4391
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:33,200
Black pudding, paradoxically, black pudding is the one that is made out of blood.

4392
03:17:33,200 --> 03:17:34,200
It's a good one.

4393
03:17:34,200 --> 03:17:35,200
Yeah.

4394
03:17:35,200 --> 03:17:38,200
So what's blood pudding made out of then?

4395
03:17:38,200 --> 03:17:39,200
Black.

4396
03:17:39,200 --> 03:17:40,200
Probably also has some blood in it.

4397
03:17:40,200 --> 03:17:42,200
It's made out of black.

4398
03:17:42,200 --> 03:17:43,200
Yeah.

4399
03:17:43,200 --> 03:17:44,200
Yeah.

4400
03:17:44,200 --> 03:17:46,200
It's made out of a squid ink.

4401
03:17:46,200 --> 03:17:48,200
It's made out of the color black.

4402
03:17:48,200 --> 03:17:50,200
It's made out of condensed void energy.

4403
03:17:50,200 --> 03:17:53,200
Void, void, void, void, void.

4404
03:17:53,200 --> 03:17:55,200
Void, void, void.

4405
03:17:55,200 --> 03:18:01,200
I'm looking to, to avoid between two slices of bread and pee all over it.

4406
03:18:01,200 --> 03:18:02,200
Oh God.

4407
03:18:02,200 --> 03:18:03,200
Hey.

4408
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:04,200
You Brits.

4409
03:18:04,200 --> 03:18:05,200
How are you?

4410
03:18:05,200 --> 03:18:06,200
I've got, I've got bad news.

4411
03:18:06,200 --> 03:18:07,200
I've got bad news.

4412
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:09,200
We've actually got two more voicemails.

4413
03:18:09,200 --> 03:18:10,200
Oh my God.

4414
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:11,200
No.

4415
03:18:11,200 --> 03:18:12,200
I'm sorry they arrived just now.

4416
03:18:12,200 --> 03:18:15,200
We have to, we have to end the episode before there are more voicemails.

4417
03:18:15,200 --> 03:18:22,200
This, this one is called a message for Simsies Balls and it's from Simsiefan333 at hotmail.com.

4418
03:18:22,200 --> 03:18:27,200
So I guess let's give this one a listen in three, two, one.

4419
03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:29,200
This one is me.

4420
03:18:29,200 --> 03:18:30,200
Go.

4421
03:18:30,200 --> 03:18:32,200
Hello Simsie.

4422
03:18:32,200 --> 03:18:34,200
You big smelly willy.

4423
03:18:34,200 --> 03:18:42,200
I'm going to suck the sweat out of your balls.

4424
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:44,200
What the fuck?

4425
03:18:44,200 --> 03:18:51,200
Your balls are mine for the second Simsie.

4426
03:18:51,200 --> 03:18:54,200
How do they know I'm so sweaty?

4427
03:18:54,200 --> 03:18:55,200
What the fuck?

4428
03:18:55,200 --> 03:18:57,200
I don't think that's the thing.

4429
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,200
It's obvious dude.

4430
03:18:58,200 --> 03:19:00,200
It's obvious.

4431
03:19:00,200 --> 03:19:01,200
Everybody knows.

4432
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:02,200
You got a voice.

4433
03:19:02,200 --> 03:19:03,200
It's just in the voice.

4434
03:19:03,200 --> 03:19:04,200
We can tell.

4435
03:19:04,200 --> 03:19:05,200
Listen, who was that?

4436
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:06,200
Oh no.

4437
03:19:06,200 --> 03:19:07,200
Come on.

4438
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:08,200
It was you Simsie.

4439
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:11,200
That one wasn't me.

4440
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:12,200
Who else would do this?

4441
03:19:12,200 --> 03:19:13,200
I'm scared now.

4442
03:19:13,200 --> 03:19:14,200
I don't like this.

4443
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:16,200
Just look up Simsiefan on Twitter.

4444
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:18,200
They might not answer.

4445
03:19:18,200 --> 03:19:22,200
Simsiefan333, but it's spelled with one M.

4446
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:26,200
One of your biggest fans on Kiwi Farms or something.

4447
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:30,200
Because clearly Simsiefan333 with two M's was taken.

4448
03:19:30,200 --> 03:19:31,200
Yeah.

4449
03:19:31,200 --> 03:19:33,200
It's too popular.

4450
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:36,200
Next one is called Apathetic Android.

4451
03:19:36,200 --> 03:19:37,200
This is the last one.

4452
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:40,200
Three, two, one, go.

4453
03:19:40,200 --> 03:19:44,200
I hate for procrastinator's podcast.

4454
03:19:44,200 --> 03:19:47,200
I fucking hate it.

4455
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:49,200
I can't stop listening.

4456
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:55,200
A single point without literally every single host.

4457
03:19:55,200 --> 03:20:01,200
Constantly like vultures try and jump on me

4458
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:07,200
and cannibalize my point to the point where it's

4459
03:20:07,200 --> 03:20:13,200
unrecognizable.

4460
03:20:13,200 --> 03:20:18,200
I like the idea of a robot listening to a podcast for some reason.

4461
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:19,200
It was really funny.

4462
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:21,200
Sounds more like a demon.

4463
03:20:21,200 --> 03:20:24,200
Why is he listening if he doesn't even like it?

4464
03:20:24,200 --> 03:20:25,200
He's a robot.

4465
03:20:25,200 --> 03:20:26,200
He can do anything.

4466
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:31,200
Well, there's plenty of people in the comments that listen all the time and they hate it.

4467
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:33,200
Yo, it's true.

4468
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:35,200
Shoutouts to you guys.

4469
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:37,200
Shoutouts to the commenters.

4470
03:20:37,200 --> 03:20:40,200
Sorry, the podcast is what it is.

4471
03:20:40,200 --> 03:20:43,200
I know none of us are happy about it.

4472
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:45,200
I'm sorry.

4473
03:20:45,200 --> 03:20:49,200
I'm so sorry.

4474
03:20:49,200 --> 03:20:54,200
We've all got to deal with the hand we're dealt in life.

4475
03:20:54,200 --> 03:20:56,200
This is what we got.

4476
03:20:56,200 --> 03:20:57,200
This is what you've got.

4477
03:20:57,200 --> 03:21:00,200
When life gives you the procrastinator's podcast, what do you do?

4478
03:21:00,200 --> 03:21:02,200
You make the gamer's zone.

4479
03:21:02,200 --> 03:21:04,200
You make gamer's zone out of it.

4480
03:21:04,200 --> 03:21:05,200
You make wasted content out of it.

4481
03:21:05,200 --> 03:21:06,200
Oh, finally.

4482
03:21:06,200 --> 03:21:07,200
You make a better podcast.

4483
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:08,200
You're right.

4484
03:21:08,200 --> 03:21:09,200
You make voicemails.

4485
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:10,200
You make comments.

4486
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:11,200
You make the best.

4487
03:21:11,200 --> 03:21:13,200
You make band camp albums.

4488
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:17,200
Well, guys, this is the end of the Pizza Party podcast.

4489
03:21:17,200 --> 03:21:20,200
Finally, we found it and we ended it.

4490
03:21:20,200 --> 03:21:23,200
We better end it before we get more voicemails.

4491
03:21:23,200 --> 03:21:24,200
Yeah.

4492
03:21:24,200 --> 03:21:26,200
No more voicemails.

4493
03:21:26,200 --> 03:21:27,200
No more.

4494
03:21:27,200 --> 03:21:28,200
That's it.

4495
03:21:28,200 --> 03:21:29,200
That's the cutoff point.

4496
03:21:29,200 --> 03:21:36,200
Thepatreon.com slash the procrastinator's podcast for something.

4497
03:21:36,200 --> 03:21:37,200
I don't know.

4498
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:41,200
I'm sure there's something there that is money to eat Minecraft server.

4499
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:42,200
Oh, sure.

4500
03:21:42,200 --> 03:21:43,200
Yeah.

4501
03:21:43,200 --> 03:21:44,200
Yeah.

4502
03:21:44,200 --> 03:21:45,200
Sure.

4503
03:21:45,200 --> 03:21:46,200
Whatever.

4504
03:21:46,200 --> 03:21:49,200
And speakcribe.com slash PCB voicemail.

4505
03:21:49,200 --> 03:21:56,200
If you want to be one of these fine fellows, fellows or fellows, it's gender neutral.

4506
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:58,200
It's either, either or.

4507
03:21:58,200 --> 03:21:59,200
Yeah.

4508
03:21:59,200 --> 03:22:00,200
Yeah.

4509
03:22:00,200 --> 03:22:04,200
In the, in the, these fucking part of the show.

4510
03:22:04,200 --> 03:22:07,200
Road to Radcon backers.

4511
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:13,200
Remember to send your change of address if necessary to the Kickstarter.

4512
03:22:13,200 --> 03:22:18,200
If you didn't order the book, but you want it, I will be selling the extra.

4513
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:20,200
I probably have like 20 extra copies at the end.

4514
03:22:20,200 --> 03:22:22,200
So I will make another post.

4515
03:22:22,200 --> 03:22:24,200
If you're, if you're a late comer, you're like, I want the book.

4516
03:22:24,200 --> 03:22:26,200
I'll be selling the book over at Patreon.

4517
03:22:26,200 --> 03:22:29,200
I'm going to get a quick tweet about it at some point in the future, but there's limited

4518
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:31,200
supply, very limited, very limited.

4519
03:22:31,200 --> 03:22:33,200
Didn't get that many extras.

4520
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:35,200
So, okay.

4521
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:36,200
Just putting that out there.

4522
03:22:36,200 --> 03:22:38,200
And I think that's all.

4523
03:22:38,200 --> 03:22:40,200
I think that's all I have to say about that.

4524
03:22:40,200 --> 03:22:43,200
Any, any, any final words?

4525
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:44,200
Rose.

4526
03:22:44,200 --> 03:22:45,200
Read Villainverse.

4527
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:46,200
Read Villainverse.

4528
03:22:46,200 --> 03:22:47,200
Okay.

4529
03:22:47,200 --> 03:22:48,200
Read Villainverse.

4530
03:22:48,200 --> 03:22:49,200
Yeah.

4531
03:22:49,200 --> 03:22:50,200
Yeah.

4532
03:22:50,200 --> 03:22:51,200
Read Villainverse.

4533
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:52,200
Yeah.

4534
03:22:52,200 --> 03:22:53,200
Read Villainverse.

4535
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:54,200
This podcast really reminds me of Villainverse.

4536
03:22:54,200 --> 03:22:55,200
You ever seen the Zimzies?

4537
03:22:55,200 --> 03:22:57,200
There aren't big Villainverse flags from that.

4538
03:22:57,200 --> 03:22:58,200
Yeah.

4539
03:22:58,200 --> 03:23:00,200
I'm getting, I'm getting a new microphone tomorrow.

4540
03:23:00,200 --> 03:23:04,200
So I'm probably going to start live streaming regularly now that my audio won't be pooh-pooh

4541
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:05,200
die-rear.

4542
03:23:05,200 --> 03:23:06,200
You're going to live stream.

4543
03:23:06,200 --> 03:23:08,200
You're going to live stream yourself reading Villainverse, guys.

4544
03:23:08,200 --> 03:23:09,200
So.

4545
03:23:09,200 --> 03:23:10,200
Yeah, exactly.

4546
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:11,200
That's the first.

4547
03:23:11,200 --> 03:23:12,200
That's the first.

4548
03:23:12,200 --> 03:23:13,200
Exciting stuff.

4549
03:23:13,200 --> 03:23:16,200
That's the first stream that I'm just going to be tracing all the art from Villainverse.

4550
03:23:16,200 --> 03:23:17,200
Yeah.

4551
03:23:17,200 --> 03:23:18,200
Making their boobs smaller.

4552
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:19,200
Yeah.

4553
03:23:19,200 --> 03:23:20,200
Smaller.

4554
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:21,200
No, bigger.

4555
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:22,200
Wait.

4556
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:23,200
Wait, what?

4557
03:23:23,200 --> 03:23:26,200
Who even is, who is even happening anymore?

4558
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:29,200
Okay, I guess that's the end of the show.

4559
03:23:29,200 --> 03:23:31,200
And that's the end of the show.

4560
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:33,200
And goodbye and see you next week.

4561
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:34,200
Goodbye.

4562
03:23:34,200 --> 03:23:35,200
Love you.

4563
03:23:35,200 --> 03:23:36,200
Bye.

4564
03:23:36,200 --> 03:23:37,200
Bye.
