00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,440
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, it's morning in America and it's afternoon in Japan

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:42,840
where Gibb is reporting live from Japan, he should send breakfast in America because that's an album by the, what's it called, Super Tramp, are they a British band?

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Half British, half Australian, I believe, they're members. I really like Super Tramp. Yes. I love Super Tramp. Good reference, one time in my old house, like two houses ago, me and a guy just got really drunk and just were like, oh my god, you like Super Tramp, I like Super Tramp.

4
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:32,840
When I was young, life was so wonderful. The miracle was beautiful, magical. Yeah, I remember. I remember when things happen sometimes. How's your week been, Gibb?

5
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:43,840
My week, gee, I don't know, it's a blur. Oh, I beat Outer Wilds, that's the thing. I talked about it last time, but I beat it.

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
You beat what now?

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Outer Wilds, remember the game, the space game?

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh yeah, I downloaded it, but I haven't played it yet.

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Give it a go, give it a good old try.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,840
It's on my desktop, so yeah, I should. I just haven't gotten around to it.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm halfway through editing, finishing to edit my video, like the final cut.

12
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:24,840
I had to do the whole rough cut, and now I'm going through the fine tooth comb, like doing the final edit of it, and that is half done.

13
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,840
I have three and a half hours out of probably seven and a half hours, so that's what I've been doing this week.

14
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Oh, you mean you've gone through three hours? I thought you'd cut it down from seven to three somehow?

15
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:50,840
No, no, I have edited three and a half hours of it, and there is about three and a half hours, probably four hours left to go.

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Crazy.

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Two weeks ago I said maybe I'd have it done by the time the episode dropped, lol, that was silly, that was too optimistic, but I said as much.

18
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Progress is progress.

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Yeah, hey yeah, it is.

20
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Hell yeah.

21
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,840
I made a bit of progress on the Clarissa, I'm now in the final scene kind of, the showdown.

22
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm at the showdown.

23
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Of the sketches?

24
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Of the blocking out of the pages.

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:41,840
They're sort of half sketches, I'm deciding where the characters are standing and what poses they have, and I might change that before I properly sketch them.

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Like a storyboard almost.

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Yeah.

28
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

29
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Cool, how many pages is it at?

30
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Oh, I knew this, I counted them, I think right now.

31
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah, the most obvious question, you gotta know this one's coming.

32
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I think it's like 80 something pages that have been blocked out and need to be sketched, so 80 something pages currently and will include more by the end.

33
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,840
And there's 50 that are already out, you can read right now on gippentake.site.

34
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King, I forget the exact URL.

35
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Just go to gippentake.site and read my comic.

36
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Yes, indeed, indeed.

37
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:54,840
But yeah, it's like I'm not technically getting that much done, but I am always getting something done, so it's coming along.

38
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,840
I don't know whether I'll be finishing things up by the end of October.

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I hope to at least be in the sketching phase and then see how many pages I can get done.

40
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,840
And then at some point this will happen, the progress is slow but steady.

41
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,840
It'd be nice if it was first, but I can't have everything.

42
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,840
No indeed, no indeed.

43
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:40,840
True words were never spoken.

44
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
When's it gonna be done?

45
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Huh?

46
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
When's it gonna be done?

47
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
When's it gonna be done?

48
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Give me deadline right now.

49
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
No, no, no, no, no.

50
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Before the end of the year, because I don't think I have anything coming up that will distract.

51
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:16,840
So as long as I keep the work in every day, every weekday, and I do a certain amount of stuff, couple hours a day at the very least, yeah, I can get it done.

52
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Christmas is always a big busy time, but November isn't.

53
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,840
November's fine.

54
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm feeling a little bit, I don't want to be a Grinch, I don't want to be a Halloween Grinch, but I'm feeling a little bit anti-Halloween this year.

55
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,840
I'm feeling a little bit fed up with all the spooky season pumpkin posting.

56
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,840
It's the second and I'm already a little bit sick of it, if I'm being completely honest.

57
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,840
The spooky posting is just sort of like whatever, but I like Halloween.

58
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Every year, every year, the noise, noise, noise, noise, they just keep posting and posting.

59
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,840
You're gonna go around in a devil costume and steal all the candy so they can't trick or treat.

60
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
It'll only be tricks.

61
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:31,840
I'm gonna go around dressed as a Mormon saying, I don't let my kids celebrate Halloween and I won't let you seduce him.

62
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,840
I won't let you groom him into Halloween-ing with you.

63
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:49,840
I don't get it. I don't really like it very much.

64
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,840
The aesthetic is not that appealing. I guess it's fine because it's different.

65
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I feel like it didn't used to be the whole month of October.

66
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Back in my day, I don't remember.

67
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I mean, the sheer Halloween decorations start going up.

68
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I don't know.

69
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I have a similar feeling in that-

70
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I like spending Halloween with friends. It is a fun holiday, but that's about it.

71
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
That's as strong as I feel about it.

72
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,840
It's like the Halloween posts feel obligatory by a lot of people.

73
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
It's mostly just tweets where I'm like, oh, spooky.

74
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Here's a gif. I'm like, yeah, I've seen that before.

75
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Everybody's got their own little thing doing.

76
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I think they're just sort of excited and that's fine.

77
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
The posts aren't what I'm interested in.

78
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I like the stuff that happens on October because you're guaranteed your favorite content creator is gonna have a Halloween special.

79
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
They're all gonna do it.

80
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
That's quite fun.

81
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Yeah, okay. That's fair. That's true.

82
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,840
I never used to. I never used to dress up.

83
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,840
I dressed up when I was younger and I was a little kid for Halloween and stuff,

84
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,840
but when I got into my teenage years, I was like,

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,840
what am I gonna do wearing a garbage bag as a cape and a little hat?

86
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't need to do that.

87
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,840
So I didn't and I'm like, that's a garbage bag and a little hat.

88
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
That's your costume. That's your idea of a Halloween costume.

89
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Yeah, I didn't give a fuck.

90
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Hey, what are you this year, kid?

91
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,840
I was just wearing this garbage bag and a little hat.

92
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,840
You mean it's Halloween?

93
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Yeah.

94
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
But I want to get back into that.

95
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,840
I want to actually make a Halloween costume this year.

96
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I want to try and make something or half make it and half buy some stuff at thrift stores and put together an outfit

97
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:18,840
instead of just relying on store bought masks that we got 19 years ago that are in the Halloween box.

98
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Because that's what I used to be.

99
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,840
If I don't put any effort in, all I've got is the Halloween box and the Halloween box is really old and sucks.

100
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:35,840
I used to always try and make it an opportunity to do what I guess I would later come to know as cosplay.

101
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I always used to want to, for Halloween, I always used to be a video game character.

102
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,840
It's a little lame to cosplay on Halloween. It's not spooky.

103
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,840
I feel like it's worth something. If you're going to do it, you should be on brand with it.

104
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I suppose so, yeah.

105
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
It's not an anime convention.

106
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,840
That's what I would tell my young self if I could go back and do it all over again.

107
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Yeah, I mean little babies.

108
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Little babies are allowed to be like a minion or something.

109
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Well, if you're scared of scary stuff, you can be like a little Captain America or whatever.

110
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Well, everyone, who did I see saying like, fuck, everyone is going to be the Queen's corpse this year?

111
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Everyone is going to be zombie.

112
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Shit, was the Queen named Victoria?

113
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
It's Elizabeth.

114
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Elizabeth, sorry, everyone's going to be the zombie Queen Elizabeth.

115
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,840
You know, I hadn't even considered that, but that is kind of an obvious edgy joke costume.

116
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you remember the year that the Dark Knight came out and everybody was fucking the Joker?

117
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
They were fucking the Joker?

118
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
They were fucking the Joker, Jerry.

119
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Oh my god, yeah, he got so much sex.

120
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
They fucked him. He got so much puse.

121
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,840
No, everybody was Heath Ledger's Joker.

122
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,840
It's going to be that with the zombie Queen Elizabeth.

123
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:20,840
The new hit blockbuster was the Queen's funeral because there's nothing else in the cinema.

124
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
That's how it feels.

125
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Basically, I want to make a thing. I just haven't decided.

126
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I made a tweet just now, just today.

127
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm like, what am I going to be? What do I do?

128
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Because I don't know. I could be Friska, but she just wears a jacket.

129
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
She's not scary except when she's trying to kill people.

130
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
What am I going to do?

131
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Yeah, blah, blah.

132
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I feel like, I don't know, I think that'd be funny.

133
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,840
I know I just said Cosplaying on Halloween is wrong.

134
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I don't actually think it's wrong. I just think it was lame when I did it.

135
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I would tell myself not to do it, but I hold myself to a different standard.

136
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Because I did it enough.

137
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
I did it enough.

138
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Were you Mega Man X?

139
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,840
No, I was Link from Zelda one year.

140
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,840
I was Squall from Final Fantasy VIII in eighth grade.

141
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,840
I don't know. It's so stupid, pitiful, pathetic. Die.

142
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Do you have pictures? Do you have pictures we can put on the screen of Ben St. as Squall?

143
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,840
No. I mean, maybe my parents have some pictures of it. I hope not.

144
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,840
I hope not.

145
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:58,840
I don't know. Looking back, it's sad because I used to think it would be cool.

146
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I used to want to cosplay as Zero from Mega Man Zero.

147
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
I was like, damn, I want to dress like that. I want to have a costume like that.

148
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Oh, with the long blond, like, spiky hair thing?

149
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Yes, but specifically the one from the Zero series, which looks distinct from Zero in the rest of the series.

150
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,840
He had a different artist.

151
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,840
This is the case for Zero as well as for everyone else.

152
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,840
You can't just dress like that.

153
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Or, in fact, basically anything that I wanted to dress like.

154
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,840
You can't just dress like that and look fine because you don't have that body type.

155
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
You don't actually look like that.

156
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,840
If I tried to dress like Mega Man Zero...

157
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Sorry, his name's not Mega Man Zero. His name's just Zero.

158
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,840
I don't know. I would just look like a fat weirdo.

159
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,840
He has a very twinkish body type.

160
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Despite how much I appreciate the character, I simply could not pull it off.

161
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Same with Squall.

162
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:20,840
It's not really made much of in the game, but Squall is a very tall, handsome, lantern-jawed, slim-build sort of guy.

163
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I was like a dumpy kid.

164
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm sure it just looked miserable.

165
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,840
It's hard to look good when you're being a character that doesn't exist.

166
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Isn't it fun, though?

167
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
To dress up?

168
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
I did have fun, but I shouldn't have. That was my mistake.

169
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,840
That was wrong of me and I apologize.

170
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,840
I didn't have the school bullies to laugh at you directly.

171
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,840
It's such an obvious way to make you aware that you didn't look perfect.

172
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Nobody laughed at me.

173
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,840
In fact, even one of the kids who I wouldn't have called him a bully.

174
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I didn't really have bullies in school, but there was a kid from a clique that I considered to be more diametrically opposed.

175
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,840
A kid I thought wouldn't like me, but I got a compliment.

176
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I was like, oh, that's a good game. I liked that game Final Fantasy VIII.

177
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
I was like, oh, what? Oh, cool.

178
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,840
It sounds like it was a good idea and it was fine, Benz scene.

179
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
It sounds like it was not embarrassing at all.

180
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,840
But let me tell you, it was embarrassing for internal reasons.

181
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
I embarrassed myself to myself.

182
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm not worried about anyone else's opinion.

183
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,840
I don't care what anyone else thinks. I only care what my extremely self-critical version of myself thinks.

184
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Yeah, man, I'm a rebel. I don't care what anyone else thinks except the voice in my head that tells me what a loser I am, that one.

185
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm very concerned about it. Let me shape my whole life around it.

186
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Man, dad.

187
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Yep, I'm a renegade.

188
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,840
I could do like a steampunk, goth, vampire, queen sort of thing.

189
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Just trying to think of like the classic.

190
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,840
I was thinking of like being like a character, but I don't know.

191
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I don't know whether I want to be a reference to something.

192
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Because it's easy if you're a reference to something. You just reference the image or the character design.

193
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,840
And you can like, you know, steal their look and get all the things.

194
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,840
But that feels too easy.

195
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,840
But then again, I might not have the patience to do a lot of work on it.

196
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:02,840
So I might take the easy approach and just like get some like red boots and goes Marcelline or something.

197
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I can play bass. It works.

198
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,840
True. Yeah.

199
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Damn, I didn't even think about even think about costuming.

200
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,840
I just assumed I wouldn't do it.

201
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Maybe I could do something.

202
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Maybe you could be the Professor Brothers or whatever those guys are called.

203
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,840
No, would anybody, would anybody get that?

204
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,840
I mean, you've referenced it before. I don't even remember what they're about.

205
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Yeah. I mean, would anyone outside of the podcast get it?

206
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Even people who listen to the, first of all, people can't see me on the podcast.

207
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Yeah. We're not going to dress up for, we might.

208
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,840
I mean, it depends on when we're recording the one near Halloween.

209
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Bonus episode idea. Episode recorded in Halloween costume.

210
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
But you can't see us.

211
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,840
But every so often, if we're wearing a crinkly outfit, we'll crinkle.

212
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
We'll crinkle for you.

213
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
And you'll know. It'll change the whole vibe.

214
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,840
We'll change.

215
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,840
I am not sure if I will do a costume or if I did, like what would I wear it to?

216
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,840
I'm not sure. I haven't worked all that out yet.

217
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,840
But I'm not completely sure. I'm not, I'm not saying I definitely won't.

218
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,840
But I won't if I don't have any good reason to.

219
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Sure. I mean, I'm not really going to go out to a party wearing it.

220
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I don't have any parties planned.

221
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Maybe I'll find something.

222
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,840
I just want to like do it to do it and then take some pictures.

223
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,840
And then I can wear it during Halloween.

224
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,840
And then I might just, if I make something cool that I can just wear normally.

225
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
That'd be cool.

226
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
And I can just wear forever.

227
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Why only do Halloween on Halloween?

228
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,840
You know, you know, actually, oh man, I had a

229
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
realization on the subject of costumes.

230
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I have started, okay, because I've lost, I've lost a bunch of weight.

231
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,840
I'm down to like 160 pounds, which for my height is,

232
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,840
which for my height actually puts me BMI wise,

233
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
it puts me just under the line of being overweight.

234
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
So I'm just barely no longer overweight according to BMI.

235
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
I guess so.

236
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,840
This is, I feel like, like it just, it feels hard for me to get to this weight.

237
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
It doesn't, like I'm usually, but I am now.

238
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,840
So anyway, what I'm saying is that I feel like BMI underestimates how much I should weigh.

239
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,840
But that's a different subject anyway.

240
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I have lost a bunch of weight.

241
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,840
And so I now fit into a bunch of clothes that I have not been able to wear for a while again.

242
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I fit into a bunch of shirts that I used to really like.

243
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I wore one the other day, a button down.

244
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
It felt good.

245
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
I thought I looked good in it.

246
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:09,840
But I was wearing the jacket, the same jacket that I wore in the Radcon 4 lectures.

247
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,840
It's like a black tuxedo jacket, sort of.

248
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,840
It doesn't have tails in the back, but it's sort of like,

249
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
it's sort of a tuxedo jacket.

250
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,840
But it's like, I don't know what you'd call it.

251
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,840
It's like a short, sort of like half jacket.

252
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,840
It's like, doesn't reach all the way down to my waist.

253
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Yeah, I guess so.

254
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
It's like a tuxedo crop jacket.

255
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
And I think it's so cool.

256
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
And I wish I had more of them.

257
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,840
I was looking for like similar things on like Amazon or eBay.

258
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
And I couldn't really find that many.

259
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Almost all the things I did find were women's.

260
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Which is like, well, I mean, I would wear a women's, I would wear a women's jacket if like,

261
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,840
as long as it didn't look like super girly or anything.

262
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
But most of the ones I found were, they either looked girly

263
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
or they were like really expensive.

264
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
So that was kind of a bummer.

265
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,840
There weren't that many.

266
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,840
But I was looking at the tag of it to see if I could find any information about the manufacturer.

267
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
And it was like, it's like a costume jacket.

268
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
It's made for by like a costume company.

269
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Not like a regular clothing company.

270
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I was like, huh, okay, sure, whatever.

271
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,840
I guess I'm not supposed to wear this in quote unquote real life.

272
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Yeah, that's a bunch of hooey.

273
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
It is a bunch of hooey.

274
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Thank you.

275
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Thank you.

276
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
That's what I've been saying.

277
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:49,840
I think partly I just want to, I want to try doing something like a little ostentatious,

278
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
a little out there, a little extreme.

279
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:02,840
For me, in a way that I can like get used to, I don't know, wearing more wilder things in normal day to day.

280
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Because I tend to like chicken out still and wear a t-shirt and whatever, like jeans.

281
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,840
I'm like, that's fine, I guess.

282
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
It's clothing.

283
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
But like, I can wear other things.

284
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
I can wear more or better things.

285
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
What if I did that more?

286
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,840
What if that was, I don't know, then I had to explain it.

287
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I am not, you're saying you're saying you want to wear something outlandish and attention-grabbing.

288
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
On Halloween.

289
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
As an exercise.

290
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
As a practice.

291
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Because you're allowed to and it just sort of would make it easier to like, I don't know.

292
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm embarrassed.

293
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I'm embarrassed about like, wearing things that are more feminine.

294
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
And I don't know.

295
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I want to get better at it because I do like it when I try.

296
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,840
I mean, you can wear whatever you want on Halloween.

297
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
So you can truly go wild.

298
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Nobody's going to say shit.

299
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Yeah.

300
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Yeah.

301
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Okay.

302
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
So where are we going from here?

303
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
I don't know.

304
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
That was really my only thought.

305
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,840
So it's just like, I want to do a Halloween thing.

306
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840
And that's my mind is set on that for the moment.

307
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
That's all I'm thinking about.

308
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,840
I'm going to obviously work on the Clarissa, but I don't know what October will bring.

309
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
And it will just probably be a month.

310
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,840
And that's, that's how it usually goes.

311
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:57,840
I feel pretty confident that my for this October, I will, I will finish editing my big video probably in the next week.

312
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
And I really mean it this time.

313
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,840
And then maybe I will get it posted in the same week.

314
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Although you never know.

315
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Sometimes things can happen.

316
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Like if there's always the chance that I try to upload it, but like it gets flagged.

317
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:19,840
And then I have to like do some fuckery with it to get around copyright stuff or content flags or something.

318
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Or there's the chance that like the rendering might prove problematic because it's such a big video.

319
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,840
And sometimes rendering really big videos can be a real fucky-wucky.

320
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,840
So I'll probably get that done in like the next week.

321
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:45,840
So my October will probably be, I'll probably, I guess I'll, once that's done, I'll be going back to finish up Slime and Punishment and getting that the book version of it done and hopefully produced.

322
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I was thinking about, I was thinking about what I was going to do for the Kickstarter trailer for Slime and Punishment.

323
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,840
And I have a green screen.

324
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:13,840
And I was thinking, I wonder if I could do some kind of, I wonder if I could do some kind of like in character green screen like from New Los Angeles City as the cop killer sort of little message.

325
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
I think that would be cool.

326
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I think that could look pretty cool.

327
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Hmm.

328
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Yeah.

329
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
Use a little filter.

330
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:29,840
How would you a green screen if you're, are you going to have your green like mask, the one that has your teeth on it?

331
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Wait, what do you mean?

332
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Don't you have like a mask, like a little fabric thing that you can pull up over your face that has like your gross slime teeth?

333
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Oh, sure.

334
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Well, I wouldn't wear that.

335
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
I mean, that would cover my, my real face.

336
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,840
No, we just use a fricking, just use fricking color shift video elements.

337
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Just, just make myself purple, crunch up the contrast, add some filters.

338
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Maybe I could get it so that my teeth look green.

339
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Anyway, you know, that would be pretty cool.

340
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Yeah.

341
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
I don't know.

342
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
I guess we'll see.

343
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,840
I just, I thought that would be a, I thought that would be a fun way to approach it.

344
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
It might, might be cool.

345
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,840
I don't know.

346
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Oh, um, speaking of kick starters, um, the clown, the clown milk Kickstarter.

347
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
She, do you see that?

348
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
She's his clown milk.

349
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Yeah.

350
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Kickstarter.

351
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
He met, he mentioned it.

352
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,840
It is, it is, it is, it is sluggish.

353
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
It's going sluggishly.

354
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
It is not on track to hit its funding goal.

355
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
I hope it, I hope it comes from behind and hits it.

356
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I pledge five bucks.

357
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,840
It does seem to be that it always ramps up near the end.

358
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
So I can, we can hope.

359
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
That does, that, that does.

360
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,840
It's got to, it's got to be like a big marketing push closer to the, the end of it.

361
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,840
I hope he, yeah, I hope he's able to like maybe do a podcast appearance or two or something

362
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
or something to, uh, yeah, get eyes on it.

363
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,840
I think it's at like a little under two K now of it's like 16 K goal.

364
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,840
You know, I wasn't, I had no idea like what's like what the market is like for clown porn.

365
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Like for all I know, it could be like a very untapped market and there's a, and there would

366
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,840
be like a ground swell of like support for it.

367
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
It's, it's weird.

368
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I feel like clown, like sexy clown women as an idea has become more popular more recently.

369
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I don't know.

370
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,840
You know, I feel that way, but it might just be because I know cheesy.

371
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,840
It might be, but I don't know.

372
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Like there's like Twitter users that dress up in clown makeup and they do like the Hong Kong sex.

373
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Like it's a, it's a.

374
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
I have seen a couple of them, but I see them because cheesy follows them and cheesy retweets

375
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
them sometimes.

376
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,840
So that's why I'm like, is it, is it really becoming popular or am I just, have I just

377
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,840
been exposed to some more, more of it than none?

378
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Well, I mean, I look at the, the likes and I'm like, these aren't like niche accounts.

379
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,840
They're quite big, like reasonably big.

380
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I mean, I think, I think that they're more popular, but I don't know how popular in general.

381
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
Yeah.

382
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Yeah.

383
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,840
I think, I think like 10 years ago, the idea would have been like, like people were talking

384
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
about how clowns are creepy, like that was the thing.

385
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Nobody was talking about how clowns were sexy.

386
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,840
There's, yeah, there's one, um, there's one, I think she's a Twitch streamer or like an

387
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Instagram girl.

388
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
She's called, I think she's called bouncy clown.

389
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Uh, she's cute, but, but her bio is like, her bio says like cute clown, not scary clown.

390
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Yeah.

391
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Yeah.

392
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
No, I think, no, I think you're right.

393
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,840
I feel like there's been a little bit of like, hey, maybe clowns are all right sometimes.

394
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,840
I think it's just like a general sense of like people embracing like grossness.

395
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I think the pendulum has swung a little bit the other way on clowns.

396
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
I feel similarly.

397
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Yeah.

398
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,840
People in general, I think are like embracing grossness as like a comedy thing, like going

399
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,840
goblin mode and being like a horrible thing.

400
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,840
So like clowns used to be scary, but now they're sexy is like, could be a part of that.

401
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Hmm.

402
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Oh, monster girls, but girls will, they will just kill you like a stab you in the face.

403
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Somebody do that so hot.

404
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Somebody needs to write a video essay on, you know, the, the semiotics of the, the intersection

405
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,840
between clowns and got clowns and pop culture and goblin mode and what it means for society.

406
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Um, man, oh man.

407
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,840
So anyway, uh, I've been, I've been, I've been keeping my eye on that, but reminder to

408
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,840
any viewers that haven't, they should check out the clown milk Kickstarter if they're,

409
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
if they want to see that succeed.

410
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Yes.

411
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Uh, what else?

412
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
What else?

413
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
I didn't, I don't have any notes.

414
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,840
I didn't write any notes for this, um, for this, this week.

415
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Yeah.

416
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
It's sort of been a weird week.

417
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
And by weird, I mean normal.

418
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm just like, I have a good day and I get some work done.

419
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Then I have a bad day and it's sad.

420
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Then I'm okay.

421
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
The week's over.

422
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
I got some work done.

423
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Well, that's good.

424
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Okay.

425
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
New, new month.

426
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Oh, I've got to do my money spenders podcast.

427
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I kind of forgot that.

428
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I have, you know, I recorded a, I did record a, a patron, uh, thing a few weeks ago.

429
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,340
I said in that, that like, I don't think, I called the monthly Q and A's, but I haven't

430
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,840
been doing the monthly for a while.

431
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,840
And I think it's time to acknowledge that like, I'm not going to do them monthly.

432
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
They're probably going to be more like every couple of months.

433
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,840
And I think I'm, I think I'm okay with that because, you know, I have this podcast to

434
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:08,840
say everything that happens to me on a somewhat regular basis that the patron one is for, um,

435
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,840
I don't know, uh, opining about more things, more generally the direction my life is heading,

436
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
I guess.

437
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,840
So a more zoomed out view is, is okay.

438
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
I think.

439
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
Yeah.

440
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,340
That's the same with mine.

441
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,840
It's, it's more personal, more things I don't want to be said publicly, but I'm okay with

442
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
saying a little bit.

443
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,840
There isn't, there isn't, there isn't too much.

444
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,840
I guess there's some things that I would not say on the PCP.

445
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
There's not that many things though.

446
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,840
It's pretty, it's pretty uncommon for me to have like something that I don't want to

447
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
talk about on here.

448
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,840
For me, it's mostly just like trends thoughts.

449
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,840
And I'm like, well, I mean, if I'm talking on a podcast with you, you won't get it.

450
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
So it'll sort of be me talking by myself.

451
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,840
So I may as well just be talking by myself on my own podcast about that sort of stuff.

452
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
I mean, guilty.

453
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Sorry.

454
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm sorry, Gip.

455
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
That's fine.

456
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,840
If only you could have just not been CIS, if only.

457
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
If only.

458
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Then we could have, then we could have like a friendship, but you know, the moment is

459
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
just a purely business relationship.

460
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
We got going.

461
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Yeah, it's, yeah, it's too, it's too bad.

462
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
You know, it's, it is a shame.

463
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,840
You know, I did always want to be a girl, but unfortunately I'm not, I'm not CIS.

464
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,840
So it just didn't work out that way.

465
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,840
You shook the magic and you asked and I said, yeah.

466
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,840
In another role of history's dice, perhaps.

467
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Speaking of being a girl, another one more page, new turned in one more page.

468
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Yes, I saw this week.

469
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
It's slowed down a little bit.

470
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I haven't, I haven't heard from Simsie about his page in a while.

471
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,840
I think he, I think he might have like, I think he might have like taken a hiatus from drawing.

472
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
I might ask him again about it.

473
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,840
And if he like, I might just like finish up the sketch that he did for him rather than

474
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,840
like find someone to do that.

475
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
And then maybe I'll just do the rest.

476
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,840
I might just do the rest of that page myself, even though I had a hard line stance against.

477
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
I mean, it's worth reaching out for sure.

478
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,840
I did ask, I did ask him about it again, but that was several weeks ago at this point.

479
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
So yeah, maybe one more, maybe one more try.

480
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,840
And then I'm like, oh, well, oh, well, he seems, he seems like he's,

481
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,840
he seems like he's not feeling it on Twitter recently.

482
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:52,840
So I think maybe he's, maybe he's not wanting to do it at the moment, which is fine.

483
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
We love that boy.

484
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
We miss that boy.

485
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Love that boy.

486
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Miss that boy.

487
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Precious.

488
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Precious Simsie.

489
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Come back to us.

490
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,840
No, it's fine.

491
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
The dojin though.

492
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Yeah.

493
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,840
There's only what, like maybe five pages left or something like that.

494
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,840
And then it's, there's no cover.

495
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Still don't have a cover.

496
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,840
There was a, there was, there was a guy, that guy who worked on Scott Pilgrim that I wanted to ask if he'd draw the cover.

497
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:34,840
And I have, he was a little bit, at first he was busy and then he was like, sorry, I've been busy.

498
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Let me get back to you about it.

499
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
And I was like, okay.

500
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
And then he didn't get back to me.

501
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
So I might give up on that too.

502
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Hmm.

503
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I think, I think Kaiji might have wanted to draw the cover.

504
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Oh yeah.

505
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Yeah.

506
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
And I didn't know anything to say.

507
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
What, huh?

508
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Is there a lag?

509
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Is there a lag that is like closing conversational difficulties?

510
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
No.

511
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Is there?

512
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Can you hear me?

513
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Right now?

514
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
I can hear you.

515
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Yeah.

516
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I just don't know when you're hearing me.

517
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I think we're fine.

518
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
No, I think, no, I think we're good.

519
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Hmm.

520
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Oh, this disease, I don't have, I don't have that much to talk about.

521
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
I can talk about.

522
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Do you want to hear, do you want to, oh yeah, yeah.

523
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Something.

524
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
The Last of Us part two.

525
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
You played that game?

526
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
No.

527
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I remember hearing all sorts of bad things about it when it came out.

528
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,840
And my brother's been playing it and I've been watching him.

529
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
And it's good.

530
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
It's actually very good.

531
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
I like what they're doing.

532
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,840
I have seen video essays talking about it.

533
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Because I didn't play the first one and I didn't plan to.

534
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
And I wasn't going to play the second one.

535
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
But I have heard people talk about it.

536
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,840
And a bunch of the video essay people that I follow have said that the game got a lot

537
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
of backlash when it came out.

538
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
But actually it's kind of good.

539
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
Yeah.

540
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Although the story is maybe a little bit confused, maybe not confused, but like all over the

541
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
place.

542
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,840
And like thematically it's a little bit like, hmm, what exactly were they going for?

543
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,840
But like there is a, there are themes there.

544
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Is my impression.

545
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,840
I would say it's a lot more cohesive and people are giving it credit.

546
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
I don't know why.

547
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Like I've heard that as well.

548
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
They think it's disjointed.

549
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
It's very simple.

550
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Well, it sounds like people are split on the ending.

551
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,840
And I guess it's like, I guess like half of the game you play as the person that kills

552
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Joel.

553
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Yeah.

554
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,840
And then you have to sort of play as them and sort of see like what their deal is.

555
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Which is a, which is a, which is a, I think that's a fair and reasonable thing to do in

556
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,840
the, in the story, but I can definitely see how it's off-putting.

557
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,840
If you like Joel and then the game is like now understand why the person that murdered

558
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Joel kind of was, was, was a justified or not justified, but like, you know, why they,

559
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,840
they had their reasons come to play as them and understand them as their own person.

560
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
See, that's the, the service is challenging.

561
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
It's a, it's a challenging decision.

562
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
That's surface level though.

563
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I feel like having, having seen the game play out in real time with the cutscenes happening

564
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:23,840
when they do, it's not about just like the, the, the frustration of playing as Joel's killer.

565
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:30,840
It's like more of a, a broader theme about like the, the necessariness of revenge and

566
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
how it's like self-defeating.

567
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Cause the whole Abbey, right?

568
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,840
She is the person who kills Joel.

569
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Her dad was a guy who Joel killed at the end of the first game and he was a very important

570
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
guy.

571
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,840
He was going to save the world with a vaccine and Joel killed him because the vaccine would

572
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
have killed Ellie.

573
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Well, that's like, that's the, I mean, I've heard, I've heard, I've heard some people

574
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,840
question whether that vaccine would have actually like worked.

575
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Sure.

576
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
I mean, yeah.

577
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
But in theory, they were going to try it.

578
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
They were doing that.

579
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Yeah.

580
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
But the thing is that was Abbey's dad.

581
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Abbey obviously hates Joel and is dead set on finding Joel and killing him.

582
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
What the fuck?

583
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
And so why is it a Libyan?

584
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Is that a Libyan fall?

585
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
A Libyan fall.

586
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Yo.

587
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
We already started recording.

588
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
I'm recording.

589
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
Okay.

590
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Hey, good to see you.

591
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,840
You have a surprise pop in.

592
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Well, I was going to be recording a draw cast right now, but I couldn't find people.

593
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
So I said, fuck it.

594
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
I'll do something else.

595
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
I see.

596
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Cool.

597
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Okay.

598
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Now this is what we're doing, I guess.

599
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,840
So last was part two spoilers, by the way.

600
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Have you not seen the game?

601
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I don't know.

602
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
You don't know.

603
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
You don't know.

604
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,840
It's not the kind of game I'm ever going to play in my life.

605
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
So I don't care.

606
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Yeah.

607
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
That's me.

608
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Like I've been spoiled on it because like I was never going to play it.

609
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
The last was part one.

610
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
So, okay.

611
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,840
So the thing with Abby is that her desire to kill Joel for revenge of her father and

612
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:21,840
the rest of the fireflies that he killed kind of fucks up her own life because the one,

613
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:28,840
the, her boyfriend that she was seeing ends up with some other woman who is one of the

614
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,840
women in the game that Ellie ends up killing.

615
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Her life, her boyfriend is sort of like, he doesn't like that Abby is constantly all

616
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,840
about killing Joel and this revenge thing and they grow distant because of that.

617
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,840
Abby sort of grows distant from her friend group and sort of finds like her life has

618
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
less meaning.

619
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,840
And after, you know, she kills Joel, she comes back and her life is kind of sucked.

620
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,840
It's kind of sucked of like purpose and it's like not good.

621
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
It's a bad thing.

622
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,840
So it's framed as Abby's desire for revenge was not good for Abby.

623
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:20,840
And so in parallel, Ellie goes off to kill Abby because she killed Joel and Ellie has

624
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
a similar sort of like lust for revenge.

625
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,840
But then we see through Abby's like situation that it's, it's not a good thing to go for

626
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
revenge.

627
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
It's a bad thing to do for your own life.

628
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,840
And Ellie's friends and like potential love interest are put in harm's way because of

629
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:44,840
her lust for this, this, this catharsis of killing Abby to revenge Joel.

630
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
She puts her own life in danger.

631
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,840
She fucks herself up and her friends and her, you know, and it's like, that's what the game

632
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
is about.

633
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,840
It's about like how revenge is self-defeating.

634
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,840
And it doesn't really do much for like anyone else.

635
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
And I was, I was just, I just like it.

636
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I just like it as a, as a theme.

637
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I like how it's portrayed and how it's not, it's not as simple.

638
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Yeah.

639
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:17,840
It's not as simple and like one note as people I've seen make comments about why like it's

640
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,840
a game where you shoot people and the game tells you that you're a bad person for shooting

641
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,840
people because Ryan, that is not at all what it says.

642
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,840
That's sort of a cliche at this point.

643
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Yeah.

644
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Yeah.

645
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Cause like you obviously shoot people for survival because that's the world you live in.

646
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:44,840
But it's specifically the revengeful killings that are not necessary for survival or self-defense

647
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
that are, you know, sort of bloodlust.

648
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,840
That's the thing that they're having a go at.

649
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Like why'd you feel like Joel doesn't deserve what he got?

650
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,840
And also why does Abby feel like she deserved to do that?

651
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Why does Ellie feel like she deserves to do any of this?

652
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,840
It doesn't, you don't need to do that.

653
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
You're just fucking yourself up.

654
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
That's the sort of message.

655
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,840
And it's controversial, but like, I like it.

656
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
It's, it's well told.

657
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
It's a story that I am into.

658
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
It's interesting.

659
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,840
And I don't like when people like sum it up in such stupid ways.

660
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Yeah.

661
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
They don't have a choice for, there's a woman in the game who isn't

662
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
conventionally attractive.

663
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,840
So, you know, it's all terrible.

664
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,840
We have to fucking hate everything.

665
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
There are a few people like that.

666
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,840
I don't know how many, but it definitely felt like the first wave of hate was like,

667
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,840
I can't believe that somebody killed Joel and she's an ugly woman.

668
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
I know.

669
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I saw this a lot of it.

670
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,840
And it was just so silly.

671
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Is that, Abby's not ugly, is she?

672
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,840
She's like, she's not like, she's kind of like muscular.

673
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
She's muscular.

674
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
She's like jacked.

675
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
That's the problem.

676
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,840
And she's got a normal person face.

677
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
It's like, she's not a beauty model.

678
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,840
And it's like, it's like, wow, what normal person, person in a post-apocalypse that

679
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,840
has big muscles for survival.

680
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
It makes sense.

681
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,840
It's just sort of like, you know, it's a silly thing to get mad about.

682
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,840
And I know some people got mad specifically about how she looked.

683
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
It's just not realistic, though.

684
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,840
You know, like a woman just wouldn't be muscular like that.

685
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,840
It just strains suspension of disbelief, I say, in my mushroom zombie apocalypse.

686
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,840
You know, unrealistic that women would exist at all in a post-apocalypse if you think about it.

687
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Mm-mm.

688
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
True.

689
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Yeah, they say the mushroom crowd would have killed them all and then it'd be Lisa instead.

690
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Remember Lisa?

691
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,840
From The Simpsons?

692
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,840
No, from Lisa the Painful.

693
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Oh, yes.

694
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
There's not enough women or something.

695
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Wait, wait, Lisa's not even in Lisa the Painful.

696
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
She's dead.

697
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
She was dead the whole time.

698
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Spoilers.

699
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
Why'd you say that?

700
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
That had nothing to do with anything.

701
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Wait, I thought you meant...

702
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I was talking about the game.

703
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
I was not talking about a character.

704
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Oh, yes.

705
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Right.

706
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
It would be Lisa, I understand.

707
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Like it would be the, there's only men scenario.

708
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
Yes, you're right.

709
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,840
That's the only apocalypse that I think could ever happen.

710
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:31,840
It's the most realistic scenario, even though they never explain why that happened.

711
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
But that makes it so realistic.

712
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,840
It's the ovaries.

713
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,840
Or...

714
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,840
There was the flash, there was the big flash.

715
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Or the balls that are protecting the flash.

716
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,840
It was the balls, it was the balls for sure.

717
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
You get right down to it.

718
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
How are you doing, Oblivion?

719
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,840
I'm doing okay.

720
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I'm working on new animations for my Patreon.

721
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,840
I've leveled up my art quite a bit.

722
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,840
You think so?

723
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
I think so.

724
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,840
I can...

725
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
How so?

726
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
How so?

727
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Pixar didn't happen.

728
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,840
I'll send pics.

729
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Justify yourself.

730
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,840
Yeah, I'll just chuck a couple in your DMs.

731
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Why not?

732
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Sorry, audience.

733
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,840
I'm not ready to have these be public yet.

734
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Okay, all right.

735
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,840
They're too saucy.

736
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,840
There's one for you, Ben.

737
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Aside from that,

738
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
something's been going on.

739
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Kai is completely recovered from his top speed right now.

740
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,840
That's some good news.

741
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Looks good.

742
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
Nice.

743
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
That is good.

744
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
And...

745
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Yeah.

746
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
This looks...

747
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Is this Falia?

748
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Yeah, this is Falia.

749
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,840
I don't know how to describe it,

750
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,840
but the style does look a little bit different.

751
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Well, I learned to shade at all,

752
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,840
which I hadn't done before.

753
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
Or at least rendered sweat.

754
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Yeah, the oily, the skin reflection.

755
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Yeah, I can...

756
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
It's nice.

757
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
You know, maybe I can stand back.

758
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,840
I think it's the Betty Boop lips.

759
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Oh, maybe, yeah.

760
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,840
I think that's what's...

761
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,840
She didn't have lipstick before, did she?

762
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
She did sometimes.

763
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,840
It was like every so often.

764
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,840
I think a cropped version that you can put on screen,

765
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Ellie is our...

766
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Also, don't mind the Anatomy being a little personal.

767
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,840
YouTube's mad at us.

768
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,840
YouTube got a little mad at us.

769
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
I know.

770
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,840
For that ballpoint pen sketch

771
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,840
of Give as Haruko.

772
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
That one time.

773
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,840
Oh, yeah.

774
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,840
You got stuff like that happen.

775
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,840
But, I don't know.

776
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Okay, all right.

777
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Life's going all right.

778
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,840
Are these for an animation?

779
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,840
No, those are just for an image set.

780
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,840
I am doing an animation as well.

781
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Okay.

782
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,840
That is going pretty okay.

783
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Again, maybe I'll need to make a cropped version

784
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,840
of what I'll send you for Ellie's already used.

785
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,840
I think I've seen a whip of this.

786
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,840
I don't know how far beyond, far along it is.

787
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,840
I took a couple weeks off to do some

788
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
drawing, basically.

789
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,840
So, it's probably not much further along

790
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,840
than what you saw before.

791
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,840
It is an animation involving my character

792
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,840
moving her funny boobies around.

793
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,840
Her fun bags, you might say.

794
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,840
That is funny.

795
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
Oh.

796
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,840
How do you feel about Halloween oblivion?

797
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,840
I think Halloween is a good time sometimes.

798
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,840
I like spooky skeletons.

799
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,840
Somebody has the 10-foot-tall Home Depot skeleton

800
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,840
down the street for me.

801
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,840
It's like leaning off of somebody's third-story balcony.

802
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,840
Oh, my God.

803
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,840
V Home Depot skeleton.

804
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,840
That sounds like there's some lore here.

805
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
Well, there's Home Depot cells

806
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,840
like 12-foot-tall skeleton for some reason.

807
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,840
It's crazy.

808
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
Yeah.

809
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,840
It's a well-known Halloween artifact

810
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,840
and someone got it.

811
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,840
I don't know, man.

812
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,840
I was saying, I'm not really in the Halloween spirit

813
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,840
at the moment.

814
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,840
I'm not really feeling it right now.

815
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,840
I'll be honest.

816
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,840
I've never done a Halloween.

817
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,840
I've never done a trick-or-treat.

818
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Oh, okay.

819
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,840
That culture just sort of escapes you.

820
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,840
It wasn't really present in New Zealand too much.

821
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
Yeah.

822
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,840
Though we did have, the church would,

823
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,840
and churches all over the country would throw

824
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,840
what they called star parties on Halloween.

825
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,840
I've never heard of that.

826
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
It sounds like some witchcraft.

827
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
It sounds like some astrology.

828
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,840
Yeah, maybe you're correct.

829
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,840
You just come down to a church,

830
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,840
they just have candy out in the open

831
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
people can grab.

832
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,840
You can dress up with no scary costumes

833
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,840
and there's a sausage sizzle going on.

834
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Wait, what's a sausage sizzle?

835
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
I mean, I think I can guess from the name.

836
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
You have a little barbecue and you throw some sausages

837
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,840
and you put them in buns with ketchup

838
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,840
and grilled onions.

839
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
You mean a barbecue?

840
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
Yeah, you mean a barbecue?

841
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,840
You call it a sausage sizzle.

842
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,840
That's so funny.

843
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Ever go to a Bunnings warehouse?

844
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,840
There's always a person selling $1 sausages outside.

845
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Bunnings?

846
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,840
I mean, I know about Costco $1.50 hot dogs.

847
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,840
And I know about Sheets $0.50 hot dogs.

848
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
Damn.

849
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
I think they're $0.50.

850
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,840
I've never been to a Sheets.

851
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,840
I just know that Michael from Repstugog

852
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,840
was a big Sheets hot dogs fan.

853
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,840
I think they were $0.50.

854
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
Like $2 for a dollar or something.

855
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Anyway, that's beside the point.

856
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,840
Okay, sausage sizzle.

857
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Very funny name for a very specific kind of barbecue.

858
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Yeah.

859
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Look, we didn't really...

860
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,840
You can't bring pork chops to a sausage sizzle.

861
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,840
Get that shit off the grill.

862
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,840
No, it's only sausages and nothing else.

863
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,840
Only sausages.

864
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,840
If it's not encasing...

865
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,840
I like the idea that somebody...

866
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,840
They have the covertly acquired pork chops or whatever,

867
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,840
and they throw them on the grill before anyone can see.

868
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
It's like, no!

869
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
No!

870
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,840
The pork is gonna ruin...

871
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,840
You don't have plates to eat it on.

872
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
You get the...

873
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
You have basically like a napkin,

874
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,840
and you get the bun with the sausage in it,

875
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
and you just carry the napkin around,

876
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,840
and then you dispose of the napkin when you're done,

877
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
or use it to wipe your face or whatever,

878
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,840
and there's no plates or anything.

879
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
It's very much like a portable thing

880
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,840
that you can just eat in public.

881
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,840
You don't have to sit down.

882
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
Yes, I know what a hot dog is.

883
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
I know.

884
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,840
But I see, the point is there's no plates.

885
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,840
We don't call it a barbecue because it's only sausages.

886
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,840
If you were gonna cook other stuff in the backyard,

887
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,840
you would call it a bobby.

888
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
In that instance, I guess.

889
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,840
Interesting.

890
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
I never heard of that.

891
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,840
But I mean, I get it.

892
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,840
I mean, I've been to a pig roast.

893
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840
As a kid, as a child,

894
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,840
at my karate dojo,

895
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
they had a pig roast one time.

896
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Wow.

897
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
Where they roast to the pig.

898
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
And the pig never forgave you.

899
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
I doubt it.

900
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
I doubt he would.

901
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Yeah.

902
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
That would be.

903
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
I mean, I'm getting hungry.

904
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
I'm getting hungry thinking about that.

905
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
That's no good.

906
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
It's no good.

907
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
That's no good.

908
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,840
You know what I could do?

909
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
This month, I could explore

910
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
my vampire characters that I made.

911
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,840
Did you see this tweet?

912
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,840
Oh, I did see the two vampires.

913
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,840
Yes.

914
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,840
Oh, there they are.

915
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Daki and Makalar.

916
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
What's going on with the mouse one?

917
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
The mouse one.

918
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Okay.

919
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,840
So you know how a vampire

920
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
turns into a bat?

921
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
Yeah.

922
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,840
She turns into a mouse instead.

923
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
You know?

924
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,840
And so she wants cheese.

925
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,840
I feel like

926
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,840
prior to the

927
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,840
pop culture codification

928
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,840
of what a vampire is

929
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
by like Dracula

930
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,840
media,

931
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
it wasn't like, oh, vampires turn into bats.

932
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
It was like

933
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,840
vampires can do all kinds of crazy things,

934
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,840
including turn into animals.

935
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,840
Yeah.

936
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,840
But then they just had this one famous vampire

937
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,840
that turned into a bat and then suddenly it was like, oh yeah,

938
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,840
vampires turn into bats.

939
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,840
What I wanted when I was coming up with it

940
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
was like, I wanted a vampire character,

941
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,840
but I wanted them to be like

942
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,840
not derivative of popular vampires

943
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,840
because vampires exist

944
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,840
in almost every

945
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,840
culture ever

946
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,840
because it's

947
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,840
quite often

948
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,840
misogynistic.

949
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,840
The ones that I got these ones from

950
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,840
were like Indian

951
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
and sort of Indonesian myths

952
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,840
where a vampire

953
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,840
is a,

954
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,840
I forget the name

955
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,840
that it was, but like

956
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,840
they seduce men

957
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,840
and they're born

958
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,840
when a woman

959
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,840
has an abortion.

960
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
When a woman dies giving birth

961
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,840
or when a woman has an abortion,

962
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
they come back as a vampire and they

963
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,840
steal the men away and they kill them

964
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,840
and they turn into beasts

965
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,840
and there's like things like that that are all like

966
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,840
women are scary.

967
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,840
True though.

968
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
Where's the lie?

969
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
So I thought I'd make like true to life

970
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,840
vampires.

971
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,840
Transform into a big old demon

972
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,840
and she will

973
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
eat blood and kill you. She's not a nice

974
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
vampire

975
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
and she has a little sister who is a very nice vampire.

976
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Cute.

977
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Are there names upon on Daki Makara?

978
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Yeah.

979
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Although Makalar

980
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
has like Kalari

981
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,840
which is a cheese.

982
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh, that's funny.

983
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,840
And Deki is like

984
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Dekini which is like

985
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,840
a demon of mythology.

986
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,840
So it sounds like Deki Makara

987
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
but it's actually two different references.

988
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,840
That's clever.

989
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Honestly, these designs are both

990
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
fucking fantastic.

991
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Thank you. I need to draw them more.

992
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,840
I need to draw them having Halloween

993
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,840
hijinks.

994
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,840
Does it make sense that you're brown?

995
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,840
Don't vampires spend a lot of time in the dark?

996
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,840
What do they need a melanin for?

997
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,840
Yeah.

998
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,840
What do they need it for? Just get rid of it.

999
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,840
It's just not historically accurate.

1000
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
It's just not historically accurate.

1001
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,840
You made these Indonesian vampires

1002
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,840
brown because

1003
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,840
I don't know. European?

1004
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,840
What about Europe?

1005
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
What about Europe?

1006
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,840
I don't know.

1007
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,840
I just am upset by the melanin.

1008
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,840
I'm angry and I don't know what to do about it.

1009
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,840
You know, if this one could be brown

1010
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,840
any woman could be brown.

1011
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,840
That's a scary thought. What if my lady

1012
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
was black?

1013
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,840
That would be really bad.

1014
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,840
True.

1015
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I was thinking the same thing.

1016
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,840
You said it better than I could have.

1017
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,840
Duh.

1018
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,840
Duh.

1019
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,840
Let's do a whole podcast we pretend to be racist.

1020
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,840
No.

1021
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,840
We already did. It's called the procrastinator's podcast.

1022
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
The procrastinator's podcast.

1023
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
Measuring Ben Skull before we crush her with a train.

1024
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,840
It's called

1025
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,840
the procrastinator's podcast

1026
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Season's 1 through 5.

1027
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Bonus episode.

1028
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,840
The racism episode where we do a whole character

1029
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
where it just says racist is possible.

1030
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
Right?

1031
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Money maker? Alright.

1032
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,840
Just throwing it out.

1033
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Upvote in the comments

1034
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
if you want to hear us be racist.

1035
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,840
If you want to hear us be racist

1036
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,840
and we'll pay to see it.

1037
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,840
I'll do anything for money.

1038
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,840
Um...

1039
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,840
Ah jeez.

1040
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,840
I can't blame us.

1041
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,840
Um...

1042
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,840
Well...

1043
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
Well...

1044
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
You know...

1045
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,840
That's it. That's it. That's all I got.

1046
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Crazy.

1047
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
I joined late so I don't know

1048
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
if this was a topic already.

1049
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,840
There was a...

1050
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,840
There was some funny

1051
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,840
conversation

1052
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,840
about a YouTuber called Boy in a Band.

1053
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
No, I know who that is.

1054
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
I've not heard anything about

1055
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
that current controversy.

1056
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
There's not a lot to say right now.

1057
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Um...

1058
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Hold on.

1059
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,840
You've probably seen what he looks like before

1060
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,840
if I get a picture. Oh, it's the guy with the red hair.

1061
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
The guy with the red hair.

1062
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,840
He's British but he didn't talk like that.

1063
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
I don't know. Some groomer or something.

1064
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Yeah, it's right.

1065
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
I mean, he's well groomed.

1066
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,840
Yeah.

1067
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
But don't stay in school guy.

1068
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,840
I liked this guy's videos for a long time

1069
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,840
until he just kind of like stopped

1070
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,840
making good videos and then kind of just fell off

1071
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
for a couple years and didn't upload but...

1072
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,840
Um...

1073
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,840
I've seen him before

1074
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
somewhere.

1075
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Yeah, he popped up on my feet

1076
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,840
again recently.

1077
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,840
He made a song with high dubs at one point.

1078
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,840
He made a song of PewDiePie and Jayden Animations

1079
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,840
and he's been around.

1080
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,840
Yeah, I vaguely remember that.

1081
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,840
I found Jayden porn in the wild.

1082
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,840
Like, organically.

1083
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Like, some just came

1084
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
across my

1085
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,840
screen all on its own

1086
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,840
and I was like, wow, okay.

1087
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,840
I can't believe it.

1088
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,840
Like, just now?

1089
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,840
I mean, I'd heard about it.

1090
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,840
I just, it had never...

1091
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,840
I'd never stumbled across it myself

1092
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,840
but I did the other day.

1093
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,840
It would be funny if a controversy was

1094
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,840
boy in a band secretly

1095
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,840
Jayden porn artists.

1096
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,840
That would have been...

1097
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,840
That would have been a fucking thing.

1098
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,840
But, uh...

1099
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,840
What I knew about this is

1100
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
I know one of his exes made a video about him

1101
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,840
like a year or two ago basically

1102
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,840
calling him a dick.

1103
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,840
Neglectful, whatever, sort of stuff.

1104
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,840
Like, not a good partner

1105
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,840
sort of things, you know, which is...

1106
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,840
Yeah.

1107
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,840
He does have red hair.

1108
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,840
That does mean that you're, like, your edgy

1109
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,840
dangerous hair in promos.

1110
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
The new...

1111
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,840
The new allegations are that

1112
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,840
there's sort of, like, sex culty.

1113
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,840
Like, he supposedly has

1114
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,840
like a harem of, like, five to six girls

1115
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,840
at a time who are mostly young,

1116
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
some...

1117
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
possibly, like, 17

1118
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,840
or something. Well, he's, like,

1119
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,840
in his 30s.

1120
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,840
And that he's, like, super, like, controlling, manipulative

1121
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,840
versus woman-to-be polyamorous when they don't want to

1122
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,840
or something. The only

1123
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,840
issue I have right now is there isn't

1124
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,840
any evidence at all, but, like,

1125
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,840
maybe that will come out, so I'm just going to wait and see.

1126
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,840
Oh, if there's no evidence.

1127
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,840
I mean, well...

1128
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,840
There's no smoke without fire, but

1129
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,840
you can light your own fire.

1130
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,840
From what I've seen, it's mostly just

1131
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,840
from one reddit post, and it's very well written.

1132
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,840
Like, I'm inclined to, you know,

1133
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,840
it seems very sincere. I don't...

1134
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,840
It doesn't, like, seem at all, like, you know,

1135
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,840
I don't get up or anything.

1136
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,840
But their Imgur album

1137
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,840
is just a bunch of, like, text messages

1138
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,840
between two anonymous people

1139
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,840
who aren't this guy, and they're just, like,

1140
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,840
messages, like, oh, do you remember

1141
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
when he said this? Yeah. Oh, do you remember

1142
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,840
when his penis was small? Yeah. Do you remember

1143
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,840
when he couldn't get an erection? Yeah.

1144
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
Do you remember when he was dumb, and it's, like...

1145
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,840
That doesn't prove

1146
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,840
much, but maybe more people

1147
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,840
come out, so we'll see.

1148
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,840
The main thing I remember, like,

1149
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,840
I've learned from the whole pro-charity

1150
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
thing, is that

1151
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,840
you can have, like, some weird

1152
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,840
shit going on, and

1153
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,840
people will, like, expose

1154
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,840
that. But they will

1155
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,840
add their own stuff

1156
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
out of nowhere, and make it

1157
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,840
so much worse than it actually is.

1158
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1159
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,840
So, like, I'm not inclined to agree with

1160
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,840
this reddit post immediately. I mean,

1161
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
not immediately. Could have some truth to it.

1162
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Yeah, like, there is some truth.

1163
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,840
One of his

1164
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,840
girlfriends, he dated, like, 10 years

1165
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,840
ago, or over 10 years ago at this

1166
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,840
point, maybe, was 17

1167
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,840
while he was, like,

1168
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,840
20... I don't know if he was, like, 23

1169
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,840
or 25. It was in that range.

1170
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,840
Which is... Is that in the UK? It's a bit

1171
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,840
creepy, but it is the UK. It's not

1172
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,840
illegal. Yeah. It's not illegal.

1173
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,840
It's a bit creepy, especially, like...

1174
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,840
But also, that was, like, a while back

1175
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,840
there was less... I feel like there was

1176
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,840
less awareness about...

1177
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,840
Or maybe less consciousness about how creepy

1178
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
that kind of thing was back then.

1179
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,840
But, like, I don't know, like,

1180
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,840
sure, like, he did that. That's a little...

1181
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,840
That's kind of weird. That's kind of sussy.

1182
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,840
But, like, that's not a smoking gun to all

1183
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,840
the new allegations, right?

1184
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
I mean, it may be sussy.

1185
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,840
I mean, the new allegations are

1186
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,840
that he's a controlling

1187
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,840
polyamorous

1188
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,840
boyfriend? That he has...

1189
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,840
That he, like, prays on, like, young

1190
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,840
women and uses his fame and money to, like,

1191
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,840
use his fame into being with him, and then he treats

1192
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,840
him like crap and kicks him out if they ever

1193
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,840
cross him. That's what they're saying now.

1194
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,840
Which, oof, is true.

1195
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,840
I mean, of course he does.

1196
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,840
Obviously he does.

1197
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Everyone famous does that.

1198
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,840
I wouldn't be... I wouldn't be...

1199
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,840
I wouldn't be shocked.

1200
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,840
That's just what I expect from anyone who's

1201
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,840
famous on YouTube or probably anywhere.

1202
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,840
Yeah. Like, I think...

1203
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,840
I mean, what's... I don't get it. I don't get...

1204
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,840
I don't even get why it's a story.

1205
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,840
Yeah. To be honest.

1206
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,840
It's probably true.

1207
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,840
But I don't fucking grab my pitchfork yet.

1208
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,840
I don't care enough.

1209
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,840
And some more concrete stuff comes out.

1210
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,840
I mean...

1211
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,840
I don't know. I mean,

1212
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,840
the story would be

1213
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,840
oh, he's doing stuff with minors.

1214
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,840
Right?

1215
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
He's doing illegal stuff

1216
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,840
with people who are too young

1217
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
to consent legally or

1218
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
ethically. Right?

1219
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
That's the...

1220
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,840
That's the smoking gun.

1221
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,840
Anything short of that

1222
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
is like...

1223
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Oh, he's a bad boyfriend?

1224
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,840
Oh, he's using his fame to manipulate women?

1225
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Well, I mean...

1226
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,840
Yeah.

1227
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
I mean, okay.

1228
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
I guess I didn't know this guy.

1229
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,840
So, yeah, I didn't know this guy at all.

1230
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,840
So, it doesn't matter to me whether he's a dickhead or not.

1231
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,840
I assume everyone who's famous

1232
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
is a dickhead.

1233
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,840
Assumption. Very good assumption, to be honest.

1234
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,840
Yeah.

1235
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
I mean, this guy stumbled across my feet

1236
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,840
and that was my baseline assumption.

1237
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,840
Alright, who's this dickhead?

1238
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,840
Oh, he's a cult leader?

1239
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Oh, okay.

1240
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
Does he make them

1241
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,840
have hair like his?

1242
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
That'd be...

1243
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,840
That'd be kind of funny, actually.

1244
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,840
He's got nice hair.

1245
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
He's got a nice head of hair on him.

1246
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
You know, you gotta respect

1247
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,840
a nice head of hair.

1248
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,840
You know what? I take it all back. I love this guy.

1249
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,840
Absolved.

1250
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Absolved.

1251
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
Nice hair.

1252
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Yeah.

1253
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,840
How many sex crimes

1254
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,840
is having nice hair worth?

1255
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
How many can you get away with because of that?

1256
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,840
Two?

1257
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Like one per follicle.

1258
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
As many as there are stars in the sky.

1259
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,840
Yeah.

1260
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Yeah, I'd never...

1261
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,840
What does this guy do? Is he a musician?

1262
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,840
He was like...

1263
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
He would like do like

1264
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,840
funny like...

1265
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,840
He's like, hey, I'm gonna make a

1266
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,840
rap song about this topic

1267
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,840
and I'm gonna do it really fast.

1268
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,840
He would collab with people like Andrew Huang

1269
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,840
or Rob Scallon

1270
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,840
or people who did rap and metal stuff.

1271
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,840
Usually just kind of like

1272
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,840
here's a funny idea for a song

1273
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
that has this restriction

1274
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
and I'll just make it.

1275
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,840
It's also known as having

1276
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
not enough fame

1277
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
as a musician to get by

1278
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
so I go to YouTube.

1279
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Yeah, and he started like doing videos

1280
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,840
like...

1281
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
Like, hey, here's the man...

1282
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
Oh my god, he had one video called

1283
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,840
the man who would save in the world

1284
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,840
and you've never heard of him.

1285
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
And did you know there's this guy who's like

1286
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,840
a real life Iron Man who

1287
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
created PayPal and builds rockets?

1288
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,840
Oh yeah, his name's Elon Musk.

1289
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,840
No! No! No!

1290
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,840
I mean,

1291
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
how long ago was that?

1292
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,840
It was 2015, to be fair,

1293
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,840
like...

1294
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,840
How many people knew about it back then

1295
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,840
or knew about how full of shit he was?

1296
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
So...

1297
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,840
I couldn't have told you

1298
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,840
that Elon was cringe

1299
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,840
back in 2015 so I can't...

1300
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,840
It's funny but I can't really judge.

1301
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,840
I mean, I didn't know Elon was cringe until

1302
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,840
around like 2018, to be fair.

1303
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,840
Even then, I was late to the party.

1304
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,840
Yeah, it's

1305
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,840
just because it's only in recent years

1306
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
that like...

1307
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,840
His

1308
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
bullshit, all his like hyper-loop

1309
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
all his hyper-loop bullshit

1310
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,840
and so on and so forth.

1311
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
Alright, I mean, yeah, okay.

1312
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
Pretty cringe video, bro, but like...

1313
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,840
Was that around the time?

1314
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,840
Okay, was that before or after

1315
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,840
he went on The Simpsons and Lisa said

1316
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
he's the most important inventor of our time?

1317
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,840
I have no idea.

1318
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,840
So this was like January 2015,

1319
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,840
so...

1320
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
Coming up on...

1321
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,840
You know what? Okay, this actually really blows.

1322
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Even if it is before.

1323
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
People knew as well.

1324
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,840
This sucks.

1325
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
Well, I watched this video in 2015

1326
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,840
and I'm like, I've never heard of this guy

1327
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,840
but wow, he is cool because I just, you know,

1328
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,840
I just assume that a YouTuber

1329
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,840
I like wouldn't like put a bunch of

1330
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,840
information in their video.

1331
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
Right.

1332
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
Never trust anyone,

1333
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,840
especially yourself.

1334
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Uh...

1335
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Oh my god, I don't trust myself.

1336
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
All the comments are like...

1337
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Yeah, this didn't age well.

1338
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,840
Yeah.

1339
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,840
Uh...

1340
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,840
It really, like...

1341
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,840
Even if it's like...

1342
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Oh, this guy's really cool.

1343
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,840
Saying the guy who is saving the world is a bit like...

1344
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,840
It sounds like you're already buying

1345
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,840
into the Kool-Aid, the hype.

1346
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Like...

1347
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
It doesn't sound like...

1348
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,840
If somebody was inventing something amazing

1349
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
or was doing something really good,

1350
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,840
you would be able to point to

1351
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,840
more specific things

1352
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,840
than...

1353
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,840
He's saving the world. It seems a little...

1354
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,840
A little over-bloated.

1355
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Damn, this guy's got 3 million subs.

1356
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,840
This is a big channel.

1357
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Yeah.

1358
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,840
It's sort of like maybe a tell-tale sign

1359
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,840
that there isn't actually much there.

1360
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,840
If like...

1361
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,840
You're blowing his ego so big.

1362
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,840
Oh wait, I just remembered.

1363
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,840
There is one other cringe thing that he did.

1364
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,840
He made like...

1365
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,840
You probably see this a lot on YouTube these days

1366
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,840
where people you're subscribed to

1367
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,840
will put up community posts

1368
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,840
with polls that you can vote on.

1369
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,840
Yeah.

1370
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
I don't really look at them, but yeah.

1371
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,840
There's a lot on this.

1372
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,840
So like, he put up a poll

1373
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,840
that was like...

1374
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,840
Asking his fans,

1375
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,840
hey guys, so I got to describe these antidepressants

1376
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,840
and, you know, I took like one

1377
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,840
pill and it didn't work.

1378
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,840
Should I chug the entire bottle?

1379
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,840
You know, I feel like

1380
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,840
that would be good for me, you guys.

1381
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,840
You know, maybe it would help me, haha.

1382
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,840
And then the results were,

1383
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,840
yeah man, chug the whole bottle, do it.

1384
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,840
No, David.

1385
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,840
That is not a good idea, follow the instructions.

1386
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,840
And it was like...

1387
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
He's asking his fans

1388
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,840
if he should fucking overdose.

1389
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,840
Yeah.

1390
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,840
Did he do it?

1391
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,840
No, he didn't do it.

1392
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,840
But like, he kind of like

1393
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,840
romanticizes like depression

1394
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,840
and suicidality.

1395
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,840
It's like his quirky personality.

1396
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,840
He does look like the type.

1397
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,840
Yeah, it is very cringy.

1398
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,840
I see.

1399
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,840
I see.

1400
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,840
This...

1401
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,840
Oh fuck, I just...

1402
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,840
I remembered because it's in the

1403
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,840
recommendations of this video.

1404
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,840
Either you two watch Action Button,

1405
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,840
either you two keep up with that.

1406
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,840
There's a new Action Button this week.

1407
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,840
No, what's Action Button?

1408
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,840
It's the Tim Rogers

1409
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,840
YouTube review, yeah.

1410
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,840
He did a...

1411
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,840
It's a six hour long video about

1412
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,840
Yasumi.

1413
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,840
Which is a game that I had seen,

1414
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,840
but I couldn't have told you the name of.

1415
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,840
That's the one where you play as a kid

1416
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,840
on summer vacation and you catch bugs.

1417
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,840
Ah, Boku no Piku.

1418
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,840
No, no, no.

1419
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,840
No, Boku no Piku.

1420
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,840
It's about being a kid on summer break

1421
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
and you catch bugs and you live

1422
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,840
with your aunt and uncle.

1423
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,840
And that's the game.

1424
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
Whatever, it's a pretty good video.

1425
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,840
Although, a lot of the video

1426
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,840
is going on a little road trip

1427
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,840
and showing footage of his

1428
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,840
like, hey, this is my house

1429
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
that I grew up in.

1430
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,840
This is my town that I grew up in.

1431
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,840
Every time people talk about Tim

1432
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
Rogers, they mention

1433
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
that he goes on about himself a lot.

1434
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
Does that add to the video

1435
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,840
or is it just interesting because

1436
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,840
you want to know about Tim?

1437
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,840
I'll be honest.

1438
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
It's butting up against the line of

1439
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,840
aren't we talking a little bit too much

1440
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,840
about yourself?

1441
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
He's always riding that line.

1442
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,840
He's a good presenter.

1443
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,840
He's a good orator.

1444
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
He's hearing him speak is entertaining.

1445
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,840
Sometimes I am

1446
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
find myself thinking, do we need to know

1447
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,840
do we need to see all of this

1448
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,840
vacation footage? Do we need to know

1449
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
like all these anecdotes

1450
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
about growing up in

1451
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Indiana?

1452
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,840
This guy looks really funny.

1453
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
Tim Rogers?

1454
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
He's

1455
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,840
debuted on

1456
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
YouTube like last year.

1457
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
Is this him?

1458
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,840
What the fuck?

1459
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,840
He was there.

1460
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,840
Is that the Revolutionary War?

1461
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,840
He grew up and trained the Revolutionary War.

1462
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,840
He's been around a long time.

1463
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,840
I mean, he's like

1464
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,840
40, so yeah.

1465
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,840
That makes sense. That adds up.

1466
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,840
Yeah.

1467
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,840
The math checks out.

1468
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,840
New video

1469
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,840
was pretty good.

1470
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,840
He sort of had the breakout hit

1471
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,840
with the review of

1472
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,840
what was that dating sim?

1473
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,840
The PCB dating sim.

1474
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,840
Not unfortunately.

1475
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,840
No.

1476
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,840
The seven hour video

1477
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,840
about

1478
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,840
Tokimeki Memorial

1479
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
and this one feels a lot like that

1480
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,840
because it's another like

1481
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,840
Tim Opines on what a game

1482
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,840
means for like Japanese

1483
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
a moment in Japanese

1484
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,840
cultural history or

1485
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,840
whatever and it's very much like

1486
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,840
the game is contemplative

1487
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,840
and not your typical

1488
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,840
gaming fare so

1489
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,840
a lot of

1490
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,840
introspection.

1491
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,840
A lot of like, hey look at this

1492
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
video I took on vacation though.

1493
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,840
Maybe a little too much this time.

1494
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,840
I think he crossed the line a little bit.

1495
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
But it's okay.

1496
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,840
I forgive him.

1497
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
And now you know.

1498
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,840
I don't forgive him.

1499
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,840
Okay.

1500
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,840
I'm good.

1501
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,840
I mean, he doesn't deserve forgiveness.

1502
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,840
Okay, well.

1503
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,840
There'll be just a sec. I need to pee.

1504
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Okay.

1505
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,840
Well, that's my week in

1506
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,840
YouTube news.

1507
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,840
The new action button is

1508
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
always an event.

1509
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,840
The last action button was

1510
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,840
Cyberpunk 2077

1511
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,840
and that was like

1512
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,840
late last year.

1513
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,840
So it's been like the better part of a year

1514
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
for this video to come out.

1515
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
Feels like only

1516
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,840
yesterday.

1517
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,840
It cannot believe it's been that long.

1518
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,840
But oh well. What are you going to do?

1519
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,840
What am I going to do?

1520
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,840
What are you going to do?

1521
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,840
I'm going to scream and cry, okay?

1522
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
Go for it. Yeah.

1523
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
All right.

1524
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,840
All right.

1525
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,840
Shit.

1526
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,840
Well.

1527
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,840
I was out of stuff to say.

1528
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,840
I was going to, you know.

1529
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
I don't know.

1530
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,840
I was going to relate like a

1531
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,840
story of some shit that

1532
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,840
happened kind of in my real life.

1533
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,840
But it's a bit like

1534
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,840
dour and a bit like

1535
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,840
upsetting, honestly.

1536
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,840
I have a little bit, it's like

1537
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,840
should I even talk about it in public?

1538
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
It's kind of a thing.

1539
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
I don't know.

1540
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,840
Yeah.

1541
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,840
I guess I can sort of relate.

1542
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Hey, hey, Gabe.

1543
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
Should I relate my

1544
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
kind of like upsetting and unsettling

1545
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,840
real life anecdote?

1546
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,840
Oh hell yeah.

1547
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,840
All right.

1548
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,840
All right.

1549
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,840
It's kind of blows. It sucks.

1550
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,840
It ruined my week.

1551
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,840
It blows and sucks. The full package.

1552
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,840
Yeah. You wouldn't think you could do both of those.

1553
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,840
Well, I don't know.

1554
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,840
There's, you know, I just moved into this new house

1555
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,840
when there's a bunch of other people

1556
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,840
that live here.

1557
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,840
And I sort of don't see them too much

1558
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,840
of them. So like,

1559
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,840
I've had a couple moments where it's like, oh, it's this person

1560
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,840
who lives here that I haven't met yet.

1561
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Well, let me introduce myself to them.

1562
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
Well, I don't know.

1563
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,840
I had a...

1564
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,840
There's a girl that lives here.

1565
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
And I kind of had the first like, oh hello,

1566
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,840
it's nice to meet you.

1567
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,840
With her.

1568
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,840
And I don't know.

1569
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,840
I won't go into too much detail about it, but there was a...

1570
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
I don't know.

1571
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
She made a kind of upsetting

1572
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,840
statement.

1573
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,840
She sort of claimed that like

1574
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,840
another guy that lives there is like

1575
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,840
violent.

1576
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,840
And she was like, oh,

1577
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,840
that's bad.

1578
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
Lives with her?

1579
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Yeah, that's what she said.

1580
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
She threw it out really casually.

1581
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
Like, oh yeah,

1582
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
this other guy, what the phrase she used

1583
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
was he has a quote unquote tendency toward

1584
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,840
violence.

1585
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840
And I said, that sounds bad.

1586
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
And she was like, yeah, but it's only with me.

1587
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,840
That's only really with me though.

1588
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
What?

1589
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,840
Oh.

1590
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,840
It doesn't sound like a joke.

1591
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
It doesn't sound like a jokie phrase.

1592
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
It wasn't a...

1593
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
No, it wasn't a jokie phrase.

1594
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
Good thing she can't...

1595
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
Good thing they can't see your giant hit spinner

1596
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,840
or else you'd be in danger too.

1597
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,840
I don't know.

1598
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
I'll be honest.

1599
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,840
I didn't know if I should believe her

1600
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,840
or if she was like...

1601
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,840
Or if she was just making it up.

1602
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,840
I'll be honest.

1603
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,840
Part of me was like, am I being tricked?

1604
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
Is this some sort of weird

1605
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
like

1606
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,840
power play?

1607
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
Some kind of weird social engineering

1608
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,840
like trick that

1609
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
is being played upon me?

1610
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
Would it be more likely that she just doesn't

1611
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
have anyone to confide in

1612
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,840
about that?

1613
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
I mean, I don't know.

1614
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
She was like, you can't tell him if he is violent.

1615
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,840
He's just gonna be violent.

1616
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,840
I don't know. There's like five people that live here.

1617
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,840
Me

1618
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,840
and one other guy are new.

1619
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
I'll be honest. I related this story

1620
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,840
the other day

1621
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,840
at Kazi's birthday

1622
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,840
and everyone was horrified with me.

1623
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,840
Everyone was disgusted with me

1624
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,840
because I did not believe women.

1625
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,840
Because I was...

1626
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,840
Yeah.

1627
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,840
So I probably shouldn't have even brought it up.

1628
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,840
I don't know.

1629
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,840
It was just, I don't know.

1630
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
Maybe I was too quick to judge.

1631
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
Just the way that she so

1632
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,840
casually said it

1633
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,840
and then just immediately moved on from it

1634
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,840
and did not give any additional details

1635
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
just made me like

1636
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,840
I don't know.

1637
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
It just seemed really strange.

1638
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,840
What would the trick be

1639
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
if she were tricking you?

1640
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,840
Like it was a...

1641
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,840
I guess the idea would be that it was an attempt

1642
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
to turn me against this guy

1643
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,840
for whatever.

1644
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,840
For some reason.

1645
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,840
And I don't know what the reason would be.

1646
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,840
I feel like it's easier to believe

1647
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,840
that some guys are just

1648
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,840
dickish and violent in general

1649
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,840
and

1650
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,840
super like next level mind games.

1651
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,840
Because I've met a lot of

1652
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,840
dudes who are just

1653
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,840
violent dickheads.

1654
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
That's pretty common.

1655
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
Yeah.

1656
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,840
But I mean

1657
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
she didn't elaborate

1658
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
or say what happened

1659
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,840
or if anything happened.

1660
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
I just don't know.

1661
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
I feel like

1662
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,840
she was a random

1663
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,840
basically a stranger.

1664
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
Hmm.

1665
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,840
Okay.

1666
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
Yeah, but

1667
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,840
I don't know what to do with this information.

1668
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
It's obvious Ben.

1669
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
You have to be a hero.

1670
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
You have to get your claymore and you have to go slay the dragon.

1671
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
And go kill him.

1672
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,840
Don't even ask one question.

1673
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,840
Don't even learn who he is.

1674
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Just go on a rampage.

1675
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Yeah, just right in Hath, you know.

1676
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,840
Hmm.

1677
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
Oh well, I guess I'll go do that.

1678
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
Well, all right, I'll see you next episode.

1679
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
I'm going to go catch a case.

1680
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
I'm going to go commit violence.

1681
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,840
But righteous violence.

1682
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,840
Yeah, I don't know.

1683
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,840
This is completely ruined my week.

1684
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
This is like so upsetting.

1685
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,840
Yeah, sounds pretty weird

1686
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
to happen.

1687
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,840
Yeah, I was

1688
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
I was very dismayed

1689
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
with the reaction that I got

1690
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,840
from

1691
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
Kazi and everyone

1692
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,840
when I talked about it.

1693
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,840
I felt like a real dick.

1694
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
But I

1695
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,840
really don't know what to do.

1696
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,840
So that's me right now.

1697
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
That's where I'm at.

1698
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,840
It's bugging me.

1699
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
Do you feel like

1700
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,840
it would be better or worse

1701
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,840
if you tried to follow up on it?

1702
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,840
If you tried to ask her

1703
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,840
what she meant

1704
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
or even talk to the guy?

1705
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
I don't know.

1706
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
I mean, if it's true,

1707
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,840
if it's true

1708
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
and I tell the guy

1709
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,840
that she said that,

1710
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,840
that seems like it would be bad

1711
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
and it would make him angry.

1712
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,840
Not to tell the guy

1713
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,840
the truth.

1714
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,840
Just to talk to him to see what he's like.

1715
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,840
I mean, I have talked to him

1716
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,840
a little bit a couple of times

1717
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
and he seems fine.

1718
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,840
He could be a monster in secret.

1719
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
I don't know.

1720
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,840
I don't know this guy well.

1721
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,840
I've only met him

1722
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
a few times

1723
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
and I've just moved into

1724
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
a house with him.

1725
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,840
I can't really say

1726
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,840
anything about him personally.

1727
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,840
I haven't noticed anything myself.

1728
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,840
I mean, here's the thing.

1729
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,840
When I was talking to her,

1730
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,840
the first thing she said to me

1731
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,840
was she wanted to talk about

1732
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
utility bills

1733
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,840
and she asked me

1734
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,840
if I would take over responsibility

1735
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,840
of putting

1736
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
the bills in my name

1737
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,840
and I didn't want to do that.

1738
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,840
And then when I said

1739
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
I said I would ask this other guy

1740
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,840
about it and she said

1741
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,840
he has a tendency

1742
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
towards violence

1743
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,840
and so

1744
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,840
I was like

1745
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,840
hmm

1746
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,840
what is

1747
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
Is this a persuasion?

1748
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,840
I don't know

1749
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,840
this is why I was like

1750
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,840
didn't know what she was doing.

1751
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,840
I mean

1752
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,840
I thought that my roommate Sean

1753
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,840
had a persuasion toward violence

1754
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,840
but that was in the form of when he talks

1755
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,840
about hand gestures and I flinched

1756
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,840
and that's it.

1757
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,840
So

1758
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,840
yeah

1759
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,840
I mean maybe

1760
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,840
it's

1761
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
like did she like come out and say

1762
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,840
I've been abused or just of this guy

1763
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,840
like

1764
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
the only thing she said is he has a

1765
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
quote unquote tendency toward violence

1766
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,840
which could mean

1767
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,840
a lot of things.

1768
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,840
There's a wide range of interpretations

1769
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,840
right.

1770
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,840
I wouldn't worry too much for now

1771
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,840
just keep it on

1772
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
just in case.

1773
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,840
I guess what else can I do

1774
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,840
yeah

1775
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,840
I

1776
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
I don't know I've had people tell

1777
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,840
me stuff

1778
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,840
in the past

1779
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,840
like that very like

1780
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,840
sort of emotionally charged

1781
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,840
things like that and it has been

1782
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,840
manipulation

1783
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,840
it makes me wary

1784
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,840
the lack of details

1785
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
I don't know it just

1786
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,840
it gave me a weird feeling

1787
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,840
like it was a trick

1788
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
but

1789
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,840
maybe my instincts are wrong and bad

1790
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
possibly

1791
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,840
I couldn't possibly say having not

1792
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
been there

1793
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
true

1794
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
well sorry to be a downer

1795
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,840
I know this sucks I feel terrible

1796
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
about it.

1797
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
If it's given you a grief

1798
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,840
do you think

1799
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,840
you need to do something to stop

1800
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,840
that or

1801
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,840
I just don't know what I could do

1802
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,840
or if anything would be appropriate

1803
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,840
to do

1804
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,840
yeah it's tricky

1805
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,840
my first thought is like Oscar

1806
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,840
to elaborate

1807
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,840
but then I wouldn't expect her to

1808
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,840
to elaborate you might get more

1809
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,840
questions

1810
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
I mean if I had been

1811
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
in that original conversation

1812
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,840
they were like oh they have a tendency to

1813
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,840
be like whoa

1814
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,840
like how come

1815
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
should I be worried?

1816
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
I'd definitely ask fellow questions immediately

1817
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
but I think the moment's passed

1818
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,840
yeah maybe I should have jumped on it

1819
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,840
and like please explain

1820
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
but I kind of she kind of moved on

1821
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,840
from it and so I kind of just was like

1822
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
okay

1823
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,840
yeah maybe I should have asked to follow them

1824
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,840
I mean you probably sort of like you know the other day when you said this

1825
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
like what did you mean exactly

1826
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,840
should I be scared you know

1827
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,840
you know maybe

1828
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,840
she's not around very often

1829
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,840
like this was the first time

1830
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,840
I've seen her I've only seen her twice

1831
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,840
in the whole month that I've lived here

1832
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,840
like she's mostly out of the house

1833
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,840
most of the time

1834
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,840
so I don't know when I'll get

1835
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,840
another chance to do that but like eventually

1836
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
I surely will

1837
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,840
so yeah maybe that should be the plan

1838
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,840
okay that's the plan

1839
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,840
alright game plan

1840
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,840
got it

1841
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
alright

1842
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,840
ah yes

1843
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,840
sorry about that sorry about that it's bummer

1844
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,840
lame

1845
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,840
it's a real life moment

1846
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,840
okay yeah unfortunately

1847
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
well I don't have anything else to talk about

1848
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,840
that's all that's all I got

1849
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,840
I swear there's something

1850
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,840
I have on my brain

1851
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
but my brain is like dead

1852
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,840
dude

1853
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,840
I don't remember anything

1854
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
oh you know what I could talk about this

1855
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,840
I'm not gonna do it just because like

1856
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,840
daily arts challenges in October

1857
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,840
is

1858
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,840
something that literally everybody does now

1859
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,840
and it's so many

1860
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
that I feel like I would be

1861
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,840
too normie to do it myself

1862
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
but I did have a cool idea

1863
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,840
which I kind of started

1864
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,840
one year and I didn't

1865
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
do anything is

1866
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,840
October

1867
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,840
we draw dicks every day

1868
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,840
that's a good one

1869
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,840
I think I will draw like maybe

1870
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
where is she going with this

1871
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
I'm going right to the groin

1872
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,840
that's where I'm going

1873
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,840
drawing dicks

1874
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,840
for one

1875
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,840
for anatomy

1876
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,840
practice and also ha ha penis

1877
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,840
it's true

1878
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,840
and also it's better fit

1879
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,840
than like inktober

1880
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
coctober sounds like october

1881
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
it's just got to cut the front of it

1882
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,840
that's what we should have all been doing from the start

1883
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
I'm sorry

1884
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,840
we moved on already but I just remembered something

1885
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
I just remembered something about

1886
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,840
that's the situation

1887
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
I was asking another guy

1888
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,840
because I said there's two guys that live here

1889
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
me and another guy are both new

1890
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,840
and I asked the other guy

1891
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,840
not about what she said about this other guy

1892
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,840
but I asked him about

1893
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
the utility bill

1894
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,840
I said something about like oh yeah she said

1895
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
something about like someone else

1896
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,840
was like

1897
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,840
late on payment or something she said

1898
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,840
because she said that the guy that she said

1899
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,840
has a tendency toward violence

1900
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,840
he had like not paid his bill

1901
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,840
or something and this was why she wanted

1902
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,840
me to take over responsibility

1903
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,840
for like

1904
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
taking the bills in my name

1905
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,840
because this guy

1906
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,840
had not paid his bills and I mentioned

1907
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,840
this to this other guy

1908
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,840
and I just said yeah she said that that other guy

1909
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,840
didn't pay his bills and this guy's

1910
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
immediate reaction to that was he shook his head

1911
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,840
and he said like don't believe her

1912
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,840
like I don't believe her

1913
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
and I was like okay

1914
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,840
I also think she's a tricky

1915
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
I don't know why

1916
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,840
I didn't follow up on it with him

1917
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
I don't know

1918
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,840
I don't know

1919
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,840
the whole thing gives me a really bad

1920
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,840
feeling

1921
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
yeah

1922
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
you know understandable

1923
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
what if this is a woman moment we don't want that

1924
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,840
we wouldn't

1925
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,840
we truly would not want that

1926
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
I don't know

1927
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,840
back to

1928
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,840
October

1929
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,840
sorry never mind

1930
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,840
I want to do Cocktober I'd love to draw a dick

1931
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,840
every day I have so many characters

1932
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,840
with dicks so many other cool characters

1933
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,840
I can give dicks

1934
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,840
yeah it's like the perfect crime

1935
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
except it's not a crime

1936
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,840
you're allowed

1937
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
everyone's allowed to draw a dick

1938
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,840
it's a crime except you're allowed to do it

1939
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
what if it was legal

1940
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
what if crime was legal

1941
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,840
that's like that's Cocktober

1942
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,840
yeah drawing one thing every day

1943
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
just doesn't work out

1944
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,840
it seems so

1945
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,840
as simple because how long does the drawing take

1946
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,840
like five minutes

1947
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,840
but you're always gonna I mean I

1948
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,840
personally I'm always gonna want

1949
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,840
it to be decent like presentable

1950
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,840
of an image

1951
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,840
so I don't want to skimp it on it

1952
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,840
I don't want to have it be

1953
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,840
a shit drawing but sometimes

1954
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,840
I just don't have the time

1955
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,840
I don't get around to it until 11 o'clock

1956
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,840
and I'm like well

1957
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,840
I'm sleepy

1958
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,840
I gotta do something and then I do something that sucks

1959
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,840
and I'm like fuck

1960
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
shit

1961
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,840
and it just makes me feel bad for the next day

1962
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
or I'm like I gotta make up for yesterday

1963
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
by making a better drawing and it just doesn't work

1964
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,840
it's hard to do

1965
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,840
like the it's so easy to draw

1966
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,840
but so hard to draw for a month straight

1967
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,840
yeah

1968
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,840
I've never

1969
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,840
I've never done ink tober

1970
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,840
when I've sort of done it

1971
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
I've only done maybe like four or five

1972
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
drawings and then

1973
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,840
no more

1974
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
I will draw like

1975
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,840
yeah I'm not gonna

1976
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,840
do the whole month

1977
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
but I will draw a few

1978
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,840
don't know how many maybe even just two of them

1979
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,840
maybe even just one

1980
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,840
but that's gonna be my cock tober

1981
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
you can find it on

1982
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,840
at biggirlsquish on twitter

1983
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,840
just one drawing

1984
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
yeah

1985
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,840
like unironically

1986
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,840
it doesn't need to be a whole big thing

1987
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
I don't want it to be for me

1988
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
it could even just be like one big canvas

1989
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,840
that throughout the month

1990
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,840
doesn't have to be every day you just draw

1991
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,840
cocks some days you draw a few cocks some days you draw none

1992
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
and then you post the whole canvas

1993
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,840
this whole canvas all October

1994
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,840
that could even be another approach

1995
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,840
and then you draw like a character

1996
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,840
looking at them all being like

1997
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,840
which one do I take

1998
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,840
which one do I choose

1999
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
how many do I have enough holes

2000
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,840
oh shit gotta make some new ones

2001
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,840
oh god what does that mean

2002
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,840
I don't know

2003
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
just cut yourself

2004
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
hopefully not

2005
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,840
shoot yourself

2006
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
just grow extra titties

2007
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,840
you know

2008
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,840
oh that's what it means

2009
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,840
oh

2010
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,840
yeah

2011
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,840
I've seen the porn

2012
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,840
I know how this works

2013
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
I haven't

2014
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
well it seems Ben

2015
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,840
when a mother and father love each other very much

2016
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,840
they sometimes draw pornography

2017
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,840
um

2018
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,840
you mean

2019
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,840
you mean that when two parents

2020
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,840
of any gender

2021
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,840
in this

2022
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,840
under these woke skies that we live under

2023
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,840
woke skies

2024
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,840
anyone can be a mother or father

2025
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,840
these are just terms

2026
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,840
terms

2027
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,840
it's all just words

2028
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,840
at the end of the day

2029
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,840
like you can have like a gay couple

2030
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
where one is considered the mother and the other the father

2031
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,840
I think that's

2032
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,840
that's allowed

2033
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,840
linguistically technically

2034
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,840
yeah

2035
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
under international law

2036
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,840
and if you're a non binary you can say parent

2037
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,840
you've got the whole gang

2038
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
just wanted to be inclusive

2039
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,840
just wanted to be inclusive

2040
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
good

2041
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,840
when parents love each other very very much

2042
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
they draw porn on you

2043
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,840
understood

2044
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,840
I do like mother and father though

2045
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,840
because mommy and daddy are funny words

2046
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,840
yeah

2047
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,840
is there like a baby version of parent

2048
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
I don't think so

2049
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
baby version

2050
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,840
what would a baby call their like non binary parent

2051
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,840
they can't say mama

2052
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
they can't say dad dad what do they do

2053
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
cancel the baby

2054
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
we've got to find a way for the future generations

2055
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,840
to not get cancelled immediately

2056
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,840
I know

2057
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,840
these bubbies are

2058
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,840
going to have a bad time

2059
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,840
I think maybe

2060
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,840
we should just make mommy the gender neutral term

2061
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,840
that everyone uses

2062
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,840
I know why you want that

2063
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,840
I want mommy I need milk I need to be held

2064
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,840
yeah

2065
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,840
don't they just kind of don't babies just kind of

2066
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,840
say like mama

2067
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
or do they say mama because like they

2068
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,840
someone teaches them to

2069
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,840
they get taught in other languages they say other things

2070
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,840
they do say other things

2071
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
I think it's just

2072
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,840
it's simplified in that way because babies

2073
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,840
can make vowels

2074
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,840
and then interrupt those vowels

2075
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,840
and it sometimes sounds like mama

2076
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,840
dad dad go ba ba ba ba

2077
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,840
yeah I feel like I feel like the M sound

2078
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
is probably one of the easiest noises for a

2079
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
stupid fucking baby

2080
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
to make to go

2081
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,840
I mean who doesn't have to call

2082
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,840
them anything

2083
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,840
he doesn't have to say anything he can just

2084
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,840
scream

2085
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,840
well yes that's what they do

2086
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,840
but like what would you teach your baby to call

2087
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,840
you because they can't say your full name

2088
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,840
that's too difficult

2089
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,840
can you say

2090
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
zuzu

2091
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,840
can you say pee pee

2092
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
pee pee would be good

2093
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,840
pee pee is funny

2094
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,840
I don't know

2095
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
I don't know I'm not sure about that one

2096
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
I don't know about that one

2097
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
someone tells me that one's in use already

2098
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,840
in use

2099
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
like a restroom

2100
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,840
yeah it's occupied

2101
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,840
it's like wall street

2102
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,840
I understand

2103
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,840
wall street

2104
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,840
it's occupied

2105
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,840
oh right

2106
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,840
of course

2107
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,840
my brain just makes autistic relations

2108
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
from one word to another it's bad

2109
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,840
that's called pumice it's good

2110
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,840
I get shit I need

2111
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
one second while I grab a sparkling water

2112
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,840
I imagine Ben saying

2113
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
has like a bucket of sparkling water

2114
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,840
and when he says grab he means

2115
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
dunk his hand in and grab some molecules

2116
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
I just need to grab those molecules

2117
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
you know

2118
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,840
I'm gonna grab your molecules Gib

2119
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,840
yep that is

2120
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,840
that is a frat I'd better believe it

2121
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
oh no

2122
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,840
I don't even know which molecules

2123
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,840
exactly there's so many

2124
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,840
I'm gonna be looking over my shoulder

2125
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,840
saying which molecules are gonna be stolen

2126
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,840
which ones are gonna be grabbed

2127
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,840
you got a lot of that

2128
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,840
that's 70% of my body

2129
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,840
it's everywhere

2130
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,840
yeah 70% is everywhere

2131
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,840
that's the threshold

2132
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,840
of everywhere

2133
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,840
what

2134
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
where was the 30%

2135
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,840
no where

2136
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,840
how can you calculate

2137
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
30% of

2138
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,840
the existence of the universe is

2139
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,840
nowhere

2140
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,840
no one knows

2141
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,840
I don't know

2142
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,840
what are you talking about

2143
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,840
calculate the probability

2144
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
of the quantum

2145
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,840
superposition of the

2146
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,840
wave form of reality

2147
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
and the

2148
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,840
information superhighway

2149
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,840
yes

2150
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,840
yes yes yes

2151
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,840
got it

2152
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
understood

2153
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,840
you think we should go to voicemails

2154
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
um

2155
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,840
or yeah

2156
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,840
I have one small thing it's another art thing

2157
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,840
um

2158
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,840
but it'll be pretty brief

2159
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
go on

2160
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,840
yeah sorry

2161
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,840
I yesterday did something

2162
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,840
that I've been meaning to do

2163
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,840
for a long fucking time

2164
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,840
which was update my character model

2165
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,840
sheet

2166
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,840
for my character failure

2167
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,840
basically like just redrawing it

2168
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,840
because

2169
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,840
me and forays are both better at art now

2170
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,840
and um

2171
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,840
I think it looks a lot

2172
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,840
fucking better

2173
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,840
I'll just drop a little

2174
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,840
comparison and chat

2175
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,840
um it's

2176
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
insane

2177
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,840
the fucking difference at least to me

2178
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,840
especially in the face

2179
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
I mean you made like

2180
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,840
really rapid art progress

2181
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,840
um

2182
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,840
I think it was last year or

2183
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,840
whenever it was

2184
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,840
you started drawing

2185
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,840
whenever it was

2186
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,840
specifically illustration progress

2187
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,840
the original reference sheet was drawn by forays

2188
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,840
before I even like

2189
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,840
had started learning art

2190
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,840
um

2191
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,840
so I can like

2192
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,840
show off like some of the comparison here

2193
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
there it is

2194
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,840
mainly the face just looks

2195
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
a heck of a lot better now I think

2196
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,840
well they look different

2197
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,840
I mean uh

2198
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,840
it looks more

2199
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
feminine

2200
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,840
which one's the new one

2201
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
the new one is the one on the right

2202
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,840
yeah

2203
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,840
so the hair no longer wraps around the horns

2204
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
oh it does I'm gonna have a

2205
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
my reference sheet will just show that

2206
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,840
it only wraps around sometimes like if it's messy

2207
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,840
and I have a better way

2208
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,840
of drawing that wrap around now

2209
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,840
um

2210
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,840
see the original was just by forays and since I've learned to draw

2211
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,840
I've been able to

2212
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,840
now do stuff

2213
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,840
so that's a thing

2214
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,840
she looks

2215
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,840
she looks sad she looks like she's

2216
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,840
less

2217
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
her mouth curls up a bit

2218
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,840
at a glance

2219
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,840
she's like depressed

2220
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,840
the small mouth just looks more

2221
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,840
feminine

2222
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,840
basically the eyes look a little more

2223
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,840
focused I guess

2224
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,840
the horns are definitely a better shape

2225
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,840
I have a 3D model of them now that I use for reference

2226
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,840
what I made

2227
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,840
was that too

2228
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,840
I think

2229
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,840
my brain's fucking stupid right now

2230
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
um

2231
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,840
what was I saying

2232
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,840
I forgot

2233
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,840
I draw her mouth smaller when it's closed

2234
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,840
but it still opens really big and scary

2235
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,840
it's like a giant penis

2236
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,840
so that's fine

2237
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,840
for instance

2238
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,840
for instance

2239
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,840
as one does

2240
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
yeah

2241
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,840
I don't think I've ever done like a model

2242
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,840
sheet

2243
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,840
for referencing my own characters

2244
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,840
I'm so lazy with that

2245
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,840
like I draw them

2246
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,840
and then every time I need to be like oh what does that character look like again

2247
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,840
I just look at the previous images

2248
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,840
they're always changing a little bit

2249
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,840
like punk

2250
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,840
I mean

2251
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,840
let me find the first image of punk

2252
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,840
she looks very different

2253
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,840
from the way I draw now

2254
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,840
yeah I would compose the full model sheet too

2255
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,840
that was just for zoom in for the main differences

2256
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,840
I've never really done

2257
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
like yeah character sheets

2258
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
I guess I did a phantom horn

2259
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,840
character sheet for t-bat back in the day

2260
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
but that wasn't like for my own reference

2261
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,840
that was like to show people

2262
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
like this is what the character looks like

2263
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
it was for other people's reference not for mine

2264
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,840
because the character looks like

2265
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,840
whatever they look like in my head

2266
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,840
to me and if it changes then like

2267
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,840
so be it

2268
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,840
when was the most recent time I drew punk

2269
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,840
was it for the game

2270
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,840
I suppose

2271
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,840
I feel like I doodled her

2272
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,840
I can't find anything

2273
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,840
the only thing I have for this year

2274
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,840
like really is the febubary stuff

2275
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,840
which is funny

2276
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,840
oh yeah

2277
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,840
I've did febubary

2278
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,840
and then occasionally I do a little doodle

2279
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,840
and I say that

2280
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
that's it

2281
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,840
I haven't done a lot of art aside from the comics

2282
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,840
I did the live stream image

2283
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,840
it's not really the same

2284
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
it's not really a punk image exactly

2285
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
but I can't say I've gotten

2286
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,840
better at art but I have

2287
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,840
I mean this one looks a lot better

2288
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,840
than the first one you posted

2289
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,840
yeah

2290
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,840
yeah I haven't done a lot

2291
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
I haven't done that much art

2292
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,840
well I guess I finished

2293
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840
I finished slime in punishment

2294
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,840
that was pretty much like the only art I've really done this year

2295
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,840
what were we talking about

2296
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,840
we were just talking about art I guess

2297
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
just talking about art

2298
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,840
I hate that stuff

2299
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,840
just kidding

2300
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,840
I like this image

2301
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840
this is a great image

2302
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,840
oh my god hi

2303
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,840
hmm

2304
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,840
it's like

2305
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,840
if I played suburb I would throw my brisket plush

2306
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,840
into the kernel sprite

2307
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,840
and then all the imps would be brisket

2308
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,840
and I would blush when I meet them

2309
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,840
but they want to kill me

2310
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,840
I saw this

2311
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,840
scrimblow gib

2312
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,840
and the big boobie mommy milkers

2313
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,840
it's very good

2314
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,840
very cute

2315
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,840
very funny

2316
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,840
disgusting imp

2317
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,840
it has the eyelashes

2318
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,840
it has the horns and the hair

2319
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,840
it's grey

2320
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,840
oh my god

2321
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,840
yeah I hope

2322
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,840
the griffs they're made of on your planet

2323
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,840
is some kind of grey stuff

2324
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,840
yeah

2325
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
I forget the kinds of griffs they have

2326
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
they're like gushers

2327
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
well John has

2328
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
oil and like cobalt

2329
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,840
I think

2330
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,840
oh yes that's right

2331
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,840
the types of imp

2332
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,840
yeah so I would hope that

2333
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,840
they're named after stuff

2334
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,840
so I would hope that yours would be something grey

2335
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
like shale or

2336
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,840
something like that

2337
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,840
gravel

2338
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,840
yeah dust is good

2339
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,840
dust is good

2340
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,840
dust imps yeah that would work

2341
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
that would work just fine

2342
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,840
and my planet is like

2343
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
oh it's got dust all over it

2344
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,840
so I gotta do the windy thing and blow the dust away

2345
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
it makes more sense than John

2346
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,840
actually with the oil

2347
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
yeah why would oil

2348
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
why would wind, why would breath blow oil away

2349
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,840
doesn't

2350
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,840
or no it doesn't know it's to clear the oil

2351
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
out so that the pipes can

2352
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,840
so the wind, the breath can blow through the pipes

2353
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
yes that's it

2354
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,840
yes yes that's it

2355
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
I forget what my home stuck

2356
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
like my chosen

2357
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,840
thingy of thingy

2358
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,840
my class bit

2359
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,840
me

2360
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
I remember it being like the page of

2361
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,840
space or the page of void

2362
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,840
or something

2363
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,840
I like hope the best but

2364
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,840
I don't know if I would be

2365
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,840
I don't know if I would be it just because I like it

2366
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,840
probably not actually

2367
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,840
I'd probably be something that I don't like

2368
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,840
like

2369
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,840
blood

2370
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,840
the bard of blood

2371
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,840
blood sucks blood doesn't even do anything

2372
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,840
at least car cat doesn't do anything

2373
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,840
it's friendship though

2374
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
it's bonds

2375
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,840
is it though or is that just

2376
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,840
fanning

2377
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,840
I mean I think it's

2378
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
implied heavily that car cat

2379
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
is a good people person and he's good with

2380
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,840
he likes the troll romance

2381
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,840
and he's like easy to talk to

2382
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,840
even though he's a little insane

2383
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,840
he's got like relationship issues

2384
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,840
which is like his blood

2385
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
if it's like a relationship thing

2386
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
there's clues here and there

2387
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,840
like imply what blood is about

2388
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,840
compared to all of the other aspects

2389
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,840
that are not about that

2390
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
okay I mean if yeah

2391
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,840
I mean then he has that

2392
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
blood packed with Jack Noir

2393
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,840
oh right yeah and he cuts the

2394
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
hand and it looks like the symbol

2395
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,840
yeah yeah yeah yeah

2396
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,840
that's hard to ignore

2397
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,840
you're right

2398
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,840
well I guess all of my art

2399
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,840
skill my focus

2400
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,840
has been on the pumpkin

2401
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,840
family game but also

2402
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
um this Clarissa comic

2403
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
some of the little things I drawn

2404
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
even though they're not even properly made yet

2405
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
they're like oh that would be such a good

2406
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,840
panel it's gonna be so fucking sick

2407
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,840
when people read it I sure hope I don't

2408
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,840
fuck it up in the process

2409
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,840
of making it finished

2410
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,840
I hope so too

2411
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,840
I love cartooning

2412
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,840
cartooning is good

2413
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
should I dare I suggest

2414
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,840
voicemails again

2415
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
I guess

2416
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
okay so I will

2417
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
probably step out

2418
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,840

yeah I know Pete the whole the whole point

2520
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,840
of that particular meme is that it's

2521
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,840
juxtaposed with things that are not the cutesy

not a question where's the question mark

2558
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,840
yeah there's no question mark

2559
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,840
sorry next one is called

2560
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,840
MLP confessions

2561
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,840
three two one go

2562
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,840
I have a confession make

2563
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,840
I could never get into my

2564
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,840
little piano guy

2565
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
I remember back in

2566
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,840
2012 2013

2567
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,840
when the fandom was starting

2568
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,840
and blossoming and I heard about it

2569
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,840
and I just could not see

2570
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,840
what other people saw in it

2571
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,840
like maybe it's because I was

2572
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
an entire audience or maybe I just

2573
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,840
wasn't autistic enough to enjoy it

2574
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,840
which is weird because

2575
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,840
I feel like I should have

2576
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,840
been no fancy

2577
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,840
piano guys

2578
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,840
like it's weird

2579
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,840
PCP has given me a lot of insight on the

2580
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,840
fucking debacle that was the piano guy

2581
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,840
fandom

2582
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,840
and like I feel like I missed

2583
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,840
out on something

2584
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,840
but at the same time I feel like I missed out

2585
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,840
on nothing so I'm wondering

2586
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,840
now that piano guy is effectively over

2587
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
what's the final autopsy report

2588
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,840
I don't remember that question

2589
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,840
like the original

2590
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,840
what's about my little pony

2591
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,840
I don't remember any of these originals

2592
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
the piano guy fandom

2593
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
will live on in our pianos

2594
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840
the piano guy fandom

2595
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,840
started with a bang

2596
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,840
and it ended and it went out in a blaze of glory

2597
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,840
short life cycle short but sweet

2598
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,840
I like to go back

2599
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,840
sometimes and listen to piano guy

2600
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,840
it's nostalgic nostalgic for the good old days

2601
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,840
you know the PCP started

2602
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,840
as just a bunch of friends who just came together

2603
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,840
over their shared love of the piano guy

2604
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,840
those days are well behind

2605
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,840
and we hate piano guy now

2606
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:01,840
next one is called friends

2607
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,840
three two one go

2608
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,840
I got pretty big list of friends

2609
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,840
and I'll like ask one of them to die

2610
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,840
and they'll be like nah I got a girlfriend

2611
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,840
sorry

2612
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,840
and then I have another friend who's got like work

2613
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,840
and that's like you know more reasonable

2614
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,840
but he's like oh I have to work all the time

2615
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
can't die and like you know other stuff

2616
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,840
like that like just friends that are busy

2617
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
like all the fucking time

2618
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,840
and I'm so busy with any of that

2619
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840
and I just want to hang out with people

2620
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
and I rarely ever die

2621
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,840
so I gotta make new friends

2622
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,840
to hang out with but then I try to ask people

2623
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840

2624
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,840

2661
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,840
The payoff I think

Sick that was great nice nice little nice little number. That was a nice little number

2663
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,760

01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:10,600
Just messing around with audio distortions and fucking shit up on audacity recently. Hope it wasn't

2668
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,160
Too much of a derailment

2669
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:18,780
And I hope you enjoyed the last one that probably played shortly before this one

2670
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:20,880
We're car in it

2671

01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,880
Yeah, I only know oblivion full not oblivion

2679
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:54,840
Oh, yeah, they're different. Well, I don't know. Well, that guy sucks

2680
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:02,320
Next one is called those searching for amusement to be like three two one go

Mary with a nice New Zealand accent Mary with a Mary with a

2684
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:20,320
Is it they mean the the artist? Oh, it's not an artist. Okay, whatever the whatever guy

2685
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:26,840
The producer I didn't think that was a is a better name for it. Maybe something like that

2686
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:29,960
I guess so

2687
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:37,200
Sure next one is called wandering air explorer of the West three two one go I

2688
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:45,640
Was exploring the rural roads west of Boston when I happened to come across one Nate nutting road a

2689
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,440
little further down

2690
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,860
There's another road gay road

2691
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,480
So what I'm seeing is

2692
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:58,440
We know the approximate location for the headquarters of the League of Nate fuckers

2693
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:02,800
Nate nothing and gay road

2694
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,520
Well, there you are

2695
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,840
Okay, next one is called Ben

2696
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,880
10

2697
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,880
three two one go

2698
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:17,880
You know this

2699
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:20,960
Airlines of yours that are no longer there

2700
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,680
Why don't you scroll them back like you could just build them into existence?

2701
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:31,000
I understand because I was tricks is for that that your hair line is

2702
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:37,720
Basically promised, I mean he or she did curse you

2703
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:42,120
It's soon as you

2704
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:47,800
Decided to shit on him right for yourself, but even so

2705
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:50,200
you know

2706
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:53,240
This person is saying that Trixie cursed my hair line

2707
01:57:54,600 --> 01:58:00,840
Yeah, well the first thing he says is you could just will it back into existence. That's what he said. That's true

2708
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,840
I guess I don't know why I didn't think of it like that

2709
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:07,560
You just got to do a Dragon Ball Z. You just got to go

2710
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,240
I don't know. I don't know. Thanks for the advice guy

2711
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,360
Next one is called. Hey, you suck on pronouns by the way. What the what the fuck is that?

2712
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:27,840
Yeah, what the fuck was she what the fuck was he or she and then and then he after that like

2713
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:34,800
You're you're you're you're in shambles. You're in shambles my guy next one is called a Gibbs layer

2714
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:37,480
three two one go

2715
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:49,960
I mean, oh, I'm not slain guess. It wasn't as funny as saying die. Yeah

2716
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,880
Yeah

2717
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:54,520
You could have just all it took was one word

2718
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,480
next one is called

2719
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:01,120
Don't dope smite and no, thank you

2720
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,040
Three two one go

2721
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,480
I

2722
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:24,040
See the CEO of a large central exchange of cryptocurrencies

2723
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:28,320
Will go into birth all the supply like the Joker

2724
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,240
Which means supply and demand the less is more you buy. No, it becomes a one dollar and only

2725
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,080
Yeah.

2726
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:40,840
At least.

2727
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,440
Did you understand that?

2728
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:47,300
Something about buying into a cryptocurrency

2729
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:50,820
because they're gonna burn the cryptocurrency

2730
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:52,640
or someone's gonna burn it.

2731
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,660
I don't know, that doesn't make sense though.

2732
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:57,660
You can't buy it and then have the thing devalue,

2733
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:01,360
but you have like, it's not like gold.

2734
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:05,380
You having a lot of it, whatever, it's stupid.

2735
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:07,100
Yeah, I don't know.

2736
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,440
Don't do it.

2737
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,660
Just don't do it.

2738
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:11,500
Next one is called,

2739
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,460
Hey Ben, new fan here.

2740
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,900
How is being bald and what does that mean?

2741
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,540
Nothing.

2742
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:18,520
It's just a joke.

2743
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,360
It was just a joke.

2744
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,200
Ha ha ha.

2745
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:22,980
You fell for it.

2746
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:23,820
Next one is called,

2747
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:25,120
Happy Birthday Ben.

2748
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,100
Thanks.

2749
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:26,940
Next one is called,

2750
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:28,260
They Are Back.

2751
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:29,100
Oh.

2752
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:31,600
Three, two, one, go.

2753
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,380
I love how you guys always engage

2754
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:35,220
with the question,

2755
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:36,820
doesn't matter how stupid it is,

2756
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:40,780
like, what do you two think about pineapples?

2757
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:44,180
Pineapple.

2758
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,020
Interesting.

2759
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:46,980
What about segregation?

2760
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:50,820
Interesting.

2761
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:52,820
I see, very interesting.

2762
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:57,320
Wait, what do you say about segregation?

2763
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:01,260
I think he just said it was interesting, very interesting.

2764
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:04,060
Or he asked us what we think about it.

2765
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:05,940
Oh, I think it is bad.

2766
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:09,900
I think that pineapples and segregation are equally bad.

2767
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:12,020
I wouldn't eat segregation on pizza.

2768
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,660
Hmm, I would,

2769
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:19,140
I would segregate my pizza though.

2770
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:20,820
I would keep pepperoni on one side.

2771
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:23,820
You segregate it whenever you cut it into eight.

2772
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:24,860
Exactly.

2773
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:27,140
Keep the pepperoni on one half

2774
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:29,540
and no pepperoni on the other half for the vegetarians.

2775
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:32,060
No, no, I'm a calzone girl.

2776
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:34,940
I got a no segregation on the pizza.

2777
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:39,580
One pizza, curl it up, eat it like a ice cream,

2778
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:41,340
like a big old ice cream cone.

2779
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:52,300
Segregation and pineapples, they're both,

2780
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,500
they're not back, they never left, baby.

2781
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:56,180
They're here to stay.

2782
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:58,140
Did I tell you, I had a pineapple on a pizza

2783
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:00,900
a little while ago and I thought it was pretty good.

2784
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:04,860
When we had it at Radcon three, I didn't like it.

2785
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:07,340
But I had like a, from a better pizzeria,

2786
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:10,220
not that long ago and it was like cooked better

2787
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:12,820
and it was good, I liked it.

2788
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:14,660
And it was with pepperoni.

2789
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:17,300
It wasn't ham and pineapple, it was pepperoni and pineapple.

2790
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:20,380
And it was well cooked so the pineapple

2791
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:21,780
kind of like melted in.

2792
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:22,620
Ah!

2793
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:25,660
Does it still taste sweet?

2794
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,500
Cause that's the reason I wouldn't like it.

2795
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,740
The reason I didn't like it was because,

2796
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:34,100
like when it was still in like chunks,

2797
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:36,860
it's kind of like has like the fruity,

2798
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:40,940
pulpy texture of it and the sweetness is in that.

2799
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:43,180
And it's just kind of weird to chew on.

2800
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:47,620
The one that I had, it was like cooked well enough

2801
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:49,860
that it sort of melted.

2802
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:51,700
It almost kind of melted on top of the pizza

2803
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:53,180
and it worked much better.

2804
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:59,500
Yeah, see, for me, it's just anything sweet.

2805
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:02,700
And like a main course just feels wrong.

2806
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:07,700
Like a main meal, it has to be savory or spicy or, you know,

2807
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,220
it can't be sweet.

2808
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:11,700
Sweet is for dessert only.

2809
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:15,060
It doesn't make sense to me that you would have sweet things.

2810
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:18,180
Like if there's a curry, but it has like dates in it

2811
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:20,700
or raisins or bits of stuff.

2812
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:26,820
And it's like, it's sweetness, that's not right.

2813
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:29,100
That's my take.

2814
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:33,700
It needs to be handled with delicacy.

2815
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:36,340
Decent with decency.

2816
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:38,540
And in modern societies, it doesn't have.

2817
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:42,300
Since we just don't have, we've lost the nuances.

2818
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:47,140
We've lost the nuances of adding sweet to savory dishes.

2819
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:50,820
The next one is called YouTube 321 Go.

2820
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,060
There's nothing.

2821
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:52,900
Terrible.

2822
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:56,860
The next one is called Evangelion Bad 321 Go.

2823
02:03:57,860 --> 02:04:02,660
I don't understand why Gendo was so abusive to Shinji.

2824
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,180
If my wife died under circumstances that could have been my fault

2825
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:07,940
and the years I spent with her were the only time

2826
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:10,140
in my life that I felt truly happy,

2827
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:12,620
I would have simply moved on and found new happiness

2828
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:14,380
by raising my son.

2829
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:16,820
Gendo's behavior simply makes no sense.

2830
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:17,660
Zero.

2831
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,500
Can't relate to it.

2832
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,300
Bad show.

2833
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:22,100
Why not just be a good dad?

2834
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:26,100
Then Shinji would smile.

2835
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:28,300
Why not just be a good dad?

2836
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:31,460
Hey, Misato, why just not be a pedophile?

2837
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,820
Why not simply skip that part?

2838
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,820
Is she a pedophile?

2839
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:38,260
Does she come onto Shinji?

2840
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:39,100
I can't even remember.

2841
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:40,260
Yeah, they make out.

2842
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,300
Misato?

2843
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:47,300
Well, don't they kiss before his final Eva mission

2844
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:49,180
or something?

2845
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:53,980
I mean, it will depend on if it was on the cheek or not.

2846
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:57,860
Maybe she says that they'll fuck afterwards or something.

2847
02:04:57,860 --> 02:04:59,140
She implies it.

2848
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:05,060
I mean, she is very openly adult around Shinji

2849
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:08,340
and Shinji's just whatever.

2850
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:09,660
Yeah.

2851
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,740
Yeah.

2852
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:12,500
It's mostly her being drunk, though.

2853
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,700
I don't know if she did a pedophile, but she may have.

2854
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:17,780
I mean, I don't know if she did a pedophile.

2855
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:20,260
She kind of comes on to him,

2856
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:22,700
but it's sort of like,

2857
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:27,140
I don't know if she was into him.

2858
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:30,420
I think she was doing it to get him to do something,

2859
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:33,540
to pilot the Eva, basically, which makes it okay.

2860
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:35,500
Yeah, of course.

2861
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:38,820
Just like Gendo's behavior was also okay

2862
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:41,660
because it led to Shinji piloting the Eva.

2863
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:42,820
At the end of the day,

2864
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:46,300
at the end of the day, you've gotta punch that alien.

2865
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:47,860
We need Shinji to pilot the Eva

2866
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:49,900
by whatever means necessary.

2867
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,820
I saw a good reply to that thread.

2868
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:57,300
Somebody else, quote, treated that idiot's thread about it.

2869
02:05:58,300 --> 02:06:00,540
Because in that thread, the guy says,

2870
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,940
it doesn't make any sense

2871
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:04,580
that Shinji is still going to high school

2872
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:09,300
while he's piloting the Eva.

2873
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:12,340
And this thread that I saw, quote, tweeting,

2874
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:17,340
it was like, wow, maybe it's not a mistake,

2875
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:19,260
that that's weird.

2876
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:22,700
Maybe the fact that the character is at once

2877
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:27,140
both involved in this fate of the world,

2878
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:30,380
hyper-military science organization,

2879
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:33,020
and also going to regular high school,

2880
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:34,780
maybe that's not a fuck-up,

2881
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:36,780
maybe it's deliberately weird.

2882
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:39,900
Like that, it never even answers this guy's head

2883
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:42,340
that the creators of the show

2884
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:45,180
might have realized that and done it on purpose

2885
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,060
and thought about it.

2886
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:51,100
Yeah, it's like strange, isn't it?

2887
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:52,100
Hmm, yeah.

2888
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:55,700
Maybe he should be a normal kid

2889
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:58,100
and go to school and have friends

2890
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:00,900
instead of everything else.

2891
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:04,620
Now, I gotta drop out of school

2892
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:08,780
and pilot a robot because robots are so fucking cool.

2893
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:11,900
Why didn't they, he could have had a private tutor.

2894
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:14,460
What, you think Nerve couldn't afford a tutor?

2895
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:15,380
They could have had a private tutor.

2896
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:18,260
We didn't have to keep going to high school, man.

2897
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:19,860
Doesn't make any sense, logistically.

2898
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,860
Man, high school sucks.

2899
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:23,660
True.

2900
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:25,740
Next one is called What Would You Do

2901
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:28,740
If You Were Trixie, Suicide.

2902
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:32,060
Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder,

2903
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:34,460
Play Delta Room Chapter Two, okay.

2904
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:36,220
Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder,

2905
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,580
catch up on one piece, okay.

2906
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:41,540
Next one is called, well, it's a Twitter link.

2907
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:45,580
Um, what's this?

2908
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:49,180
Throw a moment to gaymail.com.

2909
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,140
Power isn't determined by your size,

2910
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:55,260
but the size of your heart and dreams,

2911
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:59,300
total combat losses of the enemy from February 24,

2912
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,820
is this about the war in Ukraine?

2913
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:03,300
This is, yeah, Ministry of Defense of Ukraine

2914
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:06,340
quoted Monkey D. Luffy in a tweet

2915
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:08,900
when they are talking about how

2916
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:11,500
they've killed so many Russians.

2917
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:14,500
Oh my God, they did.

2918
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,100
What the fuck?

2919
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:19,540
Is this real?

2920
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,780
It's verified.

2921
02:08:20,780 --> 02:08:24,140
DefenseU.

2922
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:24,780
Gov.

2923
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:27,100
Ukraine, yeah, this is a verified Ukraine

2924
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:28,380
government organization.

2925
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:31,580
They quoted Monkey D. Luffy.

2926
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:34,340
Okay, sure, I guess.

2927
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:40,540
So they are reporting 59,000 eliminated personnel,

2928
02:08:40,580 --> 02:08:43,340
plus bunches of vehicles that have either

2929
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:46,820
been abandoned or destroyed.

2930
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:51,220
That's funny.

2931
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,580
Are you worried about nuclear war, by the way?

2932
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:59,460
About nuclear war, I mean, I was more worried before.

2933
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:02,900
Russia was like failing so heavily.

2934
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:06,980
I feel like all of the Russia's failings

2935
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:10,260
of logistics and just having good equipment

2936
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:13,700
and having soldiers that are willing to fight,

2937
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:23,700
it sort of speaks to a lack of like funding for these things.

2938
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:26,100
I feel like Vladimir Putin definitely

2939
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:28,980
wanted to win by intimidation.

2940
02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:32,940
And I feel like the nuclear thing could also be intimidation.

2941
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:37,420
I don't think he has enough nukes to threaten everyone,

2942
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,340
compared to how many anti-nuke defenses

2943
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:42,060
the rest of the world has.

2944
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:44,700
He might use a nuke in Ukraine.

2945
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:46,900
I think that is possible.

2946
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:48,780
Yeah, I was reading about it last night,

2947
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:51,220
and it seems like if nukes are going to get involved,

2948
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:56,580
they're going to be probably tactical nukes in Ukraine,

2949
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:57,220
which is bad.

2950
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:59,020
Tactical nukes in Ukraine, it would be horrible.

2951
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:01,140
I don't want that either.

2952
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:04,260
But I don't feel like it's like, oh, nuclear annihilation,

2953
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:06,060
doomsday approaching.

2954
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:10,500
It would just be like Russia would do that.

2955
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:14,060
And then having done that, they would be destroyed

2956
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:16,820
by literally everyone else.

2957
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:19,740
I don't think Vladimir Putin is silly enough

2958
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:22,820
to actually do it still.

2959
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:25,620
I was reading a couple of articles about it.

2960
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:33,140
And the consensus seems to be that even Russia's allies,

2961
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:40,100
India and China would not like it if Putin started nuking people.

2962
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:40,580
No.

2963
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:43,340
So it would be bad for Russia.

2964
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:49,300
I mean, Putin might be inclined to do it anyway,

2965
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:50,420
just for his own reasons.

2966
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:55,460
But it's not in Russia's interests to do it.

2967
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:57,420
None of this has been in Russia's interests,

2968
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:00,020
which is, I guess, the precedent that he could do it.

2969
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:03,820
He could completely and permanently tank

2970
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:08,500
like Russian's credibility as a nation going forward forever.

2971
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:11,860
If he does this, he does a nuke.

2972
02:11:11,860 --> 02:11:15,180
Because he doesn't have what it takes to back it up afterwards.

2973
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:22,140
Yeah.

2974
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,220
I was worried about, like, oh, am I going to get nuked?

2975
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:29,180
And like, yeah, it's probably, we're probably not looking at a,

2976
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:34,180
like, they're not going to jump right to nuking the American mainland

2977
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:37,180
or even anywhere, like, yeah.

2978
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:41,620
It would be like a combat nuke, if anything.

2979
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:42,220
Yeah.

2980
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:42,780
And even that.

2981
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:45,140
He's going to hold out for as long as possible.

2982
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:45,660
Yeah.

2983
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:48,340
I, like, I'm having to do it.

2984
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:50,060
But I think, I think.

2985
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:55,420
Because it's the threat of it that is, like, of the effective bargaining.

2986
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,260
Yeah.

2987
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:57,860
And nobody believes him.

2988
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:02,100
And, like, I feel like he knows that nobody believes him.

2989
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:03,220
Yeah.

2990
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:06,540
So he's like, he doesn't have much else he can do at the moment.

2991
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:11,780
I feel like what's most likely is that Ukraine will eventually push back

2992
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:14,940
the Russian forces to the border.

2993
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:21,900
And once that's happened, Zelensky might try to get a peace thing going.

2994
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,020
Because I don't think Ukraine wants to invade Russia.

2995
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:26,980
They have no reason to.

2996
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:30,900
So I kind of expect it to just go like that.

2997
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:35,060
I don't think Putin would use a nuke if he couldn't follow it up.

2998
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:37,860
I don't think he can follow it up right now.

2999
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:42,940
I mean, he definitely can't follow it up.

3000
02:12:42,940 --> 02:12:45,500
No, like, you just destroy it like he is.

3001
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:48,980
And then, like, you still get pushed back because the army

3002
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:51,900
and the rest of Ukraine is still strong enough to do it.

3003
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,300
Yeah.

3004
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:56,900
The consequences for doing that, I think, would be pretty bad.

3005
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:05,260
Next one is called More Voice Males Like Last Week, Please.

3006
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:07,780
Three, two, one, go.

3007
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:09,540
Well, OK.

3008
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:13,860
This guy likes what they heard.

3009
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:14,900
Yeah.

3010
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:15,580
Well, guess what?

3011
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:17,540
You did get more voice smells like last week.

3012
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:19,100
So congratulations.

3013
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:25,900
Next one is called I'm So Happy Voice Males Are Back, Thank the Lord.

3014
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:28,300
Three, two, one, go.

3015
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:30,500
It's zero seconds.

3016
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,220
Oh, yeah, you're right.

3017
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:33,780
But there was a cut.

3018
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:38,220
It's so stupid that people use these to just deliver a, like,

3019
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:42,820
eight-word long written message and no voicemail.

3020
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:43,860
But oh well.

3021
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:45,900
Next one is called Wong, Wong, Wong.

3022
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:47,100
Three, two, one, go.

3023
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:09,300
Was that like a stuttering Chinese man morphing

3024
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:11,020
into Arnold Schwarzenegger at the end?

3025
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:11,780
I thought it was.

3026
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:18,100
Was he attempting to mimic like a voice, like audio fuckery, like stutter, like?

3027
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:19,540
I don't think so.

3028
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:23,260
I think it was just a racist voice he was doing.

3029
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:24,260
Maybe.

3030
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:26,340
I mean, it was definitely that.

3031
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:27,980
But there's layers.

3032
02:14:27,980 --> 02:14:34,940
I felt like maybe he was attempting to mimic the sound of like a record repeating or like

3033
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:40,820
it having been edited to sputter, I'm not sure.

3034
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:45,500
Next one is called carbon offsets are a scam and your NFT is fucking bad.

3035
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,700
Three, two, one, go.

3036
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:53,260
Carbon assessor fucking bullshit and don't do anything you goddamn moron.

3037
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:56,340
Why did I, why are you calling me that?

3038
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:57,580
Why are you so mean?

3039
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:03,500
He's talking to carbon offset stands.

3040
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:04,500
I don't know.

3041
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:05,500
Carbon offsets.

3042
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:09,060
A carbon offset is, I assume it's something.

3043
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:13,300
It's when you do something stupid, they say they'll plant a tree, they'll plant a tree

3044
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,300
or something.

3045
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:15,300
Okay.

3046
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:16,300
Sounds good.

3047
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:17,300
Maybe.

3048
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:18,300
Sounds good.

3049
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:19,300
Yeah, it sounds dumb.

3050
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:24,060
This guy's probably right.

3051
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:26,700
Next one is called death of a Ben St.

3052
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:29,700
Oh, yes.

3053
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:44,660
Okay, let's see what this voicemail, let's see what's behind this link.

3054
02:15:44,660 --> 02:15:48,860
It's a YouTube one minute 24.

3055
02:15:48,860 --> 02:15:49,860
Okay.

3056
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,860
All right.

3057
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:54,420
Three, two, one, go.

3058
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:55,420
Probably can't.

3059
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:57,420
I don't think we can play this.

3060
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:58,540
I think.

3061
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:03,140
No, because it's got a song in it, but we can put the visuals up.

3062
02:16:03,140 --> 02:16:07,100
Yeah, we can put the visuals up.

3063
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:13,180
This is to say montage of Vinny's drawings of me.

3064
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:18,780
Oh, he think he drew new ones for it.

3065
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,580
Yeah, these are new.

3066
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:26,180
He illustrated this whole song about me.

3067
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:34,420
Wow.

3068
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:48,540
It's probably not going to be the same without the music.

3069
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:49,540
You're so sad.

3070
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:51,740
Wait, this is death of a bachelor?

3071
02:16:51,740 --> 02:17:01,580
I was thinking of a different song.

3072
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:04,060
Is that you in the orange dress?

3073
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:07,740
I don't know.

3074
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:09,740
Don't look like me.

3075
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:11,740
No, it's a tricksy.

3076
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:14,740
Oh, it's a tricksy.

3077
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:15,740
Yes.

3078
02:17:15,740 --> 02:17:17,740
Oh, I see.

3079
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:19,740
I see.

3080
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:20,740
Excellent.

3081
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,740
Funny.

3082
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:23,740
Thanks.

3083
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:24,740
Thanks, Vinny.

3084
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:25,740
I liked it.

3085
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:26,740
Yeah.

3086
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:27,740
Next one.

3087
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:28,740
How many?

3088
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:29,740
Not that many left.

3089
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:30,740
Hey, Ben.

3090
02:17:30,740 --> 02:17:31,740
New fan here.

3091
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:33,740
I'm single if you're interested.

3092
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:34,740
Nope.

3093
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:38,740
Not even going to listen to the voice?

3094
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:45,740
I did listen, but it's zero seconds, so there's nothing to it.

3095
02:17:45,740 --> 02:17:48,740
Oh, the last one is I didn't think when I sent it,

3096
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:50,740
avoid getting copyright strike.

3097
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:54,740
It's VVVV mute the vid, but still watch it, please.

3098
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:55,740
Okay.

3099
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:56,740
Three, two, one, go.

3100
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,740
I'm playing the audio.

3101
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:03,740
Be sure to mute the death of Ben saying the video in case,

3102
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:06,740
like, am I going to copyright on the channel?

3103
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:07,740
Yes.

3104
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:08,740
I didn't really think about that when I sent it.

3105
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:09,740
Yes.

3106
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:10,740
That's okay.

3107
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:12,740
We can put the link in the description and people can watch it themselves.

3108
02:18:12,740 --> 02:18:13,740
Right.

3109
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:19,740
I mean, yeah, definitely we can't play the audio, but okay.

3110
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:20,740
Got it.

3111
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:23,740
I mean, I guess that's it.

3112
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:25,740
I guess we're done.

3113
02:18:25,740 --> 02:18:26,740
Yeah.

3114
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:28,740
What a week.

3115
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:29,740
What a week.

3116
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:30,740
It's so weird.

3117
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:35,740
At the end of a week, I don't remember too much of what happened,

3118
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:42,740
but it definitely days passed and days definitely passed.

3119
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:44,740
Days.

3120
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:45,740
Days definitely passed.

3121
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:46,740
It's getting colder.

3122
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:47,740
It's getting October.

3123
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,740
It is getting.

3124
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:49,740
It is getting colder.

3125
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:50,740
October fast.

3126
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:52,740
I had to bust out my space heater.

3127
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:55,740
I had to turn off my air conditioner.

3128
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:59,740
I might actually have to take it out of my window soon if you can believe that.

3129
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:00,740
Oh.

3130
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:01,740
Yeah.

3131
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:05,740
But I don't know, whatever.

3132
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:06,740
It's fine.

3133
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:11,740
The colder weather means I can actually wear, like, clothes.

3134
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:15,740
Like when it's hot, I can just, all I can do is wear like a t-shirt because anything

3135
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:18,740
more and it's like, it's going to make me sweat.

3136
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:23,740
But when it's chilly, I can actually make an outfit, which is nice.

3137
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:24,740
Can wear a jacket.

3138
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:25,740
Can wear a cloak.

3139
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,740
Yeah.

3140
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:29,740
You can wear a cape and a cloak hood.

3141
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:30,740
Exactly.

3142
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:31,740
Boots.

3143
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:33,740
And wear a robe.

3144
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:35,740
Wear a whole costume.

3145
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:39,740
Wear a whole pumpkin man scarecrow outfit.

3146
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:43,740
If I want, I don't, but I could.

3147
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:48,740
I kind of like the idea of a punk helmet of some kind.

3148
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:55,740
Like if I pad it, if I make it like warm and fuzzy and not like a pain to wear, it could

3149
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:57,740
be like a warm thing.

3150
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:59,740
I could wear it every day.

3151
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:00,740
You can stuff it with straw.

3152
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:03,740
And people will be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

3153
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:10,740
Well, that's your practice for wearing something outlandish in public.

3154
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:11,740
True.

3155
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:13,740
That's what you said you wanted to do, right?

3156
02:20:13,740 --> 02:20:14,740
On Halloween.

3157
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,740
Yeah.

3158
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:16,740
Just wear something stupid.

3159
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:17,740
Oh, you know what?

3160
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:21,740
I could cosplay a scraggity-acty.

3161
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:27,740
The scarecrow OC that has the big straw tits.

3162
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:32,740
You could make some straw tits if you put your mind to it.

3163
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:37,740
All I need to do is believe.

3164
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:47,740
I'm trying to think if there's anything I want to say before we end the show for this

3165
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:48,740
week.

3166
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:49,740
I don't know.

3167
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:51,740
I'm going to keep grinding.

3168
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:55,740
Yeah, just keep that Sigma grind set going.

3169
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:57,740
I'm going to keep that Sigma.

3170
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:01,740
Oh, there's a new folding ideas video.

3171
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:03,740
I saw it.

3172
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:04,740
It was good.

3173
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:13,740
Yeah, it was pretty good.

3174
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:14,740
Made me want to try it almost.

3175
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:16,740
Part of me was like, what if I tried this?

3176
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:19,740
What if I tried this book method and did it?

3177
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:22,740
But I think it probably doesn't work, as he explains.

3178
02:21:22,740 --> 02:21:27,740
They don't actually do it anymore because it doesn't work.

3179
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:36,740
Oh, as a method to like, I mean, I guess getting a ghost writer is still a thing that's possible.

3180
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:41,740
Yeah, all the steps of the process are still possible to do.

3181
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:48,740
I think it's probably not super effective anymore.

3182
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:52,740
If it was super effective, they probably wouldn't be selling the method.

3183
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:53,740
No.

3184
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:59,740
Yeah, very, very, very funny grift, very funny grift.

3185
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:08,740
The people who get into those grifts and they've always got YouTube influencer faces and hair

3186
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:11,740
and clothes, there's always that sort of person.

3187
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:15,740
I don't know why, but it just reminds me of, I don't know.

3188
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:23,740
I imagine that that's the grown-up version of that bratty kid who does not get disciplined at all.

3189
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:27,740
Like, oh, that kid is such a brat and they turn into one of these people.

3190
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:31,740
Yeah, it's like, whatever they can get away with.

3191
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:37,740
I think they're so clever because they found a cute little loophole.

3192
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:45,740
It's like, this is for people that don't have the time or inclination to learn new skills because anyone could do that.

3193
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:47,740
Like, that's me.

3194
02:22:47,740 --> 02:22:50,740
What a intriguing prospect.

3195
02:22:50,740 --> 02:22:52,740
I'll buy it.

3196
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:53,740
Thank you.

3197
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:55,740
I am the target demographic.

3198
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:56,740
Thank you.

3199
02:22:56,740 --> 02:23:03,740
You mean if I put money, I can just get free shit and get my own money from putting money in?

3200
02:23:03,740 --> 02:23:05,740
If I just pay some money, I can get stuff for free?

3201
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:07,740
That's crazy, dog.

3202
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:09,740
Yeah.

3203
02:23:11,740 --> 02:23:13,740
Good video, though.

3204
02:23:13,740 --> 02:23:14,740
Yes.

3205
02:23:14,740 --> 02:23:16,740
I like Dan a lot.

3206
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:22,740
Did I watch any other good videos this week?

3207
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:23,740
No.

3208
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:25,740
No.

3209
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:27,740
Never.

3210
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:30,740
I feel, it feels bad.

3211
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:32,740
I feel like we haven't gone long enough.

3212
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:34,740
Not even two and a half hours.

3213
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:36,740
The comments are going to be furious.

3214
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:41,740
It's hard sometimes having stuff to talk about.

3215
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:42,740
Yeah.

3216
02:23:42,740 --> 02:23:45,740
I mean, I mostly had the last of us thing.

3217
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:50,740
Aside from that, I'm just working on stuff.

3218
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:54,740
Sometimes it's just a week goes by.

3219
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:57,740
Well, let's try and manufacture something.

3220
02:23:57,740 --> 02:24:00,740
I hope my video will be done soon.

3221
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:03,740
We'll be dropping in the very near future.

3222
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:10,740
Maybe not before this week's episode comes out, but not too long after that, I think, is almost for sure.

3223
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:12,740
Oh, you know what?

3224
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:15,740
I can talk briefly about RuneScape.

3225
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:16,740
Oh, sure.

3226
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:17,740
Yeah, please.

3227
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:28,740
My challenge run has been continuing, and I got bored mining coal, so I switched over.

3228
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:35,740
Now I'm shopping down U-Logs, U-Trees to get U-Logs, and that's what I'm doing.

3229
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:36,740
U-Logs.

3230
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:37,740
I haven't thought to make a video.

3231
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:38,740
U-Logs.

3232
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:39,740
What about me, Logs?

3233
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:40,740
Ah.

3234
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:44,740
Never thought of that one.

3235
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:47,740
Yeah.

3236
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:57,740
It is one of those, like, I haven't got enough of an interesting thing to make a video about it, so there's no third installment yet of the RuneScape thing.

3237
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:03,740
But when I have something to talk about it, I'll be like, and here's the update.

3238
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:05,740
Wait, was there a second?

3239
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,740
Oh, the second one was about the runite, right?

3240
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:09,740
Yeah.

3241
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:14,740
Like mining runite, or for the first time, it was like a milestone in my RuneScape career.

3242
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:18,740
Not that it's a career just sort of like, since I was young, I was wanting to do it.

3243
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:22,740
I've got a feeling this is going to consume the rest of your life, kid.

3244
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,740
Oh, my God.

3245
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:25,740
You're going to be at this.

3246
02:25:25,740 --> 02:25:28,740
This is the grind, the new Sigma grind set.

3247
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:37,740
I kind of want, I kind of luckily Outer Wilds, but I haven't, just haven't, I haven't clicked on it yet.

3248
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:40,740
But I want to, because it sounded really cool.

3249
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:45,740
You described it in a way that made it sound real neat and nifty, so.

3250
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:46,740
You should click on it.

3251
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:47,740
Definitely want to check it out.

3252
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:51,740
As soon as, as soon as this is, we finished here.

3253
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:52,740
No, I gotta get worked.

3254
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:57,740
Maybe, maybe after I edit for a while and I feel like I can't do anymore.

3255
02:25:57,740 --> 02:26:01,740
I'll use, you use it as a, as a carrot on a stick.

3256
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

3257
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:03,740
For you, this is the morning.

3258
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:04,740
Yeah, pretty much.

3259
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:05,740
Makes sense.

3260
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:10,740
I often have the thing where like after the PCP is done for the day, I like get nothing done

3261
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:13,740
for the rest of the day and I hate that.

3262
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:17,740
I fall, I fall into the trap of like, I already did my stuff for the day, even though I then

3263
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:20,740
have like most of the day left afterwards.

3264
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:22,740
Yeah.

3265
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:27,740
I mean, for me, I always classify weekends as like no work required.

3266
02:26:27,740 --> 02:26:28,740
Oh.

3267
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:30,740
In fact, in fact, no work allowed.

3268
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:33,740
I can't, like, I can't do it.

3269
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:34,740
Yeah.

3270
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:35,740
Other than.

3271
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:38,740
So it's like forced rest and it's, it works.

3272
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:40,740
I don't feel stressed during the weekend.

3273
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:41,740
Other than.

3274
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:44,740
And then when Monday comes around, I'm like, right, let's try and do something.

3275
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:45,740
That's good.

3276
02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:49,740
Other, other than Sunday for PCP, I don't really distinguish days of the week.

3277
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:55,740
Like my, my Saturday is the same as my Monday pretty much most of the time.

3278
02:26:56,740 --> 02:27:00,740
So, you know, it's probably healthy.

3279
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,740
I think it helps.

3280
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:02,740
It's probably healthier to have.

3281
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:03,740
Yeah.

3282
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:05,740
A designated weekend.

3283
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:06,740
Yeah.

3284
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:13,740
Cause it's, this is what I was saying a few, like weeks ago, the whole resting being very

3285
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:14,740
important.

3286
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:17,740
And if you're thinking about work, you're not resting.

3287
02:27:17,740 --> 02:27:23,740
And so like having a routine where it's normal and accepted and good that you don't work

3288
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:26,740
makes it easier for you to rest on that day.

3289
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:32,740
Instead, I will sort of just kind of work on a day that I can make myself do it and

3290
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:34,740
I'll just do that for as many days as I can.

3291
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:40,740
And then there will eventually come a day where I'm like, I let, I let something else

3292
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:43,740
distract me and then I don't do anything for that day.

3293
02:27:43,740 --> 02:27:46,740
And then I'll get on a, on a, on a roll of like, okay.

3294
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:51,740
So for the, for the next few days, I won't do anything until eventually I feel bad enough

3295
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,740
and I'm like, oh God, how many I've wasted like three days.

3296
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:56,740
I haven't worked on it in like four days.

3297
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:57,740
Like, uh, terrible.

3298
02:27:57,740 --> 02:27:58,740
What a waste.

3299
02:27:58,740 --> 02:27:59,740
And then I'll.
