1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now, it's so addis-

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:42,080
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,720
And we got Nate Boy.

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,840
Maybe it's deeply repressed inner rage. I can relate to that. Hello everyone.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,240
It's like when the anime girls kind of smile and they're like happy and hello, but then

6
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
you see the aura.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,320
It's like that dope sakura, like inner sakura. It's inner mage. Inner mage is rage. So there's

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
mage and then rage.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
On the inside.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,360
She's called leaf, he'll stop changing my lore.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,680
No, I'm making the lore right now. It's new, it's brand new. HD remix changed all that

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,040
code and it made the aspect ratio change the gameplay.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,160
From its natural Lithuanian into English is now, lethal is rage now.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,840
It's also a bit crunched and bit stretched and re-resed and re-uploaded and resized.

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
60 FPS.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,240
Featuring Dante from the Devil May Crackers.

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,720
Well, okay, Tom, you're actually mad about something we want to hear about.

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Alright, alright.

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
So what's that?

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Let me tell you my story. This is like the pettiest rage, but it is rage and it pisses

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,840
me off. So I, as you know, me and Digi have this I Am Games channel and so I've been slowly

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,720
but surely acquiring more gaming things just to make the entire process more easy to do.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,120
Like I spent all this time getting like a dedicated streaming thing set up and we have

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,440
like a server that has like 8 terabytes of storage so we can easily dump footage and crap

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,880
on there and any computer can access it and all that stuff.

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,840
But I'm also bringing all my game stuff because despite the title of the show, Digi is not

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:18,880
games, alright? He's not good at video games so I'm going to have to pick up all the slack

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,560
to make our show title not bullshit.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I Am Fraud.

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,240
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I, the reason it's called I Am Games and not we are games is

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,840
because I'm the only one who's games.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,920
I Am Games and not so games.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,720
Exactly. He's not games at all.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,440
This show is counterfeit.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give us money anyways. So um, brought all of my games over, brought

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,160
all that shit but one of the things I kept forgetting was my switch dock because initially

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,120
I just put like the essentials in my car because I'm like I'm never going to use the switch

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
dock because I don't have a TV in there.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,400
So but then once Digi's like just come bum at my house I'm like fine. So then all of

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,720
a sudden all this shit I ignored is now necessary again.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Yes.

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,240
I was thinking of maybe doing a video on Splatoon 2 for I Am Games and why it's like

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,360
I'll play the best multiplayer game ever and so I needed a pro controller but I didn't

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,560
want to spend a lot of money because I knew I wasn't going to use a pro controller all

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,560
that often because I find the Joy-Cons very comfortable.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
Like if I, I like kind of just sitting on the couch without the grip and just having

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,720
one in each hand just kind of chilling and be like yeah I'm just playing a fucking video.

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,400
Do you use the little stand and prop it up on a table or something?

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,120
No, I mean if I'm playing like in handheld mode I will just put it on the TV in the dock

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,600
but when I'm just kind of chilling like on the couch I'll just pull the Joy-Cons off

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,840
and I won't put them in the grip. I'll just hold one in each hand and just kind of just

52
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
relax.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,880
Wait but where's the screen? But where's the screen in this situation?

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,280
Oh that would be in the dock on the TV.

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,400
Oh oh it's oh okay alright.

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,840
Yeah so that's when I'm playing it in docked mode. In handheld mode I'll just play it in

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
handheld mode.

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,720
So I was like I need a new controller because I know in case Digi wants to play he wanted

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,360
an actual controller and if I want to play Splatoon 2 well for footage I'm gonna have

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,240
to like actually have a real controller.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,680
So I went in to Walmart because I just happened to be there and I'm like I'm gonna get a controller

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,520
while I'm here but they're like $60 and I wasn't feeling that but I saw they also had wired

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:21,160
versions for $25 and I was like that's way better and it's like a Splatoon version of

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,360
the controller. I'm like this is like systematically relevant everything and it looks super fucking

65
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,800
cool. I'll put a picture up and I'll put it in the show notes or whatever so you can see

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,520
what it looks like because it looks dope as fuck.

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,800
So it's like alright and it's like Nintendo like made like a cheaper version for poor people.

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,040
I like it so I bought it and then I brought it home and I unboxed it and I realized I

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,640
made an error and the error is that it is not a Nintendo branded controller. They just

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,320
they used the Nintendo Switch logo and used the exact same design packaging as all the

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,520
other first party Switch accessories to make retards like me think it was first party and

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,240
then they have their logo is called Power A but it's designed on the package to look

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,760
just like a Nintendo logo because it's in like the kind of like rounded design. So when

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,920
you just look at it quickly like I did it reads exactly like a first party controller

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,840
and it has like all the right logos and everything on there and I was totally fucking livid because

76
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,320
I gave these motherfuckers who I don't even I haven't even tested this yet it could be

77
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,560
a piece of shit and I have no idea. It feels nice but but it's not Nintendo and I don't

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,720
buy third party controllers because they're always trash.

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,880
Okay so you got got by the marketing but it's possible it still works well.

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,880
It could be good. I don't know. I know I can definitely tell by holding it it probably

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,920
doesn't have like rumble or anything built in because it's very light but I don't really

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,560
care too much about rumble as long as the aiming is better so I don't look like an idiot

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,680
trying to play on IM games but I'm mad because it looks so cool and it has all the Splatoon

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,760
logos and it had the Nintendo Switch logo on the packaging and it looks straight up like

85
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,360
a Nintendo thing but they fooled me and I'm gonna burn this company to the ground. Power

86
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,400
A I'm coming for you. I'm gonna use my fucking power to shove it up your a-hole.

87
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,840
I definitely want to see a picture of this in the show notes or whatever.

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Yeah I will.

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Sounds fascinating.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,400
I think like third party control I mean clearly they're they're being sneaky fucks and that's

91
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,920
not good but third party controllers are often you know good enough and I have a story.

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,120
I'd like to know whether it whether or not like update us on whether it works.

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,160
There's a sweet spot between the like just the up price because it's first party and

94
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,920
the like low point of just like an actually shitty right.

95
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,800
I have a small story also like so me and my boyfriend we have a

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Xbox controllers for our PCs and they're pretty good but like they're getting on in

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,400
years and the wires are just like disconnecting from time to time so we decided to buy some

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,880
new controllers and we found some sort of like slightly cheaper ones and we bought them

99
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,880
and it turns out they were third party even though they looked exactly like the original

100
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Xbox.

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,560
It just they didn't have that here.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,160
Yeah they didn't they didn't have the X of where the Xbox was supposed to be the box

103
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
controller.

104
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
I hate when they do that to me.

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
The thing that amazed me.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Oh wait.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah.

108
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,920
Just quickly and both of the controllers have bugs in them and it was so annoying.

109
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Wait.

110
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,560
Actual literal bugs like creepy crawlies are like when one of them had like the button

111
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,600
was to it's like an actual like ant farm.

112
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Now that would be cool.

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
I wouldn't complain about that.

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
Why would you not complain about that?

115
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,600
But I like ants and ant farms.

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
This is a cool thing.

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
I would like to have an ant farm.

118
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,520
Then you should be on the next bonus episode made.

119
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Just all I'm saying.

120
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
I won't say any more than that.

121
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
I know.

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
I will be.

123
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Shit.

124
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,040
This is for the viewers mage.

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
It's for the viewers.

126
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Yeah.

127
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,240
My thing that pissed the reason I was so pissed is not because it's a third party controller.

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,320
It's because I was purchased under false pretenses.

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,640
If I said oh it's a third party controller that's why it's cheaper.

130
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,720
And it was like you remember back in the day when you bought like a mad cat's controller

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,040
because you were like 10 and your parents wouldn't spend the full money you're like at least

132
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
I know what I'm getting into.

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,080
It's clearly has like that obnoxious mad cat's logo with the paw and like the claw marks.

134
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
And you knew it wasn't legit.

135
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,520
This was lying to me.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,440
And that's where my disdain comes from.

137
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,800
And you bought this in Walmart right?

138
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Yes.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah.

140
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay.

141
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,680
It was with all the Nintendo accessories like all like the official controllers and

142
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,960
everything and right there it was just sitting there.

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
It wasn't off to the side.

144
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
It was among them.

145
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,360
It makes me think even the people who stocked it were confused.

146
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,480
I would not be shocked.

147
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,720
And I'm ready to go to war with this company.

148
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
Power A I'm coming for you.

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
You're gonna die.

150
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,760
I just want to say that fucking mad cats every time mad cats gets brought up I always have

151
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,160
to say my funny little little quip that mad cats is good and I don't know why people hate

152
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
it.

153
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,040
That was very funny.

154
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,120
It's funny because it's true.

155
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,120
I've had like the one PlayStation 2 controller that has survived since I was a child is the

156
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
mad cat's one.

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
All the others broke.

158
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Well okay.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,360
And the official ones died.

160
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes.

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Really?

162
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I had to buy a new one.

163
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
They're still going strong.

164
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Kind of recently.

165
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,840
Except for the ones that I smash in a rage when playing Soul Calibur 2.

166
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,360
I was gonna say is it because the other ones were launched through the TV in a bout of

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
impotent rage at Dark Souls or you know some other game.

168
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,720
That's on my diet.

169
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
That's unrelated.

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,040
That's not that's you know.

171
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
No they survived all of that.

172
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
It was for other reasons.

173
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Other reasons.

174
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Yeah.

175
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Yeah.

176
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Okay.

177
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Those ants all over them.

178
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,560
They took them out of my picnic basket and they.

179
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,520
Hey I do want to say though the the the I know I say this all the time but like my Nintendo

180
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Switch pro controller it's like the actual on-brand one.

181
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,440
Like I actually love it and it's one of my favorite controllers ever.

182
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Man.

183
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
It feels great.

184
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Okay.

185
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Here's actually a question about the pro controller.

186
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,920
The pro controller itself has the analog sticks like on the same side right.

187
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,600
Like they're like on each side and then the buttons are below it because like.

188
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,240
No actually no it's set up the way that switches with like on the left the the the thumb stick

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,120
is up top on the right down below that is that is the proper way to have those.

190
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,040
That's one thing that still pisses me off about PlayStation controllers that the analog

191
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,120
sticks are too close to each other and I'm not five and my hands need more clearance

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
than that.

193
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,760
This controller has them set up properly which is why I'm okay with it.

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,480
They're offset ever since the OG Xbox did that that should have become the standard.

195
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,000
I think that PlayStation just got so like the layout of the PlayStation control is kind

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
of like on brand.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It is.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think they just don't want to change it.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,400
But I still don't like it as much and that's as a hardcore Sony fanboy.

200
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,200
That's my one point of contention.

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,040
It's like you got to give props to for Sony to like for implementing the DualShox system

202
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,000
because they invented it and it's totally awesome but like they got a little bit it's

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,320
like when you invent something but then someone else makes a better version like you want

204
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,880
to stick with this like one that you made because it's like the special one that's special

205
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,920
to you and shit but really there's probably better ways to be doing things that other

206
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
people figure out.

207
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,240
There's like a third party that did make a PlayStation 4 controller that is just an

208
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Xbox controller that works in PlayStation and I'm very tempted to try it at some point.

209
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Well that's dope.

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Maybe some but I don't play shooters on PlayStation so it really doesn't matter at that point.

211
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,320
Tom let's please play Splatoon with me online.

212
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,960
I want to play Splatoon with someone.

213
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Do you have Nintendo online since you have to pay now?

214
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,880
I got the one week free trial that I probably already like I was complaining about the fact

215
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,640
that I had to pay for it on I Am Games and someone DM'd me yesterday and said oh I have

216
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,040
the part they're like family plan just give me your email and I'll add you so now I have

217
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
what dude.

218
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Yeah they just they added me for free.

219
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
I'm like you're a fucking hero.

220
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
Adopt me and get me on your family plan too.

221
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,320
I want to be your son sir.

222
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Maybe you should you should you should ask them I'll see if they said they have like

223
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,960
three slots open and nothing to do with them so they might actually put me in your slot

224
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,240
friend put me in your fucking slot I will wait to hear from you whoever you are out there

225
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,400
because I was I was about to buy it the other day and you know what like it's $20 for a year

226
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,720
like it sucks that we have to pay and it's utterly retarded but like okay I can afford

227
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,720
that I can afford $20 and you get NES games which I guess but the NES lineup is really

228
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,640
shit but at least it's something.

229
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,920
It is it's more than absolutely zero I guess so I mean I would just emulate any of those

230
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,400
games but you know whatever you know sometimes you know there's a thing where like that we

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,800
have infinite games our disposal via emulators basically but like I don't actually play like

232
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,680
any of those games just because I don't think about them and I don't like come up that's

233
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,840
it's Nintendo can just prompt me on my switch when they like hey we just downloaded like

234
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,400
I don't know Excitebike for you I've never played Excitebike that's in Smash Bros.

235
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,960
Let me see what the fucking excitement's about.

236
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,680
It's funny because me and Digi were talking about this on IM Games about how yeah when

237
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,160
emulators like became a thing and I did the same thing with my DS because I had like the

238
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,480
flash card that let you just like down I love my flash card on my DS yeah it's just like

239
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
you play a game for like 20 minutes like oh I wonder what else I can play and then you

240
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,640
get spoiled yeah fucking spoiled when you never follow through but when you were 10 and you

241
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,040
had an N64 you played Star Fox 64 for years because that's all you had and you had to

242
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
make it work.

243
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,640
I see this as a possible death of humanity like that like access to infinite information

244
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,040
will make us all like not give a shit about anything.

245
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,800
I call it death by decadence we've become so fucking privileged to have all this entertainment

246
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,240
at our fingertips so we don't value any of it anymore.

247
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,360
That's what killed the Roman Empire as I recall something like that.

248
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,560
By the way Gibb appears to have just died oh excuse me oh no I really hope he didn't

249
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,520
restart his audio because I don't feel like editing more than that.

250
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,000
It would just be his internet.

251
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Well okay well let's let him go and we'll see if he joins back.

252
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,480
I did have another subject to bring it's a totally left turn from here.

253
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Go for it man.

254
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
I'm done.

255
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I rage is vented.

256
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
I feel better.

257
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Good.

258
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:05,080
So I just got back I took me and the lady and the dog went to a place nearby at her at

259
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,480
her suggestion a place called Findlay Market in Cincinnati it's like a it's like an open

260
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,240
air market and it's very similar to I think it's Quincy Market in Boston Tom you know

261
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,400
the one I'm talking about that that place Munchie takes us to and we went to it's got

262
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,600
like that Dix last resort and all those whatever the market is in Boston I can't remember Findlay

263
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,840
Market is like that in Cincinnati and I just we were there and we were there for like an

264
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,480
hour or two and we walked around we had the dog it was fun and like the point I'm trying

265
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,240
to get to with this was I had such a wonderful time just like being out among normal human

266
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,120
beings and like experiencing what it's like to just be a normal human not trapped on the

267
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,760
internet you know just slowly seeking or allowing my life to have away into the electronic data

268
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
sphere.

269
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,320
Um everyone was just like cool and we got delicious food and it was just a great time

270
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,160
and I saw human beings like being nice to each other and I'm just like the internet

271
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,520
is so shit uh like Twitter and all these like people sniping each other with like uh fucking

272
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,040
videos attacking other people and and all that stuff I hate all that hey get hey welcome

273
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
welcome.

274
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,760
Don't you hate it when you disconnect at the exact moment where you think you like people

275
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,280
have stepped aside to let you speak and then you say something for a while and.

276
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
That is unfortunate.

277
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,480
Do you want to finish a point or anything?

278
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,720
Uh I was just gonna ask uh how big can a Nintendo family be on the online thing.

279
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I believe it's up to eight people.

280
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I think you guys have three.

281
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh.

282
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh eight.

283
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
It's eight.

284
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Yeah okay.

285
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
It's eight.

286
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
This man should legally adopt me.

287
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Yes.

288
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,920
That's what should happen.

289
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
What's happening now then?

290
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,520
Well give I just brought up that I just got back from this place called Findlay Market

291
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,240
which is like remember that open-air market in Boston that we all went to and hung out

292
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,840
with that Munchie brought us to you know.

293
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Uh yeah.

294
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
You know what I'm talking about.

295
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,640
Well whatever like I had been there before when I was young but I just remember I associate

296
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,680
with Munchie now um but like I went to I just found one Michelle found one uh from a friend

297
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,760
uh in Cincinnati called Findlay Market and like I just had such a great time just hanging

298
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,320
out me and her and the dog walking around and just like doing stuff we're gonna go dude

299
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,560
okay here's an amazing thing it's pretty close to the University of Cincinnati which

300
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,840
is like a pretty pretty nice thing it draws a lot of tourists and stuff.

301
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:37,160
There are just this is real this is real there are just electronic scooters around this market

302
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,640
that they just leave for anyone to just use and when you're done you simply just like

303
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,440
leave it on the sidewalk you don't like put it anywhere specifically and just walk away

304
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,960
and you're done and that's it and then someone else can just take it and use it for a while

305
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,200
and apparently the system just like works great and I guess they don't get stolen extremely

306
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
quickly.

307
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,040
So this is me a story I was told by my sister's boyfriend's husband actually right now.

308
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,400
Do you see her boyfriend's husband?

309
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,640
No my my sister's boyfriend but he's a husband now I remember they got married.

310
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Oh right.

311
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,560
Yeah so so like her boyfriend has a husband it's a very complicated relationship.

312
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Yeah.

313
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
No.

314
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Anywho so so in the opinion they apparently had a similar sort of setup system with orange

315
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,240
bikes and that they were gonna you know all you just gonna take with the bike and you

316
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,520
know you place it down and someone else can use it yada yada but apparently it backfired

317
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,680
so badly because all the bikes got stolen and repainted and I just I just thought what

318
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
did you expect?

319
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Google does the same thing.

320
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,520
That's what I would expect too.

321
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,200
The thing is though they're actually like this scooter thing is like specifically for

322
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,960
this marketplace Finlay market but around UC University of Cincinnati like there's a

323
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,920
system of like these red bikes because it's like red is like the color of UC and whatever.

324
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,760
There's like tons of like these red bike rental booths where you you know you put in quarter

325
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
and you take like the bike out or whatever and then you just return it to like because

326
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,040
there's lots of stations to like dock them.

327
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,720
So those have like a pickup and drop off point these scooters do not which is true like who

328
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,040
charges them at the end of the day.

329
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,880
I know they're not but every time you say scooter I just imagine people on razor scooters

330
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,680
and shit and it's evidently funny to me and you know what you know I know I'm on a tangent

331
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,760
here but this just reminds me of like before we went you know I did I mention that for

332
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Michelle's birthday I bought her like a boosted board type electric skateboard yeah it's called

333
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,160
it's an Adam is the brand but it's dope like I just for fun I just put on my helmet went

334
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,080
outside and just like skateboarded around and had such a great time.

335
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Just like doing things in real life is like fun and good you guys I just want to let you

336
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
know.

337
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,320
I can't believe you that sounds that sounds terrifying to me.

338
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
It's great.

339
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I love it.

340
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Maybe.

341
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
I'll consider that.

342
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Dude okay it's like imagine Pokemon Go but like without the phone and just like but you

343
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,840
leave the real life there and like that's what it is like imagine that I don't know about

344
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
that.

345
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,440
I actually did regret not bringing my Pokemon Go.

346
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,920
I mean I I don't know my general like location in the world is like kind of boring if just

347
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,080
to walk around electric skateboard you can make it fun by just scooting.

348
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,480
Yeah but there's like this is like Casey Neistat just does what he does he has his electric

349
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,240
skateboard and he's he's it makes everything more fun maybe Casey Neistat has been called

350
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,800
a professional fun haver which I think is a very accurate title man but I like him.

351
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,040
Like it's just like everything around is just suburban houses for miles because we're on

352
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
the edge of London.

353
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,560
Literally dab on them on your electric skateboard as you cruise by it's just it's just nothing

354
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:01,480
much like like if I went into London if I went if I went into London then I would be

355
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,880
like I can see like stuff happening like there's people and there's buildings and it's cool

356
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
and there's a river.

357
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I love rivers.

358
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
I love looking at the river.

359
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,720
I love looking at the river when when the sun's going down and it's shimmery shining all

360
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
over it.

361
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
That's good.

362
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,960
Oh that reminds me while I was heading back home to England I was in London waiting for

363
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,960
my train and I saw a guy that looked kind of like you just a little bit taller and I just

364
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,560
I dropped kicked him.

365
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,600
No he was on the opposite side of the of the track so you wanted to drop kick him but you

366
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
didn't have the opportunity.

367
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,960
Got a running start in this fucking power kick.

368
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,760
Launched across the track.

369
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,680
I stared at him like with squinty eyes I was like is that is that hippo is that no that

370
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
can be hippo.

371
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:51,640
Oh I saw I saw Digi in May out at just at this market and by that I mean there was just

372
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,720
a big bearded guy with Lenin shades and some girl with him and I was like there they are

373
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
that's them.

374
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Disgusting.

375
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,120
Shout out to all these fakers at the King Richard's Fair right now I believe is where

376
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
they actually were.

377
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Oh King Richard's Fair going on.

378
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,560
I think that's where they are right now they went to some sort of medieval fair and I was

379
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
supposed to go.

380
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Oh that's dope.

381
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
That's dope.

382
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
We should talk about that.

383
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Yeah.

384
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I love where King Richard's Fair is going.

385
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,920
I went once back in a day when I was a wee lad and it was the funnest ship it was super

386
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
fucking cool.

387
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Yeah.

388
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,360
Jousting is awesome and it should not have gone away.

389
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,920
In fact we should have just adapted to the times.

390
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah we do that now on electric skateboards might do.

391
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,720
I was going to say we should just have people in fucking cars or motorcycles jousting.

392
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Yeah that's it.

393
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
That'd be fucking sick.

394
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Like modern.

395
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,080
That'd be a good video game so how much would you make that make a video game that's just

396
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,640
like jousting 2089 or something or like you get like shiny red boxing gloves on a boosted

397
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,080
board you go as fast as you possibly can and it's like that'd be dope and you just try

398
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
to knock the other person out.

399
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Tony Hawk's pro jousting.

400
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Let's do it.

401
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Hell yeah.

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,640
Hey I think I've told all my interesting King Richard's fair stories but like that's

403
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
where I got my ridiculous $100 floppy vampire 100D hat which is a complete goof.

404
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,640
I have to get that hat sent to me by my mom sometime.

405
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
You really do.

406
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
It needs to be in the next raton.

407
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,600
And take a picture with it.

408
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,520
Oh actually my mom is coming to visit me soon and she's bringing a certain key shaped item

409
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,920
that's of particular significance to me which I cannot wait to have for various purposes.

410
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,400
I can only imagine.

411
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Yeah.

412
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,560
Or is it a key shaped item or is it a key shaped item?

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
It's a key.

414
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,720
No it actually is a key shaped item because it's distinctly not the key shaped.

415
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,320
That would be more of like a sword.

416
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,560
And what was I going to say?

417
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Whatever.

418
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,440
Get the D hat while you're at it.

419
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,600
Oh King Richard's fair.

420
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,440
I was just going to say about that.

421
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,720
Did I talk about that time that me and my friends were at King Richard's fair.

422
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
We were in high school at the time.

423
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,160
I was like 15.

424
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,520
And like just like one of the court gestures at the fair comes up and is like hey my strapping

425
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,320
young, young, young, young lords.

426
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,680
How dost thou wish to partake of this quest to be knighted by ye old king?

427
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,600
And we're like yeah Nibba whatever you say.

428
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,200
And so we did this quest.

429
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
It was a scavenger hunt.

430
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
We had to go around.

431
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,000
It was me and like two of my friends.

432
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,080
I think Colin and like Nick or something.

433
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,480
I forget who I was with.

434
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,000
And we just went up to like stall vendors and they would give us quests.

435
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,440
They would give us little tasks to do.

436
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,720
But the thing was like they were definitely making them up as they went along.

437
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,600
They just like had like a stamp or something we had to get from them.

438
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,200
And so go kill that guy.

439
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,120
Kill these homeless people there then mucking up the joint.

440
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,160
They were things like do a jig or like like sing a song.

441
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,600
At one point someone just said like hey sing a song.

442
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,080
And by the way I had my really long hair at this point so I already looked like a strange

443
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
cryptid individual.

444
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,160
And this one lady who was like the beer wench or something she asked us to sing a song and

445
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,400
I was like guys what should we sing?

446
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,600
They're like I don't know.

447
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,720
And so I busted out a rendition of Yellow Submarine.

448
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
A rousing.

449
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,240
I don't know it was like the song of note at that time in our lives for whatever reason.

450
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,160
So I think we sang it at Boy Scout meetings a lot.

451
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,240
So I sang Yellow Submarine and the lady was so impressed by my rendition that she was

452
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,720
like dude you should like work here.

453
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,800
She like broke character and like told me I should like get a job and I was like well

454
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
thank you.

455
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I appreciate that.

456
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,280
You could be like what's it called a minstrel?

457
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,960
A minstrel yeah I could definitely be a minstrel or a game wizard.

458
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,320
And if you took that job you'd be singing Yellow Submarine to this day at that fair.

459
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
That's true.

460
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
I'm trapped.

461
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I can't.

462
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,160
Think about it you could have been in real life all the time.

463
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,120
So the end of this tale is we went around we did like 10 of these incredibly humiliating

464
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
tasks.

465
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,660
One was like run as fast as you can around the entire fairground.

466
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:09,960
So catch me like age 15 with my longass hair sprinting at top speed around these like knights

467
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,200
Gestures and wizards and just you know people in like weird steampunk and goth clothing because for some reason those people are attracted to

468
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,180
medieval fairs

469
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,560
And and then you know we got all the stamps

470
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,120
so we go to like the the ceremony at the end and we were like we're waiting for a while because we go to like where like the

471
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
end line is and

472
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,360
Like this guy's like yeah, the like the nighting ceremony is at you know X time. We're like, okay

473
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,440
Well, we'll just chill and so the the a horrible realization dawns on us as we

474
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,120
Like the people start to file in as the as the rose like in front of the stage where the person's gonna come out begin to fill with

475
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Incredibly young children

476
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:57,920
Five and six maybe up to like ten and we're just kind of standing in the back like what what is what's happening right now and

477
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,640
Outcomes like the king which I believe is the actual like guys playing the king of King Richard's Fair

478
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
He's just like oh my noble knights

479
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,800
Thank you for doing this quest come forth on stage me hearties and be crowned lords of

480
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,360
Cinder or whatever. He loves Dark Souls

481
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,160
I would say Dark Souls theme Renaissance fair that would that would be incredible

482
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,000
So you are like the oldest people there

483
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,400
We were like by ten years or so the oldest people doing the whole thing six like I like the fucking court jester played the ultimate prank on

484
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,540
Us by getting us to do this fucking nighting ceremony that was for babies

485
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,680
And no one along the entire time said like aren't you guys a little old to be doing this like this is for actual babies

486
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,360
Why are you but no this me and my two friends were deeply humiliated we walk up nighted like yeah

487
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,880
We're so good at doing quests and being cool guys

488
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:58,600
And we get knighted which was fine. I guess that's why until this last past week. They never went to real life ever again

489
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,520
That's right. That's exactly it. Yeah, it was deeply embarrassing, but you know, it's okay, but you're a knight now

490
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah, it does and I'm a literal knight now

491
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,840
I I want to what's the I want to exert my my right to

492
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,240
To say the thing we're allowed to fuck a guy's wife after he gets married, you know, because you're the Lord or whatever

493
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
It's called America

494
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We're bringing it back, baby

495
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,040
That's the main conservative platform I think to reinstate that policy. I agree. Um, yeah, well, that's my story

496
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:44,480
Speaking speaking of real life in general a little bit of a follow-up to last episode where I was talking about like the cgp

497
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Gray thing of like getting rid of distractions internet-based

498
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,400
Things such as websites and podcasts and stuff

499
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,840
I have stopped listening to all podcasts including hello internet even though I really like it and

500
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,240
I've downloaded this thing onto my onto my computer onto chrome

501
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,180
Which is like a a task focus assistant thing which

502
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,120
It doesn't block sites. I can still type them in but when I go there it immediately comes up with a notification saying

503
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,440
You're not supposed to be here

504
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,280
Here's what you're supposed to be doing and it lists the tasks that I've listed for that day or any tasks that I have not finished

505
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,120
And at the moment my task is do bail jpew stupid idiot and that keeps coming up every time I go to Twitter and I'm like, ah

506
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:42,280
Yeah, you know, I could I could click like right click on the top right and find the thing to settings and then I'm like

507
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,880
Match Twitter from the list of sites that get you know blocked or yeah, yeah, but then that there's too much effort

508
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,440
So I'm like fine like and I it has been helpful in just not

509
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,960
Making me go to Twitter and and read it and stuff

510
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,560
We should we should steal that technology and make our own

511
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,640
Application that does that and called the like the procrastinators branded anti procrastination tool and when you go to a site that like isn't the

512
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,960
Why did you just play you're supposed to be working right now?

513
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Yeah, we actually should but

514
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:24,100
But like yeah, I mean we definitely should because this this app is insidious. It's it's really it's really

515
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
It's got a devious twist to it

516
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,480
because

517
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,040
After a certain amount of time after a certain amount of like site blocking activity

518
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,880
It jumps in and says well, you know, we've blocked sites for a little while

519
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,360
But if you want to block sites forever, you're gonna have to pay you're gonna have to pay a monthly fee

520
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,520
That's so fucked up that it would do that and I'm like I'm it's there's so many other apps that do what you do

521
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,120
With just a little bit less flair, but they just they block URLs and that's fine

522
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
And this one just had a nice like

523
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,160
Focus task list built into it and they expect me to to not go to something else

524
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,880
Like why would it's it's stupid? I'm not gonna pay money

525
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,120
I'm not gonna pay money for the privilege of me being unable to go to certain places

526
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah, it's tough to motivate that I

527
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,280
Don't I don't think that thing would work on me because I have like an incredible

528
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,240
Rebellious streak of like when you'd someone tells me not to do something. I'd be like screw you. I'm gonna do the thing now

529
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,160
You just need the opposite that you're like, yeah, fuck you mage

530
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,160
You're not gonna work on your shit today. You're like, yeah, watch me bitch

531
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,080
This reminds me. I don't know. Maybe this will be gross for people. I don't know

532
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,360
It's not that big a thing, but it's like this reminds me when I was young like I to this day

533
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,240
I still bite my nails a ton and it's it's gross and I always say it's the worst thing about me that I bite my nails so much

534
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,080
but

535
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,720
In fact, I'm doing it literally right now. I have a peak. I have pliers not pliers

536
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,920
What is it nail clippers? No, they're not nail like I have like a little edge trimmer's

537
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,920
It's a tweezers. I have tweezers in my hand right now. I was picking in my hands with I'm gonna put it down and stop doing it

538
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Okay, but what I was doing or what I was saying was like when I was young my mom really she was good

539
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,240
She tried to head this off at the pass and like stopped me biting my nails then because she knew if she got got me when I was young

540
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I wouldn't do it, but it's way too late now

541
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,360
and so she bought the stuff that was like

542
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Like it's it's nail polish that just like tastes bad

543
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,960
And the point of it is just you put it on your nails and when you taste it you're like, oh shit

544
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,300
I shouldn't be doing this right now. The problem was you got addicted to that taste

545
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,920
Basically, it wasn't that I like would it was addicted, but it's like biting my nails is like super fun

546
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,040
Like I love doing it. It's just like it's super fucked up and strange, but I get a like picking a scab

547
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,200
It's it's just something I can do anytime and it's really gross and disgusting

548
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
But I do it anyway

549
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,120
And so like this this was just what it's supposed to do is remind you that you need to stop like that

550
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,120
This this nail polish is designed to just remind your brain like hey remember you shouldn't be doing this

551
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,800
Don't do this unconsciously, but my will to do it is active and powerful

552
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,560
Because it just is fun being the basket

553
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:22,120
We're just like this is now painful. This is a challenge. I need to overcome it kind of yeah kind of yeah

554
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,840
I all right

555
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,560
I may have said this on the rebellious spirit mage on this podcast before but yeah the way to combat any and all like nail

556
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,920
fidgeting like things yeah is to start playing guitar

557
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,800
Because having long nails is absolutely, you know the wrong thing

558
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,720
You can't have long nails at any point and you know get into a habit of just cutting them

559
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,640
Really short all the time my nails are already incredibly short though because I just how do you so much?

560
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,200
Yeah, but also a better way to keep them short. I actually tutorial on Phil Collins

561
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,360
No, yeah, it was no wasn't Phil Collins

562
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,760
It was I was confused him with this other guy that my dad likes from likes from like main or something

563
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,360
She had I can't remember but he the point is he had a long thumbnail for picking them strings on the guitar

564
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,600
Some nail he was signed by fucking Apple records. He like met Paul McCartney. What's his name?

565
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,720
He's like rockabye sweet, baby James Taylor. That's it. Okay, just want to remember that name

566
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,840
Okay, I actually if a funny that hippo brings up like the clipping of the nails thing

567
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,480
Because like I I also used to have like a nail biting problem not too big

568
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,120
But it was a bit of an issue

569
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,120
But the way I grew out of it is because it is when when I turned like 12 or 13

570
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,640
I realized when I grow out of my nails, they kind of look nice

571
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:44,360
so I decided to start growing out my nails and I never buy with my nails since and I grow out my nails and they look

572
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,560
Really cool and like scary and I like that

573
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,120
there's some of this much under reported female privilege because because there is a societal

574
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,080
Expectation to look not disgusting and terrible unlike the ghouls that are men in the society

575
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,920
You were given an incentive to improve your nail hygiene unlike me

576
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,400
I mean, I just it just looked nice for me personally

577
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,040
I mean, I thought that people expected me to look nice. I already had nice nails

578
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,320
So I guess I was born with the privilege of having

579
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,500
I never like bit my nails

580
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,380
One time one time I heard that that was the thing and I tried biting my nails and it was like that

581
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,540
How do you supposed to get a grip on that? That's that that's too much. Oh, you just get in there and you fuck

582
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,980
I just know but like instead of that

583
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,780
I would I would pick at my nails with my other nails, you know, yeah, okay

584
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
I would rip them off like that

585
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,860
We're talking about biting nails because when I was a young lad in like second grade

586
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,540
I thought that my nails were

587
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:51,460
Deformed and the reason I did is because everyone around me bit their nails and I didn't I thought that's what normal nails looked like

588
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,100
And mine always looks like different and I was like why what what happened?

589
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,260
Why are my hands so fucked up and it took forever for me to realize? Oh, I'm just not an autist like everyone

590
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,700
That reminds me of you ever watch you know report of the week, you know report of the week the youtuber

591
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,620
I do not enlighten me. Okay. He's a very pale strange cryptid of a man

592
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,540
Who wears a suit every day of his life vastly oversized ill-fitting suit and slicks his hair back

593
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,500
Yeah, he loves vintage fashion. Yeah, that guy and he does he does fast food and energy to drink reviews. Whoa

594
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,060
And I love him. It's hello everyone. Welcome to running on empty

595
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,980
Yeah, that sounds like him that's the sort of shit he does with his life for some reason

596
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,740
But I mean he's got like a million subscribers or whatever, but the point is

597
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,220
He he famously among his many quirks and strange things about his appearance and a personality

598
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,780
Is that he has very long fingernails and they people describe those vampire ish and skeletal

599
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,780
And it at some point it's a bigger issue

600
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,060
You know, I guess not but okay, maybe vampire

601
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,180
Vampiric dammit. All right, and he made a video addressing it at some point

602
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,740
It's like well, I just happened to like having long nails. I'm just there's no need to fuss

603
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,020
There's no need to muss. I just like my nails this way and that's all there is to say

604
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,300
He is a weird guy, but I like him a lot I like him a lot

605
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,180
He occasionally beefs with Anthony Fantano in a completely one-sided way

606
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,900
Nate since I know you had long hair. Did you ever had like the quirk of like?

607
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,980
Chewing on your hair, you know, I know some people did I never had that I never had that I had that for a while

608
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,820
I don't know how it got out of it, but I'm glad I I did that a little bit

609
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,740
I didn't chew on it, but I just would put it in my mouth. Yeah. Yeah

610
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,580
When I was young, this is just semi-relevant when I was a very young

611
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,140
I had a blankie and would suck my thumb

612
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,140
Excessively and paired this blankie with me everywhere. This is such an embarrassing episode

613
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,540
This is fine. I was so young. I'm not embarrassed by it at this point

614
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,180
Last week so we can this is last week. Yeah, I'm a totally different person

615
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:14,180
What is embarrassing though is that I would do weird fucked-up shit with that blanket like like shove it up my nose a little bit and like

616
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,060
Yeah, it was weird. All right. All right get this was the weirdest thing about that blankie

617
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,900
Here's what I would do like I had this blank since I was like born and so he got completely shredded over the years until there

618
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
Was just like a tiny little square with a bunny in the center remained

619
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:34,700
And like here's what I would do. I remembered very well in my left hand. I would clutch it in my hand

620
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,060
I would suck on my thumb and I would here's my okay. This is weird

621
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,460
I would take like one of the bigger fragments of cloth. I would kind of turn it into like a big loop

622
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,220
I would put that loop

623
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,780
It you know because if my hands clenched my thumbs in my mouth and in that loop

624
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,980
I would put in my nose and I would breathe through the loop and that was pure bliss as a human

625
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,940
My life when I was like five. Yeah, I just want to

626
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:04,260
Sometimes just one how these series of events played out that you happen to do that the first time and got positive

627
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,620
Like feedback and like this is something I'm going to continue to do

628
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,740
I think it was like an evolution of behavior patterns where I just tried a bunch of shit and then like that one stuck after a while

629
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,540
I mean, I don't know. I also try shot at my nose

630
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:23,380
Since we're sharing weird habits, I have a question like for you guys and for everyone that's listening out there

631
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,620
This is something I used to do like do you know like the sort of like

632
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:33,260
Back in the day do they even do those like sort of white glue sort of thing, but it wasn't like strong

633
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,420
I don't know

634
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,980
It was just like white glue and it didn't stick too much to you

635
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:46,700
Well enough, but you know, they let kids wait. Did you like you like use like a stick to spread it around I

636
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,740
No, no, no, no, like I would like I put it on my on my palm and I would spread it around and I wait for it to feel it

637
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,660
Yeah, yeah, I wait for it to drive it and then feel it and it looked like skin

638
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Oh

639
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,260
That's the thing that I did on occasion, but not very often my friends didn't know off and I was like, oh, I guess I'll try it

640
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,320
I should do that to my dick and make dick molds. It was sick

641
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,060
That's not that's not an accurate

642
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,500
We called it PVA glue and and and there was all it was always used

643
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:23,860
When it was as a child there's always in school like sticking things on paper because you know, that's that's basically

644
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,380
That's like 90% of schooling is sticking things on things

645
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:34,860
And so like you had two choices you had the Pritt stick which was like the the the squishy tube of glue that you could like it twist

646
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,900
stick, yeah, we the Pritt

647
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,420
Pritt was like the brand name I guess and and then they'd have PVA glue and

648
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,060
That's my story

649
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,900
Okay, I just I mean I don't want to say like the same thing may said because yes, I did

650
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,260
Try to dissuade me from doing that because they were concerned I might get like

651
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,340
Addicted to the to the smell of the glue because that was a thing

652
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,700
I think I was more I was more interested in the than the peeling of the skin glue

653
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,460
Yeah, there was this one time where my grandpa was showing me like

654
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,220
you know model making with the glue and like

655
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,900
Little plane because he was an RAF guy and he has like little model plane thing

656
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,500
And it was like we were we were building it together and I had the glue thing and it was one of those like smelly types of glue

657
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,020
In a little metal tiny little metal thing and I was sniffing it and I was like this smells really good

658
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,660
And I I said to my grandpa like do you know how nice this smells grandpa?

659
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,660
Like I had no idea it was a bad thing and he got really upset at me

660
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:49,740
And I was really sad and and afraid that I had mucked up so bad that I was doing something illegal in front of my grandpa

661
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
And I didn't even realize

662
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,820
And from that day on I never had a grandpa he disowned

663
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,740
He jumped in that little model airplane you flew away never came back

664
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
I

665
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,260
Was thinking about the nails again

666
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,300
I I still have like a bad habit of like biting them

667
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,580
But only like if I break one of my long nails and it's like uneven it drives me crazy

668
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,620
That like if I don't don't have like scissors near me, then I'll start

669
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,940
Yeah, it's just just right. It's so insane enough enough gross disgusting nails

670
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,340
Let's move on to my topic that I have okay

671
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,740
Adventure time ended

672
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,020
Yes, I did I haven't been keeping up with it for a while and I've decided to re

673
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,420
Watch the whole thing and I'm in sort of the middle of season two

674
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,180
Season one and season two are like the best thing I've ever seen like this surprisingly perfect like

675
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:58,620
I would recommend anybody who has not watched adventure time in a long time to go back and watch all of season one

676
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,420
It's all killer no filler ten out of ten like the best cartoon I've ever seen in my life

677
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,660
Wait, sorry, I I was distracted during that please repeat all those words

678
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,100
Adventure time is good season one is the best cartoon on TV. How much of it did you rewatch?

679
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Did you rewatch the whole thing? I I rewatch all of see I haven't gotten around to all of it yet

680
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:25,980
I rewatch season one and I'm in halfway through season two and it is ten out of ten cartoon

681
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I

682
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,820
Would you say where's the drop-off happen like season five season six? I I have no idea

683
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,260
That's why I'm rewatching to find out but like

684
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:41,420
I'm just saying like like though. There's a reason that cartoon contributed to like every cartoon in the world

685
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,340
In that style I was watching it as I came out and it's just like so fucking good

686
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,460
It's it's the writing like surprisingly you think of a adventure time

687
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,740
You think oh, it's just wacky and funny and and it looks very simplistic

688
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:02,880
But like everything that that that's all wrongs all misconceptions. You've all remembered it incorrectly

689
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:11,260
It's it's got it's got brilliant writing brilliant comedic writing and the animation at least in season one and the beginning of season two is like

690
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:18,780
The reason it looks so simplistic is because they want to do so much with the animation that if it was more complicated

691
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,900
They wouldn't be able to do it on the budget. They had yeah

692
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,580
So they do some really impressive looking incredible stuff because there's only so many lines and colors

693
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,060
They have to put on let's let's lay it on the line. Let's lay it on the line

694
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Let's say you have to obliterate

695
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,080
Adventure time or Steven Universe and everyone involved in either's production

696
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,940
Who do you kill? Who do you?

697
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,580
I'll kill Steven Universe. Yeah, I think the problem is if you obliterated adventure time

698
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,580
You'd kill a bunch of people who work on Steven Universe as well. So you wouldn't get either. Yeah, Rebecca sugar worked on adventure time

699
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,660
She did. Oh, well, okay in that case we definitely are

700
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,980
Cuz it's

701
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,600
It's it's just it's hard to explain

702
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,940
Exactly why it's like so perfect, but it's

703
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,580
It's like it's it's from the the perspective of a child

704
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:13,340
I think it's the the writing is so good because they know how to write good episodes like every episode is a great episode

705
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,980
but like

706
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:21,980
They understand storywriting in a way that they can do matter and they can do matter properly by having the story just go in a different direction

707
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:30,100
Like at the last second or like they can they can like the first episode of season season two

708
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,420
Finn and Marceline like Marceline's dad comes back and all that

709
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,540
He's fucking up everything and the thing fries episode

710
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:45,300
Yeah, why did you steal my fries and all that stuff and Finn and Marceline are going around adventuring and at the end

711
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,180
It's revealed to the Jake

712
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,580
You know for some reason was absent

713
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:56,540
But he was actually in Finn's pocket the entire time and he turns around at the end like like Marceline asks. Oh

714
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,740
I've been wondering what's with your your pocket

715
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,060
Yeah, Finn and then Finn goes oh Jake's in here and then Jake is like tiny he turns around he farts

716
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,060
And that's the end of the episode

717
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
I remember that I fucking lost my shit comedic timing. It's timing that wins

718
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,700
It's just it's just like you can tell these guys like they're not idiots

719
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,100
Even though they're writing something that seems like silly

720
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,700
Because through the entire episode Finn just has a pocket drawn on his shirt

721
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,220
And they don't address why at all until right at the very end and like you're wondering in the back of your mind

722
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,340
Like is that there's like a new detail on his costume they're doing now like he just has a pocket on the shirt

723
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,300
There yeah, it's it's a level of like they on the surface if you're not paying attention

724
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,980
It looks like a dumb kids show where people are just screaming and farting and is laughing and stuff

725
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:51,700
Yeah, and then if you pay attention there are things that you notice and the show recognizes that and acknowledges that people may be paying

726
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:59,380
More attention and they say they have like little jokes every so often that are meta in that way to do like it's just it's just really good

727
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:07,860
To do a little deep analysis of that joke in itself like so a layperson watch the episode like won't even notice that Jake's not there

728
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:13,300
They'll just say like ah here's Finn and like they if they could have ended the episode without the pocket without the Jake joke

729
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,180
And like it would have been like fine, you know, it would have been like okay

730
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,740
You'd be wondering where Jake is possibly but no one would really question it that much

731
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:25,060
but by adding that Jake thing it shows that they were in fact thinking of that the whole episode and

732
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,820
Like they they they do in fact address the the issue of why Jake isn't there

733
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,340
But they do it in this obviously absurd way because there was all these incredible

734
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,380
Death-defying things that happened in that episode the Jake would have absolutely

735
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:44,420
Invaluable to be to participate in and the fact that he just didn't is just like a humorous, you know

736
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:51,220
Yeah, goo like yeah, they have things that like if you're a pedantic like and why wasn't he helping it's because

737
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,340
He's a stupid dog and sometimes he's just an idiot. That's him. That's him

738
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,460
And I mean and Finn didn't even like ask for his help even though he probably could have used it at several points

739
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,860
But that's fine. It's just such a it's just such a fluid dynamic like re-watching it

740
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:11,100
You just you're just like your mind boggles at how perfect this the you know the the way they've made the show

741
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:19,100
For like for like, you know random adventures like anything they want they can do they can make happen because of the way

742
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,100
They've made these characters

743
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,060
Haven't gone back and rewatched adventure time

744
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,300
But I do and this is a little different

745
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,020
But like I have felt just the pangs and I have gone back and watched just bunches of Steven universe

746
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:35,060
And it's way better to watch on a rewatch because like there's no I know generally what's gonna happen

747
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,700
So I don't need to like stress about this is a waste of an episode

748
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,940
Ah, why aren't the series progressing which are like fine criticisms, but like the vibe of Steven universe

749
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,620
I find incredibly comfy so it is pretty comfy, but you know like in terms of like in terms of like like

750
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,220
The episodes that mean something

751
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:02,300
Like we I think most people who like Steven universe agree that the the townspeople are not that interesting enough for the time that they're given

752
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
Generally, that's true. Yeah

753
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,900
As well like he caused me to quit Steven universe and I only got back to it after

754
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,300
The episode with garnet aired and people were like losing their shit

755
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,640
I like the thing they do with Ronaldo kind of it just the meta because like

756
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,980
Ronaldo has an actual blog in the real world where he like reports on stuff

757
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,820
Yeah, keep keep keep it's like I don't know that's that that's just like Ronaldo in the show that much

758
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,300
But I like what's being done in a meta context

759
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,380
I think the funnest thing with Ronaldo is all the things he says that sounds retarded were actually straight up true

760
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,460
Yes, and you don't but I didn't want to get too much into Steven universe

761
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,940
I just meant to I just brought that up because like I would also like to similarly go back and watch adventure time

762
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,900
Because there was also especially when I heard it was ending and I watched like a video review

763
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,740
I talked about this last week of the of the finale like it gave me such nostalgia and I want to go experience that again

764
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:03,580
I watched yeah watch like the first two seasons so like I would like to watch the whole thing because yeah

765
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:09,260
I don't know why I thought I was no idea why I didn't like fall out of like favor with the show didn't do anything to piss me off

766
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,780
Same I got bored. I got watching with one of my friends and like then we stopped hanging out

767
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,980
And so I just stopped watching because I was like the thing we did is we just kick back and like watch that

768
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:24,940
That makes sense. Oh, yeah, but fuck it. I'm getting back. Give sold me on. I'm gonna check it out as soon as

769
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,180
Like what when I say season one is all killer when I say season one is all killer

770
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,820
No filler it I really mean it like every single episode is just

771
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,660
Muah, you know like muah like the like the you know like sick

772
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:48,460
Give you say would you say that adventure time style of like comedic delivery had any influence on you?

773
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,060
Cuz like I'm not I think about it things like bail statements

774
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,300
I've kind of have not like an identical tone

775
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,820
But there's there's a little like bits and pieces here in there that have like this. Oh, yeah

776
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,260
Esoteric kind of comedic value to it that I feel very there's some overlap there

777
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,460
I don't know whether I was inspired

778
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,900
I mean, I must have been inspired by it somewhat but I already had a similar sort of style of yeah before

779
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,420
Adventure time and it really resonates with me. So yeah, it's like it's just like that feeling of

780
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,300
Yeah, why not like fucking

781
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:24,660
Agreed yes, why just why not put a dank weed joke? Yeah. Yeah, this is why not

782
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,020
Even though it will get me thrown in jail for 200 years

783
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:36,820
Gotta suffer for your heart my favorite thing my favorite thing recently was watching those episodes is that the princesses and how they're all like

784
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,020
They're you know, they're all portrayed as like the dumbest sluts of all

785
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:52,540
When ice king when ice king shaved his beard and he became the nice king and all the princesses like oh, it's the new nice king

786
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
Oh

787
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,100
It was very funny. That's a very make-toe reading

788
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,740
It's just it's just they're so cute and like

789
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,860
They just do like they have dumb voices

790
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,620
If I were to make like my own show like if I had the time or like the budget

791
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:16,380
I would make it like very simplistic and I would do silly voices and that it would be adventure time

792
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:20,420
I would that's the show I would make if it's time is a great formula

793
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,220
Yeah, well give the show is ending

794
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:29,660
I want to know you can pick up the torch and make it make a new version of it do it. I will I'll literally make a show called

795
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,780
Something I probably won't check but someone in the description

796
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:40,220
Please post a guide to which episodes I should and should skip like I want to I want to comprehensive thing

797
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,580
So now what are the essential episodes? There probably is a list floating out there?

798
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:49,340
There I bet there is I bet there is did you a sandy wants when I do too I will say

799
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,940
Every episode of season one you have to watch. Okay, Julie noted Julie noted

800
00:51:54,700 --> 00:52:00,140
Every episode season two every episode of season three. I don't know about season four and five

801
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,660
No, because episode season four and five is when I

802
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,100
Stopped but I don't like Tom. I'm not really sure why I didn't hate it

803
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,140
I was just like I think it was like the site

804
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:18,100
I was watching it on was this really annoying like ads everywhere some of the episodes were missing

805
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,060
You know, it really happens. You really happen to all of us and we're just afraid to admit it

806
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,980
We're ashamed to admit it

807
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,500
We all got into pony and that's all we did when it we threw our lives away and everything else stopped mattering and we all

808
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,140
I think I got into adventure time after

809
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,940
Really mine was I guess I watched I guess I watched season one two as they came out

810
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:42,020
So I was like way before remember remember that one pony reviewer who was like his O.C. was a pony version of Finn

811
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:48,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, that was my that guy was an intellectual

812
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,420
What if he's listening right now? I

813
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,980
Got nothing against the guy, but his O.C. was hilarious and silly

814
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,100
I do not like the idea. I have nothing against the guy

815
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,900
But I don't like the idea of taking another character making to it pony and being it

816
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,340
It's kind of son at you ask in its level of thinking like I like this one thing. Let's make this

817
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,680
I mean, he probably was like eight or okay, he probably was like 15 or something

818
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,700
You know, it was me you're probably right

819
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,100
Anyway

820
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,400
Anyone else got another topic. I'm ready to sort of to switch it up

821
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:30,780
Who of you have dual screens raise your metaphorical? I got dual screen set up right now right now

822
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,460
I

823
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:39,140
Know what why do you have space on my desk? I don't have I don't have space on my desk

824
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,860
And I don't have space in my room for a bigger desk, and I've always hated people with dual screens

825
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,340
I want to kill everyone. It's good. Oh, no

826
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,740
The reason I asked is because before I went to

827
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,380
Lofiini I got a second monitor and I completely forgot and when I turn was like, oh, I have a second monitor

828
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,860
So they're working with a second monitor and it's just it's like the best

829
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,860
I

830
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,500
Survive without a second monitor. I know I'm gonna level with you guys on dual monitors

831
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,740
All right, so back in the day

832
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,900
I used to my first like big like major desktop display

833
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,260
I had actually bought a 37 inch 1080p TV and that was my computer monitor and it was godlike

834
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,780
And then everyone got on the dual screen set up smoke. All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna switch this up

835
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,580
I'm gonna get two smaller monitors

836
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,260
So I have double the workspace and I hated it

837
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,380
Hated dual monitors because like I only ever worked with one of them

838
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:32,940
I never spent the time to like shift the windows over because it's like I'm just I'm just I'm looking at this one

839
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,740
And the other one's like kind of off to the side and I don't feel like turning my head. I'm lazy

840
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,420
Fuck it. I want to go back to my one big monitor

841
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:45,220
But I fixed that problem for me what I have now and this happened by accident is because I got one of those drawing displays

842
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:49,700
and so instead of having them horizontal I now have it in a vertical alignment and

843
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:56,380
Vertical is way better because you can see both of them at the same time just by looking forward because I have my 22 inch

844
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,500
Oh, wait, wait, wait, you're saying that you have them mounted above each other

845
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,700
Yeah, so what happens is I have a big 32 inch display now

846
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,420
I just got it's a 32 inch like QHD display and then under it on my desk

847
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:12,300
I have a 22 inch drawing display and because they're like I can see both of them right now

848
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,260
And I can just drag something down you can just drag it down

849
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,500
So it's on the lower one and it's so much easier to use because like your vision sees both of them

850
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:25,860
And it's like pure bliss and it's a 10 out of 10. Everybody should do vertical displays. It's way better than horizontal

851
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,420
Technology you're talking about

852
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,580
But I I use it I this is how I use it

853
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,860
But yeah, I wanted a second one just specifically because

854
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,840
When I draw I like to listen or watch things at the site at the corner of my eyes

855
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,420
and that means I cannot full screen my drawing

856
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:53,140
Program and that gets in the way of me drawing and it's really annoying and like then I have to make the screen of

857
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,260
Whatever I'm watching really tiny that means I don't see it so well

858
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:02,300
So now that I have the monitors I have like on one monitor what I'm watching and one monitor when I'm drawing and it's so good

859
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,180
I love I love it. It's good

860
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:09,060
I also end up using my phone for a lot of stuff just because it's convenient to like have that I don't know below

861
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,380
That's all I can do. That's all I can fucking do when I'm streaming

862
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,660
I have to have my phone with the stream chat because I can't do it any other way

863
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,780
So so Tom set up is technically

864
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,540
Like vertical, but it's like on his desk and in front of him give

865
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:43,860
Why don't you construct Casey Neistat style like get like a a wooden beam going straight up and like make a base

866
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,860
and hang myself from it and

867
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:52,260
Mount two displays one literally above the other and just like screw it if you want to be lazy

868
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,100
What you do is instead of doing that you can just buy a

869
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:01,780
Vesum out that basically it attaches to your desk and it has two mounting points in the back for two monitors

870
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,540
So you just take them and there you go on there

871
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,180
Then they're they're one on top of each other so you can just go

872
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,940
Vertical and not have to worry about desk space

873
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,860
Do it give do it

874
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:19,380
I'm stretching my my neck up right to where the monitor would sit on top of the other one

875
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,460
And it seems like a bit like that that hurts my neck just a bit

876
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:30,220
I need my friend Matt. He just bought and it's dedicated office space and his setup is transcendent

877
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:34,860
He has this like big L-shaped desk and he has a huge

878
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,860
27-inch wake-up Sintiq that he got for free and I hate him for it like a

879
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:45,940
$3,000 Sintiq someone just gave to him and he has that on his left side and that and he has like a big swivel chair

880
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,700
So he wants to draw you just swivels over to that

881
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,860
But when he doesn't need to draw he swivels back over and he has two 27 inch monitors with that

882
00:57:53,260 --> 00:58:00,140
Vertical vase amounts with like that like rotate and swivel and everything so you can adjust both of them to any angle you want

883
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,860
And it's like literally you know god-tier

884
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,660
It's amazing because I just went to see him this week on Friday

885
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,740
I drove to New York and hung out with him and got drunk

886
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:14,780
We did a podcast, but I just saw this space and I was like I'd never want to leave here like this is perfect

887
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,900
like this is the best setup of all time and

888
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,540
I almost murdered him and stole his office because it was so good

889
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:27,980
Do you think do you think the the natural progression of stuff like this is eventually we're gonna be like, you know

890
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:34,340
You got like a sphere with a hole in it. You poke your head in the screen is the sphere the whole way around

891
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,820
Yes, it needs to happen immediately. Yeah, I suppose like the the logical extension is just like

892
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:44,340
Like augmented reality stuff where like you just put a little lens. You can already do that

893
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,540
You guys know about the Microsoft Holo lens. Have you ever heard about this?

894
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,040
I've heard the name. What is it?

895
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:56,500
Microsoft's like they have this thing where you put on a pair of like glasses and

896
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,460
It's tapped into like they have ones that plug into a computer

897
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:06,060
But they also have one that's just the computers built into the headset and how it works is that it overlays digital information

898
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:10,140
On top of the real world. So like they're like, oh, you want like you can play Pokemon go

899
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,580
Yeah, but it's like over your eyes and they actually had a demo very similar

900
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,580
But one of the things they did like oh you want to like

901
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:20,060
Because it senses where your hands and stuff are too so they had a demo where it's like oh

902
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:25,020
I want to watch a movie so they just sat down on a couch took two hands up and spread their hands across the wall

903
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,420
And it made a huge display that was the size the entire wall

904
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,700
I started watching a movie and then they could bring up like a little Skype window on the side that was like

905
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,260
I had like a 45 degree angle like based on where you were sitting that like had Skype

906
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,500
You could just use your hand to scroll through it and stuff while you were watching this big movie

907
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:43,140
And I was like that was like the big come. I was like, that's what I want. That's yeah

908
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,100
That's what I want fucking fucking Skype back

909
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,420
Yeah

910
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:56,860
But what you won't get any dank like gamer like login messages when you log into Skype unlike discord

911
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,860
That's what holds this thing to get

912
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,900
God

913
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:07,260
It was supposed to be our sign. It's just it's just such a millennial program with their login messages

914
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:12,500
Yeah, and I know that like they do a thing where they said submitted by so-and-so like they take like community ones

915
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,460
That's what they they give you the name so it's like if this one really bothers you, you know who to kill

916
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,380
I do think of you every time that one comes out exactly

917
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,820
Discord stop that please

918
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,980
Fucking hearthstone

919
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,860
Uh

920
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,620
mage what was

921
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:44,980
Everybody to bring it has to bring a topic forward for the for the topic list formless episodes. Do you have one?

922
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:51,180
I just did dual screens. Was it your screen? Oh dang. I guess I forgot

923
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:58,180
After you said it. Are you trying? I'm trying to catch one. I support this Gestapo tactics of calling everyone out to make sure they actually

924
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,180
I have another topic I can bring

925
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,300
Because at the controller owners when they came up last minute

926
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,540
I this is something that I've been wondering about and this is gonna get a little more like

927
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:14,500
Complicated, I guess and just like person what I wanted to ask is why do you think people don't own their weirdness anymore?

928
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:20,860
And a lot of explain what I mean by that. It's like yeah back in the day like like in like the early

929
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:26,420
2000s and shit like people were like really proud of being weird and like war like they've weird internet culture

930
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:35,260
Like that kind of shit and now it's like like people didn't want to be normal and didn't want to be accepted by society

931
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,140
But now it feels like that has like changed

932
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,580
It's like all of us like grew up and realized like oh, there's actually consequences for not being accepted by greater society now

933
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:46,700
That we have to be in it because we're adults and now there's like this whole like cultural movement of like

934
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:52,660
Everything I do needs to be accepted and I can't just be I can't exist on the fringe of culture anymore

935
01:01:52,660 --> 01:02:01,220
My weird lifestyle has to come out of this. I don't know. I still I feel still feel like I'm like weird in the way

936
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:05,040
I have always been I just you know, I don't I don't say things like

937
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,860
Yeah, I feel like I'm still one with my weakness. I think I feel like this particular group is right

938
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,620
There's definitely pockets of people like us for sure

939
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,820
I mean anyone who listened to this podcast for more than ten minutes realizes

940
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:26,780
We just don't give a fuck but like I'm talking more like a like a larger cultural scale

941
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,540
Like the internet was just Lalex desorandum now the internet is just accept me

942
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:39,100
I'm going to change everything to make my weirdness become normal like before it was never like you wanted to be anything

943
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,300
But normal now. It's like everything has to be

944
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:46,200
I see I see what you mean Tom. I think it's mainly because of the call-out culture

945
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:51,940
That that's happening and like whenever like you step out of line and like oh, you're a bit egotistic

946
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,340
People start making videos. Oh, this guy is egotistic. Bring him down

947
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:00,380
Get his head that there's a lot of that. There's a lot of there's a lot of

948
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:08,420
Laughing at people's it like being slightly not normal and and that being okay

949
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:15,100
I guess I guess it's it's fueled. It seems to be fueled by teenagers who are like a bit awkward and and don't feel

950
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,420
You know, they're not sure about themselves. So they take it out by laughing at other people who are slightly weird

951
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
Yeah, that definitely happens a lot. Yeah

952
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,180
And like that happened back in the day, but like we like accepted that like, you know, you you'd be like, yeah

953
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,660
Of course normies hate me like that's why we say normally like I think this is like post

954
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:40,540
What's he called leafy's here? I think sort of culture because people got popular by making fun of other people and then other people

955
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:46,280
They have become popular by renting on other people. So it's the new cool thing to do

956
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:50,540
You say post game theory. No, no, post leafy leafy post leafy. Oh

957
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,900
I'm personally post game theory

958
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,060
I'm pretty game theory actually I like game theories

959
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,300
Game theory's got his positive points for sure

960
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:08,740
Um, I think personally a lot of this comes down to I'm gonna blame it all on the baby boomers personally

961
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:16,060
At least I'm gonna start I think it goes back to that and I I can't exactly trace at the moment the cause of why but I do feel

962
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:21,660
Like the baby boomers were quite helicopter-ish in their parenting

963
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:27,540
And you know, I don't even really blame them. I just blame the the world as it's changed into because it's like

964
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:34,460
I think that a lot that's happened is that like like baby boomers grew up in like the 60s in the 70s and

965
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:39,020
Like this was the civil rights time and they felt really

966
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:44,660
I don't know like they wanted to change the world and like make everything about like the individual

967
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:50,260
And they didn't like their parents who like fought in World War two and were very like I don't know like, you know

968
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,460
Blah blah blah give up shit for your nation, you know

969
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,460
Like the baby boomers are way more

970
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,620
Individualistic the first the generation I think that really

971
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,060
Took off and like there's a lot of good points to that

972
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:06,860
But I think the negatives is that people became very like when I say self self-obsessed

973
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,060
I don't mean that like they really cared about themselves

974
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:13,500
I mean that they valued the individual like so much more to the collective

975
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,180
But I think there's a feeling that like it's totally okay to let the collective burn

976
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,100
Just for for any infringement

977
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:26,820
Against an individual and I feel like the result of this has been that like they raised their kids in an environment

978
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:29,780
We're like any infraction was too much of an infraction

979
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,220
so like

980
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:38,300
Calling someone like a faggot on the schoolyard like has become a federal issue like a hate crime and like like I get it like

981
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:43,020
Okay, you could you could say that that's a hate crime like why are you like?

982
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,580
What's the reason to like

983
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,420
Call this person like a specific demographic, you know

984
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:52,860
Association that has a negative connotation in some circles like sure sounds like you just hate gay people

985
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:57,700
But you know the thing is a lot of people just use that word without any association to any group

986
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:03,620
So like maybe it'd be good to just kind of relax and and realize that this is more kids being kids than

987
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,180
You know like an actual group being attacked for their identity

988
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:14,460
The thing is with insults most people don't realize when someone is like shoots an insult at you

989
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,380
They usually try to get you where it hurts

990
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:23,380
So they use whatever you know, they perceive to be your weakness for instance like just a little hogan just these video about

991
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:30,260
The black guy who fucked his daughter who he really hated so we called him a very nasty term for an african-american individual

992
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,460
You cut out, but I'm not sure I want to hear that all over again. That's fine. Go ahead. Go ahead

993
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,020
But yeah, like for instance, you know someone on the

994
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:46,620
PCP like if they don't like me they're gonna like I don't know like call me the girl or use some sort of feminine insults that are usually

995
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,580
Yeah, aim that girl's just to sort of like insult me

996
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:56,180
They might not be misogynistic, but they think that's with how they're gonna get me. I personally don't care

997
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:02,420
So go ahead, but yeah, yeah, so like it's not about like if I call you sometimes people are definitely

998
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,700
Does that make me like that

999
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:08,180
The thing is it really involves what's going on in the person's head

1000
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,260
Because if I call you a bitch because I just hate all women and here I am

1001
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:17,140
Ah, here's a woman. Let's call her a bitch because I hate her like okay fair enough, but you can also use that word

1002
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,820
To just mean like in particular girl

1003
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:27,820
I don't like or you can mean it to say like actually like friend who I'm currently giving a rough attitude to so

1004
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:32,540
And you can also honestly aim it at guys, but then the meaning is gonna be different

1005
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:39,240
But yeah, yeah, like it's it's very much dependent on the person itself and like they might not necessarily be

1006
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,020
Misogynistic or or just you know, whatever

1007
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:50,140
Whatever aces do you give them is just that they're trying to be as offensive as possible is to hurt you

1008
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,420
so that's not good, but like

1009
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,860
People don't need to go to jail for saying a word

1010
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:59,740
I think some people would respond to this and I would understand why and they'd be like

1011
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:06,620
Well, if you choose to use that word anyway, despite knowing the context then that makes you, you know, whatever the particular thing is

1012
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:14,580
You make the word so horrible, that's why people like to use it because it's such a horrible word

1013
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:20,940
Yeah, I mean, that's definitely true, but like you words have the power you decide to give them

1014
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:26,780
Yeah, that's true. And like I do not blame people for getting mad about words that they find offensive

1015
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:32,420
But like I don't know. I just your problem like I mean, yeah, I mean it kind of is your problem and

1016
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,060
But you know like we want to bridge gaps here

1017
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:36,460
We don't want to say like if you can't take it

1018
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:40,020
You're just like a pussy and then here we are just labeling you and throwing your opinion aside

1019
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:45,380
What you'd want to do is like kind of like have a conversation with this person as to why you disagree

1020
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,940
And we we've certainly made this argument quite a few times on this podcast

1021
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,540
Happy to have like discussions with people that disagree with me

1022
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,700
Yeah, as you do in the comments all the time on these and these podcasts

1023
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1024
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:05,500
Yeah, like I personally don't swear too much other than like the usual shouldn't fuck because those I don't even consider them

1025
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
swear words at this point

1026
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:17,300
Just like you're being raised like you can't say swears. They're bad. I just like what the fuck you talk about, you know

1027
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:22,860
So some people fuck is the worst word you can say but like to us. It's basically completely meaningless

1028
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:29,300
Take the words gay at some point. It was like quite offensive or just like, you know

1029
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,140
Like you wouldn't sold someone by calling them gay

1030
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:35,660
But nowadays like no one really cares anymore. You call each other gay like you guys call each

1031
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,220
But at the same time like I went for the most part like

1032
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,220
Of course by Hilary

1033
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:51,100
But only from what I've observed like most people don't care anymore. I mean some people do but like you're the most parts

1034
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:57,660
No one cares. It's definitely that like nowadays things like gay becoming like way more

1035
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:04,780
Offensive nowadays is because of a very very vocal minority of people who are trying to get offended at

1036
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,780
They're giving back the power to the word

1037
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:14,740
Yeah, I know I feel empathy like let's say that like if you're gay and like you go to school every day and like people call

1038
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:20,060
You gay because they just hate that you are homosexual like I took like I of course I understand like yeah

1039
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,100
You're not gonna be too fond of that word and you're not going to enjoy it

1040
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:29,660
But more important than banning the word is like making people okay with the thing because like they're gonna find another word to

1041
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,360
Call him if they're gonna get if they're gonna get thrown in jail for saying gay

1042
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:37,160
They're gonna find another way to make fun. It's not that hard culture just make up new insult

1043
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,440
So I can it's gonna be difficult to stay ahead of that curve

1044
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:45,200
You know, you can't just ban everything English English has enough words to sustain insults for like

1045
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,920
I don't believe in that top-down approach as an effective way to like change people's minds

1046
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:57,120
I mean, I'd like to I'd like to imagine that being like gayness has become more

1047
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,860
accepted in in schools and stuff I have no idea to

1048
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:04,660
Whether or not that's the case because only I only have the Internet

1049
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,140
Yeah

1050
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,180
But you know like I

1051
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,060
Used to be a bit more like

1052
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:13,900
not

1053
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,660
Bigoted I guess but like it grossed me out

1054
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,140
Grossed me out when I was younger because it was like what why would you kiss a guy? That's not true

1055
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:27,620
I mean, I still find it pretty strange because like I it's not something that I want to do

1056
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:33,540
But like it's nowadays, you know, somebody says they're gay for real not joking

1057
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:39,380
And then you're like, okay, like it's it's no longer a big deal because yeah, like

1058
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,300
You know the social justice warrior

1059
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:51,540
Angle of like lots of shows and things people get upset and they can fight like like social justice warrior hate

1060
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:57,420
Brigades like going around trying to get people censored and then things just appeasing that crowd

1061
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,660
As the same I think yeah, you know things that are making gayness

1062
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,740
More like normal and having gay characters. That's okay

1063
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:10,900
That's actually good because it makes it so that people growing up don't find it as weird

1064
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,980
Yeah, the the the Haprigays are separate, but like people conflate the tune

1065
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,300
I don't like I don't like it when somebody sees like a

1066
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:24,180
Like a gay character in a thing and they assume that it's social justice warrior crap and therefore

1067
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:29,500
It's it's terrible to have gay characters because that's completely going against the

1068
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,700
Like it should be okay. It should be okay to have one or the other

1069
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:39,680
Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't like like people like high guardian spice, right high guardian spice comes out and it's like very

1070
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,220
social justice warrior

1071
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,580
Like appealing like it's dog whistling to the

1072
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:51,180
It's it's it's got it's got all that that funny stuff and and it's like I

1073
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,820
Don't see a problem with you know

1074
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,620
The social justice angle

1075
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,820
The the adding the adding of like I mean we don't know anything about the characters of story

1076
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,820
But like they're having a lot of female writers

1077
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:11,540
Too much for a problem with that specifically, but it's when it's it's just

1078
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,820
It's just disingenuous

1079
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:23,540
When you say like we are gonna have 100% all female writers in this and then if there happens to be a writer's room of all men

1080
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,780
That's a problem. That's yeah, then then I get like whoa

1081
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:32,180
Even universe like we all enjoy the show to some extent, right?

1082
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:36,100
And it does have like those sort of people working on it

1083
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:42,260
Like you know bit of ACW's bit of feminists, but like they don't shove it down, you know our throats there

1084
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:46,180
Whatever beliefs they're making a genuine interesting show with whatever

1085
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,580
Yeah, that's that's what I was trying to get at like even if even if

1086
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,580
It's it's not the fact that it's a room of a hundred percent female writers

1087
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:58,780
It's that they advertise it as that being itself a good thing

1088
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:03,260
And there's no reason to believe that that means the show will be good. It just depends on how

1089
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:10,580
So like if if if high garden spice just came out and it was like that's a pretty good show and it's got a hundred percent female

1090
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,620
Wouldn't give a shit

1091
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,460
Those those writers are good writers and that's just a good thing

1092
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,820
I just hate that we live in a world and like this just is the real world and I get it

1093
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:19,700
I think we'll never change

1094
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:24,820
But like I want it to be that a product just gets made and then everyone just sees if it's good or not

1095
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:30,180
And we don't worry about anything involved in how it was made or any like whatever like I guess if they it was made

1096
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:34,420
Using the blood of babies because they ground them up and turn them into scripts. I mean, I guess that's

1097
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,580
I don't know what the show's good enough. I don't think I care. I mean

1098
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:47,660
Alchemist was made by a female author. Yeah sure was sure was yeah, and look look how popular that is only with women

1099
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:49,960
No guys ever liked full metal alchemist

1100
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,300
You know was weird though as I was reading through full metal alchemist

1101
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:01,100
Strangely when I as soon as I found out it was written by a woman the next chapter and all subsequent chapters became shit

1102
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:05,500
Oh, so when I reread the old chapter, they were also suddenly bad was a big it was weird

1103
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:10,060
It was weird, but I haven't re-read it since I found out so I guess I guess don't do it

1104
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:16,060
So that strikes me as weird like winery. Yeah, I don't know what's funny though

1105
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,780
She's so violent and it's played off as comedic effect. I never liked that in anime

1106
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:24,820
That's why I don't like Doridora much either punching guy through wall just and don't do not

1107
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,420
Yeah, I mean I

1108
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:34,780
Speaking related tangentially to the thing Nate said at the very beginning about like

1109
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,780
Blaming the boomers. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you say that I think this is a like

1110
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:45,500
I'm really tired of of Millennials blaming the boomers like the way boomers blame the Millennials

1111
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:50,020
Not because anyone is like incorrect like I'm I think what you said was

1112
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:56,900
Okay, I think what you said was correct and all that but like it's just it feels so cowardly that

1113
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:03,380
Every millennial whoever disparages baby boomers and you know the things they've done never says it to their face

1114
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:06,040
They say it on the internet a place. They would never find it

1115
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,020
We never actually

1116
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:13,540
Now get my dad in here munchie. Can we just can we pull up my dad, please in the phone? Yeah, okay

1117
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:19,660
All right, dad fuck like like none of us would go like I can't call my grandpa and is like little model airplane

1118
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,060
Say grandpa you fucked up the world

1119
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:27,140
Like I can't say that to him. I'd be too embarrassed. I'd be too scared like oh, he's just not mad now

1120
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:31,220
It doesn't matter. I feel like this is a very sort of American thing to do

1121
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,580
Hmm, I just I don't

1122
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:41,540
I cannot see I cannot see blaming my parents or my grandparents for whatever would happen because of the history my country

1123
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:47,620
You know once well, I mean you can fact you factually blame your parents for 100% of the experiences

1124
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:54,660
You've had in your life because they are in fact. Yeah, that's like I don't I don't have the hatred for baby boomers

1125
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:59,820
That a lot of people seem to do the problem is that like so many people who blame the boomers

1126
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,380
I think you can you can point as a cause at a causal thing to certain things like oh

1127
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:10,140
This is x things fault. The problem is that what so many people who do that proceed to then abdicate?

1128
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,280
Responsibility for anything that happens going forward and that's where the problem

1129
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,940
Yeah, so what I would never like like the boomers cause problems

1130
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:23,420
What are you going to do to fix it because complaining about it is not gonna help?

1131
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,700
Yeah, but as much as it is unfair that they have put you in this situation

1132
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,420
There's nothing you can do, but what you try and get out of it

1133
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,980
Yeah, yeah, the reason the reason I said is it feels like American thing because like whenever they you know

1134
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:41,540
They talk about the problems the boomers caused it seems like it's happened in America's like very American centric the problems are like

1135
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,140
American history this happen

1136
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,460
American history echoes throughout the whole world

1137
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:54,280
So, you know, it's not necessarily just America, but it's still it still very feels like the people who post those are

1138
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:02,520
Does the term baby boomer wouldn't that specifically apply to it an American generation like those economic conditions

1139
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,480
America at the time is what caused the whole big thing in the first place

1140
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,880
Oh, by the way, by the way, we're talking baby boomers are not the same as boomers because boomers are

1141
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,160
30 year old

1142
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:19,680
American gamers who are distinct from the zoomers who are the current like I don't know

1143
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,780
12 to 20 year old American

1144
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,320
Enough of these stupid names that sound too similar to other the stupid names

1145
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,120
Kill all boomers and zoomers

1146
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,960
But just kill everyone

1147
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,880
Genocide

1148
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,000
May the meteor hit the earth right now

1149
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,100
I'm cussing me right now from Final Fantasy 7

1150
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,560
Well, I don't know are we are we good with this topic I feel pretty comfortable going over to the to the

1151
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,880
Different direction I was expecting I did not expect a social justice rant to come out of that

1152
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,920
But that's that's fine. You know, yeah

1153
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:11,640
Let me just finish the point on the actual thing because your original point was just about like why are people well?

1154
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:15,320
What was why do people why do people not own their weirdness anymore?

1155
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:20,400
Why are we pushing more towards acceptance everything as opposed to being like? Yeah, I'm proud to be hated by normal people. I

1156
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,960
Mean, I like my response to that was like I feel like it's because we've made it so that people feel

1157
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,480
Like people are less able to feel vulnerable and be okay with it

1158
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,720
So like they're less willing to accept criticism and less willing to feel like they don't belong

1159
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,080
I think like there's a lack of resilience. I feel in

1160
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:48,920
Less conversations going on and more gotcha exposed you moments on that's that's that's a fair assessment

1161
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,600
I'd say you like you can post something now

1162
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,760
And like I don't know

1163
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,400
I mean, you know, maybe this is a bad example

1164
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,320
But it's like if you post something online then like way later

1165
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,120
Someone can just use it like to get you because they take it way out of context because like everything's available online

1166
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:10,120
Nothing is everything's like documented and able to be sorted through and like if you ever get to a position of like of

1167
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:17,200
Prominence like people can dig through your old posts and like make a federal fucking case of like a tiny joke

1168
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,640
You made yeah, I nobody had a problem with but now I

1169
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,040
Hate the I hate that and I relish

1170
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:30,960
I would I relish and dream of a day when I am at a an area of prominence and somebody tries to dethrone me by

1171
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:37,200
Digging up my old tweets where I say the n-word a million times and then and I'm not gonna delete them and I'm gonna say

1172
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,840
F you and I'm gonna turn my back on them. I'm not gonna do anything. I'm not gonna apologize

1173
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,040
I'm not gonna say I'm not even if I get fired or from whatever it is

1174
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:51,600
I I just don't I don't ever want to acquiesce to that stupid shit on a certain example

1175
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,800
I do worry that in that situation

1176
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:59,440
I'll I'll buckle because like I to feel like I'm not trying to say that you're just like acting tough or whatever

1177
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:06,080
But I like I feel like I don't want to apologize either, but then like I wonder if I will push you out in that moment

1178
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,660
It's like it's it's it's a thing of principle for me like it

1179
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,080
Even if it's a stupid thing to do

1180
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:12,600
Mm-hmm

1181
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:19,800
I just don't want to ever let anyone who follows me or knows about me or here's about it on the news yeah to think

1182
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:26,600
That because I know loads of people feel the way I do and they just they wish somebody would just say no

1183
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:34,040
Correct, which is the to this to this mob of political correctness like whether or not it's a good thing to do

1184
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,920
I just I wish you know what I don't wish it happens to me, but if it happens to me

1185
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,840
I'm going to do that. I'm going to say no no way. I'll take a stand right here like ethically

1186
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:49,940
I absolutely think there's a time and place to say the worst racial or other kind of slur that there is there's

1187
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,960
100% a time and place when it's gonna be really fucking funny and

1188
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,080
Totally awesome to say and everyone will laugh and have a great time as a result of it

1189
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,400
So and that extends to every word and every possible thing

1190
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,000
And like you could then if you just take that out of context like oh look at this evil person

1191
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,680
Did this thing and it was like bad because they said a word that they're forbidden to say

1192
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,360
My thing was because I think about this a lot too because I I mean I keep up with the news and shit

1193
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,840
And like people getting fucking destroyed for for things

1194
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,520
They've said that are innocuous that have become bad and my my whole thing is again

1195
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,840
Cuz I've always felt like what if that ever happened to me and my thing is that I would not apologize

1196
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:33,080
And I would not be tempted to simply because the people who are trying to take me down for this

1197
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:39,280
I don't respect them and like nothing no apology at the damage has been done. No apology

1198
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,280
I would say what would matter

1199
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,480
The problem I'm not interested in their forgiveness anyway because I already hate them

1200
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:50,680
I hear what you're saying the problem isn't those people and like those people are probably know what they're doing is wrong

1201
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:57,080
But but like what worries me when I think about it is but there's tons of people out there who simply like

1202
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,800
Accept what is reported like in a headline

1203
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,760
Like so-and-so is racist and they will not read the article

1204
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,400
They will not do the research to know that it's a bunk and that's okay

1205
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:13,800
So you apologize has anyone who's ever apologized ever gotten a follow-up report be like actually this guy's not a racist

1206
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:20,080
He said sorry like the damage is done. Unlike. There's no apologies. Yeah, even if that even if they report on that

1207
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:26,560
It won't matter because the people won't say you're already people see a headline people see a headline that says so

1208
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,100
Prominent person is secretly a Nazi and it's like ooh interesting

1209
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,620
I wonder how this person was disgraced and then you've got a same headline

1210
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:42,360
Prominent person is secretly okay, and they just glaze over it because people like they love to see like tragic downfalls

1211
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:49,640
Here's another that's why that stuff so like like anybody who's been accused of rape and is exonerated

1212
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:52,040
It doesn't matter. They're still a rapist to those people

1213
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:58,920
It doesn't nothing you're ever gonna do or say will ever change those people's minds because they they because at that point the people who are

1214
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,760
Looking for people who are racist and sexist and bigoted or whatever

1215
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:05,680
You are an our ammo in there like they're gone, right?

1216
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,840
Because they're trying to gain more power and change social structure to put them in a better position

1217
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:17,640
So the more people like you that exist the more it's so a situation to pop up and the more ammo they have to change

1218
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,120
Social structure to their benefit absolutely true

1219
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:29,040
And did you see the there was a comment by Norm McDonald recently comedian extraordinaire where he um don't know like he said a comment

1220
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,640
I forget what the inciting comment was it was something about oh, we know it okay like he said

1221
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,600
In like some podcast or something that like he

1222
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:44,360
He of course he felt bad for like people who were like insulted by Rosie O'Donald her you know

1223
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,040
You could possibly interpret it as a racist comment

1224
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:51,040
I'm on I'm agnostic to that and then like Louis CK like they both

1225
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:57,320
At Louis CK like you know flashes dick jacked off in front of women, you know, it seems pretty sketchy, but I don't know the details

1226
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,440
What what he said about that was like

1227
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:08,200
The what what Louis CK and Roseanne suffered as a result of that like was its own bad thing

1228
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,520
And then people said that like okay, but what about the victims and he's like well

1229
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,720
I mean yeah, they had their own bad things happen, but that's not what these guys felt so I you know in addition

1230
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:22,840
I specifically feel bad for what happened to Louis and Roseanne and like that's an accurate statement

1231
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:30,240
But they did not suffer the like the kind of social backlash is obviously very different from the specific kind of you know

1232
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,440
Suffering such as it is that happened to the people that were you know quote-unquote targeted or attacked by Louis and Roseanne

1233
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,200
but

1234
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:44,440
And in respect people got real mad so he apologized about that and what he said was you would have to have

1235
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:51,480
Down syndrome to not feel bad for the victims and I think that is like I mean sure that's I guess kind of mean

1236
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,480
I guess

1237
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:58,120
And then he apologized for that as well and he was apologizing for his apology

1238
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,120
Ridiculous like there's the thing is like he just he just said nothing

1239
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It's impossible. Yeah, I

1240
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:11,580
Don't know too much about Norma doll, but I have seen a few of you know funny things he's done

1241
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:20,360
He seems like the sort of person who would have deliberately made that down syndrome joke in his apology because he doesn't like apologizing

1242
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,720
And then he and then he went back on that and I'm like, yeah

1243
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:32,040
No, yeah, I like the down syndrome apology if he just didn't apologize for that because that's like funny and it's own

1244
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:38,160
You know, hey, I mean, I'm sorry. You're fucking stupid. That's a good apology. Yeah, it's really interesting

1245
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,960
There's no way to win there. There is no way to win. It's interesting because like I just I'm like a huge

1246
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:48,680
Audible fan like audio books and I just started listening to a book. I've always wanted to read unless you call the 48 laws of power

1247
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,520
It's incredibly insightful. I love it. I'm almost done with it

1248
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:57,360
And I'm probably gonna like listen slash read it again immediately because it's like trock full of goodness

1249
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,000
But the introduction to the 48 laws of power is

1250
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:08,120
Basically this big kind of like essay all about like how power is used and like how to look out for people who are you who are really

1251
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:16,000
Effective at using power despite not seeming as such and this entire essay is literally just disgusting social justice warriors

1252
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,600
Like if you ever wanted just like they're like, oh, of course

1253
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,360
I'm like, I already kind of knew that going in but just hearing it after affirmed in a

1254
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:28,280
Subject matter that's talking nothing about SJWs and trying to like be submerged them

1255
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,680
Like just listen to the introduction of 48 laws of power. You're gonna be like, oh

1256
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,760
Yeah, I am not saying I am not saying that the social justice movement is like

1257
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:42,840
Deliberately designed and the people in it are consciously attempting to undermine

1258
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:51,040
Society but what I am saying is if there were a force that was trying to covertly upend the Western society

1259
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:55,040
This is what it would look like. I think there's a I'm just saying I'm just saying

1260
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,880
Contention of people hiding behind the social justice movement to do that

1261
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:06,240
It wouldn't be so unsurprising. It would not be unsurprising and the way that we've like just for example

1262
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,040
We've basically labeled all women who claim anything as like in the social justice circles

1263
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:16,640
Any woman who makes an accusation must be believed in some circles like wow, what an amazing tool

1264
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,600
We've given to any evil women out there. This is incredible

1265
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,880
They could they can really use that and this bullshit about no one would ever claim anything if it wasn't true

1266
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:29,080
No, get that out of my face. I don't give a fuck. That's a shitty argument. There's tons of reasons why you would

1267
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:34,520
So yeah, I just don't believe in giving tools that could be abused to anyone

1268
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,680
I want everyone to be on the same playing field, but you know what whatever I'm getting all wound up about this

1269
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,440
We all know the score here

1270
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,480
Anyways weird

1271
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:47,680
Let's let's come around a voicemail now that we've gone down that right. It's weird. Yeah, let's get into some truth

1272
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,720
I guess some people who aren't afraid to share their weirdness with the world

1273
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,280
our listeners

1274
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:03,600
Absolutely, and let's see first up on the chopping block. We've got a voice message here from pig word pig word the friendly pig

1275
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,840
What have you got for us friend go?

1276
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,720
Then it's the fucking Ghibli cast gonna get to fucking pork a row sir

1277
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:19,880
Oh, that is my shit. The only reason I watch Ghibli fucking pigs for life suck my dick

1278
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Well, okay, that's all right

1279
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,760
I'm on the Ghibli cast as well. Oh, yeah, of course. I forgot that's a game show as well

1280
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,920
so like I

1281
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,640
watched pork a row sir like weeks ago and I

1282
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,920
Think it's just

1283
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,600
Everyone forgot no wait did you was doing like his month of videos at the next one. Is that next on the block?

1284
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:49,520
I think it's next. Okay. I think it's next so so I just need to remind digi and set a date and say digi digi digi digi digi

1285
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:54,600
Digi and and devu as well. Maybe I don't know what's going on with the view. I haven't heard it from him in a while

1286
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,040
So which we're just gonna message them, but I do want to do that because that is a really good film

1287
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,400
Yeah, it's probably my favorite Ghibli after watching it

1288
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:06,560
Man, that's what I really wanted to jump in on and watch it with you guys, but I just don't fucking time

1289
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,440
I gotta do other shit

1290
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:14,680
Like watch and bully. Yeah, that's right. Oh, that's that's a little teaser for everybody. Yeah. All right

1291
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:21,800
Next one. This is from your boy has a message for us. Let's hear it. All right. Hey fuckers

1292
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:28,000
Just wanted to tell you I love you. Yeah, you're all my role models. Thanks. You'll suck

1293
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,520
No, my question is why do I not have any friends?

1294
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,460
Yeah, if you approach your your potential friends with like I love you you're great

1295
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:46,720
No guys, I don't see any flaws in his approach. I think this really I I can't figure out

1296
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,960
Just keep doing what you're doing, man, you'll find somebody eventually

1297
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:55,520
I think I think your biggest problem is that we are your role models

1298
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:02,280
That's an issue and I think you might be coming on a little too positively you got to nag a little bit more when you're no

1299
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you got it

1300
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,880
You got to become good friends by being nice and then you can you can nag on people

1301
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,280
I mean, that's that's generally true

1302
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:15,720
The way you become friends is just to be like nice to them and then it's weird for a little bit

1303
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,640
But then it's cool. You can hang out with us

1304
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:22,520
You're all right, and then it becomes a thing like you want to go to a house and play Splatoon or smash

1305
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,280
And then and then after a couple months after a couple months you can call them cunts all day

1306
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,240
Yeah, that's true. This is how you get a girlfriend that you you say hey

1307
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,120
Do you want to play smash not telling her that secretly what you're thinking of is?

1308
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:42,720
And then she's given a verbal contract allowing you to do whatever you want sure once you smuggled in your own

1309
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,720
That's how you do

1310
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,960
Video games are you sent hashtag there it is

1311
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:56,080
All right, here's one from Ronary Mishin Mishin welcome. What do you got? I?

1312
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,640
Haven't talked to anyone in like over a week

1313
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:08,120
So I'm wondering how long have you guys spent not talking to anyone ever in person talking to or like online

1314
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:12,640
I guess he means in person has to be in person. I'm guessing just talk to us technically

1315
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:17,960
So if that if it's online counts, you just broke his streak. Yeah, we reset the counter there reset the counter

1316
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:25,400
I mean, I don't know. I probably have not gone a single day in my life without you know what now that I think about it in

1317
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:29,320
College I think there were some days that I didn't talk to anyone

1318
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:36,680
Yeah, I think the most has been like a weekend the longest I've ever been cuz like at uni

1319
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:41,800
I would stay in my room and I I didn't really like my housemates and they didn't really like me, but it wasn't because

1320
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:48,680
Like we had any animosity it was just like it was awkward the first time we met and it didn't stop being awkward

1321
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,680
So it's just all I

1322
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:56,880
Didn't but but I I would talk to I had friends at uni who are different and I would talk to them

1323
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:02,840
But when it was the weekends, I didn't need to go in and so sometimes I would just sit at home playing video game

1324
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,320
And and making pony reviews. Oh, yeah, that was that sort of time

1325
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,800
Live with someone so I couldn't avoid the

1326
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:17,680
You know the good morning sort of interactions, but if we discount those the mandatory interactions, yeah family members

1327
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:22,280
Like I'm not talking like I didn't even have like proper conversations. It's like good morning

1328
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:27,640
Hi and back sort of those things then probably like a few weeks. Maybe at some point

1329
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,480
That's pretty long. Yeah

1330
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,560
I went a few weeks in college because like what happened in college for me is that I was like dating my girlfriend at the time

1331
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,640
And then we broke up and then all my other friends. I knew I knew through her

1332
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:46,120
So I didn't want to talk to any of them and I actually I've lived on campus at the time

1333
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,920
And I happened to be in horseman hall at my college and that was horse horse hall

1334
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:57,680
And and this this was the only dorm on campus. I had single room dorms

1335
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,240
So I lived on campus with no roommates at all

1336
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:08,640
So for like two or three weeks at a time, I would just talk to no one and it was fucking sick

1337
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:16,520
No one but the whores here in a man hall was it was there not even like classes you went to I had no friends

1338
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,120
I didn't need to talk to them

1339
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:20,200
So because this is like senior year

1340
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:25,360
So I was just doing like senior portfolio and stuff and like no one talked to anybody doing senior portfolio because we were all like

1341
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,520
About to die. So we had to do this entire big portfolio piece and get an art project ready for

1342
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:35,160
The show we did at the end of the year, which I didn't find out because I didn't talk to anybody that it was actually mandatory

1343
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:40,680
So like I don't care about doing stuff for a portfolio like a senior show to see like three people including my parents

1344
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:44,000
I make things on the internet and they're like, no, no, this is like 40% of your grade. I'm like, oh

1345
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,240
And oh, it's doing three days. I guess I should probably do something

1346
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:53,320
Damn, did you get it done? I just took something I was doing on the internet just said oh, I was working on this the entire time

1347
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,600
I made it work, but uh, no, like I didn't like I very rarely talked to the instructors at the point

1348
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,600
I didn't need to and I would just like

1349
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,320
Go to class then I would sleep during the day then it'd be up all night

1350
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,840
I'd walk around the campus when no one else was awake at like 3 a.m. And it was fucking sick

1351
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,760
Well, that's dope. I would say though

1352
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:20,200
I feel like Mages situation is probably relatively common of people like who don't have any meaningful interactions day to day

1353
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,400
And that's really sad. I would say

1354
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,320
He didn't I would say fix this if your life is like this

1355
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,600
It's not ideal and you're probably harming your mental health

1356
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,800
It is as sick as it was it is better to have interactions with people

1357
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:40,600
It's um, yeah, yeah, I am very lucky to have like brothers

1358
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:46,560
Yeah, who are cool because we talk quite a lot like we often go on Pokemon me and

1359
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,120
Hgb guy go and Pokemon walks together and we you know if we had something that was on our mind

1360
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:59,920
We can talk about it while we're walking in Pokemon and it's like that's a really nice like very like not occasional like

1361
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,760
Regular like deep conversation in real life, and that's that's nice. Yeah, that's good

1362
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:09,320
It's good to have stuff like that if you can but if you ain't got brothers got to go go join a club

1363
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:13,840
And I mean that sincerely I met a lot of great people through my anime club not a joke

1364
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:18,840
Surprising like you might think you're fine, you know not interacting with people

1365
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,000
But then you actually interact with people and you feel so much better about it

1366
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:28,600
Swallow your special snowflake-ness and recognize that you are a base lowly human animal and humans are pack animals

1367
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,240
And you'll be doing yourself a favor if you associate with you other humans life life is the sins

1368
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,600
Yeah, you your social media goes down and then you cry

1369
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:48,520
Alright, well that should be enough for him. Here's one from a house of Claude another message

1370
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,160
Hi, I was in the sophomore year of high school

1371
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,560
Well, I was an improv and improv club

1372
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:59,560
We were playing a game called props if we don't know what it is you take an object and pretend

1373
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,400
It's other things we ran out of props and

1374
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:09,960
One of the girls said can I be a prop and I said impulsively all women are props

1375
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,160
Water

1376
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,300
He finishes he's drinking 95% of a liter of water right now

1377
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,800
Wow, what a power move. Oh, yeah

1378
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,840
No, he's gonna do it. He's gonna do it

1379
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:41,320
I hate it. I hate this. There you go. Oh my god. Oh god. What a god. I just want to oh

1380
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,280
That was nice

1381
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:53,760
That was a good story. I liked it. It was a pretty good story

1382
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,000
I

1383
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,800
Kind of wish we weren't laughing immediately after he said that he called all women's props

1384
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:04,400
Because I wanted to know what they responded with no, they didn't respond with anything. He simply replied

1385
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:11,160
I'm going to drink 95% of a liter of water now. He did not okay. No, he didn't I'm telling you. I'm telling you

1386
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,480
I was into it. Oh my god. I

1387
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:19,980
Was not ready for some like weird like creepy incel comment, but no he fucking red-pilled the shit out of that

1388
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:27,640
Well, I think we all pretty much that guy I mean the moral of the story

1389
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:36,720
Clearly he's yeah, indeed. Here's one from a Tomasso Tomasso choco taco

1390
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,480
Okay, all right driving through South Carolina. I found a place called a shit. You not cuckold landing

1391
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:50,080
I just thought I should let y'all know just in case y'all don't have the location of PCPHQ locked in

1392
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,240
I

1393
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:00,040
Was gonna say it but then he said it cuckold's landing in South Carolina

1394
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:05,280
PCPHQ southern division. I'm already on the plane. I'm already on the plane

1395
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:17,240
Because it'll be a endless bounty of women available to fuck at all times because we will be the guys

1396
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,240
We fuck all the cuckolds women

1397
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,520
Yeah, I got I hope so here we go. He's one of David Bowie this one

1398
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,520
Let's see what he's got for us

1399
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:54,000
Question for a specific member of the PCP they might not be on that episode

1400
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,320
So you might just be calling it for no reason and then the other members would have to answer for them

1401
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,040
Which wouldn't give you a specifically satisfying answer for what you wanted to ask them

1402
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,920
I like that one David

1403
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:16,400
That that very true and very good very boy. Yeah, that was very yeah

1404
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,240
It

1405
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:25,640
Yeah, what it what was what are we supposed to do when somebody isn't on the episode and somebody wants a question for a specific member

1406
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:31,840
You know at the member and then the reply in the comments on the episode. Well, you should do if you should do

1407
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,600
Here's here's a solution if you have a question specifically for one of the members

1408
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,960
You should start the voicemail with this is directed towards so we can if we hear it

1409
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:45,400
We're for screening questions. We can know not to use that one if they're not on the episode

1410
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,960
Yes, I generally that is a good thing

1411
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:55,120
It's just like because the the PCB format is such that anyone could be there or not be there every single time

1412
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,840
So there's no way to know

1413
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:01,680
So, I mean the the flaw is just we screen them a little bit. I screen them really

1414
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:07,600
I'm just gonna try to dump ones that don't use you know that person if they're not here. That's it

1415
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,020
That's all we can do, you know, what else? What else is there to say about it?

1416
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,340
All right, here's another one from a formal one spar. He's got another one for us

1417
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,400
What's up?

1418
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:23,440
Hello, you have a collect call from clear view mediocre security mental war

1419
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,880
I'll take listen. There's no time. All right. I only had 24 cents for this non-net neutrality protected connection

1420
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:34,000
All right, look, I'm not crazy. I need these timestamps to prove the conspiracy

1421
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,760
There's a connection here that you're not seeing they haven't found out yet

1422
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,240
I can still access my channel from the iPads in the rec room. I need time to have by October 15th

1423
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,760
Time has expired. Thank you. Goodbye

1424
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:52,960
Okay, good stuff. What's bar needs those Starfleet timestamps, right? That this is good. This is you see guys. He put

1425
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:00,820
Just, you know, I like this. Yeah, he noticed that his his previous calls were being talked over because they were boring

1426
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,520
And then he made them more interesting. That's very good. This is what we want. Good job

1427
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,000
This is what we want. He deserves those timestamps. Yeah

1428
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:14,520
And he's on his channel is like once bar weekly, I think and what's his uh, he's looking he's it was it it is Starfleet

1429
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,600
Yes, all right anytime

1430
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:22,520
From all PCB episodes send them to to one spar. He's probably on one spar Twitter. You can find them. I'm sure

1431
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,240
But yeah, there's I wonder what this there's a connection. We're not seeing guys. What what could it be?

1432
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,680
We need to find well. He is in an insane asylum now. So

1433
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,840
Oh, wait

1434
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,720
Shit, this may be a flaw in my plan

1435
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,440
Here's another one from from Simon. Simon's got another one for us. What's up?

1436
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:44,200
The voicemail's bit is bad

1437
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,320
It only works on the dick show because he screens them and he has a high

1438
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,440
quality IQ

1439
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,200
Production value. Okay. Okay. And oh, but you're using the voicemail bit to say that the voicemail bit is bad

1440
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:03,640
Isn't that contradictory? I hear I hear what you're saying Ben saying

1441
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Or whatever fucking

1442
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:13,000
Who cares? This isn't funny. What I'm saying is fuck you. The voicemails are bad. Stop doing them

1443
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,240
I just want to hear you guys talk about shit. Fuck off

1444
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:21,560
I think that you are in the minority by not like them. I do it's interesting that if we if we had screened the voicemails

1445
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:23,560
You're even the first one to go

1446
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:27,240
I okay to be to be faith to leave clear

1447
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:32,920
I do in fact screen them in that I listen to at least a portion of them and just decide quickly like okay

1448
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,560
Is this one I'm going to show or not like is it we can't say that?

1449
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:39,000
I mean a lot of you are going to bait the first couple seconds something that sounds good

1450
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,920
I mean that's a risk we have to take

1451
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,280
I mean if

1452
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:49,880
If it like if they're able to make something enticing at the beginning and then deliberately make it shitty

1453
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:53,400
Then it would be a joke and then it would be funny. So I wouldn't mind that I wouldn't mind that either

1454
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:57,400
But you know, I think we are increasing the quality as we go and I think a lot of people like the same

1455
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,720
Yeah, these ones have been good, but you picked the right you picked good ones indeed. Well, thank you. Thank you very much

1456
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,400
I'm doing a little work on it. Um, all right. Here's one from somebody mage knows

1457
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,800

Right, okay, and this is the satan. Here's our last one from uh ultimatum juniper

Mage just wants a goddamn piece of candy fucking corn

She's been a respected member of your fucking misogynistic podcast

1478
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,960
For decades

1479
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,280
And y'all can't send her a fucking shitty piece of three cent candy corn

Fucking relapse on the kilo keto lifestyle. He told me I should do it

1487
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,280
And then I fucking did it and I just ate cream

1488
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:02,040
For days and now I can't leave my fucking house and I'm shouting into this voicemail machine

1489
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,920
Into the void

1490
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:07,480
It's all right. We hear you. We hear you

1491
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,560
I heard that too

1492
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,560
Oh, we'll pass that fuck you on to ben

1493
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:16,040
We'll make sure he hears that one loud and clear. Well, it's it's the middle of september now

01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,360
So I guess candy corn will be available again soon

1495
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:22,280
Oh, that's true. That's true. How are we?

1496
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,320
People are already getting into the spook spirit

1497
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,240
Guys get ready for fucking

1498
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:36,200
Oh my god. Hey, wait a minute. Gib. I just want to say it would be pretty appropriate if the if the finale of

1499
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:42,600
Of pump a.k.a pump the big spooker dropped on halloween. That would be a pretty incredible

1500
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,320
ending wait, wait

1501
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:50,840
Shut up. Oh shit. Wait. I didn't know that was a thing. All right. Well, it's it's it's not actually my secret plan

1502
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:55,320
But it is a very good because that's when she was born. Oh, yeah, that's right

1503
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,280
Oh, what was that? Was that tom if it's going to be halloween soon?

1504
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:03,400
Does that mean you're going to be changing your twitter icon to something not halloween related? Is the gag going to continue? Oh, yeah

1505
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,520
What's it going to be?

1506
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:09,960
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm going to change it back to just hypocrite

1507
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:16,520
Will this be one year? I it was like one year of having continuing to have the halloween

1508
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:20,120
Twitter thing which I started in november last year

1509
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:27,160
Right and pump who was born as a result of this, right? I will I will always be halloween except on halloween

1510
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:32,920
Fantastic. Oh, excellent. Um, well, let's switch over to the questions real quick

1511
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:37,800
We'll burn through a couple of these trash low effort, uh, you know questions and uh,

1512
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,360
We'll just we'll do that show

1513
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,880
Let me just read the pity question here from at noodle bombs

1514
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:49,960
Uh, just ask when will we see the adventure time podcast? That was it just now. Uh, it's over just now

1515
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:55,720
You you just heard it. We did it. We did it. You're welcome. Um, what all right. Well, so that's that what else is going on

1516
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:00,040
Um, anyone looking in the in the main chat. I'll get some from here, but um

1517
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,920
There's there's uh, there's not there's not a whole lot of pickings this

1518
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,840
Really great. Tell me you posted in patron knowledge. Not the questions. Oh, they posted the wrong chat

1519
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,320
Oh, true. That might have been why fair enough the same thing

1520
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:17,320
You fool. There's there's several dream related questions

1521
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:19,480
Oh

1522
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,720
Our true nightmares, uh

1523
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:29,160
This dream meme has to end the my dream is that we get no more questions about dreams every dream is to have more dreams

1524
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,720
But I can't damn it ever since they cut out my mandula oblongata

1525
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,960
um

1526
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,280
This isn't a question, but it's in the questions box

1527
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:43,560
Someone should draw all the pcp members as bugs from hollow knight and I agree. That's true. Someone should do that

1528
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:49,080
That would be adorable. I love hollow knight art style and like the little bug bug designs. So that would be great

1529
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:53,080
That would be great. I'm I'm weighing to hollow knight as everyone knows and just did the stream of it

1530
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:59,560
What like two days ago? I remember remember when I drew all of us as like those furry rpg characters

1531
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:03,800
I sure do. I was a spider. So yes, johnny is a spider

1532
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,400
You know what's okay the biggest disappointment about hollow knight

1533
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:09,480
This is literally the worst thing about hollow knight

1534
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:16,040
Is that there is a big area that is spider themed and there is a big arena in the spider themed area

1535
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:21,080
Yet, there is no fucking spider boss in the game in a game about fighting bugs

1536
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,520
It's like that is obviously going to be like the biggest thing

1537
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:29,320
Maybe it's going to be like I think it might be like for dlc because they're going to make a horn at dlc soon

1538
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:33,880
But it's ridiculous. Isn't it isn't isn't it weird how how like

1539
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,600
scorpions or bugs

1540
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,600
Are they I think they're technically

1541
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:42,600
They're insects. Yeah, they're like spiders

1542
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:48,680
Oh, okay. So spiders count. I guess scorpions count too then. Yeah, well, they're not dogs. That's for sure

1543
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,680
Um, I I've got a question here from eric sea bass

1544
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:56,600
Uh, what kind of show would you make with a youtube red series?

1545
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:02,360
Undertale irl all dressed up as the characters and we would act it out in on the set

1546
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,600
I think mage would make a good frisk

1547
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,600
Yeah, because she has the dark side to her true and she would kill everyone

1548
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,320
Of course, of course, um

1549
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:15,960
Did uh, uh, you don't strike me as a metaton though

1550
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:21,720
You strike me more as a as a as a like an asriel or like you might you'd probably be flowery now that I think about it

1551
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:32,600
Yeah, uh, uh, what was I going to say? Oh, apparently somebody told me that there was like a new boss in the switch release of undertale

1552
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,040
Which there is pisses me off a little bit. Can you spoil me on it at all gib? Is it I?

1553
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,480
Yes, it is

1554
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:43,960
I don't know where it is or what you need to do to find it, but it is mu mu kissy cutie

1555
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,200
Which is the anime that um

1556
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:50,760
Alphys watches. Oh, you know what that's okay. Is it a good fight? Is it cool?

1557
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:56,680
I don't know. All I know is that it appears briefly in the trailer. Oh, or in a video somewhere

1558
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,240
I'll have to that's really he's just he's just like man everyone

1559
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:05,240
Everyone who's played undertale has bought it now. I guess I'll just have to put a new content in the switch version

1560
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:08,520
So all you fucks buy it again. See that's the thing

1561
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:11,880
I played undertale a bunch and I don't want to play it again

1562
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:15,640
Uh, nothing against the game, but I played it too much and it's it's not a game

1563
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:22,920
That's replayable beyond like four or five times like after that. It's not really you don't get that much out of it

1564
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,480
I don't know. I haven't played it in a long time

1565
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:32,360
Like a I mean I'm still burnt out after making my video that took a million years. Oh, well you made a video about it

1566
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:35,080
I I could I could potentially get the switch version

1567
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:41,320
Uh, and we'll buy a switch and then get the switch version. Yeah, and then you know have a little fuck because I still

1568
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,200
I still don't legally own

1569
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:47,000
You know, I don't think I ever played it legally either now that I think about it

1570
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:53,320
I bought it for PS4, so I paid my dues. Oh, there you go. Are we gonna get doxed is Toby gonna dox me?

1571
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:57,080
All right, I got a question from you Toby first arrows on

1572
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,080
It says how do you guys not believe in ghosts when you have met the lord of ghosts?

1573
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:09,000
Well, there is a lot of speculation that he's just a man in a suit, which I I believe personally. I'm not aware of his conspiracy

1574
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:16,040
Yeah, yeah, it's a big one a lot of people are thinking that I mean if if you're in the rowdy fuckers cop killers

1575
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,280
Uh discord you'll you'll know

1576
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,840
Um that the lord of ghosts was dethroned. He's no longer a lord

1577
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:29,880
He's just the ghost. He's been he's been gang raped and destroyed by a group of slime riddles

1578
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:34,360
On the steps of what he was like elected like the leader of of

1579
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:41,480
He he was elected the mayor, but he he's not the mayor or the lord because he was a lord of ghosts before he became the mayor, correct?

1580
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:43,320
Yep, he was the lord of ghosts

1581
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:49,560
He became the lord mayor of ghost and then he was he was um impeached so hard that he lost all ranks and titles

1582
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:55,480
With the with the discovery with the new menu item of coleslaw on the kfc menu that allows

1583
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:03,480
The the denizens of slime city to attack ghosts at last we can get a foothold against the nega slime and me and my brothers in the

1584
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,920
In the rfck we slayed the nega slime

1585
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:11,960
And then we had to turn our mob like ravenous rage towards the lord of ghosts

1586
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:15,080
Who summoned it to begin with with his endless rocks that bitch

1587
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:20,440
And those goddamn busters with that goddamn ghost busting coleslaw

1588
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,680
Now that's one for the swear jar right there using that word

1589
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:28,840
Um, well all the questions are shit. So maybe let's just wrap it up here

1590
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:33,640
We didn't get a lot this time. Uh, we did but we did tons of the voice ones. Which are the good ones anyway

1591
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:39,320
Yes, poor tech space bros. They're all dead. Yeah, all right. I guess we're done everybody. Oh, that was good

1592
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,960
I felt like there was a lot of good stuff there. We did it. We did

1593
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:48,280
It was a solid one solid like the poops that I pooped. Um, because I eat only protein

1594
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,120
You're right. I do need some salad, uh

1595
01:53:52,120 --> 01:54:00,040

Uh, and one dollar to get into the bonus. What is what is 16 episodes divided by five dollars?

1602
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:27,240

But I'm not working

I'm doing nothing

My dick i'm jerking

01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
Myself i'm sucking

1617
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:31,160

Don't want to do it
