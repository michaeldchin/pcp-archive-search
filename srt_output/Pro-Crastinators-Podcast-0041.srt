00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,880
I am the main dude, the guy who's the number one cool guy, that's me, best guy ever.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,640
And who we got here today with us?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,800
We have Hippocrit.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm the number two guy.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,520
You're poop.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,040
We've got Tom Oliver.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,400
I was going to say number two guy, too.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Oh no.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
You guys are both poop.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,200
You have to fucking kill each other then to see who wins.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,160
Actually, you already team up to kill me in the brawl.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Find out.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
This episode.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Yeah, the brawl.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Go to the Redcon 2 Royal Rumble to find out who is poop.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,280
You did fucking wreck my shit.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
You know, I don't mean to.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Oh, you just spoiled it.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
You idiot.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
They may not have seen it.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
They've all seen it.

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,760
They've all fucking seen it.

24
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,000
You know, there is a slight similarity between the ultimate victor and poop.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
I do see some visual similarities.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,120
But in any case, let's move on to today's topic.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,320
So this is from a while ago.

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,800
It looks like during Redcon, people weren't asking us as many questions.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
So come on, guys.

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Keep asking questions.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,840
But in any case, this is a topic I thought was cool.

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,280
And it is by, right here.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Yeah, okay.

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Here we go.

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,240
Vitalis the Kid asks, Topic for PCP, what did you guys aspire to around the age of eight

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
to 14?

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,960
Oh, there was an age bracket.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
This is like writer, game developer, or Spider-Man.

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,560
Well, he said that, but I don't care about that at all.

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
So just ignore it.

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
I just like to read the whole thing for fun.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,400
So Gib, what do you think?

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,320
Well, I have a long list of things I wanted to be because I changed my mind basically

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,400
every time I find something cool.

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Makes sense.

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,560
The very earliest thing that I wanted to be was, you ever seen Hercules?

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Sure.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
The Disney one?

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Yeah.

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,680
You know, the big ice elemental, I wanted to be that because I really like him.

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,080
His legs came off every time he walked, but he would still grow him back because he's

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
so cool.

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
He's so cool.

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,000
He's really tenacious, willing to fucking break his legs.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
He's like, ice cool, you would say?

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Yeah.

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Yeah.

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah.

59
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,640
Hey, did you know, Gib, you played Kingdom Hearts 1, right?

60
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Yep.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,240
And you play the 1.5, right?

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah.

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,640
Did you know that if you go back to the Colosseum at the end of the game, after you've beaten

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,400
like, I think like mostly everything else, that guy's a boss and you can fight that guy?

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh, fuck.

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Yeah.

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
And it's super fun.

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
It's super fun.

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
Oh, you can find Sephiroth 2 and he's like the hardest boss in the game.

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
He's gay.

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I don't care about Sephiroth.

72
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
You gay.

73
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,080
I just care about the Isolamentals.

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
I love elementals in games.

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,000
They're my favorite trope.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They are?

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Pretty great.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,040
Oh, and just speaking of Kingdom Hearts, everyone, my Kingdom Hearts lecture is definitely going

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,680
to be out by the time this is out.

80
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,320
So make sure you go to the Radcon 2 playlist and watch all our shit.

81
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,760
There's a big Kingdom Hearts 2 lecture, so go learn yourself some knowledge.

82
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,040
Should I keep going with my list until I'm done and then we'll do the rest?

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
I think so.

84
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I think so, if you don't mind.

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Okay.

86
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
It's not too long.

87
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,120
The next thing I wanted to be was a wizard at Hogwarts, because I read the books and

88
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,240
I wasn't yet off age and I was like, well, maybe my parents are just really good at hiding

89
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,120
secrets about this or maybe they're muggles.

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
It could be.

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Like Hermione.

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Hermione's parents were muggles.

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah.

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
They didn't know shit.

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Dude, I remember when I turned, I think like 10 or 11, I was just like waiting for that

96
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
letter to arrive.

97
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,600
I was like, I know what's going to happen to me.

98
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm the special boy.

99
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm the chosen one.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's going to be me.

101
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Didn't happen to Ben.

102
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Fuck him.

103
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah.

104
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Fuck Ben.

105
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm the, I'm the Lily shit.

106
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
What was her name?

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
He's the Petunia.

108
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
Lily Potter.

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Yeah.

110
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
No.

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,360
She had a different name originally before she, I'm trying to describe how I'm the cool

112
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,760
younger one with all the abilities and the prettiness and the cool sister.

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,960
And then Ben is Petunia, Vernon's wife, the horrible aunt, you know, that Harry grew up

114
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
with.

115
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't know.

116
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I don't know the last name.

117
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Okay.

118
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Whatever.

119
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Lily.

120
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Billy.

121
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
That works.

122
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Lily.

123
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Billy.

124
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Yeah.

125
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,800
So after I turned whatever it was the age, I was like, oh, it doesn't exist.

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Fuck that shit.

127
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Yeah.

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,640
And then I wanted to be a drummer because my dad was a drummer and occasionally he

129
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,200
played at our school for various things and he's real cool and I was really proud of him.

130
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,760
And I wanted to be a drummer, but I didn't really express deep interest.

131
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,480
I was just thinking about it as, you know, a dumb kid.

132
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,200
You don't realize as a kid, you got to do things, you just think about stuff.

133
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:59,400
Then I would, I think it was like 13, 14 where I started reading Mango and I read like

134
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,920
volume three of Dragon Ball and I wanted to be Goku and I wanted to be a martial artist

135
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,080
and the way I thought about it was I would just train like Goku.

136
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
I don't need to sign up for like a training lessons or anything like that.

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,320
I would just, you know, get asked for Christmas some weights that I could wrap around my feet

138
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,080
and I'd put them on and if I keep them on for like a month and I take them off, I should

139
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,760
be able to jump real high and that was my...

140
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
Just like the turtle shells.

141
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Yeah.

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
That's just exactly the same reasoning.

143
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I thought it would work.

144
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
It didn't work.

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
That's too bad.

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
I was pretty sad.

147
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I guess...

148
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
But after that...

149
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Oh, sorry.

150
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Go ahead.

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Go ahead.

152
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Well, I was just going to say, now seems like an appropriate time to say that that was

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,360
also my goal and I also bought a bunch of training weights and wore them throughout like most

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,600
of high school, little like two to five pounders on my wrists and ankles the whole time and

155
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,920
yeah, I just...

156
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,040
Actually they were kind of cheap and they would spring holes and just leak sand everywhere

157
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,680
sometimes so I would just leave trails of sand behind me wherever I walked and they'd

158
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,760
be like, whoa, there goes that swole kid.

159
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Leave sand everywhere.

160
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Fuck yeah.

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,920
One thing that was cool about those weights is that, I mean, they wouldn't let you jump

162
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,760
high but after you took them off, you felt like your knees could go to the ceiling.

163
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,000
You know, you could do like the, like, whoa, I am really, really strong now.

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's true.

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just for like five minutes.

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's cool.

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,200
It's kind of like that thing where, you know, if you stand inside a doorway and you try

168
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,120
to lift your arms up and then you just do that for like a minute and then you step out,

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,040
your arms just go up by themselves.

170
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
It's like...

171
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Oh yeah.

172
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,540
I love doing that.

173
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:39,220
So I saw the manga was in the school library which is where I found it but nearby was the

174
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,580
how to draw manga and after learning that manga was a thing that you could do as a job,

175
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,460
I wanted to be a manga boy.

176
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,740
So I tried, this is the one thing that I actually tried doing.

177
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,820
I still have my original manga that I drew and I think I mentioned it on Twitter what

178
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,140
it was a combination of.

179
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,780
I made it like a strange Photoshop of everything that was in it and I actually, I kind of want

180
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,300
to redraw it at some point and put it out there.

181
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
It was never finished.

182
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,340
Was this an original story?

183
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,060
It was an original story but it was very derivative of a lot of different things which is, I guess,

184
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,020
the perfect recipe for a great, perfect manga that I would have made.

185
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
You should redraw it though.

186
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
That sounds cool.

187
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I'd like to just see the original stuff.

188
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,500
I don't think I ever saw it.

189
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,740
The thing about the manga was I could not be bothered to start from the beginning.

190
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,420
Every time I thought of like a cool story or something I would just imagine how it would

191
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
get to the climax and then I would draw the climax.

192
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,700
I would write about the climax because that's the cool part and the setting up is like,

193
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
yeah, it happened, I guess.

194
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,140
That's hilarious.

195
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,740
So yeah, it's just a climax to a story that nobody is ever going to know about.

196
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:55,420
Then there was a time where my dad, being a drummer, being a rocker guy, he introduced

197
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:03,620
me to Led Zeppelin by playing the Royal Albert Hall 1969 DVD special thing where he would

198
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,780
show like John Bonham playing the drums real fast for freezes and it's like an amazing

199
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,860
thing and all the Jimmy Page stuff, it's just so mesmerizing.

200
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,340
I just wanted to be a guitarist after that and so I would play guitar from, I think,

201
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,340
age 17 till now.

202
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,300
That made a big impact on you, it seems.

203
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,620
I never really got good enough or confident enough to like write songs or talk to other

204
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,100
people who played music but I can play guitar so I guess that was one thing.

205
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:40,260
It's funny, my buddy is definitely worse at guitar than you and he is a very shy guy

206
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,100
but he knows a bunch of people and he just did a show is what I'm trying to say.

207
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,820
He was on, he just went to some like open mic thing, him and his buddies and they performed

208
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,140
a little bit and it was original songs actually and it sounds like it went pretty cool.

209
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,340
So you should do that too, it's cool.

210
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,300
I wish I could, I don't think I'd ever really get a band unless I just went out and did

211
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
stuff by myself.

212
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
You should play with your dad sometime.

213
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
I'm sure you'd be happy to do that.

214
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,700
I would want to, I don't know, it's hard to do stuff, you know.

215
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
I do know that.

216
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,860
Yeah, I think we are all aware of that for you.

217
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,860
I hate stuff.

218
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,780
I mean this is skipping ahead to the end of my list but I don't really know really what

219
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,300
I want to do at the moment but I'll continue your list for now.

220
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,500
After being a guitarist, I was still kind of wanted to be a guitarist but then obviously

221
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,820
YouTube was the thing and I learned that you could make money off it and my favorite guy

222
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,140
was AVGN so I was thinking, oh maybe I could one day make a video game review show and talk

223
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,260
about PS2 games because that's a thing that nobody does and I eventually have done that.

224
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:58,340
In between I did My Little Pony as a practice run which was pretty good and then sort of

225
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:05,460
in between all that, in between the pony stage and before the real video game stuff, I had

226
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,300
to go to university because my parents were getting mad at me for not choosing something

227
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,780
to do for my life so I decided, I like drawing and I like the idea of making a Hayao Miyazaki

228
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,780
movie and just drawing it and making the coolest world ever because I love all the Hayao Miyazaki

229
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,900
movies, the spirit and the way the Laputa Castle in the sky is probably my favorite

230
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,540
just because of the environment.

231
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,180
I just love the idea of just building a world and then being able to look at it and then

232
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,900
it being animated and that's like, oh yeah I could be an animator, obviously I'm not

233
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,860
that good and I probably never will be because I'm not Japanese so I did that for three years

234
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,620
and now I'm done with that and I don't really know whether I want to do animation and now

235
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,780
I don't know what I'm just doing YouTube because I do YouTube.

236
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,260
You kind of got a bunch of possibilities in front of you.

237
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,420
I've got a bunch of possibilities, I don't know what I want, which one I want to be when

238
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,420
I grow up and I'm already grown up just too late.

239
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,580
That's cool, yeah, that's pretty thoroughly answers the question, except Gib, you fucked

240
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,860
up because you specifically said 8 to 14, you wasted all of our time, thanks for ruining

241
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,220
this entire cast, Vitalis the Kid I'm sure is furious that you went outside of his predefined

242
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,540
age range, fuck you, Vitalis.

243
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,780
We're all still 14 at heart, so.

244
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,940
That's true.

245
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,260
Everything up to the manga stuff was 14, 8 to 14 I think.

246
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Well that's cool.

247
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,220
Yeah, I was interested.

248
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,660
Okay, well hey Tom, why don't you tell us about your dreams as a child?

249
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,660
I think the first thing I was legitimately interested in being, I guess I have some

250
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:02,060
fictitional things too like Gib was saying, I definitely wanted to be a Power Ranger back

251
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,020
in the day because my name was Tom and then the green guy was Tom and that was the coolest

252
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,180
thing ever and I was like we could hang out and be Power Ranger bros and I definitely

253
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,340
had dreams and shit all the time of being a Power Ranger, it was the coolest thing ever.

254
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,500
You're still latching on to that to this day.

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,220
To this day, honestly, I still want to spend like $500 some day and get one of those really

256
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,460
good replica helmets of the green ranger and just wear it all the time in public, I don't

257
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,340
even care.

258
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,540
I still want to go to a con wearing one of those and then get the green ranger t-shirt

259
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,300
and just be a street version of a Power Ranger and just walk around like a boss, that's my

260
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
dream.

261
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
It's going to have attainable dreams.

262
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Give me money, I need $500 for that.

263
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,500
I also like, but in terms of like serious things I guess, the first thing I wanted to

264
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,300
be as a little kid was the guys who drove the big fucking construction trucks.

265
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,860
I had this weird fucking obsession with those back in the day.

266
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
I guess it's not super weird.

267
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,860
I've given a lot of little kids like trucks and shit but I was like, that was my super

268
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,420
first like massive obsession as a little kid.

269
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,180
I had tons of like remote control trucks, like dumb trucks and like the front loaders and

270
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,780
the back hose, like all them.

271
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,980
I remember my parents got me like one of those, you kind of like sat down and you could like

272
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,700
dig up shit with it and put it in the backyard and I would do that for hours, like every

273
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,580
day just like in my head and be like, yeah, I'm fucking doing all this cool shit.

274
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,060
So we would see little Tom Oliver in his little drivable car thing, driving around his

275
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,900
own backyard digging holes with his child construction equipment.

276
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Is that correct?

277
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Awesome.

278
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
Awesome.

279
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Some of them didn't move.

280
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,260
This one kind of just sat there and you could like dig shit but I had like a remote controlled

281
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
like bulldozer.

282
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
I remember it blew my mind because it was like super huge.

283
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,540
It had to be like at least $100.

284
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,380
It was so like dumb and I was like, this is the coolest thing and you like dig shit with

285
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,660
it and I had like an army of these things and that was like my thing forever and like

286
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,300
I had all these videos about like trucks and shit and I was like, it was autistic levels

287
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,860
of just like this is my jam.

288
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,740
For a long time, like through like, hmm, I guess once I started going into like elementary

289
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,820
school and started like actually learning actual things that kind of changed.

290
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,220
The next big thing I wanted to be was a scientist was my next thing.

291
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,820
I was super into science all throughout elementary school, specifically astronomy.

292
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,220
Astronomy blew my fucking mind.

293
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,820
Space was the coolest thing.

294
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,980
A child with his eyes on the stars.

295
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,940
It was, I guess so, but that was just like, ah, it was, I don't know, it just fascinated

296
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
me.

297
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,900
I liked learning about the solar system and like black holes and supernovas and all

298
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
that stuff.

299
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,420
And I guess like, I think Ben might have been in that, into that too.

300
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,940
Like, you know, he works at AstroCamp after doing physics stuff and he's kind of into

301
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
it now.

302
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,300
I wonder if he was into as a kid too.

303
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
I just wonder because he's not here, but sorry, go on.

304
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Yeah.

305
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,660
I mean, I don't know, I was, I'd always look forward to science class as a kid and like

306
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,940
I guess also this time my dad like is like, dude, you should watch Star Trek and I got

307
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,340
into Star Trek, like the classic and so like space and then lost in space and so space

308
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,460
was a big deal as a little kid, big into like the sci-fi and then like science class always

309
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
talked about that a lot.

310
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,220
I remember one time I think it was in third, no, fourth grade, something like that.

311
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,060
We did, we did a project where you had to like create your own planet in the solar system

312
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,820
and like trying to explain like why no one had ever detected it until now.

313
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,620
I love it.

314
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,980
I came up with this planet that like its orbit instead of going like horizontally was like

315
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,900
vertically and it was like orbiting in such a way that our orbit never like crossed paths

316
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,380
with it and that was kind of the whole thing.

317
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,940
I had like this whole explanation for the project, it was pretty cool.

318
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,100
That is cool.

319
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,740
And I was totally obsessed with science and astronomy and shit up until I think middle

320
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,180
school when math started showing up in science, I was like, I'll fuck this and that killed

321
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,940
that dream right quick because math and me do not get along at all.

322
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,580
So that wasn't really working.

323
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,580
After that, there was a huge period of time where I didn't give a shit about the future

324
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,820
and just played video games.

325
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,460
So good, it did nothing.

326
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,580
Just played a lot of PlayStation 2.

327
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,140
Then at some point I was like, I think I got into new grounds and I was like, oh, you can

328
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,660
make video games.

329
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,900
I want to do that because we had this class in school where it was like multimedia design

330
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,740
and then you there's like this is flash, this is what they make all that shit.

331
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,220
And I was like, oh, so I started doing little animations and stuff and flash.

332
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,780
And I was like, all right, I want to go.

333
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Was this in high school or was this in middle school?

334
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,780
This was still in middle school.

335
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,060
I think it was like eighth grade or something.

336
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,460
OK, all right.

337
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,660
So I think I'm already past the 14th.

338
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,340
So maybe this is the end of my journey.

339
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:44,860
But yeah, animators slash video game guy was the last big thing until like it became

340
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,020
comics and then writing stories and YouTube and all that jazz.

341
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,700
So well, you can keep going and like tell us when that happened because I'm still

342
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,420
curious if it goes past 14, it doesn't matter.

343
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,060
It kind of it kind of it started with with programming and making video games because

344
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,580
that was the big thing I was into is like, oh, I could make these things.

345
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,940
That'd be really cool.

346
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,500
And I had a friend in high school who already knew how to program.

347
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,860
He was making games for like the TI 83 calculators that everyone had to have.

348
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,060
Oh, yeah, yeah, awesome.

349
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,900
So like he knew all that shit is like you can put like a custom OS on this and then

350
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,020
you can load all these games.

351
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,060
You can play all these games.

352
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,340
So like we'd look like we're doing work, but we were just playing like Phoenix, which

353
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,100
is like this like schmuck game and they had like a Mario clone for it and like a

354
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,660
doom clone.

355
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,100
So you're just playing all these games on your calculator and the teachers are too

356
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
dumb to realize doom clone on the calculator.

357
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,900
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

358
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,820
That's awesome.

359
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:41,180
Those TI 83 inspired a world of hackers and late gamer MLG before the iPhone.

360
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,940
There was the TI 83, the original fucking gaming and disguise machine.

361
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,420
So OK, but seriously, I'm really wondering was it even possible to play

362
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,100
doom reasonably well on that thing?

363
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,980
How could it be?

364
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,140
It's no controller.

365
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,820
Well, well, they had they had a d-pad on it, which you can move around with.

366
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
And then you could use like the second button, which is like the function,

367
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,140
like a second one on the other side.

368
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,260
And there's another button under that they kind of was generally used for controls.

369
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,460
And they had an engine called the Raycaster engine that did pseudo 3D

370
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,580
like Wolfenstein 3D and doom did, but they somehow made it work on the calculator.

371
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,820
And so like they had 3D FPS games on there.

372
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,580
They worked reasonably well, which is really fucking crazy.

373
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,060
Our TI 83 calculators like standard issue for a lot of American schools.

374
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,340
So I've heard a lot of people talk about them, but I've never seen one.

375
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,820
It's like that just now.

376
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,860
Yeah, they're kind of like you're expected to buy one.

377
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,540
And I remember like parents got really pissed because like a hundred something

378
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,460
dollars and it's just like, I don't want to spend that much on my little kid.

379
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,500
But they're like, you have to.

380
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,900
We have to learn how to use grass.

381
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,140
I mean, I had to buy a calculator too, but they just called it like a scientific

382
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,660
calculator and it had like all the buttons, but it didn't have a screen like that.

383
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,300
Yeah. So the difference is that the the the step

384
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,020
above scientific calculator is a TI 83.

385
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,460
They're called graphing calculators and they have the dot matrix screen is

386
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,780
essentially for being able to plot graphs like you put in data points

387
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,700
and the screen lets you plot the the data and like map like the trends and stuff.

388
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,300
Because there was a lot of like, I don't fuck.

389
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,420
I didn't I never did any of this shit because fuck math.

390
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,180
But that was the reason that the graphing calculator did someone order pizza by pizza.

391
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,060
I mean, killing your orphans and also eating your babies.

392
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,780
How do I know just in time?

393
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,060
Hey, hey, you're just in luck.

394
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,420
All right, hang on.

395
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,580
Tom was finishing his explanation of scientific and graphing calculators.

396
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,100
Yes, super, super fucking interesting.

397
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,740
I wanted to be a scientific calculator when I grew up.

398
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,340
No, that's the reason they were made.

399
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,420
But then people like hacked them and you could put like custom software on there

400
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,860
because they ran programs and so people like, well, programs, let's make games.

401
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,180
So they had like a custom OS you could put in there called Mirage OS.

402
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,100
It was a launcher for launching games and then you could play like Mario

403
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,860
and Doom and bunch of other like shooter games and stuff like that.

404
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,420
And somehow it proliferated all throughout our school and everybody had those.

405
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,100
So my friend could code for this because it was all in basic and he knew basic and shit.

406
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,260
So I wanted to do that, too.

407
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,380
It was my friend, Stefano.

408
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,300
He'd actually he went after high school.

409
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,300
He moved to California and started making like iPhone games and stuff.

410
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,380
So he actually sounds like he was above the curve here.

411
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,540
He he was he could do like super like photo realistic art and drawing

412
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,900
and was super smart and was super rich.

413
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,140
He was like one of those guys like crit hit on life and I hate him.

414
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,020
Right. But he was a cool guy.

415
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,140
So he could do all that shit and I wanted to do that.

416
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,900
So I bought a book on doing programming and it was the fucking hardest

417
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,140
shit in the world. I couldn't understand it.

418
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,620
And I realized that like the thing I liked about games wasn't the gameplay.

419
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,740
It was like the storytelling.

420
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,420
And so that's where like, oh, I want to do comics and stuff came from.

421
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,460
And that is him lasted all the way through a couple of years ago when I realized

422
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,460
I just want to write and now I'm going to be an author and a YouTuber guy.

423
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,060
Word. And that's the story.

424
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,180
OK, cool. Good.

425
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,300
It's a sink.

426
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,340
You got the full picture. Yes.

427
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,140
Thank you, Munchie. All right, Munchie.

428
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Well, Mr. Wise Guy, why don't you tell us?

429
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,860
Why don't you tell us about your dream so we can laugh and shit on them?

430
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
No.

431
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,740
That's right.

432
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,060
Tell us. Tell all much.

433
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,780
Reveal yourself. He's still like is in this age.

434
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,300
Well, Munchie is 16, so he's just barely outside the range of this thing.

435
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,700
Before I go into mine real quick, Tom, have you ever heard of Temple OS?

436
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,740
I have not heard of Temple OS.

437
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:40,740
It's it's an OS based deeply in the Bible and it's and and it's it's based

438
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,100
on two principles.

439
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,020
God is good.

440
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,060
And number two, I can code better than the CIA.

441
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,420
Wait, what what hardware does this OS run on?

442
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,620
The Bible. Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

443
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,660
I don't understand.

444
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,780
It's like a computer.

445
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,260
It's a computer operating system.

446
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,740
OK, so this is a computer that runs.

447
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
What was it, Mirage OS?

448
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,180
He said Temple, a temple, a temple, right?

449
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Temple OS.

450
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,540
Right.

451
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,660
Is there anything particularly special about this?

452
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,540
It can run fast and it's Christian.

453
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,460
OK, that's good. It's approved.

454
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,060
It's code here. OK, Munchie.

455
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,620
OK, well, I wanted I wanted to be

456
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,940
I wanted to be, you know, one of those video game.

457
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,100
You want to be a video game or OK.

458
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Then like and I wanted to be that like up until like I was 10.

459
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,420
And then I like saw code and I was like, oh, never mind.

460
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,700
I make them. Yeah.

461
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,580
Yeah. More specifically, I wanted to like like draw the like.

462
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,780
Take that dick out of your mouth when you speak, Munchie.

463
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,060
All right. Oh, my God.

464
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,860
Oh, my God.

465
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,900
Got caught.

466
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,660
Damn it.

467
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,220
I was just sucking off my best friend for San Francisco.

468
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,020
Yeah, because because that's gay.

469
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,140
That's right. Yeah.

470
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,180
Well, you know, I got stay true to life.

471
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,380
I wanted to draw the like like the

472
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,260
sprite sheets for video games.

473
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,260
And now I was like, no, that's gay.

474
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,980
And then I was like, I want to draw like shit, like not like that,

475
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,620
but like still like that.

476
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,220
And then I was like, and here I am.

477
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,820
I've I've drawn both of those.

478
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
Sprite sheet art.

479
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,300
I mean, when I was working on Bell with my with my buddy Rich,

480
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,940
I did a bunch of sprite sheet stuff, and it was a big fucking pain.

481
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,140
And it really sucked.

482
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,260
And what I am I I used to take the sprite sheets from Fire Emblem.

483
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,380
The the portraits and the animations and just alter the colors

484
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
so they'd be different guys.

485
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,780
You're a D.A. color.

486
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,540
Fag.

487
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,980
Well, I didn't do it for like any reason other than I liked the idea of like,

488
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,500
oh, yeah, if I take the light blue in this guy's hair and change it to light green

489
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,300
and then take the light, the dark blue in this guy's hair and change it to dark green,

490
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,500
he'll have dark hair.

491
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,220
He'll be my original character.

492
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Oh, I see what you say.

493
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,700
That's I was doing it just for myself.

494
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,900
And I was I was just fill bucket in paint like click, click.

495
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,500
Yeah, it's different now.

496
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,380
Hey, we didn't make some great comics with Kirby Super Star ultra characters.

497
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,900
Oh, I want to see those.

498
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,820
Was was that big bird a character?

499
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,060
I forget his name.

500
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,580
Well, you know.

501
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,740
Well, I'm a street.

502
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,900
No, no, this is a big bird and Kirby Super Stars.

503
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,500
Oh, oh, Dynablade.

504
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,020
That's the one fucking cock.

505
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,580
Yeah, it's Dynablade.

506
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,660
The little babies.

507
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,020
Yeah, I want to see it.

508
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,980
A Sesame Street Kirby crossover.

509
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,580
Oh, that'd be cool.

510
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,860
Kirby would suck up his big old going ads.

511
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,220
Kirby would eat all of Oscar the Grouch is trash.

512
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,300
Yeah.

513
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,580
And then Oscar the Grouch would be revealed to be a no-legged man.

514
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,940
Hey, so Kirby eats a lot of stuff.

515
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,700
Does he care about what he's consuming?

516
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,300
Like, does he taste it or does it just get absorbed?

517
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,580
Like, does he only explained in the anime?

518
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,140
Oh, really?

519
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
This is please.

520
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,380
There's like a like a black hole in his belly.

521
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,380
And that's that you're exactly right.

522
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,700
Yeah, well, whenever he eats something,

523
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,540
it's transported to a endless and infinite space dimension.

524
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,860
Does Meta Knight have one of these in this space dimension?

525
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,260
So he can never be full.

526
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,860
That's kind of tragic.

527
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
That's tragic.

528
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
Does Meta Knight also have that

529
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,260
because he's the same kind of being as Kirby, right?

530
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,820
Meta Knight is like a grown up Kirby.

531
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,620
So I guess they like lose that.

532
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,060
OK. Also, yeah, and then they they get on their mask

533
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,500
and then they're like, I got to fucking stop, dude,

534
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,180
like nightmares and shit through the play.

535
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,180
Hey, Kirby is male, right?

536
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,100
Or is it not specified?

537
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,980
No, it's male.

538
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,700
OK, they refer to him as a boy in like every game.

539
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,940
I was just thinking about it because, you know,

540
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,380
like Kirby's got this endless void to be filled

541
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,260
and Meta Knight's got this big rod to insert into things.

542
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,140
So I'm just wondering, you know,

543
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,340
if there's something going on here. OK, all right.

544
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,140
Well, well, well, if you think that stops people,

545
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,140
then you've got another thing to comment more

546
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,220
on what I wanted to be because that's what the podcast is about.

547
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,060
Yes. I also, like for a while, I thought that

548
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,020
I wanted to do claymation.

549
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,380
Oh, I had a phase.

550
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,100
I had I tried to arrange my Super Mario plushies together

551
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,740
and like like cut over and over again.

552
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,900
So I would have the perfect Super Mario plushie YouTube video.

553
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,340
Actually, if you go to the very beginning of my give and take channel,

554
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,740
you'll see like a few animation tests of like stop frame

555
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,300
where I turned my desk into a studio, put a blanket over the screen

556
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,940
and I would take pictures without knowing what I was doing.

557
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,780
That's cool. I did that, too.

558
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,500
There was like this guy on YouTube back in like the mid 2000s

559
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,700
who did a lot of like really crazy claymations

560
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,940
to like pendulum songs and stuff.

561
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,660
I watched that as like, this is the coolest shit ever.

562
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,900
I want to do it.

563
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,620
So me and my friend are going to start, but he never did.

564
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,660
I did a couple of experiments.

565
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,140
I'm just like, it's too hard to quit.

566
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,460
They are really hard.

567
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,100
I think I did a little at some point.

568
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,980
I don't know. This was like a recent thing.

569
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,340
I did one in college to take an animation class.

570
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,420
So I did do a couple stop motion animations in college

571
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,100
and they're actually kind of not shit.

572
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,180
That's cool.

573
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,260
All right, much. What else you got for us?

574
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,900
I also have. Well, the comment on that real quick.

575
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,940
I eventually got my friend on and I need two people to help me move around.

576
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,780
Munchie, I appreciate that you're trying to be interesting,

577
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,540
but making up things about how you have friends is just we're getting away from real life.

578
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,180
So just keep it real.

579
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,460
How like people die when they're shot with a video game gun.

580
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,100
Yeah, right, right. In real life.

581
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,780
Yeah. Well, I guess what I'm going to pull up my rocket launcher.

582
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,540
OK, I'm with you.

583
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,980
Why do you pull out your diesel?

584
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,340
No, I wanted to say that, but then I was like, nah.

585
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:21,220
Anyway, we were doing a skit where Peach was talking to Bowser,

586
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,980
and then I just say like in a gravelly voice as Bowser, I want to have sex, bro.

587
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,580
And he was like, he shut off the camera, looked me dead in the eyes

588
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,540
and screamed, why would you say that?

589
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,420
Why do you think idiot? All right.

590
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,260
Anyway,

591
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,780
other than that, I was really interested for some reason in the idea

592
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,100
that I could possibly do like be like of like a voice actor,

593
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,460
but not really like like like I didn't like actually like believe

594
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,500
I liked my voice whatsoever.

595
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,300
I just wanted to like be the Lion King.

596
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,820
Are you Mufasa or like the movie like a DVD copy of the movie?

597
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,100
You want to be that a VHS copy. OK, right. OK.

598
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,980
How'd that work out?

599
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,100
Pretty good. I'm halfway there.

600
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,300
I have a murdering part. How was your role?

601
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,780
You're halfway there.

602
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,140
Not bad.

603
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,900
You sound more like the bird.

604
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,740
Two K and Sam, my favorite guy.

605
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,500
I don't think anyone remembers that bird's name.

606
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,300
Oh, you ruined it.

607
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,900
I was trying to think of I was trying to think of what type of bird he is,

608
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,540
but I forgot because Tom's really into the extended Lion King universe.

609
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,020
So he knows all this shit.

610
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,220
That's my secret, Tism. I don't tell anybody about.

611
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,300
So what what type of bird is Zazu?

612
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
He's like a he looks like a two.

613
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,940
He looks kind of like a Toucan, but like smaller and weirder.

614
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,940
He's probably some crazy African species of bird that we don't

615
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,460
understand. Tiki Toko.

616
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,420
Yeah, I don't know.

617
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,820
African words, something.

618
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,420
Tell us in the comments what species.

619
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,020
Is a fruit loop.

620
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,100
He's a fruit loop.

621
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,220
Who's a fucking fruit?

622
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,500
In England, we call it toucans.

623
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,900
Really?

624
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,220
Yeah, we don't we don't pronounce it a toucan.

625
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,100
That's interesting.

626
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,140
Hey, why is re-tard England?

627
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,820
So like puns regarding two cans would be like two can play at that game,

628
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,220
not two cans of pecan's or whatever.

629
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,140
I see.

630
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,740
Interesting that in that particular example, he used can for both of those words.

631
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,180
Well, toucan fucking.

632
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,140
You know, I feel nobody, everybody hates a.

633
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,820
Agreed.

634
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,380
OK, I also figured when I would grow up,

635
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,180
I would just be rich not for doing anything.

636
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,540
But I just figured at one point people would recognize that they needed to give

637
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,460
me money. Well, that kind of they would proceed to give me money.

638
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,260
A kind of lifestyle is reinforced in our modern television programming

639
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,420
with expectations of wealth and riches and fame.

640
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,140
How's that working out?

641
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:11,820
Well, I started out my my journey in order to acquire money by selling

642
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,580
not drawing not like actual drawings I tried to do,

643
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,460
but I just like wrote down on like line paper smiley faces

644
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,700
and I charged them for six dollars a pop.

645
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,940
Dude, that's like paper.

646
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,660
That's like what Fantana was doing, selling his his.

647
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,860
What was it like images of Hillary during the campaign when he's,

648
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,580
you know, trying to be with her?

649
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,660
Please buy my art for thirty five dollars.

650
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,020
I'm a starving artist trying to survive.

651
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,420
And and and that that gumption,

652
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,260
that that that real that real fire in me transformed into nothing.

653
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,100
And now I don't care.

654
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,660
Good. And the world was better off.

655
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,820
Oh, there there was also a brief moment of time

656
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,980
where I wanted to make specifically apple and orange juice.

657
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,820
And I felt very passionate about this.

658
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,980
I like that.

659
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,740
Did you ever want to dabble in making apple butter?

660
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,220
You know what? No, I haven't.

661
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,740
But I don't know what apple butter is.

662
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,300
But I think you and me should team up, become the Hennessey brothers

663
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,340
and make apple butter.

664
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,020
That's been a dream of mine for a long time.

665
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,620
I did a real night.

666
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,780
Your real dream is to be brothers with someone other than Ben.

667
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,700
That's true. That's what I wanted most of all growing up.

668
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,660
One day I'll achieve that. I'm just looking for replacements.

669
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,300
Yeah, you're you're forever on the scale.

670
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,820
You have a very high expectation of your future brother.

671
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,820
Yes, I need you make sure you get the perfect one

672
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,580
because your first one was such a disaster.

673
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,500
That's right. You need to prepare yourself.

674
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,940
That's exactly right.

675
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,340
OK, so you got any other dreams when you think you do, you know,

676
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,140
any of that shit?

677
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,460
There is there is a brief moment of time

678
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,260
where I wanted to be a superhero farmer and kill the KKK.

679
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,940
Now, hang on.

680
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,620
Does that mean that you were going to be a farmer

681
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,780
and your crops were superheroes or you were both a superhero and a farmer?

682
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,780
Both a superhero and a farmer.

683
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,660
OK, I see, I see.

684
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Like Superman.

685
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,940
Yes, exactly.

686
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,060
I'm not familiar with this character.

687
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Fucking plagiarism.

688
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,580
Oh, yeah, he's from a farm.

689
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,300
I remember now.

690
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,220
He grew up in Kansas.

691
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,620
But does he does he like do shit?

692
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,100
Well, he's probably knows how to plant a tomato.

693
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,420
Oh, I don't believe this for a fucking second.

694
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,420
Put it in the ground, cover it up with the earth, done.

695
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,940
Put up with a water on it.

696
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,220
Hey, if there's farmers, if there's farmers on other planets,

697
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,700
instead of calling it Earth, do they call it like alien?

698
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,180
Is that we don't call?

699
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,980
Well, I mean, we call this planet Earth.

700
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,940
So if we call another planet Mars, they would call it Mars.

701
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,340
Oh, I think it's like two definitions for Earth.

702
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,380
Earth isn't soil and Earth isn't the planet.

703
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,900
I think we just called the planet Earth

704
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
because we didn't know it was a planet back in the day.

705
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,820
So maybe every alien planet is actually called

706
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,460
their equivalent for dirt, because back in the day,

707
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,980
they didn't know there was a planet either.

708
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,540
Here's a here's a thing, though.

709
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,660
Nobody fucking speaks alien because nobody exists.

710
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,020
Oh, that's not true.

711
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,060
Well, I mean, we don't know.

712
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,620
But I bet aliens be real if we aren't.

713
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,780
Yeah, I believe that there are probably some forms of life

714
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,180
out in the universe elsewhere as if there's big old aliens.

715
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,500
You know, I agree.

716
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,580
That's why you should get the news that there aren't aliens.

717
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,580
There's only Jewish people out there.

718
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,700
And the cause that's the difference is only.

719
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,980
You like because what's the deal with alien food?

720
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Yes, they brought their alien humor to us on this planet

721
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,660
that we just can't understand.

722
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,820
But it fascinates us like Seinfeld, their leader.

723
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,740
The show is the leader of the people in it.

724
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,860
Oh, the show. Yeah, that's a shame.

725
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,020
I don't get on the mothership.

726
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,500
That's why I felt impressed.

727
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
That's a good one.

728
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,900
Right, Nate, you're fucking gay.

729
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,500
Shans, I can't think of what to say when I was growing up.

730
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:14,340
Shans, he was defeated in the in the wrestle rumble,

731
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,100
but he'll never be truly dead.

732
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,180
The under the spirit of the Undertale fandom will always endure.

733
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,300
There's no getting rid of it.

734
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,220
Fortunately.

735
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,860
OK, when I want to be a kid, you know,

736
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,420
you guys remembered a lot more details than I can.

737
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,540
So I can really only remember a couple of things I actually wanted to be.

738
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,180
Like when I was a kid, when I was in elementary school,

739
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,460
I found out about Dragon Ball, the show, actually,

740
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,020
not the manga like Gib did.

741
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,460
This is Dragon Ball Z.

742
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,580
And so like I just got really into being fit and buff

743
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,180
because I wanted to be like a super cool guy like Goku and beat up bad guys

744
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,540
and have all the ladies like me and stuff.

745
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,580
So so yeah, I started working out like an elementary school.

746
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,300
And I mean, I totally fell off the wagon for like years in between

747
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,180
and started seriously again, like way later in college.

748
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,820
But Goku was always my hero.

749
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,260
And I wanted to be Goku, like DBZ Goku specifically.

750
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,820
And like the only other profession I can remember

751
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,700
or really, I guess that Goku isn't a profession.

752
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,940
So the only profession I can really remember

753
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,700
wanting to be when I was that young was I really wanted to be a doctor.

754
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,540
And I believe that is mostly due to the fact that when I was a kid,

755
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,340
I saw Osamu Tezuka's Blackjack.

756
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,580
I saw like the OVA from the 90s.

757
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,780
And I thought Blackjack was the coolest guy and the doctors were fucking sick,

758
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,580
which they are.

759
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,780
But I just I really wanted to be just like Blackjack.

760
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,260
So I so eventually that just manifested in me going to

761
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,860
the school I went to for their biology program.

762
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,580
And I had the intention of eventually like going into med school afterward.

763
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,900
But when I got there, I realized like, oh, my God, this is going to take so fucking long.

764
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,220
There's no way I'm doing this shit.

765
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,260
So when I was in college, so you could because you had such reverence

766
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,660
for breast examinations. What a babe. Am I right?

767
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,380
She's pressure is kind of a babe.

768
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
Like she's got a weird mom babe body.

769
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,540
Yeah, I don't I was like, she's the hottest girl.

770
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
She's the hottest girl on Star Trek, for sure.

771
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,980
There's no girl hotter than Beverly Crusher.

772
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,100
I'm talking about fucking Stambame.

773
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,540
I don't know what the fuck that means.

774
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,180
We're talking about a second size.

775
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,420
No, shut up.

776
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,900
This is my this is my time.

777
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,740
This is my story.

778
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,700
I space road.

779
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,820
Yeah, I space.

780
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,140
Yeah, that.

781
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,220
All right, whatever.

782
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,940
Well, it doesn't it doesn't matter.

783
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,420
But when I was in college, like I decided not to be a doctor and I did like game design

784
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,140
and then later computer science and then just like

785
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,940
now I'm program and do YouTube stuff.

786
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,820
But that was that was way later.

787
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,020
But another thing I was really into when I was a kid.

788
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,740
This isn't really about like a career, but there was a character

789
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,900
who I emulated even more strongly than Blackjack or Goku or anyone.

790
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,980
This had like a huge impact on me in the way that I

791
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,940
carried myself until like college from from like middle school.

792
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,340
That was when I saw the movie Vampire Hunter D. Bloodlust.

793
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,020
Dude, I that was like my favorite movie ever.

794
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,460
It's it's fantastic.

795
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,860
It's the best animation version of like Yoshi Taka Amino's Hunter D.

796
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,740
You have the will of the D or is that just pretend?

797
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,460
He's well, yeah, I mean, say, yeah.

798
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,380
He's he's just like so that whole movie is.

799
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
And even like there was a I hadn't seen at the time,

800
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,860
but there was like a first Vampire Hunter D movie that had been made

801
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,140
as well as like the light novels or maybe they're just normal novels

802
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,900
with great art from Amino in them.

803
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,340
But like I hadn't read any of those hadn't seen the first movie,

804
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,060
but I had only seen this one and just like consistently.

805
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,620
And did you always tell us about this because he's read some of the books

806
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,980
like D is fond over by every character.

807
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,460
There is a scene in in one of the books that digits has told me about

808
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,500
where D walks into a room and it is described that all the women

809
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,940
instantly fall in love with them.

810
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,300
But he is so beautiful that also the men also instantly fall in love with D.

811
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,340
So it's where it wants the D comes from.

812
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,660
Is this where I mean, I I think so.

813
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,980
I think so. Clearly, it has to be the case.

814
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,380
Yeah, the Vampire Hunter D was a big inspiration for René Descartes,

815
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,300
who made famous the D meme.

816
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,180
But of course, it all comes from from Vampire Hunter D.

817
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,740
But all that matters is that he was super beautiful.

818
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,100
I wanted to be cool like him.

819
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,060
He had these awesome gothic clothes that I thought were super rad.

820
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,060
And like I was a little kid when I saw this movie.

821
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,020
We went to this thing in Massachusetts,

822
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,220
this big Renaissance fair called King Richard's Fair, which is pretty cool.

823
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,620
Have you been there, Tom? I have been there.

824
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,060
Oh, cool. It's it's a fun place.

825
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,180
And when I was there,

826
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,220
I happened to see a giant floppy leather hat just like D's.

827
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,860
And it was like a hundred dollars.

828
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,140
And I spent like my life savings of a hundred dollars

829
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,340
on this giant retarded floppy leather hat that I still have to this day

830
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,420
because it looks like D's. It's back in my parents' house.

831
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,300
Well, I can't wait to see it in best anime ever.

832
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,060
Vampire Hunter D.

833
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Oh, I definitely will wear that exact thing.

834
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,340
Oh, my God, yes.

835
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,060
That I have to do that.

836
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
What?

837
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,460
If it's back at your parents' house,

838
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,020
Ben has already taken it for his own.

839
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,500
Oh, my God, he's wearing my hat and my shoes now.

840
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,820
Fuck you, Ben.

841
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,500
Give me my goddamn shoes back, you bitch.

842
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,380
And last thing about about D was that D is like a real

843
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,380
the whole movie is D kind of by himself doing shit.

844
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,260
And then he runs into people and he deals with it.

845
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,900
But like he spends most of his time alone and like his hand talks to him.

846
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,540
So like the movie is filled with like he's got a parasite in his left hand.

847
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,540
That's like his best friend and helper guy.

848
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,380
And it talks to him.

849
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
It's this weird face thing.

850
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:43,780
Yeah.

851
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,500
And it's kind of exactly like, you know,

852
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,180
the monk from New Yasha, who has like a wind tunnel in his hand.

853
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,700
It's just like Marocco.

854
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Right. It's just like that.

855
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,300
Only this one's alive and talks to him.

856
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,460
It's it's way cooler actually than Marocco.

857
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,180
It is way cooler.

858
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,180
This guy is like personality and sass.

859
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,820
And he's like, oh, D, you fucking idiot.

860
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,540
I hate you, you little bitch.

861
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,540
But I'm going to help you because I actually like you so complex.

862
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,100
He's a very complex character.

863
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,060
But so like the whole movie, D barely speaks at all.

864
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,260
He's so soft spoken, but he's so powerful and he gets so much shit done

865
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,540
and everyone loves him.

866
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
This made a big impression on me as a kid.

867
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,180
And I I stopped talking in class

868
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:28,740
because I wanted to be just like D and just became a silent guy for like several years.

869
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,460
It lasted a while, actually, until like the start of maybe college.

870
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,260
I was all of high school and middle school.

871
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,780
I really tried to be reserved so people would think that I'm super cool,

872
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,620
but it did not work out.

873
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,100
The world does not work like an anime, unfortunately.

874
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,540
That's when I learned that lesson well years later.

875
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,900
But that's it.

876
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,060
I have a question. Sure.

877
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,740
If you don't have the story, I'm pretty much done.

878
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,860
Yeah. OK.

879
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,420
When did you become a gay faggot idiot?

880
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,980
I guess when I saw this movie.

881
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,780
That's when it happened.

882
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,620
We can isolate the incident right there.

883
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,340
But I watch that movie again.

884
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,100
That light novel Nate officially was gay.

885
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,140
I was just I was just one of these guys

886
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,980
charmed by D's beauty and wanted to be just like him.

887
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,820
But I went a step further and so like in high school,

888
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,380
I was this kid walking around with I had super long hair, by the way,

889
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,420
was down to my waist.

890
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,580
So that was another thing inspired by I've got some pictures,

891
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,700
but it's fucking weird.

892
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,900
I was this kid who wore like death note shirts.

893
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,700
I wore I wore Kingdom Hearts arm bands,

894
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,620
a heartless and a nobody civil on my wrist.

895
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,300
Yeah, dude. Yeah.

896
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,540
I and I wore like weights as well on my wrist in addition

897
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,060
and on my ankles, because I also wanted to still be Goku.

898
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,940
So I was like training this whole time.

899
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,780
I'm wearing all this shit. Oh, my God.

900
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,420
I was a God. I was a God.

901
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,540
I was a fucking king of that school.

902
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,940
As you can imagine, my mom would not let me be

903
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,100
because I wanted to do that.

904
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,620
My mom's like, you're not going out in public with that shit.

905
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,660
That's with this fucking death note shirt.

906
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,860
No, I don't think so, Buster.

907
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,460
If I saw you walking down the schools, the halls of my school,

908
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,660
I would have been scared from my point of view.

909
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,460
I thought you were going to say you'd beat the shit out of me.

910
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,260
But hey, you don't want to mess with a dude with a death note shirt,

911
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,180
dude, who knows what the fuck he's going to do?

912
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,740
All right, well, that's that's about it for me.

913
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,660
Yeah, did we miss anything?

914
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,860
I mean, if we don't have anything else,

915
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,700
we can just kind of jump into questions right away

916
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,500
and just start doing other questions from Twitter.

917
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,900
I mean, that seems like a fair idea.

918
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,700
OK, wait, go on, before you do that,

919
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,020
I forgot to mention that at one point I wanted to die.

920
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,340
You wanted to die.

921
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,140
Well, that persists to this day.

922
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,020
So that would be past it.

923
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,940
Anyway, I wanted to be in 1880s, like Pilgrim farmer.

924
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,420
OK, did you?

925
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,500
I just thought that would pay itself.

926
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,660
That would pay for itself.

927
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,460
Well, yeah, being a farmer is kind of cool if you can sustain yourself.

928
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,700
You know, I do worry a little bit about if society collapses,

929
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,660
that I personally will definitely not be able to survive.

930
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,420
I don't have the skills to do so, you know, that's a bit of a worry to me.

931
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,140
So I will long for that.

932
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,020
Sorry, I imagine myself going up to gang members

933
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,380
and and smart talking them when they pull a gun on me.

934
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,140
But like, yeah, whatever, bro, you're going to shoot me.

935
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,100
I don't even believe in bullets, dude.

936
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,180
Just try it. Just try.

937
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,980
I just have fantasies of that because, like, if I die, then that's what I want.

938
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,060
But if I don't, then I'm the coolest guy in the world.

939
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,500
So you want to die.

940
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,020
But if you live, it'd be cool.

941
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,580
So yeah, OK.

942
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,900
So I just need to find some black people, I guess.

943
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,780
Oh, no.

944
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,260
Oh, believe me, I can arrange that.

945
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,140
I believe Trump is going to ship them all out to England soon.

946
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,020
So don't worry.

947
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,300
Yeah, there will be plenty.

948
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,380
Cool. Nice. OK.

949
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,500
Frosch is not going to allow that.

950
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,260
OK, let's go to the questions here.

951
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
Let's go to the polls.

952
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,780
OK, here's one that I thought was.

953
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,100
Yeah, let's go to the polls.

954
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,180
Pokemon. I've been with her.

955
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,060
I don't. Is this question

956
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,180
retired or not? You guys left to tell me by at Josh rushing.

957
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,940
If you could be an anime protagonist or antagonist,

958
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,420
which genre would you want your anime to be?

959
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,620
Josh, you blew it, buddy.

960
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,900
I would want it to be a romantic comedy.

961
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,020
And I would want to be.

962
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,580
The janitor,

963
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,220
who peeps on all the girls and doesn't get anything

964
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,780
and also gets beat up by somebody.

965
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,780
I would want to be in one like Undertale and or.

966
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,620
She's not an anime.

967
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,060
She's not an anime.

968
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,060
That's all right.

969
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,540
That's a good point, though.

970
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,420
That's not an anime, you idiot.

971
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,980
Oh, I wanted to be.

972
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,380
I wanted to be one, though, so I'm going to be a sort of better.

973
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,540
OK, I'll make an exception.

974
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,420
You get to be Undertale, my friend.

975
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,500
Sick, bro.

976
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,700
Tom, this is the origin story of the Undertale.

977
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,340
He wanted to be an anime,

978
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,540
but he chose Undertale, which really fucked it up.

979
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,740
But it somehow worked out he got immeasurable powers.

980
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,220
OK, Tom, what about you?

981
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,700
Well, I mean, I think like the natural first inclination to say

982
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,980
you want to be in an harem anime.

983
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,180
But that's what I was thinking.

984
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,060
That's what I was thinking.

985
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,740
Anime never get laid.

986
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Oh, no, no, no.

987
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,100
That's why you need to watch the best

988
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,060
harem anime of all time.

989
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,260
Anime, anime, anime, anime.

990
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,700
You got your fucking hand on your dick the whole time.

991
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,220
High school DxD is an anime where the guy,

992
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,620
I mean, I didn't finish it.

993
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,140
The guy has not fucked anyone yet.

994
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,500
I'm just saying.

995
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,340
What? Say that again?

996
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,740
DxD sounds a little gay.

997
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,660
I'm just saying.

998
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,820
No, that's true.

999
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,380
It does sound gay.

1000
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,620
And now you say it like that.

1001
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:52,140
But it's about this dude who's just got such lust for the puss.

1002
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,980
And he's just all about it.

1003
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,500
And the girls all get naked and they rub up on him all the time.

1004
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,180
And I haven't seen him have sex yet,

1005
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,820
but I think he's working towards it.

1006
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,860
I think there's real progression.

1007
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,900
That's why I just want to be in Vampire Hunter D. Clearly.

1008
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,940
We've already established the best that he's like fucking

1009
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,420
long-lived, super badass.

1010
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,140
Everybody wants to fuck him.

1011
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:09,900
Yes, that's true.

1012
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,260
And his hand is always there for him in more ways than one.

1013
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,500
You know what pisses me off, though,

1014
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,860
when there's a harem anime and the main guy just

1015
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,260
does not fuck all the sluts?

1016
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,580
Right.

1017
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,860
Like Tenchi, like Tenchi Muiya.

1018
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,460
What a fucking cuck bitch.

1019
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
I hate that guy.

1020
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,340
Agreed.

1021
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,380
Fucking.

1022
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,900
That's why you can't be a harem anime.

1023
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,700
Because for some reason, like you just,

1024
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,220
if you're the protag of a harem anime,

1025
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,060
you hate sex and you hate women.

1026
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,980
That's true.

1027
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,540
That's true.

1028
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,940
Which is something that I believe strongly.

1029
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,620
So I would resonate deeply with all the harem protagonists.

1030
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,340
OK, let's move on.

1031
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,420
Actually, I changed my mind.

1032
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,140
I changed my mind.

1033
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:48,220
I want to be a fucking, I want to be a porco rosso.

1034
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,140
I want to be the pig and be his.

1035
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,900
A pilot boy.

1036
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,660
Because I like flying planes and I like snorting.

1037
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,900
And also the girl's cute.

1038
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,260
I think he gets with the girl.

1039
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,900
I forget.

1040
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,780
Doesn't he get like character, like beast, like beauty

1041
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,340
and the beast rules or something at the end?

1042
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,740
Yeah.

1043
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,540
I think he does.

1044
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,980
I can't remember.

1045
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,180
But yeah, he's cool.

1046
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,420
He has a sad moment with the flying boys.

1047
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,660
He's a good boy, porco boy.

1048
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,340
Oh, I was going to say, I'd want to be in a sci-fi thing

1049
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,260
because I love sci-fi.

1050
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,260
And that's it.

1051
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:18,900
What?

1052
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,580
Stimple Bible.

1053
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,060
Yeah, yeah, that.

1054
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,500
And also a witch.

1055
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,300
OK, bye.

1056
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,820
Anui on me again.

1057
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,180
Hello there, Anui.

1058
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,660
What procrastinator is the best dancer?

1059
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,500
I got to go with Robo Gupta on that one.

1060
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,420
He's a well-known, you know, professional

1061
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:33,940
dancer.

1062
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,220
I mean, he has shoes specifically made for tactical dancing.

1063
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,380
That's exactly right.

1064
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,620
How could you beat that?

1065
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,780
I mean, maybe if I were to steal those shoes,

1066
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,060
I might be able to beat them out.

1067
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,660
But.

1068
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,300
Well, see, here's what you have to understand.

1069
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,020
He himself is already a professional great dancer,

1070
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,500
but those shoes make him 12 times better at dancing

1071
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,380
than the average robot.

1072
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,300
OK.

1073
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,180
Well, no one could compete with that.

1074
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,700
Yeah.

1075
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,900
Let's see here.

1076
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,460
Um, some of these are just very vague.

1077
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,740
Guys, that's specific questions.

1078
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,060
If you ask, like, what's your favorite movies?

1079
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,340
That's real vague.

1080
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,260
Actually, you know what?

1081
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,220
To be fair, those are better questions

1082
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,620
for, like, a topic of an entire discussion for this part.

1083
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,300
Favorites are not my favorite.

1084
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,780
I hate having favorites.

1085
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,380
My least favorite thing is to have a favorite of anything.

1086
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,220
It's dumb and gay and stupid and list-enabling.

1087
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,180
I hate lists.

1088
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,820
Fuck you, Digi.

1089
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,700
I feel the same way your life.

1090
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,860
And I laugh at you.

1091
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,660
Lol.

1092
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,740
You're sick, Vern.

1093
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,380
I do have one favorite, and that's

1094
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,740
my favorite method of murder, is what's challenge pissing.

1095
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,500
What's that?

1096
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,020
You try and piss six feet straight up in the air

1097
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,780
and not get wet.

1098
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,380
Through what means is execution caused,

1099
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,620
or is murdered, exercised in this method.

1100
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,780
Well, if you get pee in yourself, then you die.

1101
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,740
You have to kill yourself.

1102
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,340
OK, all right.

1103
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:02,940
That makes sense.

1104
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,460
I wouldn't want to be tainted like that.

1105
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,980
That's like, imagine pee roulette.

1106
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,380
Oh, no.

1107
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,900
Like, you got, like, six guys, each of which

1108
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,860
has a drink of various.

1109
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,220
May or may not have to pee.

1110
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,820
Yeah, exactly.

1111
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,660
OK, here's one.

1112
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,780
By Elton or aticekiller159, who's got that really cool

1113
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,620
escavelier Pokemon icon that I love.

1114
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,820
When eating cereals, do you pour the milk first

1115
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,380
or the cereal first?

1116
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,260
Cereal first.

1117
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,780
Always cereal first.

1118
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,620
Does anyone do milk?

1119
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,660
You have to be a fucking animal.

1120
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,340
If you do milk first, you're a common, you need to be shot.

1121
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:35,940
I suspect this.

1122
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,540
If you do milk first, it's objectively worse,

1123
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,500
because you don't know how much cereal meat.

1124
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,380
Like, you might put, like, too much cereal in,

1125
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,380
or not enough cereal.

1126
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,620
But the point is, you don't know how much cereal you want to eat.

1127
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,980
If you put in the milk first, the cereal

1128
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,980
floats on top of the milk.

1129
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,420
Like, every what I mean is what I mean is,

1130
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,460
everyone has a preferred amount of milk-soakage-image,

1131
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,700
right?

1132
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,460
Like, everybody likes maybe a bit more milk left over,

1133
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,660
maybe no milk left over, like me.

1134
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,900
And the amount of cereal you're willing to eat

1135
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,780
depends on how much milk you like

1136
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,860
and how much the milk you need to put in.

1137
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,340
True.

1138
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,460
So if you put the milk in first, you

1139
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,020
don't know how much you're going to have to eat.

1140
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,860
And if you have to eat too much, then it's too much.

1141
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,700
And you know, this guy at your very best bud,

1142
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,300
Declan Khan, immediately replied to that,

1143
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,460
what kind of a savage pours the milk first,

1144
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,860
the very image has physically shaken me.

1145
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,380
He's literally shaking, you guys.

1146
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,140
But I was going to say, you know, we all kind of

1147
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,780
do have experience with this horrible phenomenon.

1148
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,220
Because once you're eating your cereal,

1149
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,380
after you've eaten all the cereal, all that's left is milk,

1150
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,380
if you want to pour yourself a second bowl,

1151
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,660
you have no choice but to do it.

1152
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,860
And so we all know what a horrible experience it is.

1153
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,140
That milk goes everywhere.

1154
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,660
It's a nightmare.

1155
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,220
Nobody does that.

1156
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,740
I don't know.

1157
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,660
But if I have extra milk and I need more cereal,

1158
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,980
I will usually always put in more cereal

1159
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,460
and then add more milk to balance it out again.

1160
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,140
So, well, yeah, but you still have to add cereal on top of it.

1161
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,380
I don't actually have the splashing program.

1162
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,580
I guess everyone else is just really vigorous with this cereal.

1163
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,420
I just pour it in like a normal person.

1164
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,820
I put more effort into pouring my cereal than I do

1165
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,700
into being a decent human being, which is zero.

1166
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,300
OK, here we go.

1167
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,060
Here's maybe this will be our last question.

1168
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,300
I don't know.

1169
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,020
We'll see.

1170
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,060
And this one is just a light topic

1171
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,780
by Mr. Upload X XG Upload.

1172
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,100
Oh, TP Crasnators.

1173
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,940
What do you think of the current political climate?

1174
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,180
I've got I've got a few choice words for you, my friend.

1175
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,900
Pokemon, go to the polls.

1176
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,780
It's up to you, my friend.

1177
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,740
You decide.

1178
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,580
I think Trump's going to be an all right president.

1179
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,580
He'll probably not live up to everything that he said he would.

1180
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,540
But, you know, that's just politics for you.

1181
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,140
You're not in America.

1182
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,780
I think that I'm going to think he's going to be, you know,

1183
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,940
he's going to be a bit funny, but silly, but a crazy guy.

1184
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,180
But, you know, nothing's right.

1185
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,460
You are. You are so brits, blaming to me right now.

1186
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,540
This is very offensive.

1187
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,900
It's going to be pretty fucking shit and normal and normally shit

1188
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,340
and shittily normal for everyone.

1189
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,300
And it's the world's going to just slowly.

1190
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,420
No, no, what are you doing?

1191
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,940
You're scaring away our intense SJW audience

1192
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,380
who think that Trump is going to be a nightmare.

1193
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,220
I really hope Trump is actually going to blow everyone up

1194
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,260
because I don't want to die.

1195
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,740
Sam, sick, bro, sick.

1196
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,900
I think the current political climate can be summed up in one way.

1197
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,380
And that is shit is fucked up, but also not that bad.

1198
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,740
It's pretty good. All right, sick.

1199
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,700
I mean, you are a staunch SJW cuck.

1200
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,660
So I know that's true.

1201
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,340
The most blue-pilled person on the first of the earth,

1202
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,620
the most blue-pilled person on the face of the earth

1203
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,340
in the most red-pilled podcast on the face of the earth,

1204
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,700
the procrastinator podcast.

1205
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,260
It's a match made in heaven.

1206
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,460
I got a fucking clear pill, dude.

1207
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,220
Whoa, that's just iron-pilled, actually.

1208
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,020
Go on. Make sure you research all the,

1209
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,780
you make sure you research all the pills that you know.

1210
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,820
Because you put the image in the chat, but I was on mobile

1211
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,580
and I clicked it and I couldn't fucking see it

1212
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,020
because it didn't show it.

1213
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,860
Let's try to remember to post this intense pill image

1214
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,260
somewhere in the comments or something.

1215
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,580
I'll remember.

1216
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,260
Okay.

1217
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,820
God, we are floundering hardcore.

1218
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,700
I think we're all done.

1219
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,340
Anyone got anything else?

1220
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,140
I could, let me grab one more question.

1221
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:33,900
How about, God, these are all just so vague.

1222
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,780
When I was a little kid, I really liked the idea of being God.

1223
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,100
Interesting. Interesting.

1224
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,220
You know, and I did it.

1225
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,100
Hey, you know, I'm God.

1226
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,740
The guys who made Death Note are making a new manga.

1227
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,620
Oh, guys, it's called...

1228
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,460
Life Note.

1229
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,900
Nah, I forget the name of it.

1230
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,020
I'm gonna look it up while I'm talking about it.

1231
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,060
But they, oh, the premise behind it is that

1232
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,540
it's kind of the opposite of Death Note

1233
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,260
in that like a bunch of angels

1234
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,300
that are invisible to most people.

1235
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,540
Life Note.

1236
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,380
They come down and they visit fucking,

1237
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,540
just like how the Shinigami joined up

1238
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,700
with an individual person.

1239
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,820
Like the angels come down and they join another person.

1240
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,900
But now they're all in, it's a competition

1241
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,700
between, I don't know, there's like 30 of them

1242
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,700
who have done this now,

1243
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,460
and they all have to kill each other.

1244
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,460
Cause whoever is the winner at the end

1245
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,340
gets to become God, which is pretty fucking sick.

1246
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,820
Oh, it's called Platinum End.

1247
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,420
It's not Life Note, it's called Platinum End.

1248
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,260
It's called Platinum End.

1249
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,580
Is it the Japanese boat that you wanna be?

1250
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,700
What Kim?

1251
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,380
Is it like the whole, like the angels come down

1252
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,420
and they're all in Japan?

1253
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,860
Cause Japan is the only place that has God?

1254
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,260
Well, you know, it's the only non-godless place left

1255
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,860
in this corrupt world of ours.

1256
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,780
I don't know, the only characters we've seen

1257
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,860
have been like Japanese high schoolers and shit,

1258
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,820
but I only read like 10 chapters, so.

1259
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,260
Oh wait, no, there was like a serial killer.

1260
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,620
There was a serial killer who got one,

1261
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,540
who was a cute girl, who was, dude,

1262
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,380
that was pretty sick.

1263
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,580
Speaking of serial killers,

1264
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,020
don't you hate it when people say

1265
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,580
they put the milk in first?

1266
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,660
Yeah, I feel like becoming a serial killer

1267
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,820
against everyone who does that.

1268
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,660
Yeah, dude.

1269
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,540
Speaking of serial killers, hey guys, it's me, Munchie.

1270
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,380
Hey, Munchie's on serial, dude.

1271
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,780
I got you.

1272
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,620
By the way, I wanna stop this meme.

1273
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,300
We should bring Serial Experiments Lainan on this,

1274
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,740
in her opinion, you know.

1275
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,980
She's the expert, she's the expert.

1276
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,900
That's like my most popular tweets

1277
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,420
from last year. It's got like a thousand retweets

1278
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,500
or something.

1279
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,220
It's the best thing I ever did.

1280
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,660
You'll never top it.

1281
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,380
I wanted to stop this meme,

1282
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,700
that of people not pouring a lot of milk

1283
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,500
into their cereal, slurping up the milk

1284
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,420
after you eat the cereal is the best part of cereal.

1285
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,620
I pour a lot of milk myself.

1286
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,460
I'm a milk boy, I admit it.

1287
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,860
I admit it, I'm a milk boy.

1288
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,860
Good dude, you're gonna drink that fucking milk, bro, yeah.

1289
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,100
Okay, all right, we're done, that's it.

1290
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,940
Thanks for watching, everybody.

1291
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,020
No, you weren't gonna get a new question?

1292
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,580
I thought I did, oh fuck, no, I forgot.

1293
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,500
No, you didn't, you did. Right, one more, one more.

1294
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,100
Let's see here, how about...

1295
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,940
Dike.

1296
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,780
God, these questions are all shit.

1297
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,700
You guys need to step up your fucking game here.

1298
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
These questions are gay, and...

1299
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,660
Oh, okay, here it was.

1300
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,180
I remember seeing this one before.

1301
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,180
I thought it was a good meme.

1302
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,460
Okay, so bye, at John Attenbury.

1303
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,180
Clothes at the soup store.

1304
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,980
Procrastiners, if you could inhabit the body

1305
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,060
of another PCP member for a week,

1306
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,020
who would you choose?

1307
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,380
And my answer is obviously Mage,

1308
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,980
so I could masturbate and then just sleep

1309
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,820
for the rest of the time.

1310
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,060
That would be all I do.

1311
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,460
And I probably experienced female sex for a while,

1312
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,300
you know, I'm into that, I definitely wanna do that.

1313
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,140
Also, I could do that as much as...

1314
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,500
I would be Mage so I could masturbate all day

1315
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,940
and then sleep.

1316
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,940
Well, you know what, you know what,

1317
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,180
if you go into Mage, then I could become you,

1318
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,860
and then I would also be Mage.

1319
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,260
And then Munchie could be me,

1320
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,140
and then he could also be Mage through that.

1321
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:52,980
It would all work.

1322
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,980
Let's all be one guy.

1323
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,820
At the same time.

1324
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,380
No, and then Mage becomes Davoo,

1325
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,980
and then we're finally collective.

1326
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,340
Oh, no.

1327
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,380
That's how it happened.

1328
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,300
That's the origin story right there.

1329
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,860
I feel like there are a couple answers to this.

1330
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,860
I would want to either A, B, Davoo,

1331
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,260
so I can understand what the fuck is going up in there.

1332
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,260
Yeah.

1333
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,100
Going on.

1334
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,460
Number two, I would wanna be...

1335
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,820
No, that's it.

1336
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,420
I just wanna be Davoo.

1337
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,260
Yeah.

1338
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,100
Well, I would say...

1339
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,940
He's a mysterious man.

1340
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,780
I would say...

1341
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,620
I would wanna be Davoo,

1342
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,700
been real quick because I wanted to ruin his career,

1343
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,980
and then I would jump out.

1344
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:32,820
It's a good idea.

1345
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,380
Just delete his comics.

1346
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,700
Oh, no.

1347
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,540
Yeah, I would probably pick either Mage

1348
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,380
for the reason you said,

1349
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,980
just because it'd be interesting to be a girl,

1350
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,060
and I don't know what that's like.

1351
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,140
Or I'd be Digi,

1352
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,820
so I could PayPal all of his money to me,

1353
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,820
and then when I go back, I'll be rich.

1354
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,860
You know...

1355
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,700
I don't know.

1356
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,180
I don't like any of you.

1357
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,180
I don't wanna be anyone.

1358
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,020
I don't blame you.

1359
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,860
I don't blame you.

1360
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,380
That would be a really good answer to give.

1361
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,060
The most interesting person to be is me.

1362
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,860
Not me, me, but as in me.

1363
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,020
I would probably enjoy becoming Colt Corona

1364
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:08,860
for a little while,

1365
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,660
just so I could feel what it's like

1366
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,100
to be a good person once again.

1367
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,500
If we're opening up shit like that,

1368
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,860
then I would definitely wanna be the Undertaler of 5.8.

1369
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,340
What do you mean shit like what?

1370
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,660
Well, you know, characters.

1371
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,620
What do you mean characters?

1372
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:24,940
What are you talking about?

1373
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,380
Oh, this is awkward.

1374
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,220
This is awkward.

1375
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,140
I understand.

1376
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,580
Nate, Colt Corona.

1377
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,940
Colt Corona's gay.

1378
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,420
Oh, no!

1379
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,300
I thought he was a good person.

1380
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,300
It's ruins it.

1381
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,820
Oh, well, there we go.

1382
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,140
Forget that plan.

1383
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,940
Also, I like how you try to apply the Undertaler

1384
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,380
of 5.8.7. It isn't real.

1385
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,540
I would never apply that.

1386
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,380
He's me.

1387
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,220
He's me.

1388
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,820
I can feel him growing.

1389
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,300
He's with it all of us, really.

1390
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,660
Every Undertale fan.

1391
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,820
He's a collective tumor.

1392
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,740
Every Undertale fan has a little piece

1393
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,060
of the Undertaler 5.8.

1394
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,340
In fact, there are 587 pieces of the Undertaler

1395
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,340
scattered throughout the cosmos.

1396
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,260
We have to reunite them like the Dragon Balls

1397
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,740
to make the ultimate man.

1398
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,100
Oh, no.

1399
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:06,940
Oh, my God.

1400
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,340
A goal that hopefully will never be around.

1401
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,700
That's what happened after he was defeated

1402
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,540
in the Royal Rumble.

1403
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,060
He was shattered and scattered throughout the cosmos.

1404
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,540
All of his atoms broke off into different arches.

1405
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,340
He only has 587 atoms, yes.

1406
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,940
He's very, very small.

1407
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,460
He's very, very, very non-dense.

1408
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,060
What's the, what is it, a dense?

1409
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:26,900
I don't know.

1410
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,740
Non-dense.

1411
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,580
Non-dense?

1412
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,420
No.

1413
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,260
Vacuous?

1414
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,380
I don't know if there's even a word for that.

1415
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,220
Light?

1416
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,060
Gay.

1417
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:34,900
Okay, whatever.

1418
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,740
Sea-worthy.

1419
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,420
Boyant, yeah, buoyant.

1420
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,260
Sea-worthy.

1421
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,700
Things that aren't dense are buoyant, so there you go.

1422
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,220
Okay, enough questions here.

1423
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,580
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1424
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,420
We're done.

1425
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,420
All right, thanks for this, everybody.

1426
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,900
Hey, make sure you go to fucking at TP Crasnators.

1427
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,340
Yeah, first go to those polls.

1428
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,820
Then head over to Twitter and tweet us questions

1429
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,300
and topics and shit at TP Crasnators,

1430
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,660
and we'll fucking do them just like we did today.

1431
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,580
And we need more, so send them in, you little bitches.

1432
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,460
Okay, thanks for listening, everybody.

1433
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,780
Let's say goodbye.

1434
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,620
Bye.

1435
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,460
Bye.

1436
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,300
Bye.

1437
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,140
Bye.

1438
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:11,980
Yeah.

1439
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,820
Yeah.

1440
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,660
Yeah.
