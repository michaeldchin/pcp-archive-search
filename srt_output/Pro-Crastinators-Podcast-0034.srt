1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How do you like that?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Left out in the cold.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Everyone's man and murder face.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Everyone's speaking mean to me.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nobody gets re-residuals.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Dick individuals.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Fuck those six-wise fantasy.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm the fucking foundation of this five piece.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I lay down my soul. I lay down my heart.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But they try to tear me apart.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Nothing in this world is where the work is for.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If they don't come, maybe they'll show us what's important.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You better tear it up or they'll show us what's better.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I ain't breaking a sweat cause it don't really matter.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Nothing in this world shouldn't not be easy.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If it needs my comfort, tell them it won't make me queen.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you know what I ain't gonna do?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll give up room, I'll break up.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why is something so hard?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why can't everything be easy?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why can't it be easy, man?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Man, even singing the song is hard.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It gotta make everything hard.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I should hire someone to sing this song.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That would be easy.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then I'd have to tell them how to sing it.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then I'd have to pay them or I'd really get some money.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
See, everything leads into everything else in the bass.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's so hard, man.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's why people kill themselves.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello, everybody.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Welcome to the new PCP part one of this episode.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's right.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is just me and Hippo over here.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Say hi, Hippo.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi, Hippo.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Anyway, this is just us because it's only part one.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We decided to begin the recording and no one else wanted to show up.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We were like, you know, every goddamn week.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It is like an hour of waiting for people to show up.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sometimes I'm the one who takes an hour to show up.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But sometimes it's been, sometimes it's always someone.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's just so hard.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Getting the podcast to start is very difficult.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's an all day process sometimes.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, and that is the topic of this podcast.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Things being really hard and it's annoying and we hate it.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now, I guess I'll just come right out of the gate with saying,

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
come up with inventive solutions to your problems,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which is exactly what we've done here.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because me and Hippo, I guess we're just right in the mood to begin recording right now.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And we decided, hey, let's just talk about it ourselves.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then once we've set our piece, however long it takes to do so,

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
then we'll turn it off and just put our recording set aside.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Then other people can show up and record amongst themselves.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They can say their things.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then over the course of this PCP episode,

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
everyone can have said exactly what they wanted to say,

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but without a six way clusterfuck of chat client monstrosity.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That is really annoying to hear anyway.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I think this is a new format, a new exciting format

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that should really evolve the PCP into a new light direction.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, yeah.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The reason this whole thing has come to pass in this particular way is because

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
there's time zone kerfuffle that the podcast was supposed to start at 3 p.m.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Eastern Standard Time.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
According to Google, I typed in my time

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and it came up with, it was 7 p.m.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That was for me when we're, you know, 3 p.m.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So then time zones are annoying.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And then I said, okay, it's time to start.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And everyone's like, we got a whole hour to go.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We're not ready.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And so I just jumped in.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I didn't give a shit.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You know, I think in this day and age of the internet,

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
like retroactively, if you could make it to our time zones,

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it weren't a thing that would probably be a good idea.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Like, you know, there would just be certain parts of the world

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
where the times of which you get up and go to bed are completely different,

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but that would be like way more easy to adjust for, you know?

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like, instead of saying, like, talk into a guy from Britain

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and being like, having to have all this confusion about what time it is,

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you can simply have a funny conversation about how you go to bed at 2 p.m.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You wake up at 3 a.m.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's so funny.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But at least all of your appointments can be on time without any complications, you know?

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I mean, changing your watch when you land in a plane in a new country

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
isn't so bad because they usually tell you what time it is.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But like, doing stuff online across the globe,

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
especially at a time like this where I think the clocks are supposed to go back

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
an hour or forward an hour depending on where you live,

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
it's gay.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I hate time.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Time sucks.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, that is sort of many reasons why stuff is so hard.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You get into a fundamental issue.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Certainly things among human society is the different layers of civilization

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that have to be built on top of one another.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Like, all of technology that we have right now,

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
all the digital technology that we have,

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
has to be regulated through laws that were sometimes written 200 years ago,

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and things get really blurry in terms of the interpretation, don't you know?

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You know, you got like, computers themselves,

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
which were designed for DOS in the mid-80s,

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and they still are fundamentally the same.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not exactly sure about the technicals of this,

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but basically the way that computers are now is fundamentally the same

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that they were like 30 years ago,

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
like before the internet was even out,

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and so you're just building all this shit into these old systems.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's like physical tradition.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Right.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And like how, I know that your city of London and stuff

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is like laid out in a way that was originally designed for horses, right?

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, I mean, the whole of Britain has got like a lot of winding country roads

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and small alleyways and, you know, suburbs.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They're not like grids.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you ever go on Google Maps and you look around England,

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you see the suburbs are like winding roads and going up hills and down hills,

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and it's all because they branch off of main roads

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that horses use to travel between cities.

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Right.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It all starts from a way,

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and the difference with America is that they had the technology to plan it out

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
so that it can make it all efficient with grids and stuff.

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I remember you once saying that like when you were like seeing some footage

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
replaying Grand Theft Auto,

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you thought that the cities were laid out that way

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because it would be easier to design for a level,

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
but then you found out that it was just America.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, I had no idea.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then you got like modern ass cities like Dubai,

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
which are designed to be like 21st century from the ground up.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Be like, hey, let's make a really cool looking skyscraper out of nowhere.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's just build it.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Although, incidentally, Dubai has its own issues by being in the middle of the desert.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They don't have a central sewage system.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Every building in Dubai has a poop room,

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and a poop truck has to come and suck up the poop

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and then get up and then get the fuck out of that city,

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and sometimes they get backed up in traffic.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That sounds like one of the things,

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
one of the jokes my dad used to tell me,

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
or told me at one point in my childhood,

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and I just believed because I didn't know any better.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He said that when you flush the toilet,

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
it goes into a truck and a guy comes and scoops it out

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and then drives it into the sea.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was like, oh.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And then there was one time where the sewage actually got blocked

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and they had some guys around.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And I asked dad, is that the poop truck?

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then they laughed.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was like, that's not real.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I didn't know.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, my dad was like that too.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's another reason why stuff gets hard.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When your dads are fucking around with you,

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you have no idea when they're being serious.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I remember my dad would just make up things

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
that aren't real just to be funny.

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And it got to the point that I wouldn't believe him,

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
even when he's saying stuff that is legitimate.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Like, hey, David, you're like roller coaster tycoon.

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You should play zoo tycoon and mall tycoon.

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm like, I just thought he made those up.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't realize there were other tycoon games.

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I totally didn't believe him.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So that's why things get hard.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Dad's trying to be funny and just by lying.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think we should clarify what we're really talking about

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
when we're talking about hard.

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because things being hard is quite a vague, big topic.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Really what we're talking about is frustratingly complicated.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And stuff that just makes your blood boil in some way.

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I mean, maybe not blood boil.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
For me, it's always blood boil.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's frustration at the way things are

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and why can't they just be different.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Because we've thought of better ideas since...

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Here's the difference between all technology

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
for most of human history versus technology

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
since the advent of computers.

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Before computers, it's like having a piece of bread

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
with some butter and some brown sugar on top.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Very bland.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The age of computers is like being given a cinnamon roll

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
with caramel on top and chocolate and chocolate chips.

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But there's a guy constantly causing you to dodge the cinnamon roll.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Like you just want to have that cinnamon roll.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You get the fork.

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You plant the fork down.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You plant the fork down on the plate.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But then a dude grabs the plate

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and causes your fork to miss the cinnamon roll.

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So then you realign, you go for another stab

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
trying to get your fork in the cinnamon roll.

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And the dude just keeps moving the plate around.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then you try to get a little bit of it

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but then he grabs it off your fork.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then you try to put some cinnamon roll in your mouth

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and he grabs it out of your mouth.

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then if you do the wrong thing,

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
he'll flip the cinnamon roll on the freaking floor

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and you got to take it to a repair store to get it fixed

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
just so you can try and get another cinnamon roll.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's what the modern age is like.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are promised more incredible luxury

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and incredible inventions

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
than you've ever been able to conceive of before.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But the actual getting of it

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is just several orders of magnitude

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
more complicated and ridiculous

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
than anything we can comprehend.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
People have often feared the day

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
when computers could take over humanity

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but I think that they basically already have

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
because they are essentially their own organism.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They are a new branch of life

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
separate from humans and animals and fungi

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that have been created by humans

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
but are already out of our control.

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I remember when the Wi-Fi in my house didn't work one time,

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
a technician came over to fix it.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He didn't know what was happening.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He didn't know how to fix it

232
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
so a senior technician came over to fix it

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and he didn't know how to fix it.

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How is something that humans made

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
beyond the reach of humans to comprehend?

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That is the world that we are living in today.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hippo, what do you have to say?

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, I've got to say I like the cinnamon roll imagery.

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I wasn't really sure where you were going with that

240
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but now I understand that it's the complicatedness

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
of technology that's...

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You've got a 500 terabyte hard drive

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
in the palm of your hand

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
but you can't get anything on it.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can't plug it in.

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know how to explain it

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but you explained it pretty well.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's easier than it would have otherwise been

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
but it's still hard.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think that ties into people in first world countries

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
still being able to be depressed

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
even though they don't have it as hard as other people.

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's basically like that, you know?

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It doesn't matter how good your life is.

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Everything sucks.

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, something sucks.

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's like what James Rolfe says about DVDs.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He's like, you know, they are better than VHS

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but they're more bullshit-y than VHS.

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They do a better job but they have way more problems.

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And that's what all of technology is basically like.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Whoa, the hell's going on with your mic?

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It sounds like bubbling.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like a fan is slapping something really fast.

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Am I still doing that?

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's like a really slow B

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and it's caught in a plastic tube.

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Is it still happening?

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, it's gone.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was seeing it on the wave form of my audacity.

273
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't wait to...

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think that might just be a loose connection

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
on your mic or something.

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
See how hard things are?

277
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He has no idea what's wrong.

278
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's so easy to relate this to everything that happens in life.

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I feel like also on a fundamental level

280
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
things are hard because of the basic logic of entropy.

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Minute physics is having this series of videos

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
produced by some entropy specialist guy

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and he's explaining the laws of entropy

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and how they control all of the universe

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and how the universe started off as one condensed ball of energy

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and eventually become a bunch of nothingness.

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And the only reason that life and even time can occur

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is because of all the conflict and shlubla-boobling

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that happens in between.

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The process from getting to pure energy to pure nothingness

291
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that is where stuff comes from, you know?

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's from the conflict of things happening

293
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that stuff could even happen in the first place.

294
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And that is why things are hard

295
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because of entropy.

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Were you actually...

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Was that actually a point?

298
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because I didn't get it.

299
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know, it's up for you to decide.

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, okay.

301
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's hard for me to comprehend that's what it is.

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You know, it's kind of weird.

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The reason I jumped on this podcast so quickly

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
is because I was actually in a really good feeling productive mood

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
so maybe I'm not in the best state of mind

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
to talk about things being hard.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know, but yeah.

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Really, we could jump into the part two of this podcast

309
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
where naturally everyone's here.

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And this could be like the intro.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, the intro.

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The really long weird intro.

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I want to talk directly to you, Hippo.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What are some things in your life that are hard?

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I mean, you're trying to start YouTube videos

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and getting those popular and you're not making

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that much progress very quickly.

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's stupid and gay and that's what YouTube is like.

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Talk about that some.

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay, well, it's hard to get momentum, I suppose.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I mean, even Jon Tron probably wouldn't have gotten

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
as big as he did if he didn't blow up on Reddit

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and then went to Game Grumps.

324
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You know, even someone as funny as that

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
had to get a big boost out of nowhere.

326
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And I don't think I'm going to get to that size

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
unless I latch onto one of those big guys

328
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
or get blown up on Reddit

329
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
or something big happens.

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Like, I get a really good video.

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But for now, all I can do is just keep going

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and, you know, it's fun.

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I make enough Patreon to pay rent, so I'm not too worried.

334
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You do? Whoa, that's cool.

335
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, it's because I live with my parents at the moment

336
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and they're very nice, so the rent's very reasonable.

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's pretty cool.

338
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, like, toward the end of me

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
trying to make my own channel my full-time thing,

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
you know, bounce between whether or not it should be

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
or whether or not I should do the Digibro editing.

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Like, the last plan I had in mind

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and, like, I was like, if this plan doesn't work at all

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
then I give up is I'm just going to, like,

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
make videos collaboratively with other channels

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
that are big.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Like, I'll literally just message other channels

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that are slightly bigger than me

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
or at least have more fans than me, you know,

350
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and be like, hey, I would like to just straight up

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
make an entire video and it goes up on your channel.

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Like, I just do the whole thing from start to finish.

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I figure a lot of channels would be okay

354
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
with that having a free video on their channel

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that they get to make ad revenue off of

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
but then it gives exposure.txt for me.

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know, that was all I could think of at that point.

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So you just actually go for the whole exposure thing.

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, because I didn't know what else to do.

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It was getting hard, man.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, well, I liked your videos.

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I still kind of wish you were still doing your own stuff.

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

364
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The Prince of Persia one was, like,

365
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think the last one I remember watching.

366
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want to see more of those game things.

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Me too.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, another thing being hard,

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
having more things to do in your life

371
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
than you have life for.

372
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, that's another issue.

373
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I think we all know that sort of feeling of...

374
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

375
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There's not enough time in a day to get multiple things done.

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You have to just stick with one,

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
otherwise you'll get nothing.

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Right.

379
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You'll get nothing done.

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
One thing I have very specific trouble with is writing.

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I spend, like, a month or two months writing a script,

382
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
two days editing, two days recording all the audio.

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, recording audio.

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And then one week or maybe less than a week to edit it.

385
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Probably a month to edit it, actually.

386
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But the writing takes a demonstrably large amount of time

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
compared to someone like Digi, who just thinks of it,

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
writes it down, and then that's it.

389
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

390
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's too quick for me.

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't think he goes quite as fast as he sometimes indicates

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that he does, or at least lately.

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think he maybe puts more polishing time into stuff,

394
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
or maybe he...

395
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think it's more like he stews on it,

396
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
writes a paragraph, stews or something.

397
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know.

398
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I actually have not watched him writing,

399
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
but I think that's what it's like.

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Anyway.

401
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You should put a secret camera in his room.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, man.

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Make that...

406
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Put that on Davoo.

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It goes to Saturn.

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Make that a...

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Make that a Patreon reward here.

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's access to the 24-7 DigiCam.

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So, uh, Mages here now.

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Say hi.

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hi.

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay, cool.

415
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So, we were talking about why things are so hard,

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and we were specifically talking about the production

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
of video making, how Hippo in particular,

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you seem to have a huge problem with writing.

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like, it's just kind of hard to do.

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know what it is.

422
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think it's just...

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I like working in a straight line,

424
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
like chronologically.

425
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I go through the thing.

426
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't like skipping a part

427
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that I'm having trouble with

428
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and coming back to it later.

429
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't do that either, really.

430
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's like, if I can't think of a good way

431
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to flow from this paragraph to that point

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
in a way that's either funny or interesting or good,

433
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
then I get stuck on it for hours,

434
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and I tab over to anything else

435
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to distract myself from the fact

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
that I can't figure out what I'm doing.

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And that just goes on for weeks and months,

438
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and I hate it.

439
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And you say you've spent like two days

440
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
doing the voiceover as well?

441
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well, yeah, I mean, I did the Rayman

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm working on at the moment,

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and I finally finished that script,

444
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and then in one day afterwards,

445
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I recorded the whole thing.

446
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Brilliant.

447
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I've still got to do the live-action stuff,

448
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
but I sat down and I just...

449
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I spoke...

450
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It was actually the best voiceover recording session

451
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I've ever had, so that was good.

452
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Not really, you know?

453
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I only just, like, now got comfortable

454
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
with reading scripts,

455
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
like, almost comfortable, at least.

456
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I still have not really had an occasion

457
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
where I have a whole thing,

458
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and I record it, and it comes out ideally

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
on the first try,

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but I'm at least now able to, like,

461
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
read something short on the third attempt,

462
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and it comes out well,

463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and I don't feel too stressed out about it, you know?

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't know how many people have watched

465
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
a lot of my older, like, 2014 videos

466
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
where my voice sounds way different

467
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and sounds like I'm choking on a big, fat dick,

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and it was the most annoying thing ever.

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It was stressing the fuck out of me.

470
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean, I had my braces removed,

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
like, five or six videos into my full-time YouTubing,

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
so that, like, screwed up my ability

473
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to speak clearly in a comfortable manner,

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
trying to strike a balance between

475
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
sounding comfortable and sounding...

476
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
like, sounding natural and, like,

477
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
annunciating all of your syllables

478
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
is a dichotomy that you sometimes have to, like,

479
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
teeter on and make sacrifices and trade-offs in.

480
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And, uh, gosh, yeah,

481
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I feel like most people either start off terrible

482
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and never improve that much with voiceover

483
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
or start off pretty good and get a lot better.

484
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I feel like there's only some people

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
with an excessive amount of determination

486
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
who start off bad, like me,

487
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and then get pretty good, as I would now say I am.

488
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, uh...

489
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I do like your voice in your...

490
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
in the way you explain things, especially the annunciation,

491
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
like, making the syllables deliberate.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's different from just chatting with somebody,

493
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
because even across the room, they can tell what you're saying,

494
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but a microphone has bad hearing.

495
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It needs a lot of...

496
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you need to be right up close to it

497
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and to make sure you say everything correctly.

498
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Otherwise, it won't know what to tell a computer.

499
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, and you have to make sure you don't make weird noises.

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like, with the clicking of the tongue,

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
sometimes some people find it really annoying and gross.

503
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah, so...

504
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What do you mean?

505
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, not that sort of thing, but it's just like...

506
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can't even describe it, but some people see that.

507
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's the little lip smack when you open your mouth

508
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
after a period of time.

509
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, it's also weird and gross.

510
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't like it.

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I try to cut out those out from my audio,

512
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
which makes audio editing a lot more annoying for me,

513
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
because I usually do that, so I have to...

514
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Especially since my voice is so quiet,

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
you can't really mask it with background music,

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
because the whole volume level of everything

517
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
is kind of small, so if I make it louder,

518
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
you can hear the lip smacks even more,

519
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
so I have to cut them out.

520
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, and I have to also cut out by my inhales and exhales.

521
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Apparently, they're quite loud.

522
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No one knows, though, because I edit them out.

523
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's really annoying, because I breathe all the time,

524
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
so that's a lot of editing.

525
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Whoa!

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Who knew?

527
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Specifically, people with small voices

528
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
at audio editing is really hard,

529
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because if you're loud,

530
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
if you're like Nate, you can go,

531
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
whaa!

532
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then when you look at noise removal

533
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and making it sound good,

534
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you really don't need to do much,

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
because if you've got a voice like mine,

536
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
even when I'm trying really hard to make it sound loud,

537
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
there's a lot of noise that gets picked up in the background

538
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
because the microphone's gain is turned up

539
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
so that they can hear me,

540
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so there's extra problems

541
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
if you're not shouting all the time.

542
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I feel you.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Smee and Gib, Small Voice Club.

544
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah.

545
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, I'm just in too positive of a mood

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to go on for very long about things being hard.

547
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know, I'm just not really into it at the moment.

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Are you thinking it's quite hard

549
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to think of things to talk about in this podcast?

550
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I mean, talking specifically about video-making

551
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
or just things that you're trying to...

552
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We were talking about anything.

553
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Anything.

554
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So if there's things that make life hard,

555
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
what are you doing in your life, Mage?

556
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, I want to make...

557
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've been working on a comic sort of

558
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
kind of like on six or seven pages now

559
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and just everything.

560
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Everything about making a comic is hard.

561
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I thought it could do it, I thought...

562
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey, you know, some people start off...

563
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,600
crappy and the improver over time because they draw the comic and stuff and I thought you know I

564
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,480
could do it I'm slightly better than some people when they started off so I kind of have a little

565
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,680
you know um you know just a advantage of it and so I started making the comic and then just I just

566
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:49,160
realized I don't know how to lay out the panels I don't know where to place the speech bubbles

567
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:57,080
writing dialogue is hell and I just can't draw certain angles or like proportions are off like

568
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,760
most people see my finished art but they never see the art I scrap and I scrap so much art

569
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,360
because I just can't get the proportions right and it's ugly and it's gross and it's pissing me off

570
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:17,240
and I just hate my life I hate everything I quit goodbye well before you go would you say the

571
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,600
like the drawing stuff are coming up with like panels and and things would you say that's like

572
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,200
it's hard because you're already decently good at drawing so like learning something like it's

573
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,240
making comics is a whole different style of of drawing and since you're so good you have like

574
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,880
high standards for your finished works it's weird to just like settle for anything that isn't perfect

575
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,760
um kind of I guess I mean the whole topic on learning something new is a whole different

576
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:58,760
issue but the panels um I guess yeah when I put my art into panels or you know into comic form I

577
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,360
see it and I kind of feel like I could have done better this doesn't look like it as good as it

578
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,960
should have been oh backgrounds that reminds me I I had like a few month hiatus on one page

579
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,920
because I couldn't do a simple background for it and and then I came back and one day I was like

580
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,280
you know what I'm gonna do it and then I did it and kind of look crap but it better than it was

581
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:30,920
before and I was like and I'm gonna settle with this no one's perfect yeah it's I I particularly

582
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,320
have trouble like I've tried to draw comics I've tried to do everything everyone else has done

583
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,720
because I like I'm very competitive so you know with Tom and Ben being comic guys I tried drawing

584
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,480
a comic and I didn't like it so it was just because it was it was too hard to to instantly be great at

585
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,200
it it was too you know I knew I would have had to like work at it for ages I've been doing Inktober

586
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,760
as well and it was too hard to keep up with that because each drawing I was like okay I've got to

587
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:07,320
try and make it better than the last one more more properly drawn more clean and stuff and then as

588
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,320
the days went on it became harder and harder to to work that hard on a single drawing for a day

589
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,600
and also do anything else and so I just stopped doing it but really it is because I was making

590
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,640
it too hard on myself like I didn't need to put that much effort into the Inktober's I could have

591
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:32,840
just done funny little scribbles it's hard it's hard to settle for less that's what I'm thinking

592
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:41,560
um in drawing comics I stumble at drawing the same thing more than once that's when everything

593
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:48,600
falls apart oh this thing I drew I have to draw it again this time in a slightly different position

594
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:56,600
I feel you that's the end that you know just can't do it anymore yeah what's worse for me is I never

595
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,280
get like the face is similar or the eye shape or or something because every single time I draw the same

596
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,280
character I give them like different eyes or different nose or something like that and it's

597
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,880
just yeah it's so bothersome give hurt dot JP JP egg it's a credit those character designs are very

598
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,560
consistent the what hey you know you were talking about voice acting I was talking about voice acting

599
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,440
you know the thing about voice acting and uh getting frustrated and it that makes it really

600
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,920
annoying is that all of your emotions come out through your voicing whether or not you want

601
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,680
them to and that's why it's such a temperamental thing when I have to read a script and like you

602
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,600
know a lot of people they write scripts that are basically like hey everyone here's this thing it

603
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,120
came out in 1992.5 and you know that you can read in any sort of emotion that you want but when you

604
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,840
want to say something meaningful or something or something like deep or something that's supposed

605
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,160
to sound like it comes from some sort of personification of you you got to get the acting

606
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,400
just right and acting and reading a script can just really mess around with me because it like

607
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,760
the first time I'm going through I haven't like quite gotten down the flow of the thing yeah like

608
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,680
I would have would have written down like a like a paragraph and then I read the whole thing out

609
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,360
loud and I'm like wait a minute I didn't put any of the emphasis on the right words and it

610
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,000
I gotta do it again then when you go through it the second time I'm kind of getting a little

611
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,080
bit annoyed at myself I'm getting kind of tired of the script and so I'm getting a little bit

612
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:30,440
agitated and the agitation ruins everything so it's like it's almost like there's a limited

613
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,920
number of attempts you can do on a script before it's like worn out it's like removing and reapplying

614
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,720
tape onto a piece of paper you can know if you do it too many times you could never do it again

615
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,600
so you better get it right the first couple of times that's how it is for me or at least that's

616
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:54,200
how it was for me still kind of is it takes an unbelievable amount of very intense concentration

617
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:01,480
to have your have your mind be into the right lucid state of emotion to be able to pull off such a

618
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:10,200
feat yeah I know that oh you go now you go ahead okay well I was gonna say um I have that similar

619
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,960
sort of trouble but it's it's more like I forget to to act I forget to have emotion in my script

620
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,120
like I'm just reading it like and then blah blah and then you know I was like oh wait I should have

621
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,840
done a silly voice for that because that was a like it was a moment so I got to do it again with

622
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,560
silly voice and sometimes the silly voice seems forced and like that is dumb this is a bad this

623
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:37,880
is a bad joke it doesn't work I'm not I can't create the right funny sound for this word

624
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,840
particular word like sometimes I can create a funny sound just on its own but I'm trying to say

625
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,240
a word at the same time sometimes it just doesn't doesn't flow right so I have to cut that whole

626
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,280
paragraph out of the thing it is indeed very dependent on the entire writing style of what

627
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,480
you're trying to read yeah you guys like do proper videos and stuff me I struggled with

628
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,880
just like the basic videos I did a q&a and all I had to do I didn't have to do any sort of funny

629
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,600
voices or anything all I had to do was like sound interested in what I'm talking about and the

630
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,920
thing is like I have trouble pronouncing certain things and I had to redo my q&a like the recording

631
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:25,800
so many times that the end result just kind of I sounded dead just so uninterested so dead in

632
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,200
everything I said but by that time I was just so tired rereading the same things over and over again

633
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,760
and I just wanted that video to finally come out because it's been delayed for like such a long time

634
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,760
and I just I settled I'm not happy with it but I settled

635
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,320
the one thing about like recording audio for a video that I really hate is that you feel like

636
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,360
you got to do it all in one go like in one day like because the microphone is going to be set

637
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,920
up a certain way that day you're going to be sitting in a certain position that day recording it

638
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,520
you don't want to have to you don't want to have to stop and like you know even just take a break

639
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,600
because you're you're going to come back you're going to have either more air in your lungs or

640
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,680
something and it's going to sound weird or different and I don't like it I I guess it's not too bad if

641
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,200
you're like more energetic the second time but I like I like it when I can get most of it correct

642
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,640
in within a few hours and yeah same it's it's really good when that happens I was I was dancing

643
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,040
I was jumping around after after I recorded the Rayman thing because I did a whole bit where

644
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:39,240
I go more insane and more like more broken as that as it goes along and by the end I was doing a full

645
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:47,640
blown broken matte impression and it was really good oh my gosh yeah that's a secret spoiler I guess

646
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:57,320
I could cut that out but you know whatever PCP fans deserve to know spoilers spoilers uh well

647
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,600
you know this has been about 30 minutes it's about as long as I was expecting part one of the

648
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,560
PCP would be so anything else you too I came in at the very tail and I thought it was going to start

649
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,800
like right now at the moment at the round hour at like three well if you have more to say we can

650
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,840
keep going for a bit nah I complained enough for the day mage could be the one who can appear in

651
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,280
both parts yeah so what we're doing is that it's just me and hippo and then the other guys are

652
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,960
gonna show up they're gonna do their part they don't even realize what we're doing they don't

653
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,040
even realize that we're recording this whole first part it's too hard for them to read that we

654
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:40,200
we said we were gonna do yes I said we were gonna do it or I proposed it and uh no one read it so

655
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,080
we just did it without them uh so what you could do is you could appear in both parts and just say

656
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,320
the same stuff twice and they won't even know yes you should definitely do that now all right

657
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,840
everyone uh we're gonna move on to part two just imagine a kc nice that is flipping the

658
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,600
camera around and we transition into the next part goodbye bye hello everyone and welcome to

659
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:09,480
part two of this week's episode of the procrastinator's podcast we by the way have no idea what the

660
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,880
other guys talked about so judge us with mercy if we are redundant or talk about the same

661
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,040
shit because they didn't tell us and we don't want to know we didn't care to ask what happened in

662
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:32,280
part one anyway it's me the best guy ever uh we got uh did you bro hey endless jizz yep lethal mage

663
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:43,400
man greetings and tom oliver i am here hooray yes celebration all around and mage is our undercover

664
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:51,720
agent for what they talked about in the first part if that is relevant that's true they didn't

665
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,720
know that you were gonna you were gonna tell all it was gonna be an expose anyway so again

666
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,640
thing is uh for some reason the topic is uh why is everything so fucking hard and why can't everything

667
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:13,640
be easy uh and i'll tell you preach it yeah what say that again preach it i said i said hallelujah

668
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:22,520
okay jesus yeah oh baby jesus everything's too hard it's very true i was watching um uh

669
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,040
metalocalypse recently i've gotten really big into metalocalypse over the last week again and i

670
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:34,440
happened to see this part where maybe the best character william murder face murder face murder

671
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:42,680
face uh is walking along and he's he's just real upset because he wants everything in life to be

672
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,800
easy and he sings this amazing song about how everything in life deserves to be handed to him

673
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:54,600
on a silver platter and anything that takes effort isn't worth doing and i uh agree he is my role

674
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,440
model in that aspect he really makes a strong case for it where you're like yeah yeah why isn't

675
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,320

684
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,160
labors of hercules just to get on this podcast and entertain you freaks believe me i completely

685
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,800
empathize with how much work you guys all put into letting me edit this podcast every week

686
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,160
it's it's tough man you don't understand the effort it takes to have faith that you won't

687
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:20,440
fuck it up it's a big it's a big hurdle you know fucking talk about effort i'm at work

688
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,480
right now hiding in the corner so the fucking camera can't see me dicking around in the middle

689
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,120
of my rounds at work to record this part why do you think i'm never fucking here because i have to

690
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,960
yeah he's just at work god damn why is work so hard why do i have to slave but why is my life

691
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,360
a burden upon myself well i didn't choose to be born and yet here i am yeah we're going off the

692
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,680
deep end right that's that's true uh you know we we didn't ask for any of the struggles in life

693
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,800
that our parents forced upon us by selfishly producing us and here we are having to pay the

694
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,560
piper every fucking day having to punch that clock only to die one day and making it all completely

695
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,720
pointless why are we here only to suffer it's true i agree sometimes let's let's all just kill

696
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:13,000
ourselves right now and that's that's pretty easy this is really dark and i like it but even

697
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,520
killing yourself is fucking hard it'd be oh it's so hard not worth doing it's it's just like in that

698
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,000
episode of paranoia agent where those three suicidal dudes which is like the best episode of that show

699
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,480
or any show by the way where they just get together and try to kill themselves but it's such a fucking

700
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:35,080
chore man it's it's rough isn't it heavily implied that they are already at the end they do seem to

701
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,680
be ghosts but it's unclear when or if that happened you know it's it's mysterious which i like

702
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,760
yeah everyone should watch it anyway it's great you should at least that episode well i don't know

703
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,360
the little slugger's cool i don't i don't think spoiling that episode takes anything away from it

704
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,440
well that's a whole other argument spoiled something that's ambiguous anyways you you would

705
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,680
have to sit on it and come that's a good point just to know what i haven't seen the last three

706
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,600
episodes been procrastinating on that so don't spoil you've been procrastinating for for 10 years

707
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,280
how is that show now it shows for like 2004 i didn't know it existed up until like last year

708
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,840
and then you've been procrastinating for a year yes tisk tisk that's still pretty long well whatever

709
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:29,880
i i i haven't finished uh that's that's right that's right i uh whatever there's tons of stuff

710
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,760
i also haven't finished they started bakimono gatsuri being one of them that i've watched episode

711
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,920
like one through three for like like eight times like fucking eight times that i've never gotten

712
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,520
passed at uh because it's too fucking hard to make time to watch it oh my god watching

713
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,120
shit is the worst fucking burden there's so it never ends the the pile of the mountain of

714
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,240
stuff that you need to fucking consume and get inside your brain you can't ever chip away at it

715
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,840
they keep making new stuff faster than any man could possibly watch all the curse of the internet

716
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,640
could be able to become acutely aware of how much shit you're never going to be able to understand

717
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,240
about our job they think that we just make stuff now this is this is like two full-time jobs because

718
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,280
half my job is making stuff the other half is consuming stuff it's two jobs that should be full

719
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,480
time and i'm trying to bounce them out it's impossible by long and far the hardest thing

720
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,480
about my job is watching anime because like yeah like that sounds insane it sounds like

721
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,680
people will think that you're like that sounds retarded but it's totally true right well because

722
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,360
i don't know until i watch a show if i'm gonna have something to say about it right so like for me

723
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:46,200
like the most grueling part of my job is deciding which show i'm gonna watch because i'm so afraid

724
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,760
to watch something you know for four hours and then find out that i didn't have enough to say

725
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,040
about it to make a video and then that's just four hours i mean i can somewhat justify it and like

726
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,840
okay well at least i've expanded my knowledge of anime in some way you know at least this contributes

727
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:06,920
to my overall ability to to pull from different places to to have ideas but and your your life

728
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,240
goal of watching all anime right that's still on the table right i don't know if i want to watch all

729
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,520
like book i'm glad you changed when i was like 10 years old and i first discovered the anime and

730
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,560
i was like i'm gonna watch all the anime in the entire world i definitely and by the little

731
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,840
did you sample every anime in the entire world like every every single night when i like when i

732
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,560
get off sony vegas for the night finally and i and i get down on my couch and i start thinking

733
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,800
okay i should watch something well let's see what what's this what's this black mirror show on

734
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,520
netflix no wait there's this other show on sci-fi about the channel zero show no wait there's probably

735
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,920
a new south park out no way isn't there like haven't i missed like 10 my little pony episodes

736
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,560
no wait i should have watched this entire fucking series over here there's five anime i just for

737
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,360
the weebcast i had to watch like 40 fucking shows and and the thing about it is with anime with the

738
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,000
yeah it's understandable with with anime specifically i like i've gotten into star trek recently in a

739
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,680
big way and the great thing about star trek is this people just talking and you really don't

740
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,040
need to pay that much attention when you got a show in gook you gotta read the fucking subtitles

741
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,000
you gotta watch the animation because it involves you cannot do anything else while you're watching

742
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,080
anime and that's it's such a fucking pain in the ass strenuous thing and you know what you want to

743
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,160
just learn japanese but that's fucking hard to exactly so hard god learning japanese if there's

744
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,920
one thing that i have the biggest chip on my shoulder about how hard it is it's learning japanese

745
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,600
because the spoken dialect is easy as shit they have an alphabet that's easy as shit

746
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:49,560
but then they have the kanji and it's just thousands and thousands of meaningless fucking symbols

747
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,640
that not only not only do they all look exactly the same but they all have a specific order that

748
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,400
they have to be drawn in true i know yeah i took chinese and it's the same written thing and it's

749
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,560
bullshit the fact that you have to draw it in the right order or it's wrong and it's oh my god it's

750
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,520
fucking stupid and you know what sucks is that your brain hates you because every year you put off

751
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,000
learning japanese your brain becomes more set in his ways it becomes harder to learn another language

752
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,920
i know it's just like you know it's the worst learning any language is fucking unbearably

753
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,280
impossible like i took french in high school i don't remember any of it i took spanish in college

754
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,720
i don't remember any of it you know i'm watching the anime is i'm trying to i'm i'm trying to

755
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,840
understand the language sometimes i feel like i'm understanding the language every once in a while

756
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,120
i'll pick out like a like a like a kudasai or some word that i understand that i'm like yes

757
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,840
yes i got it i can i can watch this whole anime now without reading the subtitles but it's all for

758
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,360
not because it never stays it's important like learning anything and i fucking hate myself

759
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,840
the saddest part for me is that i like for years i've had this dream that one day i'll learn how to

760
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,640
read japanese well enough that i'll be able to get into manga because so much manga doesn't get

761
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,800
translated most of the the really good stuff the stuff that i really want to read isn't getting

762
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,240
translated but on some level i'm sounds like a grass is always greener so yeah oh they're only

763
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,160
translating the bad stuff i'm glad that i can't read japanese because if i could then that would

764
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:26,760
just be thousands of manga i now have to read you know now i have a whole new world of shit i have to

765
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,080
do you know well you know i mean uh i don't know if this is true but in like shown and jump

766
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,520
everything is hiragana uh in a dude where there's there's a lot yeah is it seriously i had no idea

767
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,200
yeah well yeah for whatever all children's manga have little furigana over the over the

768
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,800
bleach isn't for children don't say that yeah but uh but yeah i mean it makes it easier to to learn

769
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,400
to like you can it's an easy way to learn kanji by doing that but i one time tried i opened up a

770
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,520
volume of inuyasha because i like i was on this uh it was like how to learn japanese through manga

771
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,200
like a thing and there was all these different manga and inuyasha was there and i was like oh i

772
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,320
know inuyasha so i opened up page one and i quickly realized that i just straight up didn't know any of

773
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:13,000
the words so that was no help oh that's the thing the i mean like jesse was saying before uh if you

774
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
watch a lot of anime you can learn a bunch of phrase i remember distinctly i learned the word

775
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,280
daijobu before i studied japanese and i was like it's because uh it's because the fourth opening

776
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:28,200
of one piece kokoro cheese starts with daijobu and it's okay and as the subtitles i get this word

777
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,000
now but uh when it comes to like constructing sentences or being able to you know reverse

778
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,040
engineer them which is what you're doing in your brain when you're translating from another language

779
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,440
to english it's impossible if you don't sit down and say that shit have you ever the scene in a movie

780
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,160
that i always bought you ever watched the 13th warrior no it's a movie with antonio benders it's

781
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,160
about like he's like an arab guy i don't know why he's an arab guy but he's an arab guy and he has to

782
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,440
like hang out with all these nordic people and there's a scene where he's like sitting around

783
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,080
at the campfire over the course of like a couple weeks and he just learns nordic just by listening

784
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:03,080
to them and i'm like that's such bullshit no one can fucking do that to this day that pisses me off

785
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,600
i mean for what it's worth i am perfectly capable of watching like a children's anime and

786
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,760
understanding all of it like i don't think the language is hard it's just the it's just reading

787
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,200
it that's impossible and in particularly in inuyasha's case because the scenes take place in ancient

788
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,680
japan there's a lot of ancient dialect which is why i could not understand what i was looking at in

789
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,960
that particular case mage can you tell me about that because i i still i don't believe anyone i think

790
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,080
you're lying i think there's a conspiracy to make me feel stupid so please explain how you learned

791
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:41,240
english from cartoons okay when i was little like four years old or something i kind of broke the

792
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,520
video tape player thingy by thinking it needs food so i fed it stuff

793
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:56,840
so my parents got cable it was cartoon network holy shit yeah they got the cartoon network

794
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,360
so i watched cartoon network and everything was in english haza and me a four year old was entertained

795
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,240
by moving pictures and i didn't care that didn't understand the language but over time i started

796
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:14,680
picking up stuff here and there and by seven or eight i could speak english fine enough for what

797
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,680
it's worth when you're like four that's like the stage where you're learning language either way

798
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:27,880
like i mean arguably we all learned english from watching cartoons and you know in our parents and

799
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,440
you know language and then having a world just proof that we get dumber as we get older because

800
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,920
if you can learn it like i've been watching anime for like 15 years and i still haven't learned any

801
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:44,440
japanese ever in like four words i i also started learning german from tv again just at a later time

802
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,040
at around 12 years old or so um i discovered that i have a german channel and there was anime that's

803
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,560
the first time i discovered anime was at eight years old never mind anywho either way um so i

804
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:02,600
started learning uh german and everything was fine until they canceled the uh or at least we didn't

805
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,760
get the channel anymore we weren't supposed to get the channel in the first place apparently

806
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:14,760
but still so i took german in school and the german classes didn't teach me quite as much as tv

807
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,040
taught me and it's just because like it kind of feels like when you're hearing it it's kind of like

808
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,080
you're hearing it in practice like you hear how it's spoken how it's used in uh conversations it's

809
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:31,720
never you cannot substitute that with uh learning from books and stuff and i had such a difference

810
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:42,200
with like um students who in my class who learned english just from books had like such a thick accent

811
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:48,360
and they couldn't grasp such subtleties and weird stuff that's going on with english like let's say

812
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,240
the word knife it starts with k they can't they don't have the intuition to know that the case

813
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,200
and i did and yeah so i was kind of a prodigy up until like the very last years of school where

814
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:06,680
i became at the top of the class but not the best uh so yeah this is supposed to be a complaining

815
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,440
about things being too hard yes this is bragging why would a genius i am so much smarter than americans

816
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,680
it's so hard to live up to european standards i didn't ask you to tell us what a genius you are

817
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,240
that's my job because i'm the smartest guy everyone else is dumb compared to me i'm not a genius i've

818
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,400
learned english from cartoons you just called yourself a prodigy you fucking did it

819
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,240
no in comparison to the people in my class in comparison to me in comparison to me you piece of

820
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:38,760
shit i'm trying to fucking strangle you well okay you know i did want to say that i had i had that

821
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,360
very same experience um in fact just the other day i was reflecting on like if i was learning english

822
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,320
from a textbook i wouldn't be able to speak it uh like colloquially at all it would be a total

823
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,440
clusterfuck like people who are learning the language because when i was in japan um the rudimentary

824
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,920
japanese that i learned was like in no way would i be able to pass for like just having a conversation

825
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,600
even knowing a decent amount of vocabulary and grammar and conjugation and shit it's just like i

826
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,880
no matter what i did i would sound like a weirdo outsider in any context i mean i was a beginner

827
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:17,240
language podcast but i guess language is the most hard thing that i'm the most upset about how hard

828
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:24,520
it is you know i i thought this was going to go more towards uh jobs and money and that kind of

829
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,560
stuff because that is what's on my mind mortality we did talk about right in the beginning so like

830
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:35,880
we can only go up from there that's like the hardest thing that's true well nate i've spent the past

831
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,800
probably 11 or 12 hours building is no god more than that i've spent like the last 16 hours building

832
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:50,200
a spreadsheet and i've been having a good time i feel building a snowman no i feel mostly dead

833
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:57,160
inside but but i feel like i'm also doing the thing that my that i was built to do uh so why don't

834
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,000
you tell us about the experience of being a horrible horrible corporate corporate slut yeah

835
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,840
well uh yeah in fact i was just talking to a friend yesterday about how when i made the podcast

836
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,480
i felt such a sense of euphoria and nothing about the video is impressive

837
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,120
but i didn't even think about it it just my body just did them the mechanics of it

838
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,600
automatically and it's because i've been doing it for years now and i know what to do but more

839
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,560
importantly it's because doing it in itself is rewarding and feels good and i like doing it and

840
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:33,960
that is of course completely opposed to what i do most of my time during the week or you know the

841
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,520
40 hours out of my week i have to spend at work 40 hours plus probably more like 60 with

842
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:45,320
all the other shit but i mean i have to go into work and do my job and i go home but that time

843
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,800
is not spent doing things that i am interested in or i'm particularly want to do for much longer

844
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,600
and my my my only goal going there is to you know do my work at a decent level and pacify everyone

845
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,080
until such time that i can no longer be forced to do these things because and the it's all because

846
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,920
i have to be able to make enough money to do you know youtube and and other stuff that i want to do

847
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,960
and if we lived in star trek world i would be able to do my shit right fucking now you know it's

848
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,760
the same with my little pony actually you just you you can pursue the things that you want to do

849
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,440
and that's just how society is set up to reward the things that not not only i mean come on people

850
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:30,200
not only is it the thing i like to do but you've seen the results of what i can do when i am given

851
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,040
the time and the ability to do these things it's unquestionable that my performance is so much

852
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,240
better when i'm doing these things and i am so much more of an asset to humanity when i'm doing

853
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:47,880
these things instead of these fucking yeah that's everyone go to my fucking patreon give me money

854
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,400
it's like there's this guy jock fresco and he's like 90 something years old now but he yeah he

855
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,320
might be dead i don't even know i've been like read up on him in like a couple years but ever

856
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,520
since the 70s he's been talking about like this like society he designed where you don't need money

857
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,160
and everything is just done by machines and like nobody will listen to him and he's like old and

858
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,240
crotchy now you're just like fucking everyone's retarded i have the answer and nobody will listen

859
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,120
to me i'm just like that's the fucking hardest thing ever when you have the answer and everyone

860
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:22,760
just like yeah but no that's true that is true i'd like to hear more about his philosophy at some

861
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:29,400
point it's pretty cool he's just like science is more important than politics and if we measure

862
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,920
everything we can measure how much the carrying capacity of the earth like how much resources

863
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,640
are on earth and how to distribute it so everyone can survive and then we can computerize and

864
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,640
digitize everything so all the base tasks that we have to do can be done by machines instead

865
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,480
and then people can just pursue higher education and do things that are intellectually and creatively

866
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,000
stimulating and i'm like you see that's the thing yeah because i i just did a vlog on this on on

867
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,560
bestie boy my other channel about um fuck i don't even remember what it was about but it was it was

868
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:11,000
talking about an issue of how uh we are oh god i'm completely blanking i forgot what i was fucking

869
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,440
saying quick tom cover uh you are going to be talking about how we are like forced to do all

870
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,560
this shit that we don't want to do and like i don't i don't even watch the vlog about the vlog it

871
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,000
was about the heat death of the universe rapidly approaching and it was no matter how much humanity

872
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,960
progresses we will ultimately die in the long run oh oh i remember what i was going to say it was just

873
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,720
about how uh inevitably we will reach a point i mean if we don't all die first where uh every

874
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,920
single job that is currently done by humans will be done by machines and what are we how are we

875
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,640
gonna choose to live are we going to let everyone die because well they don't they're not the most

876
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,120
efficient tool for doing this so we might as well you know fuck them they're let them die or do we

877
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,560
want to structure our society in a way that this technology supports the the human drive to create

878
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,800
explore here's the thing though think about this yeah this has already happened once like back in the

879
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,520
day the industrial revolution happened and since everything was based on industry there was there

880
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,360
was a legit a split for a while if you read up on it there was like are we gonna shorten the work

881
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,080
day to three days a week or are we going to invent new ways to make people fucking suck balls and

882
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,320
do this shit oh i wonder which one we chose and here we are so if you think that this

883
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,040
mechanization is going to lead us to some utopia no no no they're going to find a way

884
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,480
to have us toil away do some new shit that we can't digitize yet now i don't believe that

885
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,400
that has to be the case i think that it has to be the case but i think there's definitely like a

886
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,600
structure in place that would crumble if right people actually actualize their own potential

887
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,320
examining examining how making excel spreadsheet so the boss man could be

888
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,960
happy yeah examining how that process uh has affected humans and how we've dealt with it

889
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,160
previously is definitely a good tool to predict what we might do in the future but when we get to

890
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:58,440
the point where it's either change the system or every literally everyone is obsolete except

891
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,160
maybe a handful of people who are running the whole thing at that point we have to make some

892
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:09,480
i would rely on people's moral compass to say that human life has value it's generally a good

893
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,320
thing it would be best if we kept people alive and didn't just let them all die as machines start

894
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,640
doing their jobs and they just can't afford the abundant resources that are available now

895
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,680
because human labor is worthless i hope that we can get over that hump you know what else is

896
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:29,560
because otherwise life would be pretty hard what's that digi yeah you know what else is way

897
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,760
too hard are you talking about my dick is my dick and here's why that's a problem

898
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:41,960
because my dick is so hard but i have i have nothing to put it in because dating is the hardest

899
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:52,520
thing oh god oh what what is more time consuming and asinine and difficult than trying to find

900
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:59,000
i'll tell you exactly i'll tell you exactly what's more difficult than that it's trying to do

901
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,440
literally anything and having five different fucking girlfriends at once all messaging you

902
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,880
at fucking 24 seven every hour of every day they just want to talk about bullshit there's

903
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,960
fucking 50 of them they never shut up i can't do anything you know it was great you know it was

904
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:20,280
great jesse uh a few when i was at college i had a i had an elaborate spider's net of

905
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,640
fuck buddies strewn about my college campus and it was great because i never talked to any of them

906
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:30,440
except to just arrange sex that's the only thing we did that's that's like it's like that but on a

907
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:36,280
global scale is my method but they all okay all right i'm just i'm so goddamn cool that they all

908
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,520
just fall in love with me and they all just want to talk to me all the time and i just want to blow

909
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:45,400
my brains out it's not worth it i'd rather i'd rather blow off my dick and blow off my brain

910
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,800
and die it's a delicate balance making them uh want to have sex with you but never speak but

911
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:57,640
also not like me that's what i'm trying to write right the problem i'm having is that every once

912
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:03,560
in a while i think huh maybe i should try to get a girlfriend and then i remember that to do that i

913
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:12,120
have to like i have to put in a cons a concentrated effort into actually like like somehow obtaining

914
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:18,600
a relationship because you don't even it's true it's not possible to just do that in in the course

915
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,520
of my everyday life you know like some people like when you're in when you're in school if you're

916
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:28,600
in college if you have a job you run into people you see people around you you might have to talk

917
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,040
to someone as a result of i don't know doing a project together or something yeah but if you

918
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:43,080
live in a house by you know with just you and like six bros and all you do is work at home

919
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:49,080
and you never go out anywhere then there's no reason i would ever encounter a woman

920
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:55,800
unless i was seeking out a woman which means that yeah which means that i have to take time

921
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,800
out of my schedule out of my day out of my work out of everything i've got going on all the irons

922
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:08,120
i've gotten the fire i got to lift all those irons out of the fire temporarily just in just

923
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:16,600
so i can even try to go and talk to a woman and then i just hear a cat where's the kitty where is

924
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:24,280
it i think it's amazing yeah talk about how great cats are that's the new topic cats cats have no

925
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:31,160
difficulty with anything cats the whole life's true you know digi uh you're you're absolutely

926
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,240
right about this and this has been one of the greatest struggles this is probably the big one

927
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:40,440
forget death i mean what what did what did the director of silent hill to say uh every human

928
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,280
is possessed it's compelled by only two factors sex and death they they make up the you know the

929
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,880
core of the of the human soul our fear of one and the quest for the other and it's absolutely true

930
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,800
that they're you know with our current society especially with with people who work the way we

931
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:02,280
do our jobs are basically isolationists they don't involve interaction with anyone except maybe a

932
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:09,880
select few number of people and our only way to satisfy this beastial urge inside of us

933
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,600
is to fucking devote massive amounts of time to fucking doing this shit because that's the

934
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,840
thing about the normie life that's so different when you're a normie you're you're you're grinding

935
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:24,040
your your uh your you know social skills most of that time all that time is being you're you're

936
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:29,560
taking levels in in you know socialization i'm just saying being involved that i'm not saying

937
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,480
i'm just saying exposure time yeah like exposure time that you're out doing this stuff

938
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,120
that's what i'm talking about well i just think like i think you know when i was in high school i

939
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:46,040
saw it as like oh oh ben's oh ben's muted uh when i was in high school i saw it more like um you

940
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:51,080
know i'm awkward i don't know how to talk to to girls i don't know how to do this and that you

941
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,080
know oh it'd be weird oh i don't want to have my heart broken none of that is what i'm concerned

942
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:02,520
about now it's just time the amount of time it takes to go out of your way to seek someone

943
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,880
it's something i never would have thought about before you know like growing up i was so concerned

944
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:15,480
with the the usual stuff like oh you know is she gonna like me now i'm like am i gonna have to

945
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,400
like actually spend hours of my day swiping in a different i don't even know which direction is

946
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,880
approved on tinder uh which are the right dog always to the right okay so you know how do i

947
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,800
actually have to spend hours of my day swiping on on like weird fractured information of other

948
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:38,920
people you know i've sat around trying to think of if i started a dating profile what would i write

949
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,520
on it and i have no idea i don't know how to describe myself other than like through nothing

950
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:51,880
ganzo otaku right i'm a big internet celebrity that's the thing what you need is when you're

951
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,840
boiling yourself down to like especially for shit like this it's like how am i going to attract someone

952
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,480
to be interested in me that's the thing like i don't understand how did you can be saying it's

953
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,720
hard to attract people with his audience when i've been doing it for years with my tiny microscopic

954
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:13,000
audience compared to his i wouldn't even be talking about like my audience that's all you gotta do

955
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,480
you gotta utilize the fame all you gotta do is make a tweet and say hey people who follow me on

956
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:23,320
twitter one of you has to have a vagina i'm famous we'll see the thing is let's let's all tweet

957
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:28,280
about this after we're done here and see what kind of results we get i'm like building myself up because

958
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,880
when i think of how i describe myself i think every every every person who likes one of my tweets

959
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:39,640
if i see in their picture that they're a girl i make a mental note and i write it down to that's

960
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,000
the effort i'm talking about that's the that's the going through the trouble that i'm that i'm so

961
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,560
against well i mean it's sometimes like that's the whole thing is like is what's the is there

962
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,880
a difference between something being too hard and something requiring a lot of effort are they

963
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,000
synonymous well they're they are there is a lift to murder face man i i would agree there is a subtle

964
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,720
difference it's a lot easier for me to do a lot of work if it's just something i want to do like i

965
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,520
just said i've been building a spreadsheet for like 14 straight hours and i it's probably gonna

966
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:18,120
take another 14 to finish it and it's just so easy for me to zone out and plug names into a

967
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:24,120
spreadsheet because it's like this is something that only i can do and i enjoy doing it and it

968
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,840
you know it's you know it's a good way to pass the time and i don't have to think about anything

969
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:34,200
i don't have to think about existential dread or you know like the effort it would take to get a

970
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,280
girlfriend i could just plug away at the spreadsheet and not think about the world at all it's you

971
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,280
know you brought up you brought up zoning out which is the same thing i brought up before i

972
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,720
wonder if it's an issue of shifting your ability to do these things from your conscious like intense

973
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,360
effort mind into sort of a that your subconscious are able to sort of do it without really putting

974
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,920
the the the forcing yourself to do it into it yeah maybe maybe that's relevant to ride a bike

975
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:05,720
or when you uh enter a car you know what to do after doing it like hundreds of times yeah i think

976
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:13,240
i think my two favorite states of mind are either absolutely no thoughts just like doing a thing

977
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,200
that's menial which is why i love making lists so much because that's just like there's no brain

978
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:26,200
activity there it's just structure i'll say and and the other one is like when i'm writing and that's

979
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,480
where it's like super heightened brain and it's like thousands of thoughts happening at once and

980
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,720
all of them are beautiful and it's like life affirming and makes me feel like a genius anything

981
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:44,520
between those two states is just shit it's you know uh thinking about death and how i'm spinning

982
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:50,840
my wheels towards it to get on to another sort of topic another big problem uh about that's that's

983
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:55,640
so hard that there's literally nothing you can do about it it's just dealing with other people

984
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,520
and having to put up with their bullshit that they do to you all the time and let me give an example

985
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,720
and it was just i i went for a run because i'm trying to be a good person and better myself and

986
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:11,800
not be a fat sack of shit taxing our health care system in america uh and i'm out doing my thing

987
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,920
and on my way back i'm exhausted from running i'm walking out i'm i'm you know running on the side

988
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:23,240
of the road across a uh an exit of uh of like a pizza place these and these it's fucking family

989
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:29,000
and their fucking station wagon comes barreling down to like 30 miles an hour and i'm i'm like

990
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,400
i'm not like half a mile before they fucking get to me i'm in the middle of the road and he fucking

991
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,160
smashes like he smashes on the accelerator coming towards me faster coming out of this

992
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:44,840
fucking exit of this this this fat factory and i'm just like i'm just screaming at this telling

993
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,840
what are you doing what the fuck are you doing i'm right here running in the middle of the road

994
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,800
don't you see me you stupid piece of human garbage you are in your whole family or cancer

995
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,840
you should all be fucking die i hope you choke on your pizza you fat sacks of shit yeah so

996
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,960
you know all that stuff all that stuff yeah people are in annoyance like there's like a 95

997
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:12,440
percentage of everyone in the world just sucks and shouldn't be talked to ever should be euthanized

998
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,800
slight addendum would would put that spit on it i think euthanized is too peaceful for them i think

999
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,000
that yeah that's why people should have their heads

1000
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,840
wopped off with a rusty fucking machete in the town square i don't really have run-ins with

1001
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,960
annoying people outside the internet but dealing with people the internet is definitely a point

1002
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,400
that you don't run into anybody so i mean that's the plus side to your isolation is you're isolated

1003
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:42,360
yeah i should have scouted those but you're also isolated from all the retards and there's a lot

1004
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,600
more retards out there i'll tell you that i should have scouted that little that like

1005
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,720
five-year-old daughter in the backseat for a potential girlfriend i should have

1006
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:56,120
well i blew it man i blew my chance yeah i like that like i should have offered in trade as as a

1007
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,200
piece of agreement he has to offer me his first born daughter you sons of bitches get out of the

1008
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:10,520
road by the way i'm single you know that that makes me upset too me and me and uh um and a bunch

1009
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:16,200
and everyone else in the house we all took this quiz that monkey had taken on his uh on his show

1010
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:22,680
it was like a normie quiz like it's see how normie you are right and like monkey and and

1011
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,320
basically everybody else got like slightly strange right like uh you know you're you're not quite

1012
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:33,240
normie but then me and victor and shade we all got normie victor and shade got chat status

1013
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,960
they were straight up chat and i got normie they've got girlfriends so that's like thousand

1014
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,600
points right well that's the thing i'm looking at this i'm like man i ended up being a normie

1015
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:48,600
and mostly just because i have lots of money and like i'm not i'm not ugly i have lots and

1016
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,160
lots of money and i have had sex before and that's enough to get you pretty much to normie status

1017
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:59,960
but i was like how can i possibly be a normie when i feel like this this this this alien creature

1018
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:05,080
you know who's in his room talking about how hard it is to go outside and socialize with anybody

1019
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:09,480
how can this possibly be normie but that's what that's what you get for putting your faith in an

1020
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,920
online quiz well sure i mean there's that but i also feel like this is the world we live in now

1021
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,760
this is what it like normies now are people who don't even leave their house and talk to other

1022
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,880
people you know maybe are they though i don't know maybe the classical idea of the normie it

1023
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,000
doesn't even like maybe they're not even out there roaming you know i've been outside sometimes i don't

1024
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,720
see a lot of people out there where the hell are they where are the normies if they're supposedly

1025
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,760
outside having normie has changed if i don't think you're a normie i think like because of like you

1026
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,640
know technology and stuff everyone is connecting more via the internet than real life and like people

1027
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,280
don't go outside and just hang out like that's not which i hate by the way how the fuck am i gonna

1028
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,800
know if a girl is fuckable before pursuing her if i don't see her in real life or have an up-to-date

1029
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,040
recent picture it is unacceptable to me it's very these things are not happening

1030
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,440
like if i i could i could find a girl who's super into me on twitter and spend like

1031
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,000
fucking hour talking to her then find out she's a total ham beast what what am i gonna do you know

1032
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,840
you know what the worst thing is it's when they do the like that they they have the face photos

1033
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,320
where they look up and it looks okay but then you know oh my god pair chan dude the pair chan

1034
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:23,720
syndrome it's it's it's everywhere that's really that's that's the ultimate disappointment i mean

1035
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:29,240
just don't trust any pictures taken from above because everybody looks very true it's yeah i gotta

1036
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:34,440
say i gotta say everyone this conversation is becoming a total sausage fest so i'm here

1037
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:40,360
that i hope you're i'm i've been saying well i'm here to destroy all men

1038
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:48,600
thank please do please do do it for all of us put us out of our misery let's let me talk about

1039
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:55,800
let me just throw my hat in the ring and say that i am depressed that i am lonely that i hate

1040
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:01,720
i hate it here and the tinder doesn't work in virginia beach digi what do you mean by

1041
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:06,600
how can that work i mean it doesn't fucking work i mean it used to work where i used to live it

1042
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,320
doesn't work i was hindering the whole time i was there i think did it work i think he means

1043
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:16,840
that he hasn't got no it didn't well the app worked i mean it turned on that's not what it means for

1044
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:24,280
i got more matches in one week at digi's house on tinder i have ever here where i mean oh my god

1045
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:29,320
what constitutes success what constitutes success at tinder do you have to actually get laid is that

1046
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:33,400
a successful tinder usage okay yes all right that is establishing it that's like the only reason

1047
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,880
that app exists isn't it well no no i'm not disparaging that i'm just wondering what your

1048
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,600
criteria is for i didn't know that was the point i just like the endorphin rush of getting a match

1049
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:47,320
that to me means i've won the game you haven't won the game matches are easy

1050
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:54,600
well not here they're not not for me but you i used to get a lot the success of tinder is very

1051
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,240
area-based i've tried tinder a few times and my area is just full of like super normies and

1052
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:04,680
everyone on there is wearing a fucking red socks hat and like goes out to sporting things and like

1053
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:09,000
just has pictures of them though their girlfriends getting drunk i'm just like god forbid i would

1054
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,120
execute all of you have given the chance so those are the only people that live around here

1055
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,760
genocide is par for the course in here but pay attention you guys catch up

1056
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,120
this is the most eliot roger podcast we've done in at least a couple weeks

1057
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:26,840
no it's good that's how it should be i would love a i would i i want a girl who likes sports

1058
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,360
that's cool i think like a fucking like a lin loud i'd be all over a lin loud i'd i'd rain

1059
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:38,520
calm on lin loud well all right but i want a girl who's got a brain and always speaks

1060
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:43,640
he's saying he's saying the loud sisters don't have brains they're genius there's all of them

1061
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:49,560
here's how cool i am i don't care what a girl's interests are they don't have anything to do

1062
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:58,840
with me ladies i okay but put to for a real argument here uh is it really necessary that a

1063
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:04,520
couple you know be it for a hookup or a long-term thing is it really necessary that they let's

1064
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,600
take digi for an example is it necessary that the person he dates be like into the same things

1065
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,800
he is into no as opposed to just enjoying if you're absolutely not if you're going for something

1066
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,120
long-term then i'd say absolutely yes i don't think it's necessary for any maybe in any case

1067
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:27,720
yeah mage running three or four years now uh it's not mandatory to have all of the same

1068
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,680
uh hobbies or interests yeah that's that's what i think that people who are my relationship

1069
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:40,680
personally is the similar sense of humor and i think that's like yeah i think uh vacation people

1070
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,960
who are inexperienced put way too much emphasis on finding someone who is into the same shit

1071
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:54,120
it's more about having you know for the record i i i do i don't even want a girlfriend to be into

1072
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:00,440
the same stuff that i am because i'm an elitist about the things i like and sure like you know i

1073
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:06,440
mean most of the time like my ex-girlfriend was way into anime but like the wrong ones so that was

1074
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:12,520
just actually no no it was actually more a source of a source of pain for me that it was a source of

1075
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:19,240
like you know it was fun to watch anime together but we had to watch i prefer a girl who is into

1076
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,400
nothing that i'm into so that i can mold her into having all the right opinions yeah sure

1077
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,680
yeah it's a girlfriend from the ground up just like christian westerchandler promised

1078
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,760
girlfriend from the ground up also hi mage good to see you again

1079
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,760
girlfriend i know i know but i but i was muted girlfriend from the ground up sounds like it could

1080
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:44,920
be a disney song like at the beginning of the movie when he's looking for princess oh i'm gonna get a

1081
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:51,400
girlfriend from the ground up the christian west and she's gonna be pretty and fancy somebody make it

1082
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:56,680

1083
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:02,520
plants okay and like and like the main character is like a little like a little like vegetable

1084
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,800
that wants to grow a girlfriend oh my god that's pretty good wait but wouldn't that make him a

1085
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:14,200
pedophile if we you know it doesn't work the same way in their society oh right okay they've got

1086
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:20,840
judge mcjudge mcjudson plants are incompetent that's you're you're you're just like christian

1087
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,800
thinking that he has to teleport his son at you eggs back in time 18 years for the sex in the

1088
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,760
comic for fuck's sake they can mature they can mature at different rates do dogs have to wait to

1089
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:36,600
be 18 before they fuck know you say that but in australia i believe it's illegal to make real life

1090
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,920
pornography of actresses over 18 if they look under the age of that's that's unrelated no no what

1091
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,000
i think it's what no what the similar problem would be is if you're not allowed to film animal

1092
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,840
pornography unless the animal is over the human age of consent and everyone knows the animal pornography

1093
01:13:52,840 --> 01:14:00,440
is a thriving field in australia and abroad how long are we keeping up this atrocious cringe worthy

01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:39,320
do you want to talk about a topic if yeah i could change a topic if you need a topic please

1101
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:46,440
may it save us okay okay um what you got so most people find it hard to wake up in the mornings

1102
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:53,480
what i find hard is to actually fall asleep i have i find both insanely difficult i cannot wake up

1103
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:58,280
but i cannot go to sleep i'm just crap i'm definitely the opposite of you mage there i

1104
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,840
have such a hard time getting up any day and like going to sleep is so easy for me i find it hard to

1105
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,880
want to go to sleep because the act of sleeping is death yeah it's terrifying it's true i agree

1106
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:16,200
completely i lay awake for seven hours until oh my god i have to yeah and i can't fall asleep

1107
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,560
and it's just frustrating like i i don't have i don't get enough sleep for like days and then

1108
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,720
like one day like i usually sleep for like five six hours and that's not counting uh when i keep

1109
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:34,680
waking up between like two or three hours or so and then there's this one day i can't fall asleep

1110
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:40,360
and then when i do fall asleep i fall asleep for like 14 hours and i've knocked out i've been there

1111
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:44,760
and that is the work you enter the odin sleep i used to not be able to get to sleep but what has

1112
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,520
helped with that now is that i don't have any schedule so i just go to bed literally only

1113
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:55,800
when i am falling down oh my god so speaking of what i would do if i was in your position have you

1114
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,480
ever heard of a polyphasic sleep cycle yes and i can't do it the sleep i want to talk about that

1115
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:07,240
i've tried many many times to enter one of those it's not i can't do it i just sleep too long it's

1116
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:12,680
when you sleep multiple times shortly throughout the day so you can kind of just keep going

1117
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:20,040
continuous the holy grail is the is six 20 minute naps yes is what people say is possible sleep

1118
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,600
schedule yeah but guys let me tell you because this whole not being able to wake up thing

1119
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:30,680
is such a burden being a normie with a nine to five it's a fucking nightmare i'm so bad it

1120
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:35,560
is the biggest problem in my life by a huge march that is my professional life me being able to wake

1121
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:40,840
up as to why when i had my nine to five like one of the reasons i think they let me go is because

1122
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,240
i couldn't wake up properly and i would be late a bunch of times and you know what it is it's

1123
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,240
because i'm up late doing the thing i care about yeah no fucking making my videos you know you're

1124
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:54,680
burning the midnight oil trying to satisfy your soul so before it gets crushed the following morning

1125
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:04,520
yeah that's why i guess mage wants us to shut the fucking board no i'm just letting you guys know

1126
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:09,640
because we were planning to for like half an hour and this is almost an hour now so half an hour

1127
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:13,240
that's gonna be a short ass podcast don't we usually go more than a half that's because the

1128
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:19,560
guys did part one because yeah davoo and hippo decided to just do a part one of this podcast

1129
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:26,360
themselves while they were waiting for us uh so they there's already like a 30 to 45 minute

1130
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,880
podcast recorded somewhere god this the the pcp is like the house of leaves of

1131
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:43,080
it is oh my god oh hey so i mean that joke i mean i yeah yeah and i don't i'm gay i'm gay

1132
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:50,040
um i'm sure it's come up before but this did we are did we already talk about art and how art is

1133
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:56,440
hard no we haven't talked about the actual topic at all yet we've just talked about what they've all

1134
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,480
been stuff i find hard it's just because it's stuff jesse doesn't find hard so it doesn't care jesse

1135
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:05,800
is just art on a different level than us all right ben well what were you yeah sorry tom well

1136
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:11,080
here's my art it's really hard that's it yeah i mean because it just takes a long time it just

1137
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:18,200
takes a long time as hell like for sure it's like you look okay you look at a thing like like

1138
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,720
brian leo malley's like my favorite one of my favorite artists you look at his art it's real

1139
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:26,360
simple right there's not that many lines the characters are simplified you think it'd be you

1140
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:31,720
think it would be easy to recreate but it's not it's never as easy as it looks it's it's it's like

1141
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:36,200
it's a couple a couple of drawings are like an entire day's work even if they're simple

1142
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:43,560
and it it's it's hard right now and i was doing okay now i'm four days behind

1143
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,320
because i made this stupid tweet that's like oh the last two weeks will all be foreshortening

1144
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:52,680
exercises let me tell you you want to talk about shit that's fucking hard foreshortening

1145
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:57,320
is the worst thing in the world every time i foreshorten i shorten my life from the fucking

1146
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,840
stress it's awful i haven't i haven't been doing i haven't been doing the everyday thing i've just

1147
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:09,160
been occasionally doing an ink thing for you know that's art is incredibly hard specifically

1148
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:14,760
illustration is hard and it's even more annoying because illustrators are very pompous and elitist

1149
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:20,280
about it because if you if you dare say oh it's so hard to draw good i wish i could draw good they

1150
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,360
all have the same stock response well you can draw good you just have to practice and get good at

1151
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:29,880
it you piece of shit you're just you're just yeah yeah i i know i know that i can practice and get

1152
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:35,160
good at it the hard part is that i'm too busy being the world's greatest comedy writer i'm busy

1153
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,080
putting my effort into that to put effort into something else when i say that it's hard i'm not

1154
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,080
saying that i can't get good at it i'm saying it's hard to get good at it you piece of shit you know

1155
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:49,720
it's true oh jesse i understand it's just from from my perspective it's a little it's a little

1156
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:56,360
grading sometimes when people look at your work and just assume that you just like i you know i

1157
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:02,040
wish i could do that as though it's just something i was born able to do yes i never take it that way

1158
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:08,200
i just take it like it's a result of your effort like they wish they could do that you know actually

1159
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,920
i think not many people tell me this because personally i would prefer personally i would i

1160
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:17,560
prefer people to assume it's something i was born able to do i like when people assume that i'm just

1161
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:22,440
a superior breed of human and it's pointless to try to measure up yeah that's greatly satisfying me

1162
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:27,000
so actually never mind i apologize for any time i've said anything like that i take it back that's

1163
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,160
just the real that's the source of all difficulty is that there's just not enough time in a human

1164
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:36,680
lifespan to do all the stuff that you want to do i've spent my whole life getting good at one

1165
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:41,960
particular set of skills so if someone fucking kidnaps my daughter and says you have to make a

1166
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:47,240
good youtube video i can tell them that i have this particular set of skills but anything else i just

1167
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,120
can't do it all and i hate myself for not having the time to devote myself to getting good at speaking

1168
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:56,520
of time do you ever think about that they're like higher dimensional beings where time is just like

1169
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:01,560
as fluid as i hope so and i hope to become one of them someday and i get really pissed off that

1170
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:08,120
i'm like limited by my well now hang on because me being without without a perception of time

1171
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:12,840
as we have now a cause and effect kind of becomes meaningless and nothing that you do really is an

1172
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:18,200
achievement at all you know it just it always was that way so really only because we view time in

1173
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:23,320
this way do our actions have the kind of value we perceive them to have yeah but i'd rather but i'm

1174
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:29,240
talking about should be rather just be god mode oh right easy or easiness jokes and something deep

1175
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:37,480
and philosophical just tom's right though we have to give up uh self uh congratulatory right urges

1176
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,160
if we just make everything easy you know if it's easy you're not going to get any satisfaction

1177
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,040
for it but at least you're getting it done that's true and from a limited time three dimensional

1178
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:53,080
being trapped in the coils of an ever moving forward time space mm-hmm that's the best we can

1179
01:21:53,080 --> 01:22:01,880
ever hope for vote vote prop eight to turn to turn time into uh a flowing a river that we can

1180
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,840
flow through at our own whim instead of an onward progression vote vote that up as the biggest

1181
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:12,600
solution in the universe let's talk about the actual hardest thing in the universe the thing

1182
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:19,880
that's so really um um is it is it is it uh we already made the my dick joe we already said

1183
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:24,520
that yeah we did we did okay okay i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry the actual thing

1184
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:31,080
that was really what you're good okay i don't i don't fucking know what i was gonna say the hardest

1185
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,760
thing that i don't believe anyone can ever actually get good at unless they were fucking you know

1186
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,280
fucking forced to get good at it from the age of like two years old is playing an instrument

1187
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:47,480
in also ballet i guess but playing an instrument is the most impossible thing in the world

1188
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:53,480
i've been at the same level of guitar playing for like 15 years i haven't progressed at all

1189
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:59,160
i'm just i'm just like barely competent and it's been that way since for for over a decade i never

1190
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,720
get any better because i never have the time or the patience to go okay today's the day that i

1191
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:08,360
would sign up for guitar lessons and fucking also piano lessons and all of them the fucking trumpet

1192
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,960
wasn't this the time problem again though is that i'll come back to well i mean yeah yeah but i'm

1193
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,400
specific jesse i actually found on how i hate that specific problem because i ran into i hit that

1194
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,480
wall about five years ago where i was like i'm never gonna learn how to play an instrument you

1195
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,920
know i'd spent i'm not hitting that wall i'll never accept it i spent i spent most of my childhood

1196
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,560
in my teen years thinking i was gonna do you know one of these days i'm gonna learn to play that

1197
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,960
fucking guitar that fucking bass or those fucking drums i got all of them i got a keyboard you know

1198
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,520
don't know how to play any of them and then one day i was like this is never gonna happen and then i

1199
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,680
found the best solution surround yourself with people who can play instruments then you can just

1200
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:52,520
pretend that their accomplishments are your accomplishments by singing and then posting them

1201
01:23:52,520 --> 01:24:00,120
on your bandcamp and therefore they are your songs because nobody wants to actually associate

1202
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:04,600
themselves with the songs that you've sung over because you've sung about penises and cocks

1203
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:11,080
and so they're like yeah whatever that's your bandcamp bro have fun and i'm like ha ha yes

1204
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:17,000
i have made music even though all i've done is screech about penises and cocks over someone

1205
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:27,880
else's institution digi you are an art criminal that's a good stage name art well you know the

1206
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:33,000
problem is that i just i guess i hold myself to a high standard because i picture myself in the

1207
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,480
future as like some worldly renaissance man who can do everything and so everything that i'm not

1208
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:46,360
currently good at i hate myself for and i want to die you know i view myself more as like the wild

1209
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,640
stallions as in my art will unite all of mankind and bring us into a glorious new age you know i

1210
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:56,760
think that's going to happen one of these days yeah that's right and i think self perceptions

1211
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:02,200
is pretty hard because then you have these standards you have to live up to that makes life way more

1212
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,520
difficult as opposed to like i'm just going to do whatever and whatever happens happens but no

1213
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:13,480
oh here's my here's that you know on that subject my okay um my inktober drawing i mean i was talking

1214
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,640
about how art is hard and tom you were saying that you know you've been you've been challenging

1215
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:22,680
yourself with your inktober's and they've been hard for you um let me for me my inktober things

1216
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,960
have all been stuff that i go into with no plan and i just like and i just like put down marks

1217
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,280
whatever and it becomes whatever it's going to become and it has they have not been hard they

1218
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,760
have all they have all just been whatever kind of came naturally because i wasn't trying for any

1219
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,920
particular goal with them and they all came out great and i'm really happy with them so

1220
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,520
there i'm sure there's a lesson to be learned somewhere in that story but i don't know what it

1221
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:49,960
is called stop trying trying just trying just sets you up for failure if you just do whatever

1222
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,720
you can't fail because you have no idea what you were supposed to do to succeed

1223
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:02,360
yeah if you just do what comes you know what is a uniquely podcast on such a great inspirational

1224
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:14,600
quote from tom oliver oh well cool all right i mean are we actually done i don't know does anybody

1225
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:19,320
have let me let me bring up one more thing and i just that i've thought of as you were saying

1226
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:24,920
that it's just a uh a youtuber specific thing that is kind of just true of all artists is

1227
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,240
when you've made your work and you've got like your channel whatever and you have a certain level

1228
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:35,720
of quality that you have uh made things and you know it creates an expectation in yourself and

1229
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,800
possibly your audience it's hard to know what they're thinking uh to deliver on that same

1230
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,800
standard which leads to everyone making a secondary channel where they post their

1231
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:49,240
shit that isn't good enough in their own mind to be on their main channel uh you know just living

1232
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:54,040
up to your own standards is what i'm saying as an artist as a youtuber as anything is uh

1233
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:59,480
this stuff because who who who's the toughest guy that you got to fight in your box and ring

1234
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:08,280
