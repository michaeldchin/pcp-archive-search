1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
1, 2, 3, sync.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I feel like that was a big delay on that one. Let's try that again.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
1, 2, 3, sync.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
One more time.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
1, 2, 3, sync.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Alright.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, I felt like we were all in time with that. Maybe Ben you're hearing us all later.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Maybe the first time.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, I think it was okay.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I have an awful syncing method, but it works.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's that?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hey Ben, how you doing?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm cool.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey Gibb, how you doing?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm alright. No, wait, we're not going to do the whole thing of it.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Go, keep going, keep going.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey Oblivion, how you doing?

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm doing, ah, oh my god, this month is a fucking clusterfuck. I don't know if I can, I don't want to take up the time to explain everything right now.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Just make a noise.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey Tick, how you doing?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm doing alright.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No, that's not what he said.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Tom, that was done right before.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Maybe there is a flaw in this method.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You have to be able to recognize your name.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey Tom, how you doing a second time?

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm okay, I can't hear what's going on apparently.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh god, I just kind of, and then I just line it up because everyone will be in between.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Your mic sounds pretty rough Tom, are you on like your phone or something?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Does it really sound terrible?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well I mean it doesn't sound great.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It sounds fine, it sounds okay on my end a little bit longer.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Your microphone's pretty rough Tom, are you recording through a dog or something?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is that better?

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, that is better actually, much better.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You catch.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I knew it.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Alright, so are we ready to start?

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I like changing my microphone and now everyone sounds like an alien, that's weird.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh really?

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you have to fix something?

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tom, what?

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No!

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The microphone ate all of his bandwidth somehow.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Genuinely?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When he said we all sounded like aliens, he was ignoring the actual aliens that were right.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is that any better now?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You sounded okay before, but you also sound good now.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay, fine.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do we sound okay?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You've found not terrifying anymore, so I'll take it.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Should we just use the whole thing and not even cut the pre-syncing part?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I like disasters.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Welcome to the Procrestinatus podcast.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Welcome to the PCP, again.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's me, Ben St.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Gib is here, Gib and Take.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hello everybody.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tom Oliver's here, back in fighting shape.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I would go that far, but I am back.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, we've got a lineup today.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Guesting for the first time is Tessnaker.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And returning are our friends of the show, Oblivionfall.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And Tectonic Improv.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think this is a record amount of guests for Oblivionfall, me, Tessnaker and Tom Oliver, all guesting on the PCP.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're forgetting the infamous Oops, All Guests episode.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We had like 70 guests.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I wasn't there.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We could beat that every day.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We could beat that.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We could beat that if we try.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do just invite them snakes on.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You'll have like 27,000 guests at that point.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh yeah, technically true.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
On a technicality.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So we've returned to the olden days of two years ago.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And we've returned to the olden days of too many people on a podcast to understand what is happening.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I guess, how's everyone doing?

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How's life?

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Playing bad video game all day.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually, it's not bad.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know what it is yet.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm figuring that out.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My life is currently an absolute clusterfuck.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't want to know.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know that feel.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I just moved into an apartment.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Congratulations.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I guess unless it sucks.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, it's a pretty nice one.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, it's considered.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You know, it's, I'm still moving everything in.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I got, I still, I have a fucking, I have a ridiculous record collection.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So it's been a pain in the ass bringing all those over.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I had like a bunch of milk crates, but the milk crates are too small for the records.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want to fucking blow my brains out, but it'll all get done.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's all right so far.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And think about it.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When you put that final record up, you'll be able to say to yourself, oh, finally.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, finally.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Exactly.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Amazing.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Good job.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've still got.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gamers Tavern is back on the show.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is that Gamers Tavern?

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've still got a big stack of boxes in the corner of my room from when I moved in

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because I'm not willing to get rid of them.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know I'll need them soon.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
For the winter.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Very soon.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
For the yet.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When I'm evicted and I need to live inside something, though, that's what I'm going to use.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, probably.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When my fucking slumlord decides to evict me for, I don't know, nothing, whatever.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can never be too careful.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Who's got a video playing in the background?

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do I?

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I heard something.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I heard someone yelling.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I need to work.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's another guest.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's five guests.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I live next to a football stadium.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If it was on today, we could have had.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We could have had triple digits.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh my God.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We could have.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We could have live.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sold the microphone up.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, it is the Arsenal stadium.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it would have been booing.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, because, you know, Arsenal hates the PCP famously.

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What is Arsenal?

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Arsenal is a thing where you store ammunition or guns or weapons.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, that's what an Arsenal is.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thing about Arsenal.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
True.

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
True.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's kind of why the football team is so controversial, because they just get red-carded when they blow the other team away.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
People give them a stern look.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They bring their rifles and muskets and stuff onto the pitch, but they can't really do anything until they start murdering.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Every time that happens here in America, just be like, hmm, thoughts and prayers, and that would just be it.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In America, the controversies are all over teams being named racist stuff.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But in the UK, it's like, ooh, that team's name has guns in it?

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We don't like, we don't have guns over here.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh no, you do not know about English football fan racism.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They are some of the most inventive racists in the world.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm saying, yeah, they keep the racism.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Keep the racism, lose the guns.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's the United Kingdom, I guess.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I just, okay, this is a weird story to bring up about one of my six, seven uncles.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have too many of them.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I also have like tons and tons of extended family members, but so I understand.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, let's hear it.

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When the cricket was on last year, I went downstairs, my uncle was visiting family and it was all just...

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I was just going to get a drink of whiskey.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And my uncle just casually just says, hey, Patrick.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And I was like, yeah, are you a racist?

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And he asked it in the most casual tone.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think I've ever been asked the question.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And what was your answer?

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Um, no.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You just said no.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I just said no.

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I just said no and bought my whiskey.

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And I got upstairs and it wasn't always upstairs.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I realized how absurd that question was given the framing.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Did he ask it like he was hoping you were so he could...

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did your answer satisfy him?

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He just went, huh, like it was just a very casually interested...

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Weird.

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wow.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And kids these days.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I went back down in my house, how bizarre.

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I went back down and I had to ask, I just asked, why'd you ask if I was a racist?

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And he just said, he just kind of looked at the telly because we were playing.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It was either Pakistan or India.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And he said, well, you know, when the sport's on,

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
they're saying about us as well.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He was just checking to see if he could say something racist.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was about to dunk on them, but I'm sure I have the all clear.

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is that what it was?

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He wanted...

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't think that's...

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know if that's what it was because he's not...

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Of my uncles, he's one of the...

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He's one of the less racist.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There's a scale, as they call him.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's challenging you.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There's my uncle that's like the elder racist, even though he's not the oldest brother.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And then there's, you know, it goes downscale until one is maybe just a little bit of a little Englander.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And...

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, that was nice of him to ask for consent to be racist before...

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I suppose so.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I suppose so.

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sure it's okay.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's better than the conversation I had with another uncle where I've left a passport in a caravan,

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
which we used to go on holiday and he just said,

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you'll want to get that back, you know, then foreigners.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And she's like, I'm just...

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I literally just said, I'm walking away from the phone, mate.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I can't be bothered.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It really is.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Especially in sports in the UK, there's just sort of like a...

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's okay to call players of color a racial slur,

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but that's just banter.

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's just, you know, lads having fun.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's just lads having fun.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They just have no understanding.

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If they didn't want that, they shouldn't have played for the other guy.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's pretty much it.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The fun I had with my family...

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
My family are all big football fans, and it's not even...

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not just exactly the racism, because my immediate family is just the extended family,

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
which I find very fucking lucky.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Everybody's got those racist uncles.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But it's funny that every time, you know, penalty on one side,

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and my family's just blowing their lids,

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and then penalty on the other side, and it's like, no, that was...

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That come on with it.

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it's like...

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The legitimacy of a penalty is decided on which team it is.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not by how broken the man's leg is.

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That sounds about right.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah.

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I watched some good old fashioned American gridiron football

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
over Thanksgiving the other week.

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Go Pats.

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Nothing...

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It was...

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Who was it?

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It was the Raiders versus...

245
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The Bills.

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The Pats were not playing that day.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, there might have been the Bills.

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, I think so.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, that was a good game.

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That one was like...

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That one like went into like overtime.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It was like...

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That was actually a great game.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It was really tense, and then the Raiders like barely eked it out,

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and we were rooting for them.

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So...

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, fuck the Bills.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They're not a sports guy or anything, but I've said before,

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I will partake if it's on, and if the season is right,

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and the season was right, and a good time was had by all.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Good, good...

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Really, really neck and neck.

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Real nail biter.

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It doesn't get much better than that.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I haven't actually...

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's funny because when I go to America, I do really want to catch

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
like a baseball game.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If I ever visit America, I'm more like a...

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know.

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The Simpsons has taught me that it is mostly an excuse to drink,

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and it actually is really boring.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean, the excuse to drink is fine by me.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I just want to feel like an American for an afternoon or an evening.

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'd go with someone who was excited to go to a game.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh yeah, I wouldn't go by myself.

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'd need the company.

277
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's not me.

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I went to a baseball game or two when I was a kid,

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and then I've never been to a football game,

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
but I did work as a beer hawker at a stadium very briefly.

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I was really bad at it.

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I've seen a football game or two that way,

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but I wasn't paying attention.

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Getting a ticket and going and spending the whole day

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and getting in the seats and waiting in lines and driving,

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it's like too much effort for my blood.

288
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think it's like I just kind of want to get in on that experience at least once.

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think of that one out for myself.

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Great Iron Football is a better sport.

293
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Great Iron Football is a better sport than baseball, though.

294
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I like the experience merely of being in a gigantic crowd of people yelling,

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
which I can get by going to like a music concert,

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
so I usually prefer those.

297
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But now, COVID, you could never ever do that ever again.

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't like concerts either.

299
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was packing in my bag.

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, concerts aren't for me.

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've got shitty whacked hearing,

302
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
so I don't want to risk that any further than I already pushed it.

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I hurt my hearing really bad once at a concert.

304
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thankfully, the ringing went away,

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
but I never go to a concert without...

306
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Your plugs?

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Your plugs.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, smart boy.

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I usually just stick my fingers in my ears if it gets too loud,

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
but it really doesn't most of the time.

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think I like...

312
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, when I get like tickets, I try to get cheap ones,

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and they're usually near the back, but of course it's loud,

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
so it doesn't really matter too much.

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If you want to get close,

316
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you're just going to be able to see the people's faces a bit better.

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't know.

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I saw Snacky Puppy once. That was fucking cool.

319
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, I did see...

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I did see Zen Huxtable play in a band in a show one time.

321
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This was like a few months ago.

322
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I saw his band, and they were actually really good.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That was a concert that I actually did enjoy quite a bit.

324
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They were playing at some kind of weekly festival

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
or a little tent set up with a beer stand.

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It was like every week this tent place would set up.

327
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They would sell beer.

328
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You could hang out during the day for a block party,

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and then they would have a lineup of local bands at night.

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And they were the headliner.

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wow.

332
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Apparently he had been conscripted

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
as a temporary assistant to...

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Because they needed more people to perform more tracks on stage with them.

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He wasn't an official member of the band,

336
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
but I think he got promoted to an official member later,

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
because he was really good on the keyboard.

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's the plot of that thing you do that Tom Hanks made.

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is it?

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The drummer breaks his arm or something,

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and the main character fills in form and pretty much takes his spot.

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sorry, movie.

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They were...

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know.

345
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Anyway, it was a great show.

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
A lot of fun.

347
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Small crowd.

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think that was better.

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And it outdoors probably makes it easier on the ears too.

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's the indoor venues you gotta really be careful about.

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
True.

352
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It was at... Have you ever been to the Paradise Rock Club, Ben?

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's where I hurt my ears.

354
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't think...

355
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's somewhere in Boston.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's near the Raising Canes.

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No, I've never been.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Damn, man.

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I feel like a small cramped room would be...

360
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Not a small, tiny, but a reasonably sized,

361
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
but still very much enclosed space would be much worse than stadiums concerts,

362
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
which are much louder, but they're usually open on the top.

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Those are nice.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Music.

365
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Music.

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What was that band you saw again?

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What a concept.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Where are we going with it?

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What's the apex?

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That band that you were talking about, Gib.

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What's the point?

372
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Snarky Puppy.

373
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They're like a jazz fusion band.

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They've got some really popular songs on YouTube.

375
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Lingus is one where it's got this...

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, you linked Cory Henry.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Maybe his guy is once before.

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, they're really proficient jazz,

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
like a super big group of bunch of people who go to jazz music,

380
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and no singing, it's just music.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's just real music.

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No singing.

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Singing's not real music.

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's painted by the human voice, which I agree with.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
When I hear...

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I got my headphones in and I'm jamming and I'm hearing the beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And then I hear a little...

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And then I hear a little...

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And then someone goes...

390
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And then someone goes...

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And I go, no.

392
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No, and I throw my headphones on the ground and I'm like, they ruined it.

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It was pure.

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It was pure, and now it's tainted.

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,460
It's not like singing. It's just that like when music can fill a stadium

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,420
With no like big-name artist singer, you know, it's it's because the music is incredible and it was

397
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,300
Sure, sure. It's an hour eight fair. That's how you know. It's serious real music

398
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,360
Real music not a track under five minutes two drummers. They had like three fucking

399
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
brass section

400
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,480
If the lyrics and everyone had a song, then it's real music. That's true. Yeah, lyrics

401
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,040
That's when you uh, that's the only time they're valid, right?

402
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:31,440
Yes, during the final boss during the final boss when the when like the the opening theme song of the game

403
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Plays, but they add a vocal track

404
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,600
Operatic music. This is the one time humans are allowed to sing

405
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Feel the sunshine

406
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,680
Yeah, I think that's the first song ever sung by a caveman as they like beat something to death with a stick

407
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,400
Caveman was mass destruction from persona free. Yeah, we haven't stopped since

408
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,640
Did you say lotus juice? Oh god, he doesn't know

409
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:14,440
Is that not the name lotus is is the name of the of the artist who wraps the the songs in persona three

410
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
That's his like a stage name. Oh

411
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,360
Yeah, no, I did not know that I thought it was I thought it was like a colloquial British expression or something

412
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Like man, that was so that we needed we needed some lotus juice to get that done like that took some real elbow grease

413
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,960
That took some serious birds milk. That took some real lotus juice

414
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,120
Yeah, we came up with a term lotus juice when we were just absolutely

415
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,440
Defiling China with opium. I don't know if I I mean, you know lotus eaters right from the Odyssey

416
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,560
I don't know it could mean something it could go a bunch of different ways. I'm just do it

417
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,720
I'm just doing free association here. I'm like, you know, it's like John Cleese said you guys are all in the active mode

418
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,560
You guys have all you have your creativity switched off. I am in the playful mode

419
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,320
I'm in the creative mode. I'm I'm just there are no bad ideas, right?

420
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,820
I just I just tied lotus juice

421
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,760
So the opium was you saying I'm not on that's the worst joke

422
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm gonna make on this podcast unless I really dive deep never say never alright. We still have three more hours

423
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Joy join me snake in the creative in the creative clouds

424
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,720
No, I'm already paying for adobe. Oh

425
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,640
What if

426
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,840
Lotus juice seems like a weird like like a vape flavor

427
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh, it will be one day. It sounds good. If lotus juice isn't selling lotus juice. He is not one brand

428
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,760
No idea what it would taste you have a hole in the market. It's time to capitalize on it

429
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,920
You got to start making I context of that changes then if a guy called lotus juice is selling juice with his name

430
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,640
I have to wonder where the juice comes from and then well, you know

431
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,080
You know, he could do like the Lil Nas X thing and he could sell shoes with his blood in them

432
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,120
And he could say like this shoe contains the lotus juice

433
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,760
It's already got blood so we're just gonna have to like he's gonna have to have his glands squeezed and

434
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,840
We can go lower we can we can yet do worse

435
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
We can drill I

436
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,520
Think I think they did fill the niche in the vape market that I was waiting for I think someone finally did make caffeinated vape juice

437
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,840
Which is a godsend does that work? I don't know I wish I said I wish I still vape

438
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,160
I wish I still vape so I could try it

439
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,120
I hear I hear from my friend that they don't know they don't make vape juice without like nicotine in it anymore

440
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,080
Is that true? You've got to be able to find some without nicotine

441
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I mean, I haven't really looked

442
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,400
You used to be able to find it. It would be it would be really fucked up

443
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,200
It would be really fucked up if they did like a crackdown on it and the result was not that like you can't buy the flavored

444
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,360
Kind anymore because it appeals to kids

445
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,840
It's that you can't buy the non nicotine that you can still buy the flavors the kids like but you have to get it with nicotine

446
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,160
They cracked down on the nicotine free because the kids were getting into it. That would be fucked the most

447
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,980
That's exactly what they would do. I've got the dumbest feeling on vapes and cigarettes

448
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I don't smoke. I've never smoked. I'm

449
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,320
Thankfully way too cheap to ever take up smoking if I want yeah, but that's a that's a big

450
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,840
When I'm walking behind someone and they blow a big plume or something and it smells like vanilla instead of cigarette smoke

451
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
I'm like that's wrong

452
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,080
Fill my own fill my lungs with cigarette smoke, please

453
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm gonna kill you stop wait wait wait you're saying that you would prefer it to be cigarette smoke

454
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,840
Yes, I asked smoke is fucking granted die. No, I love that smell

455
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I know

456
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,640
The smell I also like the smell when I was is nostalgic

457
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,600
But I definitely don't like reading it in because I was scared to death by like videos of like

458
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,200
Here's what a fucking lung looks like if you smoke and it's like like a like a creepypasta scary monster

459
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,200
And I'm like, oh, no, I don't want that to happen

460
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,120
And then when I every time I see a person smoking I hold my breath

461
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,200
I don't I was a little kid when I was a little kid

462
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,880
The only person who I ever spent much time around who smoked was my grandpa

463
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,280
And when I went to his house his house smelled like cigarettes and I liked my grandpa and I liked that smell and I thought it smelled nice

464
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
There are times when I think

465
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,120
Like when I when I used to smoke I would catch myself smelling like cigarettes and I'd be like this is disgusting

466
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,040
This is horrible. This is a nightmare. My breath is gross. Why am I why live, right?

467
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,200
But but occasionally I will catch someone else smoking and I will get a whiff and be like

468
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Kind of nice though. I kind of like that though kind of want that. I should ignore that feeling

469
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,000
I should point out just for clarity's sake. I'm not saying that I've taken the smart opinion on this

470
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Just that that's the way my brain has been foiled. I disagree. I

471
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,640
Don't I don't understand I don't understand I like the smell of cigarettes

472
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,480
But I like the smell of vapes better like I like a good a good smell of smell of like like menthol watermelon

473
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
It's like delightful

474
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,480
men fall water to me. It's just it's me. It's like

475
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,720
Some weird Senate. It's not even synesthesia. What am I talking about this feels like reality isn't quite adding up

476
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,620
They're cheating snake. They're they're gonna smoke. Oh, yeah smoke the good shit. They got a guy

477
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,740
Commitment to the bit when I when I light it when I light a scented candle like I just it's such an uncanny

478
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,160
It's like why does it smell like like bananas and walnuts like my reality is fizz collapsing

479
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Mankind was not meant to live like this

480
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,320
You're taking me on one here. You're moving me a step beyond what I mean

481
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,360
I'm talking about when I'm walking down the high street and it's grotty and horrible and I'm in London

482
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,400
So it's just human misery all around me if someone isn't smoking to die

483
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,640
I want it to smell miserable. Yeah, I want I want the app most to be perfect. I want to breathe in and go

484
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Yeah, this is my town

485
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,400
All right, okay, that's not quiet. I take it back. You can live that's funny

486
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,880
If if they can live as long as I'm allowed to with this air quality

487
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,080
It needs to be in like a hipster trendy part of London if it's like a sweet weird smelling vape

488
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, I feel you on that is this closer to the set

489
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,440
There's like a bubble tea shop and like stuff like that then the vapes can the vapes can be like different colors

490
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,400
They can be coming out as pink and green. Yeah, someone is you know, just blowing out a plume of that or someone else is choking on a tapioca

491
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:53,320
They should have like themed vapes for different parts of cities like in Italian districts

492
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,800
You could have like olive oil a pizza a pizza flavor. Yeah

493
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,960
Oh my god, I'm just thinking of London tourist vapes and I'm getting disgusted

494
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
You have you have corned beef

495
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,900
Like a baby like the tower London

496
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,000
Well, it's like jelly. Do you remember a like Willy Wonka Willy Wonka had those like pills that were like an entire

497
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,080
Three-course meal. Why not vape? Oh first? I vape my mashed potatoes

498
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:27,660
Then I vape my my turkey and and and cranberry sauce then finally I vape my pumpkin pie. Ah, it's a whole Thanksgiving meal

499
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:38,200
The dystopic food pill into the dystopic vape wait, what if we could vape on the blockchain

500
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,360
No

501
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,240
So like so like you get you mine coins by I don't know

502
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I don't know what I mean by that

503
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:56,400
What you do is you suck in from an e-pen or an e-sig or whatever is then you put your mouth to a hard drive and you just blow it in

504
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
That creates

505
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,840
You just have the pen the vape pens wirelessly connected to your phone or your computer and like every time you inhale

506
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,340
It can calculate how much you're inhaling and the more you inhale you get rewarded with vape coin

507
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,820
So like if you just like keep vape the more you vape the more vape coin you mine

508
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,100
And then you can trade it for a theory or something and buy your your vape NFTs

509
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:29,060
You know and then they'd they'd have like like like mass-produce vape mining operations where people sitting in a room

510
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,500
Like 16 vape pens in their mouth sort of time like an opioid den

511
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,380
But just a bunch of people vape a bunch of crypto bros just vaping for the dear life

512
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,180
I've got all the crypto bros that have popcorn lung and Bitcoin just like disappears

513
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,780
There's a supervisor walking around saying if you're good today, you get the vanilla flavor

514
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,260
I'm so sick of the olive oil flavor man, please

515
00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:00,060
We can convert we can convert like our smoggy our smoggy like industrial cities billowing out plumes of smoke

516
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,940
No from now on it's gonna be big clouds of like yeah of like a blueberry muffin

517
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,140
scented

518
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,020
Diacetyl of vapor just into the clouds surrounding the atmosphere

519
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,580
Filling filling up filling up the ozone layer

520
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,020
But it'll smell nicer the plumes coming off of like a nuclear power plant would be

521
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:31,020
Centered and it would make the whole area around taste great when it rains all the time cup out and you can catch the juice

522
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
And it will be great

523
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,900
She's like mommy mommy the rain tastes like a taste like menthol the rain tastes like

524
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:46,780
Grapes grape menthol. That's my favorite by the way. My favorite flavor was always the fruit menthol combos. That was

525
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,020
I love it. That's so that's what I keep going back to

526
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:57,620
What what is the taste of menthol? I can only think of methamphetamine. I know that's not what it is, right?

527
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,260
Well, have you ever yeah, it's like mint. Have you ever had like a menthol cough drop?

528
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,380
Yeah, it's like a like a mint. Okay. I know what really weird because I

529
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,140
When I'm recording, I'll get like Fisherman's friends, which are menthol flavored and it just tastes

530
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,180
Cold wait you the Fisherman's. Yeah

531
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,900
What's that? Does that help with recording using like cough drops or something?

532
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,460
It helps with sore throat and it

533
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,620
It basically if you're talking too much and you're not talking properly, which I'm very very bad at narration

534
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,940
After 10 years, I was hoping I'd get better, but I just I don't know

535
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
I guess if you think it's as long as you so

536
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,300
I

537
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,740
Just I use those which they're like a menthol sweet which soothes the throat and just kind of helps

538
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,340
Yeah, if you've ever had like if you've ever had like a menthol cough drop like a cherry menthol

539
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,740
Like it tastes like cherry, but it's just kind of got like a little like a sort of like cool minty icy

540
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
Mentholiness to it

541
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,400
Like like like icicles are growing on the back of you the throat sort of

542
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,500
Pretty much like a very extreme delightful

543
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
delightful

544
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,780
Man, well, I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. How did how did this happen?

545
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:16,260
Where I was very weird chain from racist uncles in sport to the blockchain, which by the way

546
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
Crypto just crashed the other day

547
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,940
Oh

548
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,940
That's one of the items on my list. That's one of the items on my topic list was the crypto crash

549
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,820
I'm so sorry. I just had some I'm sorry. I had to mention no

550
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,100
I mean, I'm excited. It was a pretty big one. It dropped like 20% in like one day. Yeah, it was pretty brutal

551
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,580
Did something like a bit what caused it? I bought the dip. Did you buy the dip then?

552
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,700
Did you actually buy the dip? I did I bought two hundred dollars with Ethereum on the dip

553
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,340
Uh, no, I did not no, I did not buy the dip

554
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,460
I'm not convinced that it will not continue to crash

555
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,540
It probably will go through like I someone would mentioned because I've been knee-deep in those research for this fucking video

556
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,100
That like it's gonna crash during the holidays as people cash out to like buy holiday gifts and stuff

557
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,980
Are you making a crypto video for like?

558
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,700
I have like a 12-page video right now on NFTs and why they're bad and it's a deep

559
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,660
It's a deep dive. My brain is permanently infected with garbage the common section for that video is gonna be great. Oh, okay

560
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,460
But I mean the the avatars of that comment section

561
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,820
Clicks ready boys, we're gonna have to take them all is

562
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,380
Do we know what caused the the big crash the other day because I have no idea

563
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,220
It was because of all those fainting beat. They stopped being able to vape. They yeah

564
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,060
Yeah

565
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,060
I actually want to know okay, but does anybody know why these things happen? Like I said like like I

566
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,740
Sometimes there are like sometimes some country who passes some legislation and there's like oh as a market response

567
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,740
Well, like I said, I'd heard I'd heard that like it tends to crash a little bit

568
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,940
Around the holidays as people like cash out to like use them their gains to like buy stuff for Christmas and shit

569
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I don't know if that was the entirety of it

570
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:12,420
But I expect it probably to kind of be rather low for the rest of the year as people continue to do that. I

571
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Didn't buy any dip

572
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,740
But what I did do was I complained before about how a bunch of I had a bunch of stable coins that I got from some app

573
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:28,100
That like some tax youtuber may it recommended me to try and I tried it and now I have a bunch of like

574
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
USDT and USDC

575
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,180
So and then I I said this before

576
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
STD

577
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
We call them STIs now actually

578
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,060
The the anyway, yeah, I had them in this app and I tried to transfer them out and they ended up in

579
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,820
Not my not my coinbase wallet, but my wallet in my coinbase wallet app

580
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,820
So my coinbase wallet wallet so they're in my coinbase wallet wallet

581
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,660
But I can't transfer them to my coinbase wallet without paying gas and the gas was outrageous

582
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,060
They wanted me to pay more in gas than I even have in the account

583
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,540
That's cuz coinbase coinbase the app and coinbase wallet are two different things. I

584
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,820
Know that now

585
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,620
Guess so I guess so I've been so I've been waiting for so I had a little bit of Bitcoin

586
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,580
I had like $80 worth of Bitcoin. I had a little bit of USDT USDC

587
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,260
So I sent my I converted my Bitcoin to

588
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,340
Ethereum and I'm gonna send the Ethereum I sent the Ethereum to the Bitcoin wallet wallet

589
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,740
And now I'm waiting for gas fees to go down low enough that I can use that Ethereum that was Bitcoin to pay

590
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:45,380
The gas the ether gas fee to transfer my USDT and USDC for my coinbase wallet wallet to my coinbase wallet

591
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,820
And then cash them out and that's the plan and this is all to get like a hundred and fifty dollars

592
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,220
This has been like a month's long process

593
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,260
Arturning is much better. Carturning is awesome. I got a new one the other day

594
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,380
The American Express blue business card doesn't count towards my 520 limit 524 limit

595
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,940
Fuck yeah, I'm excited. I'm back on the churn, baby

596
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:17,420
Back in the chain. Yeah, I'm gonna make a hundred dollars during this podcast by finishing a commission. That's what I do

597
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,300
What are you well? Oh, that's multi-tasking. I

598
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,100
Think I've mentioned this before but I used to be in the my little pony community shocking

599
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,740
Terrible, are you making more are you making more vectors? Yeah, I am

600
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,360
I did a lot of animation and I made rigs

601
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,300
Very similar to the ones for used on the show. In fact, I have the rigs from the show

602
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,180
There are like animation files that were leaked from the show years ago, but I had access to before anyone else

603
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,580
So I've like studied how I do things. I built these animation rigs and

604
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,780
You know, you know how you know your youtubers who have their little like character in the corner

605
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,100
It's just a bunch of PNGs that they swap out similar

606
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,820
Who would do such a thing the arm crosses who would do such a thing or pony analysis channels

607
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,180
I mean my god, who are they we've moved into the third dimension now

608
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,780
We use fully fully modeled 3d rigs to do our to emote for our youtubers. It's true

609
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:18,380
I am being outclassed slowly, but I basically used my animation rig to make a hundred and fifty poses in

610
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,460
flash and each pose is just a keyframe in the program and

611
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:29,060
So son will commission me a hundred bucks for a hundred images or a hundred and fifty images for, you know

612
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,660
120 bucks of their character and all I have to do is just draw the hair once slap it in and it's done

613
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:40,940
Hmm, and I go I was gonna have to vector hair and recolor and that's it. That sounds kind of smart not hard

614
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,260
I guess yeah, definitely up your rates

615
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,220
I

616
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,980
Everyone I think my rates are good because something a lot of especially when they accept easy designs

617
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,180
I can do it in like an hour. Yeah, ours

618
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
No reason not

619
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,740
Yeah, I've hit the sweet spot for what people are willing to pay people don't want to pay more than that

620
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,500
So okay, okay, I think I'm the market started to start accepting a theorem then that's when you'll really fucking. Oh

621
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
No

622
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
Tom stop

623
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
You know I should

624
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:26,460
At some point I really do think at some point the the crypto bubble is gonna pop and I just it is

625
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,340
And I just don't want and I just don't want to be holding the bag

626
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,780
I just don't want to be holding the bag when that happens. We don't have you want to get in and get out

627
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,060
The easiest thing to do is to not grab the bag at all. I

628
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,580
Try to get in and get out

629
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:45,860
I tried to get in and get out during the last big rally and I ended up I waited too long and I cashed out and I lost like a

630
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:51,340
Little bit. I've mostly broke even and so I'm like, what's the point? I can't time the market. I don't know what shit's gonna

631
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Do, what's the fucking man exactly?

632
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,180
It's genuinely all just gambling by another name

633
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,060
They're totally gonna we totally have the resources and energy to do that

634
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:12,180
Totally, I'm sure NFTs are gonna replace emojis. Just you wait. I want to hear what they're gonna do

635
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,020
I I just wanted to like point out my own stupidity and why I will not I ever expect anyone to but just never take

636
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,580
Financial advice from me because I own thirty nine thousand shares in Napster

637
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,340
No, that's funny

638
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:34,020
Wait, whoa, when did you buy them for thirty nine cents? They are thirty nine cents now

639
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
So I've lost

640
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,940
But so here's the thing about so I I got into stocks trading the whole GME thing happened

641
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,860
I thought I'm too late to get onto GME, but I've been

642
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,980
I lost I lost a couple hundred dollars on me. I didn't go on GME. It just kind of reminded me

643
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,020
Hey, I've been being start doing stocks for a while. Let's let's take a punt on it

644
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,260
I've got a bit of money spare and this does go against what I said earlier about me being too cheap to smoke

645
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,300
But I am perfectly willing I set aside a hundred

646
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,980
But not too cheap to buy Napster shares. It's never too late

647
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
But here's okay

648
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,180
Not that this excuses my later decision-making, but

649
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,780
What I started as was when I was just looking around for companies to invest and I saw on as alone

650
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:21,260
It was a company called Melody VR and its whole its whole modus operandi. Whatever fuck was

651
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,380
That we do 360 degree

652
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,260
Videos of concerts and my brain just I'm very simplistic on it

653
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,140
I was just like hey, maybe when covid's over and there are concerts again

654
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,580
That sounds like a cool venture and like headsets are becoming more common

655
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,180
That sounds like something people might like and I threw in a few quid

656
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,420
Turns out Melody VR is the company that acquired and bought Napster

657
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,500
Um years ago and then at some point just decided hey, we're gonna start trading under the name Napster again

658
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,860
So it was like they just pulled the cloak off and like we're Napster actually

659
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,820
We

660
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,660
And then it just kept going lower and lower and at this point. I don't expect to make money on it

661
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,460
I just kind of want to know how many fucking Napster stocks can I have

662
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,380
Can I eventually trip Elon Musk into boosting it?

663
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,940
Can I make it a revenge thing against Grimes? I don't actually believe those last two steps, but you know

664
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,940
Can you why would they change their name to a thing that is associated with like an old

665
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:27,820
outdated here's the messed up thing I since learned which is Napster is still functional and has a music storefront

666
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,460
Just no one cares or knows not even I own stock in it and I don't care or no. I just have spot of

667
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,940
I think I think I remember hearing that they um

668
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,140
They tried bringing back Napster like a few years ago

669
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:49,420
Oh, like there's report. There's multiple reports. They say we're bringing it back in 2023. I'm sure sure you're fucking up

670
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:56,940
It's it's the equivalent of like owning the name myspace and trying to make a comeback when everybody is associated

671
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,300
Myspace with like oh that one that failed and facebook won

672
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,340
Like nobody would get interested in a new myspace. I mean, I guess I mean a lot of these old companies

673
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,580
They still keep puttering around doing

674
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,940
God knows what um, but like they continue to exist and have some sort of

675
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,300
Presence like I don't know who uses them, but like maybe somebody does and that's we're still pulling in

676
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,380
uh

677
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,900
about like

678
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,740
Several million a year enough to remain technically functional

679
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,780
But you know, they're never really good. They're never going to be in the public zeitgeist again

680
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:36,620
Yeah, like like they've had their fame and they've scuppered it. They need a new name because otherwise

681
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,660
Nobody will yeah exactly

682
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,180
Like I I wasn't even on the internet when Napster was

683
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Influential I didn't get internet

684
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,580
till 2003 when and I only heard about Napster in retrospect

685
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,220
My generation was using limewire to nice to steal everything. Yeah

686
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,660
I was limewire and memories of limewire. Yeah

687
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,700
My knowledge never saw limewire

688
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,100
My Napster knowledge pretty much begins and ends the episode of Futurama

689
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,900
Where they oh, yeah, where they make like robots of celebrities or something

690
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,300
Oh, was it kidnapped? Yeah, they're kidnapped. Yes. Oh, yeah

691
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,780
I feel really bad with Futurama because I think when I was a teenager

692
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,940
I knew near enough every episode word for word and it's all gone now

693
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,860
I want to get back into it. I haven't watched it. I never I never watched the uh, the re the reboot

694
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
I

695
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,140
I I watched a couple episodes and yeah, it's not on it

696
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,740
The average quality is not as good as the original fox run, but there are still some gems in there

697
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,660
The original

698
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,420
Futurama writing team seasons one to five were it was a room full of phd's

699
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,580
Yeah, we're just making whatever joke entertain them

700
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,940
Well, it was that wasn't a family guy writers and it's it loses some some of that

701
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,260
Wasn't the team originally like a bunch of like the best talent from the simpsons team got like put like sort of

702
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,340
Yeah, it was it was led by it was led by david x cohen formally david s cohen

703
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,460
Yeah, and he just grabbed some of the smartest people he knew and just let them loose on making the most obscure gags

704
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,780
They could while just being funny along the way

705
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,820
Yeah, and that's kind of how you get futurama. It's this weird flash in a pan

706
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,620
Honestly, I believe something that shouldn't have happened, but

707
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,020
It did

708
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,540
Yeah, glad it did

709
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,020
It's it's funny how like 50%

710
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,260
Like 50% of number file videos I watch there'll be like a segment where they're like, yeah, futurama reference fist

711
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
Like it always happens

712
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,660
lol

713
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,340
I thought I thought you were making a joke like like 50% of number

714
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,820
File and then you were gonna make up some like

715
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,500
Weird statistic like you're gonna like be like, oh, yeah

716
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,980
Actually, according to number like the number file numbers followed like the fibonacci sequence

717
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,100
If you spiral it out or something if you take the square root, I don't know it didn't happen

718
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,060
I don't know never mind. Well the reason all I don't know mathematics jokes is impossible

719
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,740
It is impossible. You need to know numbers. I and that just doesn't add up

720
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
I make jokes

721
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,660
Fucking numbers

722
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:28,060
We already talked about this words are bad. You has to be instrumentals only if you can you have to make me laugh at your instruments

723
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,580
I've been getting yes. I love the sound of a trumpet

724
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
It really makes it really gets me going

725
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,260
I've been getting the most I've ever gotten out of my physics degree

726
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,620
As I mentioned during the pre show I have been

727
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,460
Uh, I've been making I've been doing my programming shit

728
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,060
I've been making making codes and shit and I use numbers

729
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,140
All the time they said they said they I said I'd never learn I'd never need to know about how

730
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:02,540
Oh, what is the the acceleration is equal to the square root of the the mass of the times of gravity?

731
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,700
Well, guess what I'm doing it. I'm I'm I'm making animations and stuff. It's gonna be it's gonna be

732
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,220
I am a dang I'm I think I gotta be a nerd I'm I'm getting like

733
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,660
I don't think I could have kept at the greek the game grind this long if I wasn't a dang nerd

734
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,220
And I get

735
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,860
I'm a jock game reviewer

736
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,380
Chad chad virgin game developer the chad game reviewer

737
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,700
Yeah, that's that's telling me about mario jumping in a parabola

738
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,020
I have I could not have stuck with it if I did not get a perverse

739
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:45,500
Uh, a nerd pleasure out of when I when I type in yeah when I when I make a little formula and then like

740
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,540
Oh, here's he's gonna move according to this formula and then I boot up the game

741
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,580
And I see him and he moves in the in the correct arc and I go

742
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,580
Aha, like oh, I'll I'll define I'll define such and such to go according to this formula and then I see it and I'm like

743
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,780
Yep, that's that's the waveform. It tickles that like residual gone god complex

744
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,660
All of us nerds have for being fucking bullied and having no control growing up. It's like now they all listen

745
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,020
Absolutely

746
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,900
Absolutely, that's why I named all of the characters in my game off my childhood bullies. So I could

747
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,740
Yeah, exactly. No. No. No. No. Hey. Hey. Hey, this is my

748
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,780
I made I made a little game called hatred and have you ever heard of it? But yeah, that was that was how I work

749
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,540
Oh, that was you the trauma. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And yeah, this

750
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,820
This brings me to okay. This brings me to another topic one of the topics on my list that I wanted to bring up

751
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,820
I have I have a conundrum

752
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,500
Where I'm getting close to be able to release this I already talked told

753
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,420
I think give and tom and probably tech also. I mentioned this too

754
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,340
Uh, I I'm getting closer to be able to release it

755
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,460
And I want to put it on steam. Oh, yes

756
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,020
and I am

757
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
Cons and I am and I'm wondering

758
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:02,140
Are they gonna be mad if it has like music from an old SNES game in it? Yes. Yes, they will. Yes, really

759
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,500
Is something is something actually gonna happen because I yeah, I find I find it

760
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,140
I find it kind of hard to believe that anyone would even notice

761
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,220
I

762
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,180
I think

763
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:19,900
Them not noticing is likely, but like there will be consequences for you and your game if it gets caught

764
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,860
You are absolutely playing with fire. Just the context of one the one bit of history

765
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,100
I have with this and it's not quite SNES music

766
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,020
Okay

767
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,020
Um, you know the yeek devs

768
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:37,500
Their previous games and brothers that had bitcrushed shadow of the colossus music in it and you can't you can't buy that game anymore

769
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,620
And that is one bit of flak that's going to follow them around forever

770
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,300
So I'd say I mean and this is just my perspective on it

771
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Here's even if you think you can get away with it

772
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,540
You probably can't and you would be taking the reputation hit

773
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:56,060
Just what I'm saying. Hold on. Hold on. I hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is okay

774
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,140
I'm not saying I'm not intending to pass off it as my own work

775
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:06,380
Like I was intending to be like credit in the credits like this music is I took this music from this game, right?

776
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:12,860
Like that's what I wasn't I wasn't gonna plagiarize. I was gonna be like, yeah, it's credited. This is not my music

777
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,100
I don't think that matters

778
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:22,380
Because you need the licensing rights or that just lets everybody know that you knew exactly what you did and did it anyway

779
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,220
I don't yeah, because you're gonna sound like stealing something from someone admitting you did it but like

780
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,460
But it's okay. Hold on. It's not plagiarism. Okay. It might be no. We're not saying it's plagiarism anymore

781
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,900
We're saying it's yeah, it's intellectual. It's violating copyright

782
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:44,300
Stealing from who though from square square doesn't even exist anymore. There's square enix now the game was never even localized

783
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:50,780
You're trying to they still own the fucking trademark. Just convince yourself. This is okay. Yes. Tell me what I want to hear

784
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,100
Right now

785
00:47:53,100 --> 00:48:00,380
There's so many people. This one we're involved. You gotta you gotta go back to doing musicians. You have access to musicians find someone from the piece

786
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,700
I don't want to. You could release it on itch. I feel like you could release it on itch and be fine

787
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,900
I'll say all right. It could still be a bad look but you could do it

788
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,820
But I wouldn't put it on steam. I'll fucking kill you. I'll fucking end you. It will not be a bad look

789
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,900
It's not a fucking bad look. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with everyone to be like? Then why are you asking the question?

790
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
Why are you asking the question? Let me say this in a way that

791
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,220
You're admitted to violating copyright law. It'll get I don't think it's a bad look

792
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,300
I don't think it unless I charge for it. If I charged for it. Maybe it would be a bad look if I wasn't

793
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,660
I still think you then just distribute the game via napster, then you'll be on brand

794
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,940
Just put it on just put it on napster and have everyone to be able to download it from there and then you'll be on

795
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,380
39 shares will finally go up in value. You know everybody everybody wins

796
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,220
Yeah, when I'm a millionaire, I'll be able to say the pcp got me here

797
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,860
I'm going to put it on itch no matter I was gonna put it on itch for free

798
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:01,420
But then I was like hey, I could technically put it on steam if I wanted to I did not know that you were gonna just make it free

799
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,620
Yeah, I still think it's a problem. I guess I guess it makes sense because it follows on from a comic

800
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,020
But I assume since it's on steam you you'd probably want it to to get paid for

801
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:19,100
The game is already a nightmare of like stolen intellectual property. It's already that then I wouldn't put it on steam

802
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:26,060
That's the point god. Okay. I feel like it's it's funnier that way. Well, I mean if you like you just pull one out

803
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,940
Hey, I got this legal action. That's funny. Then go for it

804
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,220
What's that what you're saying snake? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was talking over you

805
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,580
It's just I feel like you just pulled the hell of a fucking joke on us with

806
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,460
Oh, yeah, it's got this one SNES track in it and then we zoom out and then there's all these intellectual characters

807
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:49,420
No, no, no, what I mean what I mean is that like in terms of inter I'll tell you the exact specs in terms of like assets

808
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,700
There is music from uh front mission gun hazard

809
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,860
There are a few sprites and sound effects from secretive mana

810
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,420
and uh mario rpg

811
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
I'm pretty sure those release the us

812
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,660
Those released in the us, but okay, but the music but the music did not release in the us

813
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,780
All right, but I mean the the game is the game is based on a comic, which is I mean it's

814
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:20,380
It's it's it the main character is a my little pony fan character and it's about his uh, it's it's it's it's also involves a

815
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,540
sonichu, which is also, you know, uh

816
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,700
Has its own intellectual property that definitely falls under parody. That's definitely fine

817
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,900
Well, maybe my use of uh the front mission gun hazard song is also

818
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,860
I was making a comment. It's a commentary on the original and how good of music it is

819
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,100
It's very much. I like it and want to put it in a video game

820
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:48,380
I thought we threw the gameplay just have a character say damn this tune is rocking and it's like we did it boys

821
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,780
We defeated

822
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,020
I got so excited my headphones fell out for a second

823
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,180
I might might be right but now it's for now. It's for the purposes of review and critique

824
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,740
That's how I get exactly

825
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,500
Actually, that's how

826
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,100
Get away with everything

827
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:09,260
You should have a character say wow this this you should have phantom horn do a a t-bap on that song

828
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,660
And then it would be fine

829
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,900
It would be a review

830
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,500
Okay, well, fuck you guys. You didn't tell me you didn't give me the answer. I wanted so how is that not the answer?

831
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
You wanted that's a great idea. It's funny. You do it

832
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:28,220
Oh, okay. Thank you. It's the one my my guy my guy livid now you can make the final boss of your game us

833
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,820
Shutting down your Ben. Here's what you could do. Here's what you could do

834
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,300
Yeah, I

835
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,660
You could probably do something

836
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,900
I know like a lot of like porn games on steam do something similar to this where they release like a

837
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,500
censored version of the game on steam and then they point to a like a

838
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,340
A way to patch the game with like the the porn scenes in it

839
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:51,260
What you could do is you could release the game on steam without the music and then like

840
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,980
Like subtly nudge to to a patch that patches in the the front mission gun hazard music. There you go

841
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,500
That might work with the porn game example rather than all the yakuza mods that

842
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,220
patch back in

843
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:15,980
No, I of course I think of the porn games before yakuza. No, I mean that's my my game has more has a more direct lineage to

844
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,220
To porn to porn visual novels those mass three games. Yeah

845
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
Yeah

846
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,180
Okay, that's an idea that's uh

847
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,980
I will continue to uh, I will continue to mull this this conundrum over

848
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,700
Uh in my spare time

849
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
You should put it on the epic game store instead

850
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,660
That'll be

851
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,620
Supposed to exclusively we love phantom horn ben we want your game

852
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,260
Fans of big big t-bap fans speak speaking of big t-bap fans. This is crazy. My sister called me the other day

853
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:55,980
My sister is a tattoo is a tattoo artist. She was famously on the podcast one time when she said you're a dog

854
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,300
You're you're a dog and i'm sick of it

855
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,660
um

856
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:06,060
And and she called me the other day to tell me that one of her customers like a guy who had come to get a tattoo from her

857
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,420
they were chatting and she brought up her brothers who had a

858
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,980
A my little pony youtube channel and the guy was like what's their channel called and she told him and he knew

859
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:23,260
He he okay. She's she specifically asked wait is ben saint your brother. He didn't ask about keg standard

860
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,580
He asked is ben saint your brother

861
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,420
Uh, he knew t-bap. This was I know

862
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,540
Crazy shit. So so my sister just got a lifelong customer out of that

863
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,220
Uh

864
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,980
Some guy walked in was like, yeah, I want a tattoo a tattoo every week comes in just like what's ben saint up to

865
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:47,260
What kind of debauchery is he getting into this week? I I want a I would like a tramp stamp

866
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,860
Please on the back so that it looks like when I'm wearing pants so that it looks like uh phantom horn

867
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:58,220
Is coming out of of the right side of my pants and and keg standard is sticking out of the left side

868
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,220
Shouldn't be the other way around

869
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,940
No phantom horn was on the right. Oh, okay

870
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,100
He's right like separated by the arse. He moves slowly left over time

871
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,780
Anyway, I thought that was very funny that that is very small world

872
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,980
Small world small world

873
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,420
Uh, all right. So that's that's two

874
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,860
That's two of my items. That was both of my two items off my topics list. I'm done

875
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
I've said all I have to say about this week

876
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,580
I

877
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,580
I've got a thing to say

878
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:41,740
It's pikmin bloom. Oh god. I love pikmin bloom and I'm gonna say it again

879
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,700
I want to ask people in in in the call

880
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,300
Have you played pikmin bloom and do you know how cool it is? I have not I've seen it. I'm sorry

881
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:57,020
I thought it was like pokemon go thing, but different probably. Yes. It's it's different from pokemon go. It's just it's just good

882
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,380
I've just never I've never played pokemon go ever in my life

883
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,140
Pikmin is about tiny little people who come out of the ground and then they help you do things

884
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,220
Yeah, um

885
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,700
And that's that's that's what they do sick. So you it's a you grow slaves. What?

886
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,420
You you grow a little? No, they like slaves

887
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,540
Yeah, just like just like pokemon

888
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,860
It sounds like just like pokemon. They like it. It sounds like justification to me. It's different. I swear

889
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,180
But I mean we got we got nintendo's classic franchises, you know

890
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,380
Like cock fighting with pokemon and slavery with pikmin. It's just like fun for all ages

891
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:39,740
No, he's like, you know, Miyamoto said that, you know zelda was like the forest he explored and pokemon was the bug catching

892
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,700
Now it's just taking it back to when his family had the plantation

893
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:52,940
Miyamoto Miyamoto made he made pikmin to remind him of all the good times he had as a child uh helming the slave ships from africa

894
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,220
and

895
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:01,260
That's why that's why the ships legs sprout in a triangle. It's to represent the transit

896
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:09,020
Yeah, captain olamar. I cut myself off. I cut myself captain olamar is actually based off of uh, uncle remiss

897
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,340
his uh, his old friend from

898
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,220
I want to cut through the irony for a split moment just say pikmin one and two are very good

899
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,940
I never played three. Yes. I never played them because I was not a game cube guy

900
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,780
They're cool

901
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,060
I'm really

902
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:33,660
They make me really anxious because I always feel terrible when like any pikmin dies and like you're not going to make it

903
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,460
Do that game without losing a couple of them. Oh, no, I

904
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,780
Have tried for a zero death

905
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,500
I've I've very gotten I've gotten very close as like the second boss was the first time one of them died

906
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,060
I was very angry reset the game like it's fire and bloom

907
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,420
Yeah, anyway, anyway pikmin bloom

908
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
um, you have your little pikmin

909
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,540
And you pick them up out of the ground you you grow them by walking with steps

910
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,220
So it counts your steps and the thing that I've learned

911
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:06,060
Aside from the fact that it's like it's not as stressful as pokemon go is with like

912
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,180
There's billions of pokemon and you just have to once you've found all of the common ones

913
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,580
You're just sort of waiting and there's nothing to do until you see. Oh, there's a cool one nearby and then you go

914
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,380
um, it counts your steps and it records um

915
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,060
You can plant flowers as you walk to increase

916
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,540
The chance of you finding an expedition which is sort of like a little mission

917
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,860
You can send your pikmin on together like a grape or something

918
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,740
Um, and then you can bring it back and make nectar which you can use to make more flower petals

919
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,980
But the flower petals are server side

920
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,980
Um, and everybody can see them so you can see like frequently warped paths

921
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,180
And that's cool. Yeah, but the thing I like about it

922
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,060
Is that in pokemon go

923
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,220
the high

924
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:56,940
Like amount of pokemon like a lot of pokemon spawn in like densely populated areas

925
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,940
So you always have to go to the major cities in order to get loads of pokemon and loads of poker stops

926
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,100
Which kind of defeats the purpose of exploring

927
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,700
You just sort of go to a place where there's like 10 poker stops in walking distance

928
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:14,300
You walk around the block and then you go home to your probably less in the middle of the city

929
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:19,020
You know place and it's like there's nothing to do especially out in the country. There's nothing to do

930
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,340
But with pikmin it counts your steps and everything is about just how far you can walk

931
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,740
So it's completely the opposite you are it encouraged to go on long walks

932
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,700
To rack up the steps so that you can grow more pikmin more quickly

933
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,500
Plant flowers everywhere and then go and find

934
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,300
You know expeditions for your pikmin to go on

935
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,540
And I really like that because going on walks was the whole reason I sort of

936
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,100
Got into not the whole reason but part of the reason I liked pokemon go as a game

937
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:54,940
And then once I realized that I would never go for a walk unless there was a rare pokemon that I needed

938
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,980
Um, I realized it was terrible for walks

939
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:02,700
And but pikmin is pikmin bloom is great. Do you want to get some exercise?

940
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,580
I do need to get more cardio

941
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,580
But it's fucking cold now

942
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,580
Why couldn't they release in the spring?

943
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:14,700
I can actually I just got a new phone my phone has been has been unusably bad for like a year now

944
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:20,220
And I finally just got another one in the mail. I got to activate it. Dude download pikmin bloom right now

945
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,180
Maybe I fucking will maybe I don't know

946
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,420
It's funny because you had the countryside

947
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,140
And where you didn't have much to do and I have london

948
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:33,740
And I had a somewhat different experience with it, which is just walking around london

949
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,900
Can kind of be shit

950
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,860
Especially when it's like a pokemon will be somewhere. It's like that's kind of a dodgy neighborhood. I don't yeah

951
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,140
Yeah, I don't want to do that. Do I want to stick my neck out of that?

952
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,260
And it's like it's never it's not that bad, but there are moments where it's like

953
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,820
Mmm, don't don't like that area. Do I want to go there for that?

954
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:57,340
Do I want to have a walk in sheffield for a snorlax? Not quite not today, I would say

955
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:04,780
You know I grab I grab my handgun and I'm like right we're going to we're going to peck them

956
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,780
Let's uh

957
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,980
Take a chance is yeah, and the chancey folks whether

958
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,460
Dead or alive pickpocket alleyway. I had to break out the squad and we had to infiltrate to

959
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Liberate a pokemon

960
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,100
That's what that's a new to in buckingham palace. You just have to storm it

961
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,500
I mean, I'd say hello to the queen on the way out challenger to a duel

962
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,340
I'll think of all the cool pokemon get blown away by the palace guard

963
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:37,900
I don't know if the queen has a smartphone. I've always wondered that and I've never seen her with one anymore. She's dead, dude

964
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:43,980
Oh, yeah, she's done. I know she's in the hospital. She's got to have like some some like like a nintendo switch

965
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:52,380
She's gonna be reborn the only nintendo switch she has she's like hooked up to and it's somehow her consciousness is being uploaded to it

966
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,620
It's keeping her alive

967
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,940
She's in a cocoon. She's gonna turn into a bead drill or a butterfly. We don't know which one

968
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,340
Please don't switch off her life support

969
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,020
You know what they're doing they're they're minting her they're minting her on the blockchain

970
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,740
Save the queen

971
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,820
Ah, it's the only way to keep her alive is to put her in the in the in the god's right place to queen

972
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,780
You're right clicking the queen right click saving the queen is a punishable by death offense

973
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,620
So you will be found

974
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:43,260
But I thought you're supposed to god save the queen only is god the only one allowed to right click save

975
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,420
You're supposed to god

976
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,620
All right, I was confused by that

977
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:53,900
I you know i'm just gonna nick and eddie is odd bit and say why do we have to ask god to save the queen?

978
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,220
She's got an army and men with guns

979
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,540
Like god could have a go now the blockchain might be all right

980
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:06,140
That's just god. God's got guns. She's doing all right

981
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,740
This whole time we thought they were talking about god, but god's actually an acronym for gamers on demand

982
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,820
Like she has her gamer army to rise up

983
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,980
Oh god, we didn't think about they've all been waiting

984
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,620
For her to snap her fingers and the gamers will rise up and uh

985
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:28,860
What will they do? I don't know they were raised playing the getaways so they'd probably drive really badly

986
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:34,460
They'd rise up and bring all of their playstation 2 memory cards and they will save the queen

987
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,780
Oh, yeah

988
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,220
Save the queen memory card thing and you have a little queen head in there

989
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:48,380
That'd be cool. I just think a little 3d model just slowly rotating. Yeah, and then I delete her to just clear room for more metal giz solid photos

990
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:57,820
Yeah, sorry. Yes, right priorities. Yes queen. Hmm. Do you want to do you want to overwrite this file?

991
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,300
Yes queen

992
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:08,300
That's the day when we're we have voice voice controlled computers and it's really gotten out of hand

993
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:17,900
Well, they're looking for the commands. Yes queen. Yeah, we're not we can't we can't say yes, please we have to say that

994
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,580
I pushed into it

995
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,820
Snake yeah, I wanted to ask you a question

996
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:34,780
I wanted to ask you at some point on this podcast about how you found the pcp

997
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,180
Sure, because I saw because I saw um, I didn't know

998
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,380
I saw you you pledged to the patreon and I was like

999
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:47,100
Is that the to snaker and then I looked at your and it was it was linked to your page. I was like it is

1000
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:52,940
It's the guy same guy. I know this guy. Love this guy got to get that guy got him

1001
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,060
That's where I am. So here he is

1002
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:01,980
So, yeah, how'd you how'd you find this? So it's a long and winding road?

1003
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:07,260
I'm a little bit trepidious and it's kind of spotty, but there's when I was a okay

1004
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:10,860
um, I didn't start watching anime until I was

1005
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,420
21 22

1006
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:20,780
God you're so pure so long. I was so pure so long and it fucks you up if you get if you if you hook them too early

1007
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,340
It's funny as well because I have a problem with watching films and watching as well

1008
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:29,340
I don't watch them that much and I just thought I'm gonna really see about getting into anime

1009
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:35,500
So I watched 100 shows in a fucking year, which and then I didn't watch much afterwards

1010
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:41,740
I just catch I just catch one or two things a year maybe it was it was the year of anime

1011
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:46,940
Yeah, and that was also I was in university at the time and I was also doing the youtube

1012
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:51,100
I was doing the youtube and I was looking at what other creators were doing and because I just got into anime it was

1013
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:54,300
I watched I watched Trixie and

1014
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,620
It's funny because I talked to a lot of people in the essay. I'm not gonna put them thing

1015
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:03,020
I had more respect for what she's doing than most of what most of them

1016
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:08,700
Just wait you cut out for a second. Sorry. It was basically I I

1017
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,340
Started watching Trixie just kind of see I looked into any tubers. Oh, sure

1018
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,940
I kind of wanted to know what was going on and I've been and you know

1019
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:21,100
I I talked to other game essay creators and I have made to all do game essays and I think

1020
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,860
I think even back then I had the highest opinion of

1021
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:29,980
Stuff but it's like I thought it was okay. It was fine. Um, it was like stuff

1022
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,540
I could watch and then I

1023
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:38,140
I found the pcp through that essentially because I also needed a lot of podcasts because I was doing

1024
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,700
I was doing a practical filmmaking course at university

1025
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,620
Which is a lot of a lot of your credits where you literally had to

1026
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:51,580
Go and get work you had to go and approach people and do that and a lot of your

1027
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,260
grade in the third year and a lot of it in the second year was influenced by

1028
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,740
how many credits did you have and

1029
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,620
The minimum was five you had to have five

1030
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:06,220
Rolls it could either be like five rolls on one project if you were mad or like one roll on so many

1031
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,340
I ended that year with like 25 credits

1032
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,380
Saw a lot of credits

1033
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:17,500
I was I was kind of sneaky about it because I was literally the only person in my class doing

1034
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,700
Audio engineering. No one else wanted to do audio engineering. Everyone there wanted to be a director

1035
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,780
They wanted to be a writer. Of course

1036
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,300
Classic

1037
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,580
I was the only person in there who like spent my kind of

1038
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,500
University grant on a sound kit on like a boom mic and all that

1039
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:38,620
So I was on trains a lot and I needed a lot of podcasts and yeah, I kind of

1040
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:43,340
I listened to a bit of ps uh pcp and it didn't stick with me then

1041
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,340
My most of my memory of it then came years later when I was bloody doing

1042
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:53,820
The evil the evil genius video. I was I kind of got bored of listening to the sound of that game

1043
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,420
It's got a great soundtrack. I was just like I need to this is a podcast game now

1044
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,740
and yeah, it was it was basically via Trixie and

1045
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,460
This is gonna sound really weird and like a lot worse than it is. It wasn't actually until a few months ago

1046
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:11,660
I started actually looking into everyone else in the pcp because like because I don't listen fine

1047
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:16,380
I don't listen to I didn't watch Trixie stuff that much anyway. It was like her stuff was

1048
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,420
fine, but it was

1049
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,860
How do I put this?

1050
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,020
Because I don't want to be doing something with it

1051
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:28,860
It's the perfect stuff that I can listen to it when I'm working because it's just mentally engaging enough

1052
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,260
Sure, yeah

1053
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,740
If I listen to something way too interesting, it's like I have to stop and pay attention

1054
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:41,660
If it's not interesting enough that part of my brain isn't shut up that demands to be entertained and fed

1055
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:49,260
So yeah, it's kind of like I've bounced I've bounced in and out over the years essentially

1056
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,220
Well, I uh, I found I think I found your

1057
01:07:54,700 --> 01:08:01,740
Evo video because I had played that game and like I didn't know anyone else who I just I saw it recommended one day

1058
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,940
Uh, and I just thought that was needs. I was like, oh

1059
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:08,940
There's I played that game like a once and nobody ever talks about it

1060
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,940
Yeah, so I checked that out

1061
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,820
And then I think a later on I think after I saw

1062
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:20,460
The running shine yick video your yick video got recommended and I was like, oh, it's that guy. It's the same. Oh, it's the same guy

1063
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:25,580
Let me check out his other videos and I've watched a lot of your videos even though I don't play

1064
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:29,500
any of the games you talk about I get that a lot because

1065
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:36,060
My mission statement has changed a lot over the years and at one point and I do still kind of hold to it

1066
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:41,340
Is I want to do these kind of long form deep dives on games that would otherwise

1067
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,660
Probably not get this treatment

1068
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,980
I break out something big occasionally

1069
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:50,620
Because really I just kind of at heart of it. It's just pursuing what I find interesting

1070
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,020
but

1071
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:56,700
Stuff that's got less eyes on it. I'm just kind of drawn to that

1072
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,220
But ding ding

1073
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,620
What was that? I oh

1074
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:08,380
Oh, that was my computer for some reason that notification didn't go through my headphones. It's just

1075
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,020
Okay

1076
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,460
I just got I thought I just got cinema sins dinged for something. Yeah

1077
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,820
Oh my god, no, that's the mac text message sound

1078
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:23,180
Tom's nft is just minted. It was oh, you know, I've been working on it hard

1079
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,900
You know, I figured if I'm gonna make a big video dunking on nft

1080
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,540
The best thing to do would be to immediately launch one of my own

1081
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:36,540
It's like it's like it's like ironic, you know satire. Yeah. Yeah. I want to ironically get like 10 ethereum. It'll be good

1082
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,820
Yeah, um

1083
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,580
It was funny actually the year I did evo and yeek because that was in the same year

1084
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,500
A lot of games I did that year. I was picking as excuses to

1085
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:56,300
Again, there it is again. Tom. You're a madman. I can't stop it. I can't stop it every every time snake lies

1086
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,380
it goes ding

1087
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,420
No, come on. It hasn't been enough for that

1088
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,660
Okay, I'm good. Um, it's

1089
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,580
That year I was like I did the video on um, we the revolution I did that

1090
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:14,060
I was just kind of picking games that gave me an excuse to research external stuff

1091
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,540
Oh god, tom, please. I'm trying to mute it. I'm trying. I can't do it

1092
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,340
How could you not mute? I I don't know

1093
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,380
I don't know what angels you use

1094
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,460
I can't put the spoon. You got to flip it turnways

1095
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:33,740
You got to tip the take the volumes the volume knob and you got to flip it turnways

1096
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,980
Or not we could just keep dinging. Yeah, I'm fine with that. Yeah, we'll just pretend citizens is joining us

1097
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,540
I'm so sorry for that

1098
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:47,260
All right, I'm turning off playing sound effects. I don't know how to actually switch the fucking thing over

1099
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,060
Hey, that's my name in my series

1100
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:56,540
Huh playing. I don't know why I settled on that name. I think it was a real friday afternoon decision

1101
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:59,020
Hey, it works. It's not taken. Yeah

1102
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,940
Playing a game

1103
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:06,780
Playing a game and I feel it it was kind of like um, it gave it a sort of relaxed vibe because it's the kind of

1104
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,300
Even my try and go as deep as I want to on them

1105
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:15,580
I think it's it's meant to be something like a guided tour of whatever I'm playing and you know

1106
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:21,660
What what experience did I have along the way? What did I learn? What did I find out and what can I pick into with it?

1107
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:28,300
And that was with evo was fun because I like genuinely in the course of making the video

1108
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:34,380
I discovered the other one existed and yeah, I got it gave me an excuse to read up on you know

1109
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,260
Ancient creatures and all that and I have a friend who's really into paleons paleontology

1110
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,940
So that was fun

1111
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,980
I got to speak to her a lot about that and she gave me to yeah

1112
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:49,660
And I learned enough to make a bunch of really bad puns at least about creatures

1113
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,380
I I guess I won't specify

1114
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:57,500
Because I guess it's sort of I don't know I don't know if you can spoil like a like a review

1115
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,580
If you want to it depends I don't mind it being spoiled because I spoil

1116
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:08,460
I won't I won't I won't because that I like that video and the way the way that the other game ends is really

1117
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:15,180
Cool and it's like makes for like a cool the the ending of that game makes for a cool ending to the video as well

1118
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,740
Yeah, I I do think um a lot of my videos

1119
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:27,420
I feel very blessed in terms of um, what's the word for happy coincidences serendipity? I feel

1120
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,300
A lot of my videos just kind of come along

1121
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:35,180
There's a I'm always making a video and there is a point where I will learn something or a friend will say something

1122
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,420
and then it's just very serendipitous and it all kind of pans out and with the

1123
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:46,380
With the uh evo video there were two of those which was discovering the original game existed and it just

1124
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:52,060
Even though it's the earlier game it ramps up in such a nice way that I could put it second and just have a lot of fun

1125
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,540
with the better ending and comparing it back

1126
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,140
And uh working backwards to peppering jokes and like call forwards

1127
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,740
And it was also me and a friend are just the same friend who really likes paleontology and that

1128
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:11,020
We just finished the table. Tom. I got I got I got it. I gotta stop you. Tom

1129
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,260
Your typing is he's mincing. He's mincing so loud. Why?

1130
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:23,980
I hate everything. I don't I don't know if there's any way that you can we maybe get this this typing situation under control

1131
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,220
Can we brain it? I'll just type on my phone then

1132
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:31,900
Okay, I have I have a real life thing happening right now. It's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna multitask

1133
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,420
I'm rocking up. I'm rocking up. Eleazar cut this all out

1134
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:42,860
No, Eleazar keep it all in make me feel like an idiot duplicate it Eleazar just whatever you think

1135
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,180
Base boost his typing

1136
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:51,420
Whatever you think makes for the best listening if it like syncs up cool to like the the the the speech then do that

1137
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,460
Otherwise, you know have fun have fun, buddy

1138
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,900
It's like a it's like a drum drum roll for the speech but

1139
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,860
The second bit of serendipity was I was I think I was part way through recording

1140
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,700
Or I maybe hadn't just started. I can't remember these like Dave. I just finished

1141
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,340
I was probably through recording the second game and me and a friend had just finished a tabletop session

1142
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,620
And she said to me

1143
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,620
Hey, have you ever heard of spirit science?

1144
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,340
Yeah

1145
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,220
And

1146
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:26,700
Showed me we used to have a video about that on our channel. I didn't see I didn't see munchies pcp lecture until afterwards

1147
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,500
It's gone now

1148
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:36,140
Although it is still around it's still around on the internet in places, but we saw far channel

1149
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:44,220
But okay, and just anyway. Yeah, so so so we so we know about spirit science is what i'm saying

1150
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,660
Yeah, I don't I probably do not know as much as you I like watch that video

1151
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,980
And I I studied bits and I studied bits and pieces and just saw the correlations and

1152
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:56,780
I I'm it was a fun coincidence. I may have like with a year of reflection of thing

1153
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:59,980
It's the motifs of spirit science are repeated in a lot of

1154
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,780
new age shams

1155
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,780
um, yeah

1156
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:10,460
It was a fun coincidence to be able to kind of dig into and just peppering that little bit of the video

1157
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:16,460
I mean, it's it's it's more it's even though like a lot of that stuff is not unique to spirit science

1158
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:21,500
It's more fun to talk about spirit science in specific because everyone knows it and it's this

1159
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:27,260
particularly wacky yeah like a iteration of that sort of new agey

1160
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,540
Uh belief system. It's the potpourri

1161
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,620
Soup mix grind ground up everything's in here

1162
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,060
Yeah

1163
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:43,820
Yes, and also the fact that it's presented through a fucking extra credit squeaky guy youtube animated puppet man

1164
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:49,100
That is the most surreal part of it is that yeah, it's like why is this the form that?

1165
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:54,140
Yeah, putting a weirdly innocent squeaky face on it

1166
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:01,500
I don't know very very strange decision for like how you want to spread the word of your weird

1167
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:08,540
I do think it's kind of like the people who you know the the alt-right pipe line of people who do like friend like that creepy

1168
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,940
cutesy like we're friend is like

1169
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,020
just

1170
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,540
It could be like just making it

1171
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:20,140
You know defanging it out the gate to make it more presentable to some people. I don't know that's just like my

1172
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,940
my way of like it's I mean it sounds like like sinister or is it just

1173
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:29,980
Well, there is there is a question. There is a little bit of anti-semitism mixed in there as the

1174
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:34,700
It's it's it's a bit like it's that video is definitely

1175
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:41,260
Like those youtube videos are definitely meant to put like a friendly approachable face on like whatever the fuck this is

1176
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,060
They don't they don't say anything

1177
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,420
They don't in those videos. Yeah, they don't say anything bad about the Hebrews

1178
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:52,140
But the Hebrews are singled out as a particular group of aliens that has a

1179
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,900
That has an outsized like influence on like the course of

1180
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:59,980
Of human history. So like the door is open for something

1181
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:07,260
My thought is is is like i'm not sure whether it was

1182
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,900
like

1183
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,380
The the the the presentation was made cutesy for reasons of covering up

1184
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:20,620
What would be otherwise sinister language? I feel like the person who made that just likes that

1185
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,820
It could be they saw extra credits once and I was like, oh, I want to do that

1186
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:27,580
But with my thing it's tricky to it's tricky to discern intent

1187
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:33,820
Because essentially well, here's the thing. You know why like Nigerian email scams are poorly written

1188
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:39,660
It's essentially that they know they're poorly written. They don't want anyone who can suss that out

1189
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:45,020
They want the people they don't care if it's a smaller sample base. They want the people who will fall for the fall for the thing

1190
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:50,940
That's why they're very upfront with you know being poorly written because they don't want anyone who I just I'm just repeating myself

1191
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,980
You know the uh, you you might you might as well. You might as well

1192
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,220
You might as well filter out the people who are going to be like suspicious

1193
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:05,420
Essentially, yes, so you make yourself look as stupid as possible so that you'll only get the punters who are easily fooled by it

1194
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,900
That's a funny that's a funny way to think about it

1195
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,940
Like they just made it just made it down on purpose

1196
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,260
I heard that on like a scam baiting channel, but it makes a degree of sense and that

1197
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:20,700
Yeah, why wouldn't you want to filter out the people who are going to be difficult?

1198
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,860
Yes, yeah, I think so. I think so

1199
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,020
um

1200
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,220
It is a

1201
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,580
It is a

1202
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:34,300
I think I watched that entire video. It's like many hours long right the spirit science one

1203
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:38,700
Isn't it like six hours like the like the full human history one is like huge

1204
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,980
Yeah, I think the one I watched was only about an hour and a half

1205
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:47,500
I get a series right I got the easy right it is part of a series and I

1206
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,100
I jumped and I bounced between them trying to

1207
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,300
I was trying to grasp a

1208
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,300
Uh, I was trying to grasp what could be the

1209
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,340
The synopses of this and it's

1210
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:06,780
Hard to pin down especially with you know the person who who made it and it's a

1211
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,380
It's a blurry road backwards

1212
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:18,140
God, I'm trying to remember the name of the guy because it because it was inspired by some old grifter in the 70s who

1213
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,660
Kicked it off with some something by another name

1214
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:27,420
It's been it's been a couple years in the video and my specific deals. Yeah, that's the tragedy of

1215
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:33,020
Like the year I made those videos was as an excuse to learn a bunch of stuff and then my own

1216
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,980
Confounded memory made me forget a lot of it

1217
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:40,940
I am finding it funny though because now I'm thinking about the fact that I did the weed a revolution video

1218
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:46,300
And munchy also did the french revolution which I did catch and was very right

1219
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,740
That's right

1220
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,620
I think it's a real that's a really interesting game

1221
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,420
Yeah, it was fascinating

1222
01:19:55,820 --> 01:20:00,620
It's I feel bad for I have I have seen that one. I feel bad for a friend of mine because the first time I played

1223
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,700
I had a mate round and

1224
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:08,460
I think this is old let's play a brain of just I regret not recording us playing that game

1225
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:15,500
Because we had like some it would have been good banter. Yeah, and then I felt weirdly cynical about that afterwards

1226
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:23,260
The the you you review games that I've like never even heard of and I never would hear of

1227
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:28,300
Ever I think tech like when when be on on as it flame chase ma

1228
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,620
flesh flesh

1229
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:34,460
Chasmer, yeah, or chase chase ma as I like to call it

1230
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,940
Oh, yeah

1231
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:41,820
Well, that's that's just one I I've never heard of like neuro or whatever

1232
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:47,980
Yeah, that one I got from youtube pms when they existed. I did not find one by myself

1233
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:55,500
Uh, what's what's uh, I don't know. I guess like what's uh, what what's in a game that makes you want to

1234
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:01,020
Be like I want to talk about this game like what is it about the games you pick that are like this is like

1235
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:06,300
Why do you pick the games you pick? I guess when I figure that one out? I'll tell you

1236
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,460
Okay

1237
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,460
It really is just

1238
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:17,260
I I said before we started recording proper that because we kind of briefly touched on it, but I'm

1239
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,660
This is the first time in

1240
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:24,060
Years that I've had anything approaching a planned ahead schedule and it's just four videos

1241
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:28,220
But usually yeah, I will finish the video and I'll just kind of look around and I'll just think

1242
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,900
What do I want to do right now?

1243
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,580
And sometimes it'll sneak up on me sometimes

1244
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:36,140
I will just kind of pick something at random and then decide I'm gonna make this interesting

1245
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,380
It's gonna be it's like a challenge myself

1246
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:43,180
Sometimes another category that the well is drying but narc the one I'm doing next is one of those games

1247
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:48,220
What's the game that I played as a child and it's just kind of in the recesses of my memory

1248
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,300
but I never finished it because

1249
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:56,700
When I was a kid I had fucking weird taste and I would buy the strangest things and then just

1250
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,420
Never finished them and I'd come back to them years later because

1251
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,620
I bought I wound up buying a lot of russian jank as a kid because those games were always trying

1252
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:07,580
Because I wanted games that promised a lot of freedom and a lot of mechanics

1253
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,140
Even when in the early 2000s

1254
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,660
The the the trade for that was going to be the mechanics are going to be a little bit

1255
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:21,020
Not half baked just kind of not all the way there. I guess that's a distinction about difference

1256
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:25,740
But you know, but that just kind of led me into I'd see a game like boiling point in the back of the box thing

1257
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:29,500
Was look how big this world is and you can drive anywhere and do immersive stuff and it's like

1258
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,860
That sounded cool as hell to me. I like the freedom of it

1259
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:38,220
Or like gangline manager on gang and things like that. It's like, okay. Yeah, I I need to own this

1260
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,020
Gangland is a weird one. Yeah

1261
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:45,420
Watch watching you play that one in that video. I'm just I'm looking at that. I'm like

1262
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:51,660
I don't know who would make a game like this. I don't I don't I don't get it medium monsters would

1263
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,580
um, I guess so I I am kind of sad genuinely that the

1264
01:22:56,780 --> 01:23:00,140
The italian crime family the mafia crime family

1265
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,500
Genre isn't as big as it could be

1266
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,500
It's

1267
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:10,060
It could be a really fun simulation. I think but I guess it's really tricky because there are a lot of things

1268
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:13,660
You'd have to account for account for and it's a very different rhythm

1269
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:20,380
But the last game that we got in that vein was um, empire of sin, which was

1270
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,580
made by George Romero and his wife

1271
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,580
John Romero, right?

1272
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:33,980
John Romero. Yeah, that bad. Yeah, John. George Romero is the horror. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas John Romero is the uh

1273
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,740
Is the guy who's made you his bitch

1274
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:41,900
Yeah, right. Yeah, I think he just did now because of that slip-up. I think he

1275
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,940
Being beaten down right now

1276
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:45,900
Um, right

1277
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,420
But and that game

1278
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:50,860
I want to love it because I I kind of want games like this even though I

1279
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,100
As a kid I wasn't too big into gang stuff

1280
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,860
But now it's like I'd love a good simulation hat, but it's just very boring

1281
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,500
It's very artfully put together. It pays a lot of homage to the gangsters of the time

1282
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:07,020
It has the rope-iest Irish accent. I've ever heard in a game. I can't ropey

1283
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,500
I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1284
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:14,060
But it's uh, it's not doing it. It's it's just not there. I don't know

1285
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:17,580
Do they just they just haven't done the genre justice yet? I guess

1286
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:22,140
It's the problem is trying to figure out the fun in running a crime family because it's

1287
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:26,700
I guess on the surface of it. It'd be very slow very meticulous. There'd be a lot of rules of respects

1288
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:28,220
What is ometta?

1289
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:33,740
Not the game the literal code of honor, but you know, you know, how do you finally game by that?

1290
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,700
That episode of the simpsons

1291
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:40,940
I don't even remember what episode it is, but there's a little joke where martin prince

1292
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:46,220
He's playing he got a new video game, but it's the uh, it's the like game version of uh,

1293
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,780
My dinner with andre. Oh, yeah

1294
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:54,700
He's playing that in the arcade. Tell me more. Yeah, the the the three the three. Yeah, tell me more bon mort

1295
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,860
Like bon appetit

1296
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,020
That's good. Yeah, I think it would be really hard to find the fun on that and

1297
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,780
How much of a big audience would you have of people who really want an in-depth?

1298
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:13,020
Mafia simulation where yeah, you might have to go to a meet and pay respects and work your way up

1299
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:19,020
If I can surgeon simulate the physics trying to spin the spaghetti around your fork

1300
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:23,020
Oh, yeah, bring that to your mouth. Don't let any of it get on you or you just lose respect

1301
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:29,260
Don't don't let any don't let any source splash on the eye of your of your business partner

1302
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:34,620
Because then you'll get mad and you'll get a gun out. There's a soprano's uh video game for ps2, right?

1303
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:41,020
Is that any yeah road to respect it takes place between between seasons three and four or two and three and was based on a

1304
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,260
Storyline that got dropped from the show

1305
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:48,780
I wouldn't have that has anyone played that one. How does that one play? Is it just like a generic?

1306
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:55,420
I think only cybershell has played that game. Oh really cybershell the biggest soprano's man. He's a soprano's guy

1307
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:02,620
Um, I'm working my way through sopranos and I did I was on a stream the other day where I realized and I've still never seen it

1308
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:08,860
I was on a I was on a stream the other day where I realized and joked I should play that game when it's canonically accurate to the

1309
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,780
To the series

1310
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:13,980
It's like oh, well that was a great season. Just boot up your playstation too

1311
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:19,020
Just oh god. Oh, I really took a dive here. I need Tony's full story

1312
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:28,620
I like ps2 tie-in games to media franchises because it's like the the the area where they're just about getting

1313
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,540
photorealistic faces, but not like good

1314
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,460
They're just being able to like put a png of an actor's face onto a model

1315
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:39,180
And you just like okay, I can recognize who that is

1316
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,820
But it looks like shit

1317
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:47,500
Um, but that's the fun exactly ever there's like a 24 game. I played where it's like jack bowell's face

1318
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:52,620
But the gameplay was godawful. Have you just flying all over the place and getting shot

1319
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:56,700
It's like when you play the funniest one is uh the lord of the rings game

1320
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:02,220
Like the two towers or ps2 where they'd like shift from the movie and then try and recreate the frame in ps2

1321
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,620
And like back in the day is like whoa now you look at it. It's like

1322
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:06,300
Oh

1323
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:11,100
The I mean you could tell there was a difference back in the day, but it really just was oh my god

1324
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,860
I'm used to playstation one exactly so incredible and uh, I think I think tech's trying to access something

1325
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:22,700
It's it's it's okay. It's okay. I just don't want to talk over people. You know it is uh, no you got you got a battle for dominance

1326
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:28,940
Is how I know there's a it is that's how we do it. Have you ever played have any of you ever played enter the matrix?

1327
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,500
Yes, yes

1328
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:37,660
That game multiple times as a kid xbox. All right. So yeah, I'm playing through it right now for reps to gog, right?

1329
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,580
And um, yes

1330
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:44,300
So the thing is the thing with enter the matrix is that it's a tie-in game to the movies, right?

1331
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:49,740
But it's it's 100 canon and they got like act they filmed actual footage

1332
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:55,820
Of the actors from the movies for the game. So there's like there's live action cutscenes for the games

1333
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,980
I'll really fucking dark by the way

1334
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:02,300
And then it'll switch it'll switch to the in-game models that look like shit, but um

1335
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:11,180
It's it's like the apex predator of of movie tie-in games because it gives you like crucial plot information that you won't get in the

1336
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:15,660
Yeah, it's reloaded. Like I was watching the it's like it's like the kingdom hearts chain

1337
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:20,380
Is it like the kingdom hearts chain of memories of uh, of uh, yeah, it's it's like that

1338
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:25,420
It's like that like level of crackheadedness, but for like a matrix video game

1339
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:30,780
And it's like 45 minutes of new film scenes or something crazy like like

1340
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:36,300
It's like you don't play as like nioh or whatever, but they got like kary and moss and shit

1341
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:43,820
For for like yeah, it's like the two side characters that like briefly appear in yeah ghost may have to play on both because they have

1342
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,300
slightly different stories

1343
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:50,140
Yeah, I was I was trying to see if I could get away with just playing as ghosts

1344
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:53,100
But I think I'm gonna have to I'm gonna play as nao. We just uh

1345
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:58,780
Just to say I did it wouldn't be it wouldn't be right. I thought fucking having the uh, this

1346
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:02,940
Rise of Skywalker event in fortnight was bad back in the day

1347
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,300
We had 45 minutes of an entire movie in a shitty video game

1348
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:15,260
Yeah, I mean you you'd be watching uh, the matrix reloaded and you wouldn't know you wouldn't know how uh, naobie got the uh

1349
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:20,540
Got the oh my god. What the fuck was the name of that stupid ship from uh, that like

1350
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:27,740
Nebuchadnezzar not the nebuchadnezzar or the logo so the the ship that gets like destroyed in one of the animatrix, uh

1351
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,380
Movies that is basically delivering

1352
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:35,260
Was it was it was it called the was it called the sargon of a cod?

1353
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,820
You know, it should be it should bend that joke

1354
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:49,500
Wait, I wait no, do I have like a foggy memory that like there is a ship called that it's somewhere in the I don't think

1355
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:57,180
It's within the theme. Yeah, it would it would there would be okay. It makes sense. But yeah, there's like a

1356
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:04,540
They like get they get like some message like a distress signal or whatever from a ship that's supposed to alert zion

1357
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,460
That the machines are have found their location. They're attacking them

1358
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,580
And that's like the whole impetus of like the matrix revolutions

1359
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:16,780
But they don't tell you any of that in the movie the only reason I figured that out was because I happened to watch the animatrix

1360
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,140
Another tie-in that is tech that is cannon

1361
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,180
Oh, man, it's cool

1362
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:27,500
I think I watched the animatrix and I don't remember anything. It's really good at all

1363
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:34,300
I remember the one like main story that goes through it of like how actually the machines got kind of fucked and humans

1364
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:37,100
So I was like, you know what that's some really second renaissance

1365
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:40,220
Yeah, my 13 year old brain is down with this shit

1366
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,940
Mmm

1367
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:50,460
It's like society. It's genuinely cool. Even if um, that's a dangerous word even if reloaded and revolutions like kind of suck but

1368
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:56,700
Uh, the world and like the the lore and the the world building and stuff are like really really

1369
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,420
Uh, interesting in the matrix

1370
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:03,980
I'm not I'm not gonna spoil it. But um, who here has played uh, path of neo

1371
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,140
I've not played that I want to I heard it like when it came out

1372
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:12,700
I heard it was like actually pretty good and everyone's like, oh, this is way better than enter the matrix actually

1373
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:14,940
That's what I heard too. I'm looking forward to it

1374
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,260
What is path of neo?

1375
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:20,300
It's like I think it's a game that just follows the movie story

1376
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,420
It's like and you play as neo and you fucking beat the shit out of dudes, right?

1377
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:29,580
Oh, yeah, it's the whole trilogy that kind of condensed into a video game and it's a decently fun, uh, brawler

1378
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:34,380
And I was gonna and I don't know if I'm not gonna spoil but now I'm not even gonna do my very light

1379
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:37,740
Nudge and wink spoiler if I now I know someone wants to play

1380
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,220
Yeah, I

1381
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:44,540
It goes places. I was gonna see how much that game costs on ebay for xbox right now

1382
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:50,380
Uh, it I got it. I got it on ps2. I like a local game store for like 15 bucks. It's not

1383
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:56,060
Uh, that expensive. Oh, sorry. They're 14 dollars. I got it for 14 bucks

1384
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,660
14 dollars for xbox. That's not bad

1385
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,300
Maybe I'll buy one

1386
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:07,980
I will say my one weird bit of matrix game trivia that is like not really a spoiler

1387
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:14,780
But also just kind of viscs. It's funny. There was a matrix mmo that was also canon and orpheus dies in it

1388
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:18,780
Yep, there was a matrix mmo. It was it was

1389
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,180
It's you know what you know what?

1390
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:25,900
That's pretty cool. Actually. It's like, yeah a matrix mmo would be canon

1391
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:32,140
Uh, and matrix was an mmo. Yeah, like movie. Yeah, that seems really thematically like and good

1392
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:37,820
I have a disc copy of it. You can't play it anymore, but I I had the matrix online

1393
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,140
Um

1394
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:44,300
Awesome. I didn't play many. Awesome kid. I had I had that one

1395
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,900
You know what better than wow? I said

1396
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,300
Let's go

1397
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:56,780
Uh, hmm, I I bounced off of final fantasy 11

1398
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:02,140
After a while and that was about it. I uh, it's all about final fantasy 14 now

1399
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:07,500
I had star wars galaxies, which was way too complex for me. You know who messaged me

1400
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,300
You know who DM'd me on twitter the other day?

1401
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:18,620
After after getting embroiled in another argument with one of these weirdos who insists that there's nothing political about the plot of one piece

1402
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:24,220
In which the literal final bed the literal ultimate antagonist is the government

1403
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:25,980
um

1404
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,340
one of

1405
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,260
None other than maryweather

1406
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:33,580
Popped into to weigh in a little bit on that and then he he DM'd me

1407
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,500
Afterwards to tell me that I should really play final fantasy 14

1408
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:43,580
Because it's cool and good and it's got a free trial up to level 60, but that's what he said

1409
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:50,140
He all he he didn't say the exact copypasta, but he I mean he delivered all the all the basic information

1410
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:58,780
Contained there and I have my husband is playing final fantasy 14 literally right now in the other rooms. Oh, they managed to

1411
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:00,700
sound

1412
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,260
I yeah, they've been able to do it

1413
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:11,260
I uh, I had my group's tabletop session cancelled this week because of ff 14. So I hate that damn game

1414
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,300
No

1415
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:18,220
Bullshit, it's bullshit. That's un that's unacceptable. We have to hold no

1416
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:24,620
It's your fault. It's your fault for not joining them in final fantasy 14. I tried. Okay. This is the pettiest damn thing

1417
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:28,060
I'll ever say I'm just not an mmo guy, but I played it for half an hour

1418
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,220
And I stopped and I'm gonna admit this is on me. This is just me being a dumbass

1419
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:37,340
I just said I'm sorry mate. I can't do this. I hate how everyone is dressed in this game

1420
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:42,620
That sounds that sounds like uh like one of those

1421
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:50,140
Iroly things that like whenever someone says that the designs in final fantasy 10 are dumb. I just get mad

1422
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:56,220
You know, I like how people are you talking about the npcs? Are you talking about the uh the player character?

1423
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:57,580
I hated everyone

1424
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:01,980
I walked into a room and a lot of fells started getting sassy with me and I'm like

1425
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:04,220
I don't feel like this

1426
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:10,620
It was entirely petty I was not an mmo guy

1427
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:16,780
Yeah, it wasn't not my jam. So but I've been taking the piss out of a friend for liking ff 14

1428
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:20,300
Just for the sake of it for years and you know what that was ammo

1429
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:28,220
Good my stupidity and pettiness is ammo. I mean it's it's not that petty because like i'm an mmo

1430
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,500
You play for hours if you don't like the look of your character

1431
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:37,020
The hell's the point in being there? I suppose but no, it's just i'm just saying you know my dislike of it is

1432
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:42,140
Serious, it's just an ongoing bit for years that has become steadily more internalized

1433
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,940
People make fun of me for liking water warcraft

1434
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:52,540
Uh because of the giant shoulder pads and no other. Well, I like the giant shoulder pads

1435
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:57,100
I want them to be even bigger actually. No, it's silly. They think they're so cool

1436
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,980
Just like dragon balls you with all the spiky hair. They're dumb

1437
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:04,700
They're not cooler than me think of think of all the storage you could put in those giant shoulder pads

1438
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:10,700
Why why the why isn't it there like five stuff where containers where they're organs built into each one?

1439
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,900
Where are the pockets? I

1440
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:18,220
Look seeing a world of warcraft guy with huge shoulders oof her poor bag

1441
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:29,340
I'm just thinking does that guy have any cartilage left in his knees. That's too heavy. No

1442
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:33,740
No, he's just very strong. He's so fucking strong

1443
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:38,060
Look, I don't play video games. I don't he's got a sword the size of the earth

1444
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:44,860
I've just been sitting here. I've just been sitting here gathering gathering of stuff for my topic

1445
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:49,340
Yeah, because I've had since since the month started 1st of december

1446
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:54,220
Shit happened and every day there's been some crazy shit happening to me most of it bad

1447
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:59,180
Um, so to start with I don't have it. I lost my job

1448
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:01,740
And it's not like

1449
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:04,940
Oh, I don't get to go to McDonald's anymore like go whatever the fuck no

1450
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:11,580
My job was working for pencil mation one of the largest animation channels. I was gonna ask if that's the job you were talking about

1451
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,660
Yeah, what happens they have

1452
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,060
All right, so for people who don't know pencil mation

1453
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:22,380
Is like a animation series about a stick man who walks around on a piece of paper and there's a pencil that draws things

1454
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:27,260
And he interacts with it. Wait, wait, sorry, uh, is my is my cameo still gonna make it in

1455
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,740
Yes, I was gonna get to that

1456
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,860
So I I watched the first episode of pencil mation

1457
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:42,300
In 2007 I was a little boy and I made a fan of your job. I just wanted to see my face in the show

1458
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:48,460
I'll get to it. You gotta be patient then I can't I can't I have tell you this story

1459
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:52,940
I'll kill you wait. I said I have a lot of patience before so I gotta I gotta do that

1460
01:37:53,740 --> 01:38:00,300
Okay, well anyways in 2007 I saw it and I was a fan of it and I made like a little fan animation

1461
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:03,820
Back fan that I still have and I forgot about it for years

1462
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:09,660
And then in 2016, you know, like or no 2017 2018 like 11 years later

1463
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:14,060
I got a message from tr or y the famous my little pony porn animator

1464
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:19,020
I'm saying that they wanted to hire him as a director, but he didn't feel like it

1465
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:23,740
So he was just telling other people he knew like who did animation if I'd be interested and I said, oh sure

1466
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:28,780
And then I realized I got the job and I realized afterwards it was a thing. I was a fan of as a kid and that was cool

1467
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:30,620
um

1468
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:35,420
Well, the reason I got laid off is because a lot of people got laid off a lot of people

1469
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,980
Um, are they downsizing?

1470
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:45,580
Yeah, okay, so kind of funny. Um, I looked up pencil mation so I could grab screenshots of all the cameos I've put in for pcp things

1471
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,500
Because now what I'm no longer working there. I no longer care if people know what I did that. I used to be very secretive about it

1472
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:58,220
Funny thing is I looked them up and the two results I see are at the end of pencil mation and a graph going down

1473
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:02,060
Basically, what's happened is the youtube for kids

1474
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,580
designation has completely screwed them over

1475
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:11,900
Instead of getting like 10 to 20 to 30 million views per video putting out free videos a week

1476
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,180
They are now getting like 50k views

1477
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:19,740
Whoa, okay, because of an out an algorithm change

1478
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,700
Well, okay, so

1479
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:28,140
You as four kids it was the four kids destroys your ads and fuss your search ability

1480
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,420
Right

1481
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:36,300
It's it's a bit more complex than that. So originally, um, only like one or two videos were getting flagged like every couple months

1482
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,300
They weren't getting flagged that much

1483
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:42,620
And they managed to avoid the four kids thing by saying no animations for everyone, you know

1484
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:44,700
It's not just a baby thing even though

1485
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:47,580
There to be fair it was mostly kids watching their stuff

1486
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:52,780
But like they were trying to like avoid it because they didn't want their ad revenue getting cut down to like 10 20% of what it was

1487
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:59,660
The problem is is because most of our audience were genuinely kids and the episodes were not appearing on the kids app

1488
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,460
Where it was getting used more and more. Um, their viewership

1489
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:08,780
Um was starting to go down. Um instead of getting like regularly like 20 million views a video

1490
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,500
They were getting like one or two million which is still good

1491
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:15,260
But like for how big the team was they they were like just scraping by

1492
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:16,860
so

1493
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:21,020
They noticed on a couple of the videos that had been automatically flipped to four kids

1494
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:26,460
They had a resurgence in views shortly afterwards like we're they're getting 10 20 times the viewer count

1495
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:30,860
So even with the loss in it like ad revenue like, you know percentage

1496
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:33,420
The added views were going to add up to more money

1497
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:36,380
So they thought maybe we just need to bite the bullet and switch everything

1498
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,780
And they did about a month or two ago

1499
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,900
And it worked for a while as in flagging it for kids

1500
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:46,620
Yeah, they they intentionally flagged for stuff for kids. If you do it intentionally you can switch it back anytime

1501
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,700
It's only when youtube does it that it's permanent

1502
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:51,500
So if I get it did that as an experiment it worked for a bit and then

1503
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:57,100
Suddenly like a flitch a flitch a switch was a flitch a flitch swept. Yeah

1504
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:04,940
Like internally somewhere at pencil mation, um at youtube. Sorry and just overnight it just went to nothing

1505
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:08,780
And I've seen this happen before it happened to my old channel nightfall studios

1506
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:11,980
Why did that happen though?

1507
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,700
According to

1508
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,780
Ross who again, he has like fucking crazy. You mean you mean of game brumps?

1509
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:23,580
No, no of uh chris farms. No ross ballinger

1510
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:30,700
Of pencil mation. He's a cool guy. Oh, okay. He was he was gonna fucking just two russes in animation. I can't believe it

1511
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:35,660
Impossible impossible. He's not even made of rubber. What the fuck how did that happen? But

1512
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,020
According to him the algorithm

1513
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,020
Oh, I got it. No, I got it. I got it

1514
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,660
Rip rip to the podcast

1515
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,380
It's uh, I'm sorry

1516
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:53,180
What he's what he's heard from his deep state connections at youtube is the algorithm has like a good video switch and a bad video switch

1517
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,740
Or maybe a good channel switch and a bad channel switch

1518
01:41:55,820 --> 01:42:01,260
It'll just decide channel bad and just fuck them over this happened to one of my old channels

1519
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:06,380
I don't use it anymore. Um, but we had a video on there that was yeah nightfall studios

1520
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:10,940
We had a video called a cult classic. It was a my little pony animation. I did

1521
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:12,620
um

1522
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:18,860
Which is probably one of the probably the best video I made it used to get about 20 000 views a day consistently for years

1523
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:22,780
And then like instantly in a single day a day pretty much

1524
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:24,620
um

1525
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:27,260
And then instantly it dropped to like

1526
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,980
50 views a day like

1527
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:34,860
Like instantaneously because youtube said video bad flip the switch

1528
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:37,980
I think apparently internally apparently that's how it works at the time

1529
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:41,180
I didn't know what it was. I thought like they just decided to blacklist it or something

1530
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,980
It's a thing that can just happen to channel sometimes

1531
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,420
And it happened to them and so they had to

1532
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:53,020
They they were just like fuck we we have to scale back and so pretty much everyone was like go

1533
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:57,340
I I'm not I'm not worried. I got good severance pay. I'm gonna be fine. Like we have

1534
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:01,740
Enough in savings to coast by for like a year. So I'm just gonna be working on my patreon and stuff

1535
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:07,260
Um, and I'll probably end up making a lot more money by the end of next year. So it'll I honestly with

1536
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:12,300
It's good. I'm kind of glad it happened. That's what Trixie said and look what happened there

1537
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:17,020
I was oh, yeah, but I'm I'm smart of in Trixie though. It'll be I'll be fine

1538
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:20,620
I'm privating all of my porn drawings in three weeks

1539
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:23,020
Save me now

1540
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:28,620
Now's the time for me to make my porn drawings even more public because I don't have to worry about it being associated with me

1541
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:31,500
You're working for a channel that does kids entertainment

1542
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:36,060
Um, anyways, so I'm gonna I'm gonna show some of the cameos I've done

1543
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:43,420
Uh, this episode, uh on on this frame. There's like there's a give and take drop face. It's very hard to see

1544
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:45,980
It's at like one percent opacity

1545
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:49,180
I have a dark inversion. You can sort of make it out. It's like

1546
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:54,620
Oh, yeah, it's big if I have to like lean my head way back and I can sort of see it

1547
01:43:55,180 --> 01:44:01,980
Yeah, um, there's another one in this episode for one frame and uh, there was like a cloud smoke cloud

1548
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:04,060
I put one in the corner

1549
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:09,740
I put a number one on a painting at the end of this episode

1550
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:12,540
They're all in the background

1551
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,060
Dude, I fucking love the bra. I fucking love the bra

1552
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:21,980
When when Gib drop that video years ago, I thought it was the best video ever and like all the comments were

1553
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:26,220
Oh my god, you you lazy. Why are you making such a lazy review of my little pony?

1554
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,220
With like jesse

1555
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:36,780
No, no, no, this is when I was starting to be like, uh, jeez making a video every week sucks. I don't like it's boring

1556
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:43,100
I'm just talking about pony show every time. So I started to fuck things up. I I decided to draw my pony

1557
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,180
uh, like

1558
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:48,060
avatar really really badly in ms paint

1559
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:52,540
And bruhp was just one of the drawings, but there was a bunch of them. Oh, yeah

1560
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,500
Explain the plot and I talked in a silly voice

1561
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:02,780
That was a good video. I remember that it was episode with the I don't remember it was the one of rarity getting the green

1562
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,820
evil thing whatever the hook

1563
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,660
The evil the evil jewel or whatever

1564
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,740
She got like the the evil

1565
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:16,300
Book that gave her like green magic and she was doing a bad thing. I don't know. I love that video

1566
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:20,380
I love I thought it was the funniest thing and everyone was like hating on it at the time

1567
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:26,940
So I and I always like fuck you bruhp is good. You guys are shit. So I have a I have an emotional connection to it

1568
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:34,220
Um, but I didn't do any cameos for a while because I was working too hard. Um, the workload got crazy in 2019

1569
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:39,500
You'll notice in the first two videos. It's just like very simple. No backgrounds. It's just a blank

1570
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:44,940
Paper texture and then in the next one. It's like a full-on painted background with a million characters

1571
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:47,580
Yeah, that was during 2019

1572
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:51,980
They started making the episodes way too fucking ambitious and it was like really hard to keep up

1573
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,060
And this episode the one with the Ben st. Cameo where you're shoplifting in a market

1574
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:59,900
Oh, my god, you can look at it's not I don't think the episode's out yet

1575
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:05,420
There he is. I animated that it's just barely it's just barely me

1576
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,980
yeah

1577
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,260
so

1578
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:14,140
That episode took two years over two years to complete when other episodes take just a few months

1579
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:18,140
Yeah, 2019 like we were way too ambitious when we scaled back

1580
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:23,820
On how complex the episodes were but yeah, that was one of those but yeah in total

1581
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:31,820
97 episodes that are out. I've like directed either entirely or I directed part of them and it's like another

1582
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:37,580
13 or so episodes that are unreleased that'll be finished by the remainder of the team at some point

1583
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:40,780
So like 110 episodes total pretty cool

1584
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,540
um

1585
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:46,300
I'm I'm proud of what I've done there and I'm glad to be moving out

1586
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:50,780
But yeah, those those are some of the pzp references. It's possible. There are more that I've forgotten

1587
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,220
But I'll let you know if that ever if I ever find them

1588
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:00,940
Literally epic. I was gonna say it's epic. It's not there's no other word for it

1589
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:06,460
Uh, I mean, how many views did you get on the you haven't like millions of views on the uh?

1590
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:11,100
Is it the cum zone video not the one with the with the pcp logo?

1591
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,940
Yeah, the cum zone video has like welcome to the cum zone

1592
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,340
Yeah, the first one has like 11 million views

1593
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:24,220
Pretty good. Um, the the cuphead animation has like 90 million views that I put all the pcp stuff in

1594
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:26,540
Hold on

1595
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:30,940
All I have to do is search cupheads sort by most popular and it's like the second result on youtube

1596
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:34,460
Spare some views sir, please

1597
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:37,820
91 million views. Yeah

1598
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,660
with the

1599
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:42,140
This little hypocrite. Why not a hundred? Yeah

1600
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:46,220
Um, it'll get there. It still gets views pretty quickly

1601
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:53,260
My videos my my lectures, uh, they took a dip. They've been taking a dip by the dip views recently

1602
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:55,660
No, I can't

1603
01:47:55,660 --> 01:48:00,060
But they're down. Yeah, they they they are getting less views than they have in like in like years

1604
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:05,740
These past couple months, you know, we had the big bump with the uh when I released sonichi 102

1605
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:10,460
And I thought that would give my channel a boost and for a while it did but no, it's down lower than ever

1606
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:15,420
I'm a bit down. I'm a bit. I'm a bit cheesed about it. It's not good. But that is cheese

1607
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,900
I was um, I need to

1608
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:24,140
Animation youtube gets more screwed than anyone else unlike when youtube changes something or other

1609
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:29,980
Yeah, yeah, the only reason pencilmation was able to succeed is because they did reruns

1610
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:35,100
Um, when they uploaded a video like the first five minutes would be a new episode

1611
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:40,140
And then it would be 40 minutes of reruns of old episodes. That's how they got the watch time up

1612
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:41,500
right

1613
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:45,900
That was the only way they were able to succeed which is technically like breaking youtube's rules for like, um

1614
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,300
what's it called like

1615
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:51,340
Uploading like re-uploading like the same content over and over

1616
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:56,460
But I guess they were just skirting by on like a technicality. It's technically different content. So they were fine

1617
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:02,140
Oh, yeah gives youtube any respect. They don't respect the people who actually play post there. Yeah, no

1618
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:04,940
I mean, I mean if they were getting away with it

1619
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:11,740
Last time I calculated I I went through and manually added up the view counts of every pencilmation episode

1620
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:16,780
I've done and it was close to a billion views like two years ago. Nice if I'd um

1621
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:20,860
If I included the fact that my episodes appear on reruns

1622
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:25,340
And I have like almost a hundred episodes pretty much every rerun would have something of mine

1623
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:29,900
So I'd be multiple billions of views at this point if I could fucking calculate it somehow

1624
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,940
Incalculably high

1625
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:38,140
Yeah, I need I need I need like a tool that I can like just input like a hundred like youtube links and it can just

1626
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:42,060
Spit out the total view count for all of them because he's doing it manually fucking sucks

1627
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:44,940
subconsciously suggested to potential billions

1628
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:48,940
Yeah, and yeah the pvp. Yeah

1629
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,420
It's we have to how are we got to flip the switch?

1630
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:55,020
We've got to say the code word to like flip the switch to activate them

1631
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,660
in the minds of the masses

1632
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:04,380
Oh a little the little all hail plankton helmet that's being strapped into their head except it's been sainte

1633
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:12,220
Maybe it's me, but does anyone have a feeling like get get get in is getting a step closer to an insanity every video

1634
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:13,980
He makes I mean I still like them, but man

1635
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:17,660
What a shift started as an assembly of different opinions on a particular episode

1636
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:23,100
Then moved into a sort of not so serious review then stuff and now we're here man the pony

1637
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:25,740
The pony youtube

1638
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:30,700
Comments the kind of people who were leaving comments on pony youtube videos were

1639
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:34,620
They were a different they were a different breed simply build

1640
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:38,380
They're the they're the they're the people who analyze the analyzers

1641
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,940
That over

1642
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:47,020
Massacre show. So I'm not in I'm not in on brony stuff. I in a brony. I don't know about it, but

1643
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:53,580
This is a fucking thing. I thought it was a joke for the first three years. It was happening. I thought it was an ironic bit

1644
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:57,100
Yeah, definitely started is that right?

1645
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:04,780
It I assumed I assumed it was until until I started finding some of the fan stuff and being like, oh, no

1646
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:09,980
No, this is this is sincere appreciation. I'm seeing okay. All right. It was a weird

1647
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:13,020
What I first thought but I was thinking like

1648
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:19,100
This show I saw was like a youtube poop of it. It was like there's no way this they like this show

1649
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:22,620
I thought it was an ironic thing and also a porn some clips of it

1650
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:28,140
Some clips of it. I was just like, oh, that's cute. Maybe I'll look at it. Maybe I'll see for myself

1651
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:35,180
Biggest mistake in my life. Absolutely. Look look where it's led you here. This cursive play

1652
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,500
This is not coming ironically

1653
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:44,780
Huh, if you'd ever what if you I don't want to repeat came on ironic

1654
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:56,700
Well, hey oblivion fall sorry to hear yo that you got fired

1655
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,740
Oh gross for gross misconduct

1656
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:06,700
Gross for sex for sexual harassment. I'm sorry here. You got fired for sexual harassment. Anyway moving on to the next

1657
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,340
topic of discussion

1658
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:11,340
Yeah, no, that's no, that's a bummer

1659
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:16,380
But the next the next topic is plagiarism. Oh, all right

1660
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,540
This guy

1661
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:23,900
I want to I want to talk about something else. Um, that's been happening to my friend recently. She's an artist

1662
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:28,700
She has a she has a character that she uses to represent herself. It's like a hold on. I

1663
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:32,700
Wait, I had a fucking no, I closed the folder. I had it all open a second ago

1664
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:38,380
This situation is really funny. It's not just like, oh, you know, just artist dramas, but it's the fact that

1665
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:40,140
like

1666
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:45,980
People are defending something that is so obviously stupid that I can't wrap my head around so like

1667
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:49,180
Hold on. That's loading up an image

1668
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:54,460
So that's like some drawings like of my friend's character that they did over the years

1669
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:57,020
They're like a black cat

1670
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:58,300
like

1671
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,300
spooky monster thing

1672
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:03,420
And they've drawn like probably like close to a hundred images of them

1673
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:05,820
It's like an overcat

1674
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:11,500
Yeah, she's like a cat wolf thing and sort of like hybrid. It's hard. I don't exactly know what she is

1675
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:16,140
It reminds me of uh, that uh, that thing in the um,

1676
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:19,900
This is gonna sound bad the thing in the wall review

1677
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,620
Lucy lace maker

1678
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:25,660
Little white rat the nostalgia critic

1679
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,500
Fills me with the urge to decapitate

1680
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:30,780
That creature

1681
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:33,820
I'm sorry to think and I will let you go back to I just want to bring up that

1682
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:39,100
The other day because I heard about from me. I watched the nostalgia critic sailor moon review

1683
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:43,740
Which has an extended aside on age of consent laws in japan, which oh, I know

1684
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:49,100
It's true though. Wait, is that a new video or is it?

1685
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:53,740
No, it's a few years old. It's old. It's old. He's like at this age

1686
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:57,580
You can have a blow job, but you can't touch a vagina at this age

1687
01:53:57,660 --> 01:54:01,660
You can like he's like he's just going into the technicality for like 10 minutes and I'm like

1688
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:08,300
It's like he's stuck on it and he says one sense and I knew it was coming because like we've been told about me

1689
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:11,260
Everyone was like, okay, doc. You said the thing you can move on now

1690
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:15,020
And then he just keeps fucking going for multiple minutes

1691
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:16,780
okay

1692
01:54:16,780 --> 01:54:20,780
And he's like genuinely just like elaborating like the legal system

1693
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:27,500
He's trying to make a genuine point about and then at the end the funniest part the punchline of all this is kind of

1694
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,540
It ends on

1695
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:34,780
And that's why when I put sailor moon whatever on my sexiest character's list. I didn't know

1696
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:44,220
It's like, okay, dug that is genuinely the funniest joke you've ever written and you did not mean it that way

1697
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:47,020
Yeah

1698
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:53,580
I'm really sorry twins were up. So he got flak for that back when he made whatever that that list

1699
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:58,540
Oh the sexiest characters. I'm sorry twins right like an actual topic with that

1700
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:01,500
Was he like was he like thinking about this for years like oh god

1701
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:05,980
I've got to have to I'm gonna have to address this somehow. He probably I bet he was I bet he was yeah

1702
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:11,260
It was yeah, no the uh an airing of the grievances was the primary motivator

1703
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:15,020
I guess behind the nostalgia critic sailor moon review because

1704
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:21,340
The rest it was even worse than a usual nostalgia critic review in terms of just airiness and emptiness

1705
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,740
Yeah

1706
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:28,860
I mean it sounds like it was worth it though. That's oh, yeah, no we were me and I've watched through every

1707
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:32,540
nostalgia critic film more than once with different friend groups because

1708
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:38,780
Oh film. I thought you were gonna say every review. No, no every review. I'm not like I've watched every nostalgia critic review

1709
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:45,100
No, just the films just just the films and they are I've actually never seen a single one of the films

1710
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:52,220
Uh, they're they're a good drunken with mates watch if you're all in on the bit of how weird and bad nostalgia critic is

1711
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,180
I've I've heard a lot about them

1712
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:59,020
But I never watched like I'd never watched uh like uh

1713
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:06,060
Like that guy with the glasses content in its heyday. So I'm not like I wasn't invested in the characters

1714
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:09,020
I just know about them now as like. Oh, yeah that weird

1715
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:11,820
diaspora of people that that all came from

1716
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:17,020
Guy with the glasses like linkara and and uh, Todd in the shadows and Lindsay Ellis and all these people

1717
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:22,300
Every time they're all just mingling every single time juwari always on screen. It's harrowing

1718
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,460
You just kind of got to think about it

1719
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:31,260
Like damn there he is. Okay. He he's the guy he committed suicide, but did he also have some like sexual assault

1720
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:34,540
Sexual assault allegations come out after the fact. Yeah

1721
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,900
Yeah, I don't know exactly the extent of it, but uh

1722
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:41,100
everyone was

1723
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:43,100
Everyone was like they at first

1724
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:48,780
Suicide obviously everyone was very sad. Yes, and then they learn about that later and they're like, uh

1725
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:52,780
I've got to delete all of my sad things. I said

1726
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:56,940
They couldn't because I love all my loving all my loving tributes to juwario

1727
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:00,060
Yeah, that's why I love lull

1728
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:02,140
lull

1729
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:06,220
Anyway, what were we talking about something? We're talking about the plagiarism thing. I was gonna get into that

1730
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:08,940
Yes

1731
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:12,460
Yeah, so anyway, they've had this character. They've had this character for like a couple years

1732
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:16,860
Um, and one of their artist friends who was a much bigger artist really liked the character

1733
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:22,140
They they were simping they were simping hard. Oh my god. She's so cute. I want to cuddle. I want to sex. She's so great

1734
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:24,460
And my friend, you know told him well

1735
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:31,660
It's too bad. My character is a lesbian lamal and he oh no cry emoji that does make that is very upsetting

1736
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:39,100
It is very upsetting Frank. I don't know what I would do in that situation. Lose lose my mind. I assume this fictional character is a lesbian

1737
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:44,620
Yeah, yeah, so he drew um a lot of fan art

1738
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:49,020
Initially and because he really liked the character and he was really into it

1739
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:54,060
So he drew a bunch of fan art that was really good. He's a really good artist. I think um

1740
01:57:54,620 --> 01:58:00,860
And he drew that for like for out 2020 for about a year. He was drawing fan art and that's the images on the left

1741
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:05,260
And all of a sudden he had a new o.c

1742
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,380
That he started drawing afterwards

1743
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:15,580
That he claimed. Oh, no, this character is different. This is completely different. This isn't the same character or they look nothing like

1744
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:20,540
And it's they look pretty so they look pretty

1745
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:26,300
On the right. Wait a minute. That's the other one. Wait. Wait. Okay. The one of she's peeking out the wall

1746
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:29,020
That's the same drawing

1747
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:33,260
Yeah, that is the same drawing well spotted then he was literally the same drawing

1748
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:38,220
That that drawing that drawing that's not the same drawing one of them has a speech bubble

1749
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:41,180
Yeah, yeah, you're right. You know, she has a picture

1750
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:47,340
See he insists. Well, well like her personality is different. See my version. She's straight

1751
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:52,940
She's not as tall, you know with all the all these images or there's no background. You can totally tell how tall she is

1752
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,300
um

1753
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:57,340
Okay, and like and he insists that there's a bunch of differences

1754
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:01,420
But they're all differences you can't fucking see because they're things that aren't being drawn at the time

1755
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:07,660
Um, and yeah that one image that is identical. He sent that to my friend in 2019

1756
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:13,340
Like as as like a piece of fan art he was working on two months later

1757
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:16,300
Someone wrote a fanfic based on his fan art

1758
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:17,980
where they like

1759
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:21,900
Made them straight and stuff and then the remainder of his art was of

1760
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:26,380
The character from the fanfic of the fan art that he was now

1761
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:28,300
drawing

1762
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:31,820
Fan art of a fanfic of his fan art of my friend's character

1763
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:36,220
And saying it was no longer the same character even though the design was identical

1764
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:38,860
Okay, and he then

1765
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:41,020
A year later

1766
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:43,020
It's confusing

1767
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:49,180
Just just really to get around that lesbian roadblock by any means necessary it seems the any means necessary

1768
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:52,460
He added he basically just yeah, he added a speech bubble to the image post

1769
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:55,420
Posted to his twitter a year later and said it was his character

1770
01:59:55,980 --> 02:00:01,660
And so like we tried working things out with him like in dms like saying hey, maybe you could change the design

1771
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,700
Maybe you could put stripes in her hair. Maybe give him a hand

1772
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:08,780
Okay, okay, okay. So so the is the is the problem just like

1773
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:13,180
He's basically using the character. He's using the design

1774
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:16,140
But calling it his own character is the idea like

1775
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,180
I don't want you using that design because it is so

1776
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:22,220
Like it much it'll be confused for mine

1777
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:28,060
Yeah, and also the fact that he was like using the character for like straight things and my

1778
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:32,460
Friend is lesbian and was uncomfortable with it because it's like a character that represents her

1779
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:38,620
And also they were just friends and she told him like that's an extra degree of discomfort. Yeah, yeah

1780
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:43,500
Maybe I'm being like and for like a year she was asking him to change the design and he was like, oh, yeah

1781
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:46,780
I'll get to it soon. I'll get to it soon. Um, actually, can you like drop it?

1782
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:53,100
Um, uh, like I thought I thought like those just like those damn plebe and the wee blu rays. Oh, I'll get to it soon

1783
02:00:53,180 --> 02:00:57,340
Oh, when are we gonna go? Yeah. Oh, I did nobody bought me a burner burner though

1784
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:00,380
You should try sending this guy a blu ray burner. See if that helps any

1785
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:02,780
Yeah, so

1786
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:05,580
Eventually it went dark for four months. Wait. Wait. Was it was snake?

1787
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:09,740
Yeah, it wasn't like a thing. It was like I'm being maybe I'm being maybe a little naive about this

1788
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:11,020
But it was just like

1789
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:15,180
Really love the character and maybe I'm just not key to it on how much it's they're gonna share this thing

1790
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:17,180
But why didn't he just do this for himself?

1791
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,420
the character

1792
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:20,700
I don't

1793
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:23,580
I don't really get it. It seems it seems like the motivation on like

1794
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:29,020
Like you can make the odd just why spread it around at that point artists are vain

1795
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:34,860
This can confirm can confirm. Okay, right. Yeah. I'm not in on yeah

1796
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:40,620
I'm just being I'm naively asking. I just it seems like to me if you wanted to like keep this

1797
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:45,420
Going the simplest solution would have been to just be like, you know

1798
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:52,220
Do what the porn artists do and be like your sexual orientation is whatever I feel like in my art and just go hand my

1799
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:55,020
My feeling

1800
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:59,500
Okay, I I'm getting the feeling that this is like what this is really about

1801
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:06,380
Is like a like weird control thing like I want this part like it feels like it's just like crossing the boundary

1802
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:07,900
into like

1803
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:09,900
This is about the artists

1804
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:15,420
If it's because it's because it's because it's because it's because it's her character

1805
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:24,780
If I don't really consider this character, I like effectively becomes what I want it to be because I control this narrative now

1806
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:29,020
I I just I could see that being like a thing because like maybe

1807
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:33,820
They go to this artist. This is maybe they know it's the

1808
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:36,620
representation the artist draws of themselves

1809
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:41,980
And then he says oh, I want to cuddle that or I want to like is it that like

1810
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:44,700
Yeah, it's like a maximally of like

1811
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,340
The affection for the creator

1812
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,900
Because that that takes it to a level of

1813
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:54,060
Mm-hmm. It definitely that is definitely a bit of a weird thing

1814
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:57,820
I I would not like make an argument based on that, but it is a no

1815
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,860
Not accusing just speculating

1816
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,500
Yeah, I know I know I'm aware

1817
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:05,340
Allegedly

1818
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:11,100
Yeah, like we've been we were trying to work this out for for like a year and he just stopped responding for four months straight at a

1819
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:16,220
Certain point, so he made a call-out post which anytime someone brought it up on his twitter. He would just hide the reply

1820
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:18,860
Um for like a week

1821
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:26,140
And he just wasn't talking about it. So then they filed a dmca on a couple of images to like just get his attention and also because

1822
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:31,100
We think it we read up on like how dmca works and like if you think you have a copyright claim

1823
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:35,980
Which we think is valid you can do that and then he like came out and was like, oh, well

1824
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:39,340
Well, the characters are obviously different. They look nothing alike

1825
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:44,300
And also you don't even know your own character because

1826
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:50,780
In in 2019 you said they were this tall and a couple years later you said they were like a few inches taller

1827
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:55,100
So clearly you're dumb and don't know what your character is. He was like trying so hard to like

1828
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:00,060
He was just trying so hard to like deflect everything and his I saw yeah

1829
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:01,340
Yeah, he's right

1830
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:07,260
And it was I saw your post where he tries to argue that they're not the same character based on and I like the really flimsy stuff

1831
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:13,260
Like the different like foot anatomy when like even when he even when he draws the the original character

1832
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:17,900
He draws them with that same foot. It's not like a character thing. It's just like the way he draws feet

1833
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:19,500
Yeah, exactly

1834
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:24,140
Like I have received a lot of fan art of my character and everyone draws the horns differently

1835
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:29,100
On on my character. She's like a demon girl people draw the horns differently all the time and probably because like

1836
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,100
um the way they

1837
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:36,460
Look at the reference. Maybe they misunderstood the reference images I have or maybe if they just like drawing horns a certain way

1838
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:41,340
Um, it doesn't mean it's a new character all of a sudden that's theirs that they can claim as their own

1839
02:04:41,900 --> 02:04:43,900
um

1840
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:48,940
Let me stop unless I'm a bit maybe though like but what if I want your character to be

1841
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:52,140
Is your character by?

1842
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:57,500
My character will fuck everything. Are they gay? Okay. What if I want them to be I wanted to make them an insult

1843
02:04:57,580 --> 02:04:59,580
Yeah, I want to make them an insult

1844
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:06,860
My character is literally unfuckable. I there's cannot be fucked under no circumstances

1845
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:10,460
But it looks exactly like what's what's her name? What's the character's name?

1846
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:14,140
Let it did something not lydia. What's her name?

1847
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:18,460
Lydia from breaking bad literally unfuckable. No, not no

1848
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:24,620
Oh my god, dude. She's so hot oblivion fall. What's her name? What's your character's name?

1849
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,220
stevia

1850
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:34,620
Are you can you hear me? Yeah, are you are you asking me a question? Yes. Yes. Oh, no, no, no my character's name is

1851
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:41,420
Is is fallia. Sorry. Oh fallia fallia. Okay. Well, my fallia. This is my fallia is is just

1852
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:47,820
Is just gross is ugly looks the same but mine is ugly and nobody likes her mine is infallible

1853
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:55,340
And you can't have a copyright claim because uh, you've drawn her with differently sized boobs in the past

1854
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:57,740
Sometimes you draw them really big and sometimes you draw them

1855
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:00,620
Even bigger than that

1856
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:01,980
Yeah

1857
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:06,220
So clearly you have no consistency and you can't have a copyright claim. Yeah, it's basically

1858
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:09,100
It's obviously different. Yeah

1859
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:13,580
It's it's it's spelled the same but mine is pronounced failure and failure

1860
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:21,100
Is a is a fake fail failure is a z z z cup and fallia is only a y y y

1861
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:23,820
Failure is what I am. Oh why?

1862
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:27,260
Uh, okay. Anyway

1863
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:29,580
failure

1864
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:32,140
That's my yeah, that's mine. She can't get laid

1865
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:36,460
Amazing dark dark mirror

1866
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,500
whole version

1867
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:40,540
so

1868
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:43,500
Yeah, this guy seems like he wants

1869
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:48,540
To have his fucking way with it. He wants to have his way with this cat girl

1870
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:57,740
We just if that's if that's if that's the goal though, why not just be like

1871
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:02,060
Fuck what you want. I'm gonna just draw her

1872
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:04,860
Regardless of whether you accept it or not

1873
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:06,700
Because like

1874
02:07:06,700 --> 02:07:08,060
Isn't that what she's doing?

1875
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:12,860
Well, no, no, no, I mean it's just keep doing fan art however you want, you know

1876
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:16,460
Like regardless of what the intention of the original creator is

1877
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:21,340
It seems like I feel like this might have been done to try and mitigate controversy, but this only

1878
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:27,580
Is worse. It's worse because you're not just like you're taking a character on top

1879
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:31,500
Putting it in this situation the artist doesn't like you're like doing two things instead of just one

1880
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:35,260
Uh, it seems like a very poorly thought out plan

1881
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:40,220
I I guess it's like I guess maybe he just he's just so compelled by this character

1882
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:43,420
But it's like, but I would write I would make this character different though

1883
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:48,860
But isn't it strange that if you're compelled for the character you're you're now arguing that the character is different

1884
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:52,940
So like by your own definition, you've kind of like moved your own goalpost

1885
02:07:53,260 --> 02:08:01,100
It's like having enough shame to not just make a carbon copy of that character that is just named differently, but not having

1886
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:08,060
It's having too much shame to god. I'm getting this backwards there. Let me work on this. Give me give me five minutes

1887
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:13,980
Too much too. No, you're right too too much shame to just admit it. Yeah

1888
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:17,500
You have enough shame to have started and gone this path

1889
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:22,620
Right, right like a weird level weird in between of shame

1890
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:30,300
Yeah, I feel I feel like you could have just gotten away with saying. Yeah, I I I draw your character and I made them straight

1891
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:35,340
Yeah, I you wouldn't really need to say that you can just commit to the bit

1892
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:39,500
And then and just say just say in your own in your own art like people go to your page

1893
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:42,540
I see your art and then you say fan art of this oc

1894
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:48,780
Then people will there's nothing to worry about people go to the actual artist to you know, you know, you know what?

1895
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:52,940
You know what? I'm gonna go to bat a little bit and say that in this scenario

1896
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:56,060
I think that would be fucked because this guy is a bigger artist

1897
02:08:56,300 --> 02:09:02,220
I think it would be a little fucked for a bigger artist to take the oc of a smaller artist and make like fan art of them

1898
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:09,020
That is like well, correct. There's there's no good move here. I think what you're talking about like the less

1899
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:12,380
This thing is kind of what matters because just a kind of thing on it

1900
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:16,380
I don't know how much of your friend has put in their character, but

1901
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:21,580
If any of themselves is in that character that still is kind of fucked up to do to someone

1902
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:24,940
That's that's definitely the most fucked up part. True. Yeah, I

1903
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:28,620
I really think okay. I really think that like yeah what you're saying tom

1904
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:31,340
Like just like just draw fan art and have it be whoever you want

1905
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,460
I would say yes

1906
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:35,740
If it were a small artist doing that to the character of a bigger artist

1907
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:41,420
But for a bigger artist to take the character of a smaller artist and draw art of them doing things that contradict

1908
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:43,740
The power dynamic like what the creator thinks about them

1909
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:49,900
I don't like my my brain and I think that's my brain is going to like people doing like fan art of tracer

1910
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:55,180
Like fucking dudes, even though she's like canonically a lesbian, but like obviously the scale is much different in terms of like creative

1911
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:58,460
But who cares who cares what blizzard right?

1912
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:03,420
Yeah, yeah, I'm just I'm just surprised like this guy didn't just take that

1913
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:09,660
Avenue, you know like it's still wrong, but I'm just surprised going this extra step and causing extra controversy

1914
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:15,820
It seems extra stupid and correctly to just make the same character again and just say yeah, I do

1915
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:18,060
Actually, this is mine

1916
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:24,700
All right, I'll say it to the artist who is definitely listening. Um, you're not actually you're not actually banging the character you want

1917
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:26,780
It's it's not that one

1918
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:29,340
Please

1919
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,420
Please stop edging right now

1920
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:32,940
Just

1921
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:36,620
This is like this is like that episode of the future drama. This is like kid Napster

1922
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:39,260
Oh god is yeah, hell yeah

1923
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,660
It all comes back

1924
02:10:41,660 --> 02:10:43,660
The episode's come full circle

1925
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:49,580
If he he should he should he should put the character on the blockchain. He should mint it as an nft

1926
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:53,660
Oh, no, no, no

1927
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:57,900
Why why not why not there's no rules to get my legal fund made up

1928
02:10:58,780 --> 02:11:00,780
ready to go

1929
02:11:00,780 --> 02:11:03,900
Gonna sell nfts for that to fight that dmca claim

1930
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:10,860
Oh, I can't say the hairstyle of a character is based on my friend's real hair. That's definitely one thing

1931
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:14,220
Based indeed

1932
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,860
That's what we like to call in the business weird champ

1933
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:26,700
My friend told him if he changed the hairstyle like like months ago

1934
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:29,740
My friend told him like maybe he could just change the hairstyle and put like a stripe in it

1935
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:33,900
And yeah, it would be and he didn't do it you could you could you could totally

1936
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:38,780
You could totally just change the hair and like most things could stay pretty much the same

1937
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:42,540
You would only need to make minimal changes. I mean not not to shit on the character design

1938
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:49,580
But it's like not generic, but like it's non-descript enough that a small deviation like that is all the plausible deniability

1939
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:53,740
You'd need I do actually genuinely like I said give him a hand. It's just a power thing of just not even

1940
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:57,020
Not even conceiving something that yeah

1941
02:11:57,740 --> 02:12:01,900
It's it can't it's gotta be it's about the fact it's about like this

1942
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:08,140
It's about where the character comes from. It's not about the design. It's about like this is this character specifically

1943
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:11,740
He spent a year drawing

1944
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:16,380
He spent a year drawing fan art of the design and then a switch flipped and he

1945
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:19,260
Spent another year drawing it as his own character

1946
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:23,020
Like the timeline is just switched

1947
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:29,900
He's put in the work. He deserves this character. I think you're right. You know what it changed my mind. I changed my mind

1948
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:32,300
He earned it

1949
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:34,300
Oh, no, I think I think

1950
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:38,700
10 grand 10 grand or so. You know transition of power

1951
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:42,540
You know his money where his mouth is

1952
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:50,220
Actually, maybe your artist should make an nft of this character and then have this guy buy it make that joke. Oh, no

1953
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:56,460
I'm sorry. I'm sorry the blockchain is a revolutionary technology

1954
02:12:56,860 --> 02:13:01,740
For just such now now we can settle disputes like this before it was all he said she said now

1955
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:05,900
We can just we can just refer to the blockchain and understand ownership

1956
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:07,260
You don't own this character

1957
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:11,580
You just own a receipt that says you own the character and that's the best you can really do

1958
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:15,500
If you have a receipt the beepers at the store don't go off and you can leave

1959
02:13:16,460 --> 02:13:18,460
Hmm

1960
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:24,460
Oh like shoplifting. Oh like shoplifting like I did

1961
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:27,180
in that one video

1962
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:31,500
That oblivion followed me and then that I did it in pencil mates. It all comes back together

1963
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:35,820
It's all tied together. It's all true in a spirograph of meaning

1964
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:38,300
Uh

1965
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:44,140
It all wraps around. Yeah, it's a spiral. We've all we've all we've wrapped all the way around. We've come 360

1966
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:47,740
I guess anyone got any more uh shit. They want to bring up

1967
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:53,260
My topic feels or wait. Are we are we done on are we are we have we said all we can have to say about uh

1968
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:59,900
Missy I feel like we could head into voicemails soon ish. I uh if anyone

1969
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:04,780
Huh, I'm just glad my topic was so shit and I'm glad we can avoid it

1970
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:08,220
I know wait

1971
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:13,900
Say it. Did you know it? Oh wait? I would oh wait. You didn't say it yet. No, um, but we we skin

1972
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:18,700
We like we have to cross it. We surfed over it basically

1973
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:23,260
Oh, we got it. We got to dig deep. We got to dig deep on the start. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't realize

1974
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:28,380
I was gonna my intro to it was basically you know how

1975
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:32,460
When you when you kind of mentioned, you know, you can bring whatever topic you want and I

1976
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:35,420
I was working on watch dogs legion video

1977
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:39,340
So I like barely had time to think and then I I finished it. I was like, okay, I gotta get back to then

1978
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:43,740
I said to the message and then I apologetically say I've got um, I've got a topic

1979
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:46,620
But it's shit and you say I'll out be on brand and I'm like, well

1980
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,620
Yeah, yeah

1981
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:54,460
You said well, I'm dead like it was you said it was shit and I'm sure and I'm sure it's been talked about before

1982
02:14:55,020 --> 02:15:00,300
And I was like that's that's completely on brand fresh and I was like, well shit now. I better not think of another topic

1983
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:05,020
I better just commit. I'll be sure to I'll be sure to go in saying it shit

1984
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:09,260
And my topic was just gonna be and also at the time I thought it would be like

1985
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:13,020
Even keel 50 percent american 50 percent british

1986
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:16,860
But now we're massively outnumbered because it was

1987
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:21,900
Because it was being it was being british on the internet. It was

1988
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:29,180
The perception of being a british person and then I thought about that because I was playing not so good these days

1989
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:33,180
I was just thinking like being british on the internet is a weird mixed bag

1990
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:36,860
Because it's because we get if you're doing youtube videos

1991
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:42,140
You just get a leg up because the accent makes people think you're clever no matter what yeah

1992
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:48,780
Yeah, that's the weird thing with me though is like people can't tell that I have an english

1993
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:53,980
I don't know what accent I have. It's definitely informed a little bit by

1994
02:15:54,940 --> 02:16:01,820
Americans talking on video. Yeah, and I've sort of adopted some mannerism. So people think I'm not british

1995
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:06,060
You got to lean into it more. That's that's the power you you don't know if that's true

1996
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:11,180
You and snake in my opinion and everyone can disagree if they want but in my opinion like

1997
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:15,420
Neither of you have what I would consider to be like a very like

1998
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:21,820
Like stereotypically or like very like obviously british accent. I'm like a stereotype is like a posh

1999
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,860
Wanker

2000
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:27,180
From the victorian era

2001
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:33,100
You sound exactly like what I think of in my head when I think of a british accent. It's funny because when I

2002
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:36,060
This is gonna sound really weird. It's like

2003
02:16:37,820 --> 02:16:39,500
I used to have sorry

2004
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:43,340
I used to have a weirdly set dislike of other british people on the internet

2005
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:48,940
Especially when they leaned into it for points or they like I am the british game rubber

2006
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,940
It's like fucking have a personality

2007
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:57,660
It's just don't yeah gaming brit and and uh total biscuit had like the the cynical brit

2008
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:03,260
I've actually met the guy in real life. I like both of those guys

2009
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:08,060
I mean, I guess it sort of makes sense because on the internet your voice is so important

2010
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:11,420
So like if you're obviously british, I guess maybe you got to lean into it

2011
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,820
a little bit maybe

2012
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:17,260
The thing I didn't like about those is that I think it's just sort of a

2013
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:20,380
If you wave the flag and you're like

2014
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:22,300
I'm proud of my country

2015
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:27,820
That's sort of like an american thing to wave the flag constantly and to be like hey look at what my nationality is everybody

2016
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:30,140
That's sort of like a thing that

2017
02:17:30,140 --> 02:17:37,020
You don't do all the time. You do that when you you know as a special occasion. Oh the queen's getting another divorce

2018
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:39,100
I don't know

2019
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:45,980
In my mind like even british patriotism has a an angle of shame about it from what I've seen

2020
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:51,740
Yeah, as it's there's always like a I love my country, but we're a bit shit and that's

2021
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:58,540
I something fun. I'm always I don't think that people who exploit being british on the internet really do

2022
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:05,740
I saw something I saw like a tweet or something that was like, uh, like yeah, like amer- american nationalism is like

2023
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:11,740
We love guns and god and we love our greatest country in the world and and british nationalism is like

2024
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:15,660
Yeah, it's shit here and that's just how we like it

2025
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:21,660
That was that was like a lot of the humor when I was growing up was like every comedian

2026
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:27,980
The most pro british thing would just be a love of how shit we are as a doing things. Yeah

2027
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:31,740
There'll be observational stand-up comedy about like

2028
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:37,580
Uh, I know all those other countries. They're doing all this and we're over here and it's shit and oh

2029
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:42,540
We're standing in queues. Why do we like queuing as a nation? That's stupid. Ha ha ha

2030
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:48,540
That's what it's like being british. I have heard I've heard a few different places

2031
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:53,020
And I think this is really funny that apparently there is a certain uh attitude

2032
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:58,380
In canadian politics. There is a particular, uh, what's the word? Um

2033
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:03,500
Fixation or phobia of like not appearing to american

2034
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:08,460
Like if you say if you say anything that sounds like too american, it's kind of cringe. It's like

2035
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:13,260
Like there is a lot of like there's a lot of very like similar

2036
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:19,180
Like nationalist and like like uh pro like trump. It basically trumpism sort of attitudes

2037
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:21,820
Like they have it in canada as well, but they can't

2038
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:24,540
Like say it that way

2039
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:27,260
Because if you phrase it if you phrase it as like a pro trump way

2040
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:31,740
That's like american and like you don't want to be seen as like being a big america stan

2041
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:36,300
He's it's it's it's it's look down upon in canada. They really

2042
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:41,500
They really want to have their own identity like we're definitely we're not america. We're not just america's hat guys

2043
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:45,660
We're we're we got our own thing going on. We we're under the queen over here, right?

2044
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:50,060
Yeah, they uh, now i'm imagining blackface over there. Yeah

2045
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:55,100
Trump would never do that. Come on trump get the blackface out. Show us what you're all about

2046
02:19:55,180 --> 02:20:01,580
He could he could he he just he just runs he just puts on blackface makeup and runs in canada and replaces trudeau

2047
02:20:02,460 --> 02:20:04,460
Because they just love it so much

2048
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:10,780
That's our prime minister right there. He's like pretends he gets he he loses 2020 so in 2024

2049
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:16,460
He decides no i'm not gonna run against joe. No i'm not gonna run against kamala. No the kamala p tickets too strong

2050
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:21,500
No one can beat it. Hey, I'll run it. I'll run in canada. I'll run it. It's unstoppable

2051
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:26,460
It's an unstoppable combo. You can't you can't beat it. Uh, so i'll run in canada instead

2052
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:29,980
I I could do I could do blackface like it worked for that other guy

2053
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:33,900
You know what they say black is the new orange

2054
02:20:41,980 --> 02:20:43,980
Oh my god

2055
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:47,820
It's all downhill from here. We can't we can't stop that

2056
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:50,460
Can't keep getting away with it

2057
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:52,140
uh, the

2058
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,220
Oh, you were gonna say you smashed into something

2059
02:20:54,940 --> 02:21:02,140
I I smashed into boris johnson. No, I nearly smashed into boris johnson ones and like like in your car took him out

2060
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:05,020
No, uh on foot. Oh, okay

2061
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:09,340
Like I almost ran over. I was gonna say if it was your car like you should have gone for it

2062
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:12,380
I mean I was on foot and I should have gone for it

2063
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:15,180
Ruck be tackled in fair enough

2064
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:19,820
I I used to volunteer with a group called, um

2065
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:22,380
Good gym and it was

2066
02:21:22,380 --> 02:21:24,060
It was this weird mix of like

2067
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:29,980
Exercise jogging and charity work. You would like jog to a place and like volunteer there for an hour

2068
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:33,660
And then you'd jog back and you'd do that every week in different places

2069
02:21:34,220 --> 02:21:38,060
And over christmas we had um we had a thing a homeless shelter

2070
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:45,420
And fucking boris johnson was there with his press team and he was just like pretending to look like he was getting involved

2071
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:50,380
Like they'd film a shot of him, you know at the counter or just in the kitchens doing something

2072
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:54,300
While we did do all the actual work like we had been jogging for an hour at this point like we had

2073
02:21:54,780 --> 02:22:00,300
I had done two tasks that day one of them was like carry like jogging with a backpack full of fucking tinned food

2074
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:04,140
Like two kilometers across london to move it somewhere else

2075
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:08,940
And then we had to jog there and then we got split into groups and I decided i'll go to the homeless shelter

2076
02:22:09,580 --> 02:22:11,580
That was something outside

2077
02:22:12,460 --> 02:22:18,860
And then we were told hey boris johnson is here and we're all getting roped into being in a fucking advert for him

2078
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:23,100
So you were you were just there as like you were just there on your own

2079
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:28,460
Uh as a group good gym was a group thing. There was about 10 15 20 of us. Okay

2080
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:31,660
And like we were we were there to just actually volunteer

2081
02:22:32,060 --> 02:22:37,420
I'm kind of annoyed for several reasons which the primary one not just politically is just that

2082
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:40,860
We were actually there to try and help and we were on a limited time

2083
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:44,780
So why are we being roped into being a background shot for this cunt? Yeah, like

2084
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:49,660
But but we were and I just let's just figure out. Fuck it. I'll be on I'll be on tv

2085
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:53,340
I guess I didn't really put together at the time be on tv for this guy

2086
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:56,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2087
02:22:56,540 --> 02:23:00,780
Yeah, and the the shot they wanted planned was hey, how about we tie it in with good gym?

2088
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:05,580
We have boris standing in this lobby. It wasn't actually a lobby. It was a kind of

2089
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,900
Subterranean area

2090
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:14,140
Uh while all you guys come running in through the door and you run past him like you coming in twos one of you runs left

2091
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:16,140
One of you runs, right?

2092
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:22,300
It's the problem. This is so fucked up. They just like hey you guys you got to be in a you got to be in a commercial for the president

2093
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:30,140
What the what the fuck he wasn't he wasn't uh prime him at the time prime in oh right he was

2094
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:35,180
Um, you know, he was pre prime in but he's he's there now

2095
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:37,500
and

2096
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,500
Uh, so here's the problem

2097
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:42,620
Well, there's many problems, but here's my physical problem was the

2098
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:49,020
The area outside the door was actually just this tiny little alleyway because it wasn't really a an entrance exit

2099
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,740
It just led out into this little subterranean area beside the building

2100
02:23:52,460 --> 02:23:56,860
You could barely stand shoulder to shoulder, but we had to jog do a 90

2101
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:02,300
45 my under bad angles. We had to do a hard turn into the building

2102
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:04,060
and then

2103
02:24:04,060 --> 02:24:07,500
Go up a step then jog in and jog to the side of him

2104
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:14,460
I did not quite have the grace of foot to do all those motions. Was he jogging or was he just standing there?

2105
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:21,020
He was just standing there while we all jogged past him. I get in missed the step. I'm like stumbling and they made you exercise too

2106
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:24,220
I'm about to take a hard step

2107
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:27,900
And this was actually when I was more fit. I've been out of it for a while

2108
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:29,900
This is when I was like jogging all the time and

2109
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:32,460
Actually taking care of myself

2110
02:24:37,820 --> 02:24:42,140
And like I stumble and I'm about to like I'm about to eat shit really bad

2111
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:46,540
And then I I reach my arm out to grab something and I feel I feel something and my

2112
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:50,460
You have almost moments in life where the world goes into slow motion

2113
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:52,540
and you think

2114
02:24:52,540 --> 02:24:57,500
What oh, I know who that is. I know what I'm about to do. I'm on camera and I just

2115
02:24:58,460 --> 02:25:00,460
Using everything just right myself

2116
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:02,620
Run past the thing

2117
02:25:02,620 --> 02:25:08,220
Probably looked really clumsy. I've never looked at the footage. I've never so you were so you were about to trip and fall

2118
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:10,540
And collide with Boris Johnson

2119
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:12,620
But you yes

2120
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:15,340
But I wrongly saved myself

2121
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:19,420
The one time to not trip and hit Boris Johnson

2122
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:24,700
Yeah, I should have gone all in. I should have bought the first gave him a little donkey punch. I don't know

2123
02:25:25,660 --> 02:25:27,660
You should have pinned him to the ground

2124
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:34,860
I'm like you should have tripped and like accidentally grabbed his like boom like oh my gosh. Oh, no

2125
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:37,100
He's like

2126
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:41,100
You should have had a you should have had a piece of toast in your mouth while you were running

2127
02:25:42,380 --> 02:25:45,580
Oh, yeah, it's to have a lovely romantic one. They call him senpai

2128
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:53,260
The you know this reminds me what is the prime minister or not the old joe san can't be this cute

2129
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:57,660
Oh god

2130
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:05,020
What's up oblivion I was just saying this reminds me of a time that I had an encounter with the prime minister of new zealand

2131
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:07,180
um

2132
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:11,020
You guys you guys have a prime minister. What the fuck? I never see the president

2133
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:18,700
All right, so in in 2005 prime minister helen clark came down to otago university for some of that otago university

2134
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:21,580
No otago

2135
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:24,460
Enroll me, okay

2136
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:28,780
Okay, my dad my dad was doing his phd at the university. I was I think I was home school at the time

2137
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:32,380
So I was just they just took me to university with them and it was cool. Um

2138
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:37,500
I it was fun. But yeah, the prime minister was coming down my parents, um

2139
02:26:38,060 --> 02:26:42,140
You know weren't politically aligned with her. They were part of a peaceful protest

2140
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:46,620
Against something. I don't know. I was too young to like really know what it was about. I was like 10

2141
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:49,180
um liberal or something

2142
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:51,580
I don't know. Um

2143
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:54,380
My my parents are like

2144
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:56,780
Right leaning

2145
02:26:56,780 --> 02:27:03,260
For new zealand standards, which is like dad centrist for by american standards. I don't know like a bernie sanders type

2146
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:05,820
Yeah, yeah, maybe

2147
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:10,620
Yeah, um, but but but anyways, um one of my parents friends, um

2148
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:15,420
Glenn had a printout of the prime minister with like horns like

2149
02:27:15,900 --> 02:27:20,460
Talking and like nerd speaker some shit and I I had one of these and I she walked past

2150
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:22,140
I held it up to her and I was like screaming

2151
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:24,940
And she just waved and smiled at me and walked by

2152
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:28,140
And then later that day, um

2153
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:32,540
Like she was on camera talking to press my mom was in the background holing up a speeding sign because um

2154
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:37,020
uh prime minister helen clark had recently like been caught speeding like

2155
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:43,420
Driving way over the fucking limit and she was like, oh, I'm gonna go see a rugby game or some shit. Um, and my parents

2156
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:46,780
I guess they just thought that was really funny. So they made like a fake speeding sign

2157
02:27:46,940 --> 02:27:52,220
And it's made out of like paper like not like your regular printer paper, but that really like flimsy packing paper

2158
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:55,020
Um, they just yeah, okay

2159
02:27:55,660 --> 02:28:00,780
Cabinet minister pete hogson like grabbed my mom and like pulled the sign out of her hand and threw it to the ground and like

2160
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:03,180
yelled at her and it was caught on camera

2161
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:10,220
And then how fucking funny if i'm if america was like a tiny little island and like sometimes you would go to like

2162
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:16,220
You would go to one of these things and like, I don't know fucking, uh, uh, uh, who is the who is the like mike

2163
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:18,220
Pence just like tackles you say

2164
02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:21,100
Hey, yeah, what are you doing here? Get out of here

2165
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:22,860
No, the police got involved

2166
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:25,820
My mom was on the fucking channel free news to talk about it

2167
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:27,660
I think that was um

2168
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:29,980
Like a year ago when I mentioned that my parents would be on the news

2169
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:32,540
I think this was one of the incidents that was about where bite

2170
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:35,740
They sent an interviewer to a house to pre-record the interview

2171
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:40,780
But then they played the videos of my mom's pre-recorded interview and pretended it was a live thing

2172
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:43,420
Um, yo, yeah, yeah

2173
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:45,420
Yeah

2174
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,660
Yeah, I think that was related to that but

2175
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:51,420
I just remember that that happened

2176
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:53,900
um, I I generally don't remember much about

2177
02:28:54,540 --> 02:29:00,380
The political ramifications ramifications of anything back then that my parents were involved in sure, but um

2178
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:03,660
Funny stuff

2179
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:09,420
Uh, guys, I need to go. There's a prior engagement. I I forgot about

2180
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:12,620
But uh, I thought it was a good episode

2181
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:15,900
Hell yeah, the snake where it was nice to meet you. It was very nice to speak to you

2182
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:20,620
And uh, yes, goodbye everybody. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. See you and bye

2183
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:25,900
She said that she had a thing to do in the morning and she was going to be back

2184
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:28,860
For the evening and that's why we moved the time later

2185
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:34,220
I wonder if it ended up changing so that she had to do it later and maybe we should have done two things to do

2186
02:29:34,780 --> 02:29:37,420
Maybe there were two. Maybe there were just two things too. Yeah

2187
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:40,700
Hard hard to imagine

2188
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:43,500
But I guess yeah, two things in one day two things in one day

2189
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:47,820
Can you that's that's too much? I don't know. I'll be some people have all the luck

2190
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:51,340
I'm up here trying to scrape up one dang thing to do in a week

2191
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:54,220
geez louise

2192
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,780
uh

2193
02:29:56,940 --> 02:30:00,540
Things to do as I go you got it. You got to make your own fun

2194
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:06,300
I uh, all right. All right, so we have been going for two two. We're a 240

2195
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:11,020
Uh, I feel like there's 240p. What shut up

2196
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:13,660
um

2197
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:18,220
Is there anything else? I like any other urgent matters to discuss before we move on to uh

2198
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:24,940
To uh, all right that that talk about being british went on longer than I thought it would I thought I had like one thing

2199
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:31,420
And it was just a bit a thing of I stopped playing up being british online. It's really annoying

2200
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:38,780
You're making us look even worse. We can bring any topic of every last little bit of gold that's there. It's we're good at that

2201
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:44,460
Had a hundred and ninety something episode two hundred and ninety something episode wherever the fuck we're at. I don't even know

2202
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:46,620
We've been at it a while the

2203
02:30:47,660 --> 02:30:53,900
Nations nations will fall and uh history will turn the winds will grind

2204
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:59,100
The sand the desert sands will grind the the the mountains down

2205
02:31:00,060 --> 02:31:07,420
To to flat planes and and and and the and british people will still be playing up how british they are on the internet

2206
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:11,660
Uh for cloud besides anything else. I'm half irish, so

2207
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:17,100
Hey, i'm a quarter. Hey, i'm a i'm a quarter irish. Nice to meet you brother

2208
02:31:18,700 --> 02:31:20,700
Fellow mick

2209
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:22,780
Well, you can I guess you can say it

2210
02:31:24,140 --> 02:31:27,900
My dad used to I don't know if my dad would slap me. Maybe maybe not

2211
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:32,460
All right tv show called

2212
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:38,620
The the mick uh, it was on uh, I think it was on fx or something. Hmm

2213
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:43,740
Was it about is it not is it not as bad of a word as I thought it was?

2214
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:49,980
I i'm gonna be honest. I don't actually fully understand how bad it is. I just feel

2215
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:55,340
I kind of thought I kind of thought it was a pretty nasty, but I don't know. I mean I imagine it's been defined

2216
02:31:55,340 --> 02:32:01,020
I don't think it's a reclaimed word or anything. I mean i i'm i'm just i'm just fucking plastic you can

2217
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:06,380
You can call I mean you can call nalleners kiwi, and that's fine, right

2218
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:09,420
Right

2219
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:15,680
Uh, you love it. You love it. Yeah, I do. You're stroking yeah

2220
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:17,960
Yeah, good, okay.

2221
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:21,840
I've got a quarter, I've got a quarter of Scott in me,

2222
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:24,240
but I don't just flippantly use jock.

2223
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,880
So I think I've put the arbitrary cut off

2224
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:29,160
at being half something.

2225
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:31,560
Jock, is that a Scottish thing?

2226
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:34,520
Yeah, that's a derogatory term for a Scott as a jock.

2227
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:35,360
Oh, I know that.

2228
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:36,200
What?

2229
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:37,040
I've never, no.

2230
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:37,880
Yeah.

2231
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:40,840
It's not just like the football chat and the music.

2232
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:43,220
You literally called yourself a jock earlier,

2233
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:45,120
but you were talking about in like the sense of-

2234
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,400
I was talking about a different kind of jock.

2235
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:48,240
Yeah.

2236
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:49,280
Not the Scottish jock.

2237
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:50,120
Interesting.

2238
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:50,960
The language is fun.

2239
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:52,840
Yeah, this is why music should only,

2240
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:53,840
you should never have lyrics

2241
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,920
because words are fucking terrible.

2242
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,080
Second full circle.

2243
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:59,640
That's a Venn diagram, baby, voicemails.

2244
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,480
Beautiful.

2245
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:04,640
You said you've got a quarter of Scott in you.

2246
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:05,480
And I thought you-

2247
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:06,640
No, no, no, it's probably not even that.

2248
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:10,320
And I thought you said you've got a quarter of Scott in you.

2249
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:14,480
I was like, wow, we progressed from that one beer from before.

2250
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:16,360
Actually, I had that and a wine,

2251
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:17,720
which you all not meant to mix,

2252
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:18,960
but it was already there.

2253
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:19,960
Opshaw.

2254
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:20,800
Opshaw.

2255
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:24,280
Who says, doctors, what do they know?

2256
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:27,640
Genuinely, one of the biggest pieces of advice

2257
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:29,760
my dad gave me was don't mix grape and grain.

2258
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,360
That's the one bit of advice I remember.

2259
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:33,440
Grape and grain?

2260
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,280
Grape?

2261
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:35,120
You know, what?

2262
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:35,960
Grape and grain.

2263
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:39,040
It's basically don't mix wine with other kinds of alcohol.

2264
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:40,720
That's so silly.

2265
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:41,560
That's so funny.

2266
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:42,400
I mean, that's how you get the-

2267
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,760
Mixing alcohol is how you get the worst.

2268
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:45,800
They both start with the G.R.A.

2269
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,800
They're made for each other.

2270
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:48,360
Grape and grain, I've never-

2271
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:51,600
Yeah, beer before liquor is the-

2272
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,280
Beer before liquor never been sicker

2273
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:55,480
is the one that I know.

2274
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:58,360
And what's beer-

2275
02:33:58,360 --> 02:34:00,040
Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.

2276
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:01,280
You're in the clear, that's right.

2277
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:02,440
That's how it goes.

2278
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:08,600
There's a lot of advice about how you should drink.

2279
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:10,800
I suppose the best advice is-

2280
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:11,640
Probably don't.

2281
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:12,480
Have fun.

2282
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:13,320
Just have fun with it.

2283
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:15,040
Yeah, definitely.

2284
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:16,720
Have fun and be yourself.

2285
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:18,640
Yeah.

2286
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:21,280
Anyway.

2287
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:24,320
So we've learned even more now.

2288
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:27,000
I think we should start voicemails

2289
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,720
if you guys are up for it.

2290
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:30,640
Hell yeah.

2291
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,760
I mean, I never am, but I do them anyway.

2292
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:37,280
Okay, well, here we go.

2293
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,040
I'm gonna post them in the general.

2294
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:42,800
Let me find, okay.

2295
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:46,240
Did I, oh, shit.

2296
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:48,080
Did I save these in the wrong order?

2297
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:51,520
Did I save these?

2298
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,280
We're gonna get through all of them anyway,

2299
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:54,280
so it doesn't matter what the order is.

2300
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:58,840
I, well, I need to know, yeah, okay.

2301
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:00,360
All right, this, okay, I found it, all right.

2302
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:04,720
First one, the first one is called when,

2303
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:06,280
and here it is.

2304
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:08,680
It's called when question mark.

2305
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:10,280
So if you guys are ready,

2306
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:13,200
in three, two, one, play.

2307
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:16,880
All right, week three, me asking,

2308
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:19,160
the who, what, when, where, why, of Radgon?

2309
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:22,400
When will Radgon be?

2310
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:23,240
You asked this already.

2311
02:35:23,240 --> 02:35:28,240
Do you guys think this will be a soon future endeavor?

2312
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,640
No.

2313
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:33,240
Or later, and when do you want it to be?

2314
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:35,880
And when do you realistically think it'll be?

2315
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:38,480
I don't know, there's only so many ways I can phrase when.

2316
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,480
It won't be for a while.

2317
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:45,480
Snake, do you know what Radgon is?

2318
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:47,480
Yeah, I've watched the PCP lectures.

2319
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:48,480
Actually, I forgot to say that, yeah,

2320
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:51,480
that was actually a big part of what I did listen to

2321
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:53,480
that got me into the PCP.

2322
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:55,480
I forgot you mentioned a...

2323
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:57,480
You mentioned the lectures.

2324
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:01,480
I have watched most all of them, so, yeah.

2325
02:36:01,480 --> 02:36:03,480
Do you have a favorite one, Snake?

2326
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:05,480
Yeah.

2327
02:36:05,480 --> 02:36:06,480
My favorite one, god.

2328
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,480
Give me a fucking minute on that.

2329
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:11,480
I think it is actually, I think it is

2330
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:14,480
either the Son of Chew or the Bloody Son of Chew

2331
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:16,480
or the Tales Gets Told lecture,

2332
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:18,480
because they were just topics that I'm more

2333
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:21,480
intimately familiar with.

2334
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:24,480
And it's like, it's always being broken down.

2335
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:25,480
Yeah.

2336
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:28,480
The JDR and the Animorphs one are probably my favorites.

2337
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:30,480
I really enjoy, I do really enjoy Munchie's ones.

2338
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:33,480
I only recently learned that he's a lot calmer.

2339
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:35,480
And that was actually very pleasant to learn.

2340
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:37,480
In real life, he's much more,

2341
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:38,480
he's still very loud.

2342
02:36:38,480 --> 02:36:40,480
He has a very loud voice, but he's much more,

2343
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:44,480
he's much more low-key in real life.

2344
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:47,480
If I had to pick, yeah, among the ones that are not mine,

2345
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:49,480
I would probably say Animorph,

2346
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:51,480
maybe Animorphs and Kingdom Hearts

2347
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:53,480
are probably my two favorites.

2348
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:54,480
Aside from mine.

2349
02:36:54,480 --> 02:36:55,480
I enjoy Nates.

2350
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:57,480
I enjoy Nates.

2351
02:36:57,480 --> 02:36:59,480
Kingdom Hearts is pretty good.

2352
02:36:59,480 --> 02:37:02,480
I like the kind of raw enthusiasm he kind of brings to him.

2353
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:05,480
Yeah, yeah, he does.

2354
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:07,480
Because I love Jeff, he's my favorite.

2355
02:37:07,480 --> 02:37:09,480
I love Jeff.

2356
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:11,480
We need to have him at Redcon 4.0.

2357
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:13,480
Where's Jeff's lecture?

2358
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:17,480
Yeah, if we ever did anything else like that in the future,

2359
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:18,480
I mean, it wouldn't be...

2360
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:20,480
Jeff would be there.

2361
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:22,480
We haven't even thought about it,

2362
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:25,480
and like, we're still thinking about getting all the final stuff

2363
02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:28,480
from Last Redcon out and produce and release, so...

2364
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:29,480
You're gonna clear that.

2365
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:32,480
Not even start thinking about the next one.

2366
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:34,480
So it wouldn't...

2367
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:36,480
It couldn't be that soon, even if we wanted it to.

2368
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:38,480
I don't know.

2369
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:41,480
Okay, the next one is called

2370
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:45,480
In This Voice Mail I Nate So Hard.

2371
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:49,480
There it is.

2372
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:54,480
3, 2, 1, go.

2373
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:57,480
No Nate November.

2374
02:37:57,480 --> 02:38:00,480
More like, Nate never makes anything.

2375
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:02,480
Wait, what's this?

2376
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:04,480
New Gamer Zone episode.

2377
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:06,480
Featuring Giggit.

2378
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:09,480
Hold up, I think I just lost this challenge.

2379
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:12,480
Gross.

2380
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:13,480
Fallen Soldier.

2381
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:15,480
Amazing.

2382
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:17,480
He will never be allowed into the Nate fucker ranks.

2383
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:19,480
He's not worthy.

2384
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:20,480
What a shame.

2385
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:23,480
He's Nazi in heaven.

2386
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:27,480
Next Voice Mail is an image.

2387
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:29,480
Let's post it.

2388
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:33,480
The fuck is this?

2389
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:35,480
What is this?

2390
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:39,480
I'm not familiar with this format.

2391
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:42,480
Well, this is me mining cryptocurrency

2392
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:45,480
at Redcon 3, I think.

2393
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:47,480
Probably.

2394
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:51,480
Who is you getting assimilated into the blockchain?

2395
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:53,480
This is me mining for Slimecoin.

2396
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:55,480
I'm getting slimy in here.

2397
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:58,480
I am having a good time.

2398
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:00,480
I like this.

2399
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:03,480
This one's going in the Favorites file.

2400
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:07,480
Okay, next one is called I'm So Fucked Up.

2401
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:09,480
So Fucked Up.

2402
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:11,480
Wait, it's loading.

2403
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:12,480
Come on.

2404
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:13,480
Okay, there it goes.

2405
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:15,480
3, 2, 1, go.

2406
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:18,480
Why, when you really got a P,

2407
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:19,480
it's like, ooh, that sucks.

2408
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:22,480
But then you P and it's like, ah, so rude.

2409
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:23,480
Tell me about it.

2410
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:26,480
When you got a shit, when you really got a shit,

2411
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:30,480
it's like orders of magnitude worse than really having a P.

2412
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:31,480
It's like torture.

2413
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:33,480
It sucks so bad.

2414
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,480
And then sometimes when you do shit,

2415
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:37,480
it just feels like you still got a shit

2416
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:40,480
and you just wait until your bowels calm the fuck down.

2417
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:41,480
What the hell?

2418
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:43,480
What the fuck?

2419
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:45,480
So fucked up.

2420
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:47,480
That's called the gape.

2421
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:50,480
You're experiencing the gape, my friend.

2422
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:55,480
You have to wait for your body to un-gape.

2423
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:57,480
I feel like if you don't shit for long enough,

2424
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:59,480
your asshole will just close,

2425
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:01,480
but we're just constantly damaging it just enough

2426
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:03,480
to maintain equilibrium.

2427
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:05,480
I learned this.

2428
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:07,480
If you don't shit,

2429
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:09,480
like if you hold it in,

2430
02:40:09,480 --> 02:40:12,480
you can prevent yourself from shitting for a while,

2431
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:15,480
but if you don't shit,

2432
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,480
it feels bad.

2433
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:19,480
Your body, like,

2434
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:22,480
moisture absorbs out of the poop

2435
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:24,480
through your large intestine.

2436
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:26,480
And the longer it spends in your large intestine,

2437
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:28,480
the drier it becomes.

2438
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:30,480
And so when you do eventually shit it,

2439
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:32,480
it will be harder and drier

2440
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:34,480
because you absorb the moisture out of it.

2441
02:40:34,480 --> 02:40:36,480
Because it spent more time in there.

2442
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:37,480
I don't know.

2443
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:39,480
What should you do with this information?

2444
02:40:39,480 --> 02:40:40,480
I don't know.

2445
02:40:40,480 --> 02:40:41,480
I'm not a doctor.

2446
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:42,480
It's as small as poop fast.

2447
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:44,480
Or take the dry shit challenge.

2448
02:40:44,480 --> 02:40:46,480
I would say yes.

2449
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:48,480
You should probably shit...

2450
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:49,480
Don't hold it in.

2451
02:40:49,480 --> 02:40:50,480
Guys, listen.

2452
02:40:50,480 --> 02:40:51,480
Viewers, please.

2453
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:52,480
Don't hold...

2454
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,480
Don't hold it in.

2455
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:54,480
Listen, everybody.

2456
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:57,480
Please take part in dry shit December.

2457
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:01,480
It's the heaviest product going.

2458
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:02,480
Dry it!

2459
02:41:02,480 --> 02:41:04,480
Dump this in there!

2460
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:05,480
No!

2461
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:07,480
No!

2462
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:12,480
We did it.

2463
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:14,480
Let us know how it goes.

2464
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:17,480
Hold it in for a whole month and see how dry it is.

2465
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:22,480
Send it in.

2466
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:24,480
Send it in.

2467
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:25,480
Don't...

2468
02:41:25,480 --> 02:41:26,480
It's not to hear somewhere.

2469
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:28,480
Send it to somewhere and they'll...

2470
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:29,480
Obviously.

2471
02:41:29,480 --> 02:41:31,480
They'll get back to you.

2472
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:35,480
Better than doing an advent calendar, I guess.

2473
02:41:35,480 --> 02:41:37,480
Well, if you hold it out long enough,

2474
02:41:37,480 --> 02:41:40,480
it can be part of next year's advent calendar.

2475
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:48,480
The next voicemail is called

2476
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:50,480
a fried vocalist.

2477
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:53,480
There it is.

2478
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:54,480
It's loading.

2479
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:55,480
Okay.

2480
02:41:55,480 --> 02:41:57,480
Three, two, one, go.

2481
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:01,480
I have bipolar.

2482
02:42:01,480 --> 02:42:04,480
I have to sort over there.

2483
02:42:07,480 --> 02:42:10,480
Sounds like someone has already started

2484
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:12,480
dry something December.

2485
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:13,480
D-D-D-D.

2486
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:15,480
They've already started D-3.

2487
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:16,480
D-D-D-D.

2488
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:18,480
Actually, they're already struggling

2489
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:21,480
on the first day of December, it says.

2490
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:24,480
When you successfully complete

2491
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:26,480
Dry Dump December,

2492
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:29,480
you get crowned King D-D-D.

2493
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:31,480
That's the lore.

2494
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:34,480
That's the Kirby lore every YouTuber tells me about.

2495
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:36,480
Because Kirby's all about eating,

2496
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:38,480
his antagonist, King D-D-D,

2497
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:39,480
he's all about shitting.

2498
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:41,480
It's the end of the day.

2499
02:42:41,480 --> 02:42:43,480
Boss, end of the expert.

2500
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:47,480
Can you start Keto diet help on Dry Dump December?

2501
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:50,480
Keto can sometimes give you diarrhea.

2502
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,480
Sometimes.

2503
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:52,480
Oh, okay, never mind.

2504
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:54,480
It's spotty.

2505
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:56,480
Sometimes when you start Keto,

2506
02:42:56,480 --> 02:42:58,480
you can get a little bit diarrhea-y,

2507
02:42:58,480 --> 02:43:01,480
but not always, and it's just temporary.

2508
02:43:01,480 --> 02:43:02,480
I don't know.

2509
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:05,480
All I know is it dries you out,

2510
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:07,480
but I don't know.

2511
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:11,480
Well, I'm very serious about staying hydrated.

2512
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:12,480
Okay.

2513
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:15,480
I think it might dry some people out, but not me.

2514
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:18,480
I'm built different.

2515
02:43:18,480 --> 02:43:21,480
Next one is called...

2516
02:43:21,480 --> 02:43:24,480
What is this?

2517
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:27,480
It's called Oh No, I Failed NNN.

2518
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:29,480
Well, you got DDD to look forward to.

2519
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:32,480
Three, two, one, go.

2520
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:34,480
You know, in listening to the latest

2521
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:36,480
Gamer Zone episode,

2522
02:43:36,480 --> 02:43:40,480
and Nate's streams and shit,

2523
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:45,480
I realized the reason Nate's not on the current PCP

2524
02:43:45,480 --> 02:43:48,480
is that he is a relic.

2525
02:43:48,480 --> 02:43:50,480
He's a fixture of the past.

2526
02:43:50,480 --> 02:43:54,480
He still does all the edgy jokes,

2527
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:56,480
all the...

2528
02:43:56,480 --> 02:43:58,480
all the racy stuff,

2529
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:02,480
all the sexist stuff,

2530
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:04,480
and it's always funny,

2531
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:09,480
but it doesn't fit with the current PCP anymore.

2532
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:12,480
I don't know.

2533
02:44:12,480 --> 02:44:17,480
He just saw himself growing obsolete,

2534
02:44:17,480 --> 02:44:21,480
took himself back into the back of the fucking barn.

2535
02:44:21,480 --> 02:44:27,480
The shed and popped a cap in his own ass.

2536
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:29,480
But, okay.

2537
02:44:29,480 --> 02:44:32,480
I love that you specified that it's still funny.

2538
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:34,480
Oh, man.

2539
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:36,480
If you think Nate is...

2540
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:38,480
So why are you here not watching the Gamer Zone?

2541
02:44:38,480 --> 02:44:40,480
I don't understand.

2542
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:42,480
Okay.

2543
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:46,480
If you think his humor is dated and makes him a relic,

2544
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:48,480
that's okay, but if you then say,

2545
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:50,480
and it's funny,

2546
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:52,480
that means you're a relic too, my dude.

2547
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:54,480
You're right there with him.

2548
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:57,480
It's either not a relic or you are also a relic.

2549
02:44:57,480 --> 02:44:59,480
I need a joke about the opium wars

2550
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:03,480
and called Ben St. Amick earlier this episode.

2551
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:05,480
You're getting canceled.

2552
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:07,480
We're canceling Snake on this one.

2553
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:11,480
Well, catch me on the Gamer Zone next month.

2554
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:13,480
No, he would.

2555
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:14,480
Nate would poach you like that.

2556
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:15,480
He did it to Cyber Shell.

2557
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:17,480
He'll do it to you.

2558
02:45:17,480 --> 02:45:18,480
I don't know.

2559
02:45:18,480 --> 02:45:20,480
I've never spoken to the guy.

2560
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:22,480
A bunch of my patrons want you to go on the Gamer Zone,

2561
02:45:22,480 --> 02:45:24,480
and I'm just like, I don't know, man.

2562
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:30,480
It seems a little too high tier for me.

2563
02:45:30,480 --> 02:45:31,480
I saw it enough.

2564
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:34,480
Well, that's a bit too high concept.

2565
02:45:35,480 --> 02:45:38,480
What if Nate got Saber Spark and not you?

2566
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:40,480
I mean, I would understand.

2567
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:42,480
Why would you want someone with no following

2568
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:44,480
when you have someone who has a huge following?

2569
02:45:44,480 --> 02:45:50,480
It's the stratification of podcasts.

2570
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:51,480
You've got the Gamer Zone.

2571
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:53,480
I'm the one who writes all Saber Spanger videos now,

2572
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:54,480
but that's okay.

2573
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:56,480
He can get all the credit.

2574
02:45:56,480 --> 02:45:58,480
Has he been gaining subscribers?

2575
02:45:58,480 --> 02:46:00,480
I feel like he was at 150.

2576
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:02,480
Saber's at 1.5 mil.

2577
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:03,480
No, no, no, Nate.

2578
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:04,480
But is he still gaining?

2579
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:05,480
Oh, Nate?

2580
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:06,480
I have no idea what Nate's at.

2581
02:46:06,480 --> 02:46:07,480
He was at 150.

2582
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:08,480
Nate has been up.

2583
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:09,480
But now it's 114.

2584
02:46:09,480 --> 02:46:11,480
I think at the time, we even mentioned,

2585
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:15,480
because before Nate hit 100K,

2586
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:17,480
we had noticed the phenomenon on YouTube.

2587
02:46:17,480 --> 02:46:21,480
Once you hit 100K, you get accelerated in the algorithm,

2588
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:23,480
and people hit 200K really quick.

2589
02:46:23,480 --> 02:46:26,480
And then it didn't happen to Nate.

2590
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:27,480
It didn't happen.

2591
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:28,480
It's like he's an anomaly.

2592
02:46:28,480 --> 02:46:30,480
I don't understand.

2593
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:33,480
I'm going to press it at 100.

2594
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:35,480
I think it's actually, maybe I'm thinking,

2595
02:46:35,480 --> 02:46:37,480
if you're hitting 100 fast, it's momentum.

2596
02:46:37,480 --> 02:46:39,480
I don't think you get a boost off.

2597
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:40,480
I could be wrong.

2598
02:46:40,480 --> 02:46:41,480
There was, I mean,

2599
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:43,480
there was something that was actually done.

2600
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:46,480
That was like the common thing at the time.

2601
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:47,480
At least the confusion.

2602
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:49,480
I haven't a lot.

2603
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:50,480
I didn't get the boost,

2604
02:46:50,480 --> 02:46:53,480
but I also haven't posted since I hit 100K.

2605
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:55,480
Well, I guess that would help.

2606
02:46:55,480 --> 02:46:57,480
Yeah, it would help.

2607
02:46:57,480 --> 02:46:59,480
I'm still surpassing him though.

2608
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:01,480
I'm still growing like 1,000 a month fish.

2609
02:47:01,480 --> 02:47:02,480
Damn.

2610
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:03,480
I'm growing 1,000 a month,

2611
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:05,480
and I don't think I'm going to get the boost

2612
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:08,480
when I hit 100,000 if it does exist.

2613
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:11,480
You're at like 90, right?

2614
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:12,480
Oh, wow.

2615
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:13,480
I thought you were bigger than me.

2616
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:16,480
No, but I've been at this for a thing,

2617
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:17,480
and I've just had very slow,

2618
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:20,480
but steady growth throughout.

2619
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,480
So for the last few years,

2620
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:24,480
the ramp-ups have been very steady.

2621
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:27,480
And honestly, I'm okay with the slower growth,

2622
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:30,480
because I don't really care to get too big too fast.

2623
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:31,480
I don't really care bigness,

2624
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:35,480
as long as I just have a good base to work from.

2625
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:38,480
That's the most important term.

2626
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:40,480
I'm always thinking about,

2627
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:43,480
I should really be doing something with my channel.

2628
02:47:43,480 --> 02:47:45,480
I'm not doing anything with it at the moment.

2629
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:46,480
I should do something.

2630
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:48,480
I mean, I'm doing my game right now.

2631
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:51,480
It's really difficult to do weekly videos

2632
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:54,480
on top of bigger creative projects.

2633
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:57,480
Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that.

2634
02:47:57,480 --> 02:47:58,480
It sucks.

2635
02:47:58,480 --> 02:47:59,480
It sucks.

2636
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:00,480
I don't know what I would...

2637
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:02,480
I know I should be doing something with my channel

2638
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:04,480
and trying to grow my channel,

2639
02:48:04,480 --> 02:48:07,480
but I don't know what I would want to do with it.

2640
02:48:07,480 --> 02:48:08,480
So I have no ideas.

2641
02:48:08,480 --> 02:48:10,480
I'm stupid.

2642
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:13,480
That's the curse you expect.

2643
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:14,480
I'm not going to tell you to do something

2644
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:15,480
you don't want to do,

2645
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:17,480
but maybe devlogs or just breakdowns

2646
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:18,480
on what you're doing,

2647
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:19,480
tie it into other projects,

2648
02:48:19,480 --> 02:48:21,480
but then you're just creating more work

2649
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:22,480
on projects we're already doing.

2650
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:25,480
It's always a balancing act of,

2651
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:26,480
am I having fun with this?

2652
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,480
Am I enjoying it?

2653
02:48:27,480 --> 02:48:28,480
Is this awful or painful?

2654
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:30,480
I started doing devlogs for Patreon

2655
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:32,480
just because I needed more bonus content

2656
02:48:32,480 --> 02:48:33,480
to throw on my Patreon,

2657
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:35,480
and even that takes a lot of time away

2658
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:38,480
from just actually doing work.

2659
02:48:38,480 --> 02:48:40,480
Yeah, that is the tricky part,

2660
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:42,480
because I have that with my Patreon videos,

2661
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:44,480
where it's like, I do enjoy doing them

2662
02:48:44,480 --> 02:48:45,480
and it gives people a chance to interact,

2663
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:48,480
but it's like, it takes three or four days,

2664
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:50,480
and it's like, this is three or four days

2665
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:52,480
off the thing that your technically came from.

2666
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:54,480
I'm so upset that Clubhouse didn't take off

2667
02:48:54,480 --> 02:48:55,480
and become a thing.

2668
02:48:55,480 --> 02:48:57,480
I was really hoping that the Zeitgeist

2669
02:48:57,480 --> 02:48:58,480
would shift to audio,

2670
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:00,480
because just shitting out audio stuff

2671
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:01,480
as we're doing right now

2672
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:03,480
is the easiest thing on God's Earth,

2673
02:49:03,480 --> 02:49:06,480
and if that just became the de facto standard,

2674
02:49:06,480 --> 02:49:09,480
God, I could destroy the world.

2675
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:11,480
Video is just such a fucking grind,

2676
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:13,480
and it sucks, and I hate it.

2677
02:49:15,480 --> 02:49:16,480
What's Clubhouse?

2678
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:18,480
Yeah, I don't like enough failure.

2679
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:20,480
Clubhouse was an app,

2680
02:49:20,480 --> 02:49:22,480
but you know how Twitter has spaces

2681
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:25,480
where people can just jump into live audio calls?

2682
02:49:25,480 --> 02:49:26,480
Yeah.

2683
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,480
Wait, what?

2684
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:29,480
They stole that from an app called Clubhouse,

2685
02:49:29,480 --> 02:49:30,480
which is just the same thing.

2686
02:49:30,480 --> 02:49:31,480
I saw one or two spaces.

2687
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:33,480
Didn't they kill spaces, or are they still around?

2688
02:49:33,480 --> 02:49:35,480
No, they killed fleets.

2689
02:49:35,480 --> 02:49:37,480
They're pushing spaces hard now.

2690
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:38,480
They killed fleets.

2691
02:49:38,480 --> 02:49:39,480
Oh, thank God fleets are gone.

2692
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:40,480
That was stupid.

2693
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:41,480
Yeah, that died.

2694
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:44,480
I never even saw a single fleet.

2695
02:49:44,480 --> 02:49:46,480
I still don't know what fleets were.

2696
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:49,480
They were Instagram stories on Twitter.

2697
02:49:49,480 --> 02:49:51,480
Oh, yeah, I don't use it on Google.

2698
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:53,480
Because nobody can have an original idea anymore.

2699
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:02,480
Voicemails.

2700
02:50:02,480 --> 02:50:03,480
Voicemails.

2701
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:05,480
Oh, yeah, let's look at those voicemails.

2702
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:07,480
Finally.

2703
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:09,480
Shit.

2704
02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:11,480
Which episode?

2705
02:50:11,480 --> 02:50:13,480
Okay, the next one is called...

2706
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:14,480
Full circle.

2707
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:17,480
Oh, the next one is called Who Made the New Intro?

2708
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:20,480
And the answer to that is I think Eleazar did, right?

2709
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:23,480
That blessed that guy, that son of a bitch.

2710
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:24,480
I think...

2711
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:26,480
It was either that or there was a voicemailer.

2712
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:29,480
No, it was a voicemailer.

2713
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:32,480
Yeah, a voicemailer made it.

2714
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:34,480
And I don't know who it was.

2715
02:50:34,480 --> 02:50:36,480
I don't know who made the new intro.

2716
02:50:36,480 --> 02:50:41,480
If you made the new intro, shout out to the comments.

2717
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:43,480
I have a musical...

2718
02:50:43,480 --> 02:50:46,480
A PCP musical thing I've been doing for like a year,

2719
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:48,480
but it's not done because it's been too busy.

2720
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:49,480
We do?

2721
02:50:49,480 --> 02:50:51,480
Did you just let that rip?

2722
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:53,480
You'll see it.

2723
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:55,480
When I finish my current project,

2724
02:50:55,480 --> 02:50:58,480
I'm going to actually take time to finish it.

2725
02:50:58,480 --> 02:51:00,480
Wow.

2726
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:02,480
Based.

2727
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:04,480
Okay, sounds good.

2728
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:06,480
Let's do the next voicemail.

2729
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:08,480
It is called...

2730
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:10,480
Horoscope.

2731
02:51:10,480 --> 02:51:13,480
Three, two, one, go.

2732
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:16,480
Ben, you come off as earnest and considerate,

2733
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:19,480
emotionally honest and wise enough to laugh at one's own.

2734
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:20,480
Wise.

2735
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:22,480
Your soft-spokenness and fiery virtuosity

2736
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:24,480
paint you as compassionate and well-compassed.

2737
02:51:24,480 --> 02:51:25,480
I agree.

2738
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:27,480
You're both guided by strong moral principles

2739
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:29,480
and emotional intelligence.

2740
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:31,480
You attract people who act in kind.

2741
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:33,480
Do you agree with your horoscope?

2742
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:35,480
No.

2743
02:51:35,480 --> 02:51:37,480
Was that me and Giz?

2744
02:51:37,480 --> 02:51:39,480
That was correct.

2745
02:51:39,480 --> 02:51:41,480
Well, Giz's not here.

2746
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:45,480
Mine, what did they say?

2747
02:51:45,480 --> 02:51:47,480
I was like, compassionate.

2748
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:49,480
All lies.

2749
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:51,480
Something about like,

2750
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:53,480
bleeding with emotional intelligence

2751
02:51:53,480 --> 02:51:56,480
and attracting people who are the same thing.

2752
02:51:56,480 --> 02:51:59,480
You're anti-sigma male.

2753
02:51:59,480 --> 02:52:02,480
They're saying you're like a sheep of Inu coin?

2754
02:52:02,480 --> 02:52:04,480
Yeah, yeah.

2755
02:52:04,480 --> 02:52:07,480
Oh, Elon Musk's a tweet about me

2756
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:09,480
and I'm going to go to the moon.

2757
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:11,480
Wait, wait.

2758
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:13,480
Ernest, considerate,

2759
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:15,480
emotionally honest,

2760
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:17,480
wise enough to laugh at myself.

2761
02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:19,480
Ernest, considerate, emotionally honest,

2762
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:21,480
wise enough to laugh at myself.

2763
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:23,480
I would, okay.

2764
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:26,480
Ernest, considerate, emotionally honest.

2765
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:28,480
Unironically, I agree with all those things

2766
02:52:28,480 --> 02:52:30,480
and I think they're all true of me.

2767
02:52:30,480 --> 02:52:33,480
I don't care how that sounds.

2768
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:35,480
You know, emotionally honest in the sense that

2769
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:37,480
I don't know if you're wise enough to laugh at yourself.

2770
02:52:37,480 --> 02:52:39,480
I feel like you just didn't have a choice.

2771
02:52:39,480 --> 02:52:41,480
You had to save face.

2772
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:43,480
You're honest in that you'll tell someone

2773
02:52:43,480 --> 02:52:45,480
that they're fucking stupid

2774
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:47,480
without hesitation because you believe it.

2775
02:52:47,480 --> 02:52:49,480
Exactly, exactly.

2776
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:51,480
That is definitely true.

2777
02:52:51,480 --> 02:52:53,480
I don't mean to sound conceited.

2778
02:52:53,480 --> 02:52:55,480
I'm just giving you my Ernest opinion.

2779
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:57,480
I'm just,

2780
02:52:57,480 --> 02:52:59,480
my honest,

2781
02:52:59,480 --> 02:53:01,480
my emotionally honest response to this

2782
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:03,480
is to say that, yeah, I think it's all true.

2783
02:53:03,480 --> 02:53:05,480
I guess we've learned today that horoscopes are real.

2784
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:07,480
Yeah, that's right.

2785
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:09,480
Shit.

2786
02:53:09,480 --> 02:53:11,480
A lesson I learned over and over again,

2787
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:13,480
but I always fail to internalize.

2788
02:53:13,480 --> 02:53:15,480
People say that

2789
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:17,480
crypto is horoscopes for men

2790
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:19,480
and so are horoscopes.

2791
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:23,480
Crypto is essential oils for men.

2792
02:53:23,480 --> 02:53:25,480
And NFTs are

2793
02:53:25,480 --> 02:53:27,480
multi-level marketing schemes for men.

2794
02:53:27,480 --> 02:53:29,480
And

2795
02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:31,480
Sigma Male Grants sets over

2796
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:33,480
horoscopes.

2797
02:53:33,480 --> 02:53:35,480
Tesla stock is

2798
02:53:35,480 --> 02:53:37,480
horoscopes for men

2799
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:39,480
and

2800
02:53:39,480 --> 02:53:41,480
the

2801
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:43,480
blockchain is

2802
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:45,480
makeup?

2803
02:53:45,480 --> 02:53:47,480
I don't know.

2804
02:53:47,480 --> 02:53:49,480
How do the Grants sets fit in though?

2805
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:51,480
That's gotta be one of the things.

2806
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:53,480
I would have said that was horoscopes

2807
02:53:53,480 --> 02:53:55,480
because it's all about your personality, man.

2808
02:53:55,480 --> 02:53:57,480
You're not an asshole.

2809
02:53:57,480 --> 02:53:59,480
You're just really smart

2810
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:01,480
and people don't understand you.

2811
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:03,480
You're too smart to care about people's feelings.

2812
02:54:03,480 --> 02:54:05,480
You're special.

2813
02:54:05,480 --> 02:54:07,480
You're not an asshole.

2814
02:54:07,480 --> 02:54:09,480
You're just so intelligent and no one understands you.

2815
02:54:09,480 --> 02:54:11,480
That's correct. Thank you.

2816
02:54:11,480 --> 02:54:13,480
You're right. What's your point?

2817
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:15,480
Sigma.

2818
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:17,480
What's your point in saying these things about me?

2819
02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:19,480
Okay.

2820
02:54:19,480 --> 02:54:21,480
Next voicemail.

2821
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:23,480
The next voicemail

2822
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:25,480
is another image.

2823
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:27,480
So let's see it.

2824
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:29,480
Tech had to go do some shit,

2825
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:31,480
but maybe he'll be back.

2826
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:33,480
Oh, Bencore.

2827
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:37,480
Oh boy.

2828
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:39,480
Yeah.

2829
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:41,480
These are all things that you've talked about in one way or another.

2830
02:54:41,480 --> 02:54:43,480
Wait, what is...

2831
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:47,480
I wouldn't go so far as to say that

2832
02:54:47,480 --> 02:54:49,480
Golden Girls is Bencore.

2833
02:54:51,480 --> 02:54:53,480
Gold Ghost is great.

2834
02:54:53,480 --> 02:54:55,480
What are you fucking...

2835
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:57,480
I just mean you're old, Ben. That's all it means.

2836
02:54:57,480 --> 02:54:59,480
Yeah.

2837
02:54:59,480 --> 02:55:01,480
It's just a coincidence that the picture is from Golden Girls.

2838
02:55:01,480 --> 02:55:03,480
Correct.

2839
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:05,480
They were just pictures of an old person at doctor with health problems.

2840
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:07,480
So this is great.

2841
02:55:09,480 --> 02:55:11,480
Maybe it's not Golden Girls.

2842
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:13,480
Maybe it's more specifically Be Offer.

2843
02:55:13,480 --> 02:55:15,480
I don't know.

2844
02:55:15,480 --> 02:55:17,480
No, I was talking last episode about...

2845
02:55:17,480 --> 02:55:19,480
Or maybe two episodes ago about the Golden Girls.

2846
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:21,480
But I like that

2847
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:23,480
their Simpsons is also

2848
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:25,480
the old people.

2849
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:27,480
So there's a message here.

2850
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:29,480
I don't know if these are Bencore.

2851
02:55:29,480 --> 02:55:31,480
So much as these are just things that I like.

2852
02:55:31,480 --> 02:55:33,480
I mean, Homestuck is pretty Bencore.

2853
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:35,480
I would maybe say J.D.

2854
02:55:35,480 --> 02:55:37,480
I'm trying to work out...

2855
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:39,480
Some of these are Bencore.

2856
02:55:39,480 --> 02:55:41,480
Do you know what the one in the middle right is?

2857
02:55:41,480 --> 02:55:43,480
Yeah, Oolulia.

2858
02:55:43,480 --> 02:55:45,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2859
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:47,480
Elemental Masters, yeah.

2860
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:49,480
I've not read Elemental Masters,

2861
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:51,480
but I know it's very granular.

2862
02:55:51,480 --> 02:55:53,480
It's magic system.

2863
02:55:53,480 --> 02:55:55,480
I was...

2864
02:55:55,480 --> 02:55:57,480
I was talking...

2865
02:55:57,480 --> 02:55:59,480
I wanted to get Nick to let me do

2866
02:55:59,480 --> 02:56:01,480
the audiobook version and let us upload

2867
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:03,480
an audiobook to Audible.

2868
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:05,480
And he was down.

2869
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:07,480
He said he would let me do it.

2870
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:09,480
But then when it came time for him to

2871
02:56:09,480 --> 02:56:11,480
just fill out the form,

2872
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:13,480
giving them permission to sell his book,

2873
02:56:13,480 --> 02:56:15,480
just put in his

2874
02:56:15,480 --> 02:56:17,480
payment information

2875
02:56:17,480 --> 02:56:19,480
to be a person who uses Audible.

2876
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:21,480
He just wouldn't do it.

2877
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:23,480
He was just like...

2878
02:56:23,480 --> 02:56:25,480
I don't know if he was just lazy,

2879
02:56:25,480 --> 02:56:27,480
or if he was like, phobic of

2880
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:29,480
anything that Google owns.

2881
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:31,480
That might have been it, actually,

2882
02:56:31,480 --> 02:56:33,480
because he said he would not

2883
02:56:33,480 --> 02:56:35,480
look at Facebook, because it was like...

2884
02:56:35,480 --> 02:56:37,480
No, wait, Facebook is not owned by Google.

2885
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:39,480
He's phobic

2886
02:56:39,480 --> 02:56:41,480
of Google stuff, though, so...

2887
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:43,480
Alright.

2888
02:56:43,480 --> 02:56:45,480
Amazon owns Audible.

2889
02:56:45,480 --> 02:56:47,480
He doesn't like alphabet

2890
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:49,480
or operation.

2891
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:51,480
Maybe it was...

2892
02:56:51,480 --> 02:56:53,480
I don't know. Maybe he was just lazy.

2893
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:55,480
The point is we could have made some money,

2894
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:57,480
and we didn't do it.

2895
02:56:57,480 --> 02:56:59,480
And it's his fault.

2896
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:01,480
What?

2897
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:03,480
If we

2898
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:05,480
cracked Jeff Bezos' head

2899
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:07,480
like an egg yolk would come out.

2900
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:09,480
Yeah.

2901
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:11,480
I think it's only one way to find out.

2902
02:57:11,480 --> 02:57:13,480
I think like a chick would come out.

2903
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:15,480
We'll take an axe to it.

2904
02:57:15,480 --> 02:57:17,480
We'll find him.

2905
02:57:19,480 --> 02:57:21,480
Long story short, as you were denied

2906
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:23,480
the rank of Elemental Master.

2907
02:57:23,480 --> 02:57:25,480
I was.

2908
02:57:25,480 --> 02:57:27,480
I was so...

2909
02:57:27,480 --> 02:57:29,480
I was so hyped for it. I honestly was really hyped for it.

2910
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:31,480
And then he...

2911
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:33,480
He betrayed me.

2912
02:57:33,480 --> 02:57:35,480
He hurt me.

2913
02:57:35,480 --> 02:57:37,480
I was owed. I was owed this.

2914
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:39,480
And he robbed it from me.

2915
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:41,480
And now I'm out for revenge.

2916
02:57:41,480 --> 02:57:43,480
After I destroy Trixie...

2917
02:57:45,480 --> 02:57:47,480
Oh, Lillia's next.

2918
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:49,480
Oh.

2919
02:57:49,480 --> 02:57:51,480
Okay.

2920
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:53,480
The next voicemail is this image.

2921
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:55,480
This Lynchian Alignment chart.

2922
02:57:57,480 --> 02:57:59,480
An academic definition of Lynchian

2923
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:01,480
might be that the term refers to a particular

2924
02:58:01,480 --> 02:58:03,480
kind of irony with a very macabre and very mundane

2925
02:58:03,480 --> 02:58:05,480
combined in such a way as to reveal

2926
02:58:05,480 --> 02:58:07,480
the former's perpetual containment

2927
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:09,480
within the latter.

2928
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:11,480
Hmm.

2929
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:13,480
Okay.

2930
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:15,480
Only film TV.

2931
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:17,480
Okay, form can be any art.

2932
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:19,480
Form, rebel, anything. Okay, that's simple enough.

2933
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:21,480
Content purist.

2934
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:23,480
The mundane refers to regular plain Americana

2935
02:58:23,480 --> 02:58:25,480
and the macabre refers

2936
02:58:25,480 --> 02:58:27,480
to strange psychosexual violence.

2937
02:58:27,480 --> 02:58:29,480
Content centrist. The mundane refers

2938
02:58:29,480 --> 02:58:31,480
to any sense of normalcy and the macabre

2939
02:58:31,480 --> 02:58:33,480
anything creepy.

2940
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:35,480
Content, rebel. Okay, it doesn't have to be

2941
02:58:35,480 --> 02:58:37,480
that normal or that creepy.

2942
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:39,480
So play...

2943
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:41,480
Pizza...

2944
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:43,480
Pizza bait, papa?

2945
02:58:43,480 --> 02:58:45,480
I don't even know what that is.

2946
02:58:45,480 --> 02:58:47,480
So it's an idea that there is a certain

2947
02:58:47,480 --> 02:58:49,480
sinister undertone even in

2948
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:51,480
very mundane

2949
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:53,480
concepts.

2950
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:55,480
What is pizza bait, papa?

2951
02:58:55,480 --> 02:58:57,480
Or pizza. I'm just trying to work out how...

2952
02:58:57,480 --> 02:58:59,480
Is it just a pizza with a chicken on it?

2953
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:01,480
I'm just trying to work out how...

2954
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:03,480
I mean, I guess that isn't normal

2955
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:05,480
or creepy.

2956
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:07,480
I guess it kind of fits the content rebel definition.

2957
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:09,480
I would say a pizza is relatively normal.

2958
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:11,480
There's something abnormal about the pizza.

2959
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:13,480
I would say

2960
02:59:13,480 --> 02:59:15,480
by these definitions where form rebel means

2961
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:17,480
the medium can be anything

2962
02:59:17,480 --> 02:59:19,480
and content rebel means it doesn't really

2963
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:21,480
even need to be normal or creepy.

2964
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:23,480
Yeah, literally anything is lynchian

2965
02:59:23,480 --> 02:59:25,480
by that definition.

2966
02:59:25,480 --> 02:59:27,480
So sure, maybe it's just a pizza.

2967
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:29,480
Maybe.

2968
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:31,480
Yeah, I'm just thinking by this term

2969
02:59:31,480 --> 02:59:33,480
the universe itself is macabre

2970
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:35,480
and there's an irony

2971
02:59:35,480 --> 02:59:37,480
within the mundanity by which we experience

2972
02:59:37,480 --> 02:59:39,480
and get used to it.

2973
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:41,480
I mean,

2974
02:59:41,480 --> 02:59:43,480
DFW's definition up here

2975
02:59:43,480 --> 02:59:45,480
is referring to...

2976
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:47,480
He's referring to something that is

2977
02:59:47,480 --> 02:59:49,480
evoked in media

2978
02:59:49,480 --> 02:59:51,480
where you bring these two ideas together

2979
02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:53,480
to suggest something

2980
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:55,480
but you're suggesting something

2981
02:59:55,480 --> 02:59:57,480
about the real world.

2982
02:59:57,480 --> 02:59:59,480
So it seems a bit

2983
02:59:59,480 --> 03:00:01,480
off base to point to something

2984
03:00:01,480 --> 03:00:03,480
that really exists.

2985
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:05,480
Which yes, of course the macabre

2986
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:07,480
is contained within the mundane.

2987
03:00:07,480 --> 03:00:09,480
That's why the lynchian

2988
03:00:09,480 --> 03:00:11,480
paradigm is compelling

2989
03:00:11,480 --> 03:00:13,480
because that's how real life is.

2990
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:15,480
So just point to something in real life

2991
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:17,480
and be like, oh, it's lynchian.

2992
03:00:17,480 --> 03:00:19,480
It's like, well, no.

2993
03:00:19,480 --> 03:00:21,480
Lynchian things just refer

2994
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:23,480
to the same phenomenon.

2995
03:00:23,480 --> 03:00:25,480
They just evoke the phenomenon that exists

2996
03:00:25,480 --> 03:00:27,480
in reality, in media.

2997
03:00:27,480 --> 03:00:29,480
So you've gone off base.

2998
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:31,480
You've lost your mind.

2999
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:33,480
Where does dry dump December

3000
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:35,480
fit on the lynchian

3001
03:00:35,480 --> 03:00:37,480
line?

3002
03:00:37,480 --> 03:00:39,480
When someone's taking a dump,

3003
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:41,480
you know how you see stars

3004
03:00:41,480 --> 03:00:43,480
sometimes if you push really hard?

3005
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:45,480
Those stars will start dancing

3006
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:47,480
and there'll be some nice

3007
03:00:47,480 --> 03:00:49,480
jazz music playing.

3008
03:00:49,480 --> 03:00:51,480
I would say, okay.

3009
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:53,480
Do you know the context behind this picture

3010
03:00:53,480 --> 03:00:55,480
of David Lynch and the Woody Woodpecker dolls?

3011
03:00:57,480 --> 03:00:59,480
Yeah, he rescued them.

3012
03:00:59,480 --> 03:01:01,480
Yes, dude.

3013
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:03,480
Oh, no.

3014
03:01:03,480 --> 03:01:05,480
In the lynchian line, this black and white photo,

3015
03:01:05,480 --> 03:01:07,480
he's sitting on a sofa with like

3016
03:01:07,480 --> 03:01:09,480
five Woody Woodpecker dolls.

3017
03:01:09,480 --> 03:01:11,480
There's a video. I'm linking the video.

3018
03:01:11,480 --> 03:01:13,480
This is one of my favorite videos ever.

3019
03:01:15,480 --> 03:01:17,480
Okay.

3020
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:19,480
And Snake knows it.

3021
03:01:19,480 --> 03:01:21,480
Is it as good as

3022
03:01:21,480 --> 03:01:23,480
David Lynch cooks quinoa?

3023
03:01:23,480 --> 03:01:25,480
Ben, it's better.

3024
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:27,480
No way.

3025
03:01:27,480 --> 03:01:29,480
See, here's the thing.

3026
03:01:29,480 --> 03:01:31,480
I think there's nothing macabre about it.

3027
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:33,480
It's potentially macabre,

3028
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:35,480
but the macabre has been denied.

3029
03:01:35,480 --> 03:01:37,480
Well, here's the thing, Snake,

3030
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:39,480
is that there's a follow-up to this video

3031
03:01:39,480 --> 03:01:41,480
where he talks about

3032
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:43,480
this video in an interview he did once,

3033
03:01:43,480 --> 03:01:45,480
where he

3034
03:01:45,480 --> 03:01:47,480
ends talking

3035
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:49,480
about these Woody Woodpecker dolls

3036
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:51,480
with, they're not in my life anymore.

3037
03:01:51,480 --> 03:01:53,480
Oh, okay.

3038
03:01:55,480 --> 03:01:57,480
I forgot about, yeah,

3039
03:01:57,480 --> 03:01:59,480
I said it just very vaguely in an interview.

3040
03:01:59,480 --> 03:02:01,480
They're not in my life anymore.

3041
03:02:01,480 --> 03:02:03,480
With no elucidation.

3042
03:02:03,480 --> 03:02:05,480
Like, what did they do to him?

3043
03:02:05,480 --> 03:02:07,480
Oh, I love, I love

3044
03:02:07,480 --> 03:02:09,480
any chance

3045
03:02:09,480 --> 03:02:11,480
I get to link this fucking

3046
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:13,480
David Lynch Woody Woodpecker video.

3047
03:02:13,480 --> 03:02:15,480
Yeah, the pin drop,

3048
03:02:15,480 --> 03:02:17,480
the shoe, the other shoe.

3049
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:21,480
Something, something macabre,

3050
03:02:21,480 --> 03:02:23,480
something, something.

3051
03:02:23,480 --> 03:02:25,480
Dried up, dried up December.

3052
03:02:25,480 --> 03:02:27,480
Okay, my question is,

3053
03:02:27,480 --> 03:02:29,480
if he is

3054
03:02:29,480 --> 03:02:31,480
participating in an event like dried up December,

3055
03:02:31,480 --> 03:02:33,480
no November, is that a form of art,

3056
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:35,480
that participation?

3057
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:37,480
Or does that count as anything?

3058
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:39,480
I am of the games or art crowd,

3059
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:41,480
I think art is a very

3060
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:43,480
broad thing where if it's meant to

3061
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:45,480
star an emotion in you,

3062
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:47,480
then it can qualify.

3063
03:02:47,480 --> 03:02:49,480
Something being bad doesn't mean it's not art,

3064
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:51,480
it means it's bad art.

3065
03:02:51,480 --> 03:02:53,480
I agree. Yeah, and

3066
03:02:53,480 --> 03:02:55,480
that's your argument that

3067
03:02:55,480 --> 03:02:57,480
dried up December is art.

3068
03:02:57,480 --> 03:02:59,480
It's not just art, it's a movement.

3069
03:02:59,480 --> 03:03:01,480
A bowel movement, if you will.

3070
03:03:01,480 --> 03:03:03,480
I'm gonna disagree, because

3071
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:05,480
I think that the creation

3072
03:03:05,480 --> 03:03:07,480
of dried up December

3073
03:03:07,480 --> 03:03:09,480
obviously was inspired

3074
03:03:09,480 --> 03:03:11,480
and is a work of art.

3075
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:13,480
Dried up December as a concept is a work of art.

3076
03:03:13,480 --> 03:03:15,480
Merely participating in dried up December,

3077
03:03:15,480 --> 03:03:17,480
merely

3078
03:03:17,480 --> 03:03:19,480
executing upon

3079
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:21,480
the ideas contained within,

3080
03:03:21,480 --> 03:03:23,480
I don't think I would call that art.

3081
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:25,480
I would call that

3082
03:03:25,480 --> 03:03:27,480
performance art.

3083
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:29,480
I think that's contributing to

3084
03:03:29,480 --> 03:03:31,480
the, I mean, I guess that's the

3085
03:03:31,480 --> 03:03:33,480
separation between art and artist, right?

3086
03:03:33,480 --> 03:03:35,480
You're not an artist

3087
03:03:35,480 --> 03:03:37,480
when you play a video game.

3088
03:03:37,480 --> 03:03:39,480
You're an artist when you make a video game.

3089
03:03:39,480 --> 03:03:41,480
I don't know, I've never seen my videos.

3090
03:03:41,480 --> 03:03:43,480
When you design the game.

3091
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:45,480
You participate

3092
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:47,480
in the game that you play,

3093
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:49,480
but you don't

3094
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:51,480
make art by playing a video game.

3095
03:03:51,480 --> 03:03:53,480
You participate in art that someone else made.

3096
03:03:53,480 --> 03:03:55,480
I don't know.

3097
03:03:55,480 --> 03:03:57,480
I think dried up December

3098
03:03:57,480 --> 03:03:59,480
is a distinct and new

3099
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:01,480
from these

3100
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:03,480
terms.

3101
03:04:03,480 --> 03:04:05,480
If you make

3102
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:07,480
a let's play, that could be

3103
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:09,480
considered art.

3104
03:04:09,480 --> 03:04:11,480
If you're doing dried up December, you have to

3105
03:04:11,480 --> 03:04:13,480
catalog the process.

3106
03:04:13,480 --> 03:04:15,480
If you publicly perform it and you

3107
03:04:15,480 --> 03:04:17,480
catalog it, then of course.

3108
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:19,480
I do just want to actually say

3109
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:21,480
for sake of

3110
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:23,480
let's plays as art.

3111
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:25,480
If you've ever seen Sonic 2 Special Edition,

3112
03:04:25,480 --> 03:04:27,480
that is art.

3113
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:29,480
That's some old, something awful.

3114
03:04:29,480 --> 03:04:31,480
Sonic 2 Special Edition.

3115
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:33,480
Is this text LP shit?

3116
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:35,480
It's not text LP.

3117
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:37,480
It's an absolutely hilarious

3118
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:39,480
let's play that kind of builds on

3119
03:04:39,480 --> 03:04:41,480
the old jokes about just how much cut content

3120
03:04:41,480 --> 03:04:43,480
there was in Sonic 2.

3121
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:45,480
It just kind of builds on that

3122
03:04:45,480 --> 03:04:47,480
into an absurdist joke where the game just

3123
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:49,480
gradually breaks down

3124
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:51,480
and the edits get more and more absurdist.

3125
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:53,480
At one point, a level

3126
03:04:53,480 --> 03:04:55,480
just is played like memento

3127
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:57,480
essentially.

3128
03:04:57,480 --> 03:04:59,480
Is it this?

3129
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:01,480
I believe so.

3130
03:05:01,480 --> 03:05:03,480
I watched it on the LP archive

3131
03:05:03,480 --> 03:05:05,480
years and years ago.

3132
03:05:05,480 --> 03:05:07,480
I'll give this a watch. This looks right.

3133
03:05:07,480 --> 03:05:09,480
Yeah.

3134
03:05:09,480 --> 03:05:11,480
I'm trying to remember the name

3135
03:05:11,480 --> 03:05:13,480
of the guy who made it. I still follow him on Twitter.

3136
03:05:13,480 --> 03:05:15,480
He's still around. He just doesn't do LP stuff anymore.

3137
03:05:15,480 --> 03:05:17,480
Doc Future?

3138
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:19,480
Doc Future. Yes. This is the guy.

3139
03:05:19,480 --> 03:05:21,480
Yeah.

3140
03:05:33,480 --> 03:05:35,480
Interesting. Alright. I'll give this a watch.

3141
03:05:35,480 --> 03:05:37,480
This sounds cool.

3142
03:05:37,480 --> 03:05:39,480
Yeah. It's a fun old LP

3143
03:05:39,480 --> 03:05:41,480
and kind of something awful.

3144
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:43,480
I think that's actually where I got a lot of my

3145
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:45,480
old weird internet

3146
03:05:45,480 --> 03:05:47,480
sensibilities that have steadily dropped away.

3147
03:05:47,480 --> 03:05:49,480
Is this where I count?

3148
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:51,480
Yup. There'd be Doc Future.

3149
03:05:53,480 --> 03:05:55,480
Interesting.

3150
03:05:55,480 --> 03:05:57,480
Fascinating.

3151
03:05:57,480 --> 03:05:59,480
I really like really

3152
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:01,480
something awful LP's where people would get

3153
03:06:01,480 --> 03:06:03,480
really

3154
03:06:03,480 --> 03:06:05,480
creative with it.

3155
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:07,480
Put them on blue.

3156
03:06:07,480 --> 03:06:09,480
Oh yeah.

3157
03:06:09,480 --> 03:06:11,480
I have enjoyed your video series.

3158
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:13,480
Thank you.

3159
03:06:13,480 --> 03:06:15,480
This isn't...

3160
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:17,480
Is this the guy?

3161
03:06:17,480 --> 03:06:19,480
Oh wait. This is the guy behind Petscop?

3162
03:06:19,480 --> 03:06:21,480
No. No. The guy

3163
03:06:21,480 --> 03:06:23,480
who uploaded the video did a

3164
03:06:23,480 --> 03:06:25,480
or like he was basically

3165
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:27,480
describing the series.

3166
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:29,480
Because this is a reupload. He said,

3167
03:06:29,480 --> 03:06:31,480
think a more comedic version of Petscop.

3168
03:06:31,480 --> 03:06:33,480
I misspoke.

3169
03:06:33,480 --> 03:06:35,480
I thought I recognized the name

3170
03:06:35,480 --> 03:06:37,480
and I thought maybe...

3171
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:39,480
I made Petscop his name as

3172
03:06:39,480 --> 03:06:41,480
Tony.

3173
03:06:41,480 --> 03:06:43,480
I think it's just Twitter app.

3174
03:06:43,480 --> 03:06:45,480
This is just for me

3175
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:47,480
and maybe tech, but I've just noticed

3176
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:49,480
the uploader's name is Mike Dawson

3177
03:06:49,480 --> 03:06:51,480
and now I'm wondering if this is a

3178
03:06:51,480 --> 03:06:53,480
Retsuit Pre-reference

3179
03:06:53,480 --> 03:06:55,480
the uploader of Sonic 2.

3180
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:57,480
Is that the name of...

3181
03:06:57,480 --> 03:06:59,480
Mike Dawson is the guy from

3182
03:06:59,480 --> 03:07:01,480
Darkseed.

3183
03:07:01,480 --> 03:07:03,480
While I'm just going off

3184
03:07:03,480 --> 03:07:05,480
of weird trivia, the guy who wrote

3185
03:07:05,480 --> 03:07:07,480
Sonic 2, Benson also

3186
03:07:07,480 --> 03:07:09,480
wrote the Metal Gear Solid 1

3187
03:07:09,480 --> 03:07:11,480
novelization, which is awful.

3188
03:07:11,480 --> 03:07:13,480
That's insane.

3189
03:07:13,480 --> 03:07:15,480
That's the one that canonizes

3190
03:07:15,480 --> 03:07:17,480
Snake as a dog musher.

3191
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:19,480
Yeah.

3192
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:21,480
What?

3193
03:07:21,480 --> 03:07:23,480
Is it actually bad?

3194
03:07:23,480 --> 03:07:25,480
No. I actually can't say with 100%

3195
03:07:25,480 --> 03:07:27,480
certainty whether that's the case.

3196
03:07:27,480 --> 03:07:29,480
I think Metal Gear Solid 1 itself

3197
03:07:29,480 --> 03:07:31,480
does allude to the fact that Snake

3198
03:07:31,480 --> 03:07:33,480
was taking part in the idea of a rod.

3199
03:07:33,480 --> 03:07:35,480
Yeah.

3200
03:07:35,480 --> 03:07:37,480
A dog musher. I actually don't know

3201
03:07:37,480 --> 03:07:39,480
if that's the correct term. Basically

3202
03:07:39,480 --> 03:07:41,480
he retired

3203
03:07:41,480 --> 03:07:43,480
from the military

3204
03:07:43,480 --> 03:07:45,480
or whatever and he went to Alaska

3205
03:07:45,480 --> 03:07:47,480
to

3206
03:07:47,480 --> 03:07:49,480
mush dogs.

3207
03:07:49,480 --> 03:07:51,480
Slay dogs.

3208
03:07:51,480 --> 03:07:53,480
Thank you.

3209
03:07:53,480 --> 03:07:55,480
When you crack the whip and you go

3210
03:07:55,480 --> 03:07:57,480
mush, mush.

3211
03:07:57,480 --> 03:07:59,480
Oh yeah, right.

3212
03:07:59,480 --> 03:08:01,480
The briefing mission.

3213
03:08:01,480 --> 03:08:03,480
The fucking dogs.

3214
03:08:03,480 --> 03:08:05,480
I forgot Roy.

3215
03:08:05,480 --> 03:08:07,480
You bastard.

3216
03:08:07,480 --> 03:08:09,480
I didn't watch that when I first

3217
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:11,480
played the game. I watched it later

3218
03:08:11,480 --> 03:08:13,480
and I was like, holy shit. Roy sucks.

3219
03:08:13,480 --> 03:08:15,480
I get that it's

3220
03:08:15,480 --> 03:08:17,480
desperate, but still.

3221
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:19,480
That's a pretty crazy first impression.

3222
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:21,480
Metal Gear Solid is great.

3223
03:08:21,480 --> 03:08:23,480
Metal Gear Solid series.

3224
03:08:23,480 --> 03:08:25,480
A lot of fun.

3225
03:08:25,480 --> 03:08:27,480
A lot of fun, guy friends to kill dogs.

3226
03:08:27,480 --> 03:08:29,480
I've only played

3227
03:08:29,480 --> 03:08:31,480
the first one and I didn't even beat it

3228
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:33,480
because I'm a fucking noob.

3229
03:08:33,480 --> 03:08:35,480
Well, you at least

3230
03:08:35,480 --> 03:08:37,480
watched the Mathematosis reviews, right?

3231
03:08:37,480 --> 03:08:39,480
Of course.

3232
03:08:39,480 --> 03:08:41,480
Of course.

3233
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:43,480
I'll watch anything he puts out.

3234
03:08:43,480 --> 03:08:45,480
I'll play his fucking game too

3235
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:47,480
whenever it's done.

3236
03:08:47,480 --> 03:08:49,480
Just to say I did.

3237
03:08:49,480 --> 03:08:51,480
I'll pay $10 for it

3238
03:08:51,480 --> 03:08:53,480
on Steam, but no more.

3239
03:08:53,480 --> 03:08:55,480
Next voicemail

3240
03:08:55,480 --> 03:08:57,480
is called

3241
03:08:57,480 --> 03:08:59,480
Voice Grail

3242
03:08:59,480 --> 03:09:01,480
3, 2, 1

3243
03:09:01,480 --> 03:09:03,480
Go.

3244
03:09:03,480 --> 03:09:05,480
Hello, it is me.

3245
03:09:05,480 --> 03:09:07,480
The golden bitch, Trixie.

3246
03:09:07,480 --> 03:09:09,480
Also known as Dark Gazers.

3247
03:09:09,480 --> 03:09:11,480
And since we're retroactively

3248
03:09:11,480 --> 03:09:13,480
voice grailing people,

3249
03:09:13,480 --> 03:09:15,480
I would like to nominate

3250
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:17,480
Tommy J. for voice grail.

3251
03:09:17,480 --> 03:09:19,480
Thank you.

3252
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:21,480
I really thought he was

3253
03:09:21,480 --> 03:09:23,480
going to nominate himself.

3254
03:09:23,480 --> 03:09:25,480
I didn't go where I was expecting.

3255
03:09:25,480 --> 03:09:27,480
I think, you know what?

3256
03:09:27,480 --> 03:09:29,480
You know what?

3257
03:09:29,480 --> 03:09:31,480
If the illustrious Doid Gazers

3258
03:09:31,480 --> 03:09:33,480
makes Trixie the golden bitch.

3259
03:09:33,480 --> 03:09:35,480
If he makes Trixie the golden bitch.

3260
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:37,480
If he makes Trixie the golden bitch.

3261
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:39,480
I was going to say we'll do it

3262
03:09:39,480 --> 03:09:41,480
if he wants us to, but no, you're right.

3263
03:09:41,480 --> 03:09:43,480
No, he's going to sing for us.

3264
03:09:43,480 --> 03:09:45,480
Sing for us.

3265
03:09:45,480 --> 03:09:47,480
Dance slave.

3266
03:09:47,480 --> 03:09:49,480
Dance slave.

3267
03:09:49,480 --> 03:09:51,480
Snake is BRB.

3268
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:53,480
We can

3269
03:09:53,480 --> 03:09:55,480
listen to the next one.

3270
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:57,480
Well, he's gone. It is called

3271
03:09:57,480 --> 03:09:59,480
Your Gay.

3272
03:09:59,480 --> 03:10:01,480
LeMau.

3273
03:10:01,480 --> 03:10:03,480
As in the letters, U-R-G-A-Y.

3274
03:10:03,480 --> 03:10:05,480
Here we go.

3275
03:10:05,480 --> 03:10:07,480
3, 2, 1, Go.

3276
03:10:07,480 --> 03:10:09,480
You guys are

3277
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:11,480
shitting on crypto and bitcoin all the time.

3278
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:13,480
And it's

3279
03:10:13,480 --> 03:10:15,480
getting infuriating.

3280
03:10:15,480 --> 03:10:17,480
I mean, just think about this.

3281
03:10:17,480 --> 03:10:19,480
If you would put $500

3282
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:21,480
bitcoin one month ago,

3283
03:10:21,480 --> 03:10:23,480
today you'd have $300.

3284
03:10:23,480 --> 03:10:25,480
Think about that.

3285
03:10:25,480 --> 03:10:27,480
True.

3286
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:29,480
He's going to love this one.

3287
03:10:29,480 --> 03:10:31,480
On a long enough timeline,

3288
03:10:31,480 --> 03:10:33,480
on a long enough timeline,

3289
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:35,480
the value of every investment

3290
03:10:35,480 --> 03:10:37,480
is zero.

3291
03:10:37,480 --> 03:10:39,480
Think about it.

3292
03:10:39,480 --> 03:10:41,480
Really think about it.

3293
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:43,480
Really mull it over.

3294
03:10:43,480 --> 03:10:45,480
Buy gold.

3295
03:10:45,480 --> 03:10:47,480
Buy gold. It's the only truly safe asset.

3296
03:10:47,480 --> 03:10:49,480
No, you want to buy silver.

3297
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:51,480
It's going to go up.

3298
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:53,480
Don't worry.

3299
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:55,480
Actually, you want to buy copper?

3300
03:10:55,480 --> 03:10:57,480
Actually, because it's

3301
03:10:57,480 --> 03:10:59,480
like silver, but it's heavier,

3302
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:01,480
so it's harder for them to steal

3303
03:11:01,480 --> 03:11:03,480
your value.

3304
03:11:03,480 --> 03:11:05,480
And it'll always be valuable.

3305
03:11:05,480 --> 03:11:07,480
Yeah.

3306
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:09,480
Steal other people's copper.

3307
03:11:09,480 --> 03:11:11,480
How about that?

3308
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:13,480
Steal would be a pretty good asset.

3309
03:11:13,480 --> 03:11:15,480
Maybe we can get our hands on some of that.

3310
03:11:15,480 --> 03:11:17,480
It's pretty valuable in Dwarf Fortress.

3311
03:11:17,480 --> 03:11:19,480
It's like the most valuable metal.

3312
03:11:19,480 --> 03:11:21,480
Aside from Adamantium, obviously.

3313
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:23,480
Obviously.

3314
03:11:23,480 --> 03:11:25,480
Aside from Adamantium, obviously.

3315
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:27,480
All right.

3316
03:11:27,480 --> 03:11:29,480
Next voicemail

3317
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:31,480
is called

3318
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:33,480
I'll be a little embarrassed if we get to the end of these

3319
03:11:33,480 --> 03:11:35,480
and we end the episode.

3320
03:11:35,480 --> 03:11:37,480
Snake is still gone.

3321
03:11:37,480 --> 03:11:39,480
We have to sheepishly explain.

3322
03:11:39,480 --> 03:11:41,480
Episode ended while you were away.

3323
03:11:41,480 --> 03:11:43,480
Sorry.

3324
03:11:43,480 --> 03:11:45,480
Yeah, next time.

3325
03:11:45,480 --> 03:11:47,480
Okay, this one is called

3326
03:11:47,480 --> 03:11:49,480
Penny Packer.

3327
03:11:49,480 --> 03:11:51,480
Okay.

3328
03:11:51,480 --> 03:11:53,480
Three, two, one, go.

3329
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:55,480
Sup, guys.

3330
03:11:55,480 --> 03:11:57,480
I was just watching VTubers

3331
03:11:57,480 --> 03:11:59,480
and my friend told me to leave a message.

3332
03:11:59,480 --> 03:12:01,480
I haven't watched this

3333
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:03,480
or listened to this podcast

3334
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:05,480
for like two years.

3335
03:12:05,480 --> 03:12:07,480
I just want to say

3336
03:12:07,480 --> 03:12:09,480
Ben is gay.

3337
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:11,480
Hippo used to be pretty cool.

3338
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:13,480
He's just a little cool now.

3339
03:12:13,480 --> 03:12:15,480
And Nate

3340
03:12:15,480 --> 03:12:17,480
Well, Nate doesn't even exist.

3341
03:12:17,480 --> 03:12:19,480
See ya.

3342
03:12:19,480 --> 03:12:21,480
That was a great voicemail.

3343
03:12:21,480 --> 03:12:23,480
Damn. 10 out of 10.

3344
03:12:23,480 --> 03:12:25,480
That was...

3345
03:12:25,480 --> 03:12:27,480
That was appreciate the misgendering.

3346
03:12:27,480 --> 03:12:29,480
I can't believe I've been gaslit by Nate.

3347
03:12:29,480 --> 03:12:31,480
Yeah.

3348
03:12:31,480 --> 03:12:33,480
Well, not by Nate.

3349
03:12:33,480 --> 03:12:35,480
Yeah.

3350
03:12:35,480 --> 03:12:37,480
Everyone's been gaslit by Nate.

3351
03:12:37,480 --> 03:12:39,480
Oh.

3352
03:12:39,480 --> 03:12:41,480
Everyone was gaslit

3353
03:12:41,480 --> 03:12:43,480
when he said he was going to make

3354
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:45,480
Best Anime Ever

3355
03:12:45,480 --> 03:12:47,480
Ghost in the Shell

3356
03:12:47,480 --> 03:12:49,480
Ghost in the Shell

3357
03:12:49,480 --> 03:12:51,480
And then he gaslit us all

3358
03:12:51,480 --> 03:12:53,480
with that video about the movie.

3359
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:55,480
And then he said,

3360
03:12:55,480 --> 03:12:57,480
No, you're crazy.

3361
03:12:57,480 --> 03:12:59,480
That's the video, guys.

3362
03:12:59,480 --> 03:13:01,480
He said, why?

3363
03:13:01,480 --> 03:13:03,480
Why?

3364
03:13:03,480 --> 03:13:05,480
Okay.

3365
03:13:05,480 --> 03:13:07,480
So, that's...

3366
03:13:07,480 --> 03:13:09,480
Uh...

3367
03:13:09,480 --> 03:13:11,480
Nate fans?

3368
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:13,480
I don't know. I don't trust them.

3369
03:13:13,480 --> 03:13:15,480
I don't trust them.

3370
03:13:15,480 --> 03:13:17,480
They don't trust themselves.

3371
03:13:17,480 --> 03:13:19,480
Yeah.

3372
03:13:19,480 --> 03:13:21,480
It looks like I'm missing the next voicemail

3373
03:13:21,480 --> 03:13:23,480
for some reason, but I will get it

3374
03:13:23,480 --> 03:13:25,480
really quick.

3375
03:13:25,480 --> 03:13:27,480
Why is it not in my...

3376
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:29,480
What does it mean to be the best anime ever?

3377
03:13:29,480 --> 03:13:31,480
What does it mean to be that?

3378
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:33,480
I mean, the deal with Nate Stick,

3379
03:13:33,480 --> 03:13:35,480
you know, it was sort of self-consciously

3380
03:13:35,480 --> 03:13:37,480
like, uh, you know.

3381
03:13:37,480 --> 03:13:39,480
He makes a Best Anime Ever video

3382
03:13:39,480 --> 03:13:41,480
about multiple different

3383
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:43,480
animes. You can have multiple different

3384
03:13:43,480 --> 03:13:45,480
Best Anime Ever.

3385
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:47,480
It's just whatever you feel.

3386
03:13:47,480 --> 03:13:49,480
There's no rules.

3387
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:51,480
What does it mean to me?

3388
03:13:51,480 --> 03:13:53,480
This isn't a question for anyone else.

3389
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:55,480
This is me putting my thoughts out.

3390
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:57,480
I want your 5 paragraph essay

3391
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:59,480
on what makes the Best Anime Ever

3392
03:13:59,480 --> 03:14:01,480
to you on my desk by next Thursday.

3393
03:14:01,480 --> 03:14:03,480
We famously discussed

3394
03:14:03,480 --> 03:14:05,480
the question of the best game ever

3395
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:07,480
on the very first episode

3396
03:14:07,480 --> 03:14:09,480
of this podcast, and we came to the irrefutable

3397
03:14:09,480 --> 03:14:11,480
conclusion that Undertale

3398
03:14:11,480 --> 03:14:13,480
is, in fact, the best game ever.

3399
03:14:13,480 --> 03:14:15,480
Ah, yes. The most beloved 7 out of 10

3400
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:17,480
ever made.

3401
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:19,480
Uh-oh.

3402
03:14:19,480 --> 03:14:21,480
Savage.

3403
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:23,480
Cruel.

3404
03:14:23,480 --> 03:14:25,480
The most beloved 7 out of 10 ever made

3405
03:14:25,480 --> 03:14:27,480
is definitely Dark Cloud

3406
03:14:27,480 --> 03:14:29,480
for...

3407
03:14:29,480 --> 03:14:31,480
I've got to admit some of my own

3408
03:14:31,480 --> 03:14:33,480
uh...

3409
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:35,480
Not cagey-ness.

3410
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:37,480
I've made that joke about Dark Souls,

3411
03:14:37,480 --> 03:14:39,480
but I just undercut my own opinions for an easy jab,

3412
03:14:39,480 --> 03:14:41,480
and I will do that at a moment's notice.

3413
03:14:41,480 --> 03:14:43,480
I believe that about Dark Souls, and ironically,

3414
03:14:43,480 --> 03:14:45,480
and we'll stand by that.

3415
03:14:45,480 --> 03:14:47,480
No, I actually do.

3416
03:14:47,480 --> 03:14:49,480
I don't actually believe in number grades.

3417
03:14:49,480 --> 03:14:51,480
I've never finished Dark Souls, because I just always get bored

3418
03:14:51,480 --> 03:14:53,480
when I get to Anor Londo,

3419
03:14:53,480 --> 03:14:55,480
and I'm like, I've had my fill.

3420
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:57,480
I'm done.

3421
03:14:57,480 --> 03:14:59,480
I beat Dark Souls, but I did get bored

3422
03:14:59,480 --> 03:15:01,480
partway through number two.

3423
03:15:01,480 --> 03:15:03,480
Two is terrible.

3424
03:15:03,480 --> 03:15:05,480
I got to the Royal Rat Authority

3425
03:15:05,480 --> 03:15:07,480
and was like, I'm done with this fucking game.

3426
03:15:07,480 --> 03:15:09,480
I did beat the Royal Rat Authority.

3427
03:15:09,480 --> 03:15:11,480
And it's like, these controls

3428
03:15:11,480 --> 03:15:13,480
are unbearably bad,

3429
03:15:13,480 --> 03:15:15,480
even compared to the first time I went out.

3430
03:15:15,480 --> 03:15:17,480
I really tried to stick with it.

3431
03:15:17,480 --> 03:15:19,480
I really gave it a shot.

3432
03:15:19,480 --> 03:15:21,480
Um...

3433
03:15:21,480 --> 03:15:23,480
I don't know, I just never got the satisfaction

3434
03:15:23,480 --> 03:15:25,480
I felt other people were really, like,

3435
03:15:25,480 --> 03:15:27,480
clamoring from it.

3436
03:15:27,480 --> 03:15:29,480
Same.

3437
03:15:29,480 --> 03:15:31,480
It really makes me sad,

3438
03:15:31,480 --> 03:15:33,480
because the reason I powered through Dark Souls one

3439
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:35,480
is I wanted to have that epiphany

3440
03:15:35,480 --> 03:15:37,480
and come out on the other side getting it,

3441
03:15:37,480 --> 03:15:39,480
and I just never did.

3442
03:15:39,480 --> 03:15:41,480
There's kind of...

3443
03:15:41,480 --> 03:15:43,480
This is a kind of okay

3444
03:15:43,480 --> 03:15:45,480
hack and slash with

3445
03:15:45,480 --> 03:15:47,480
sort of grim setting,

3446
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:49,480
and it's like, I don't know, this stuff has existed

3447
03:15:49,480 --> 03:15:51,480
for years already.

3448
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:53,480
I think part of the appeal

3449
03:15:53,480 --> 03:15:55,480
of something like a Dark Souls

3450
03:15:55,480 --> 03:15:57,480
or a Demon Souls is that,

3451
03:15:57,480 --> 03:15:59,480
like, while

3452
03:15:59,480 --> 03:16:01,480
from software it was making it,

3453
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:03,480
it was very obvious that they knew

3454
03:16:03,480 --> 03:16:05,480
or that they didn't think it was going to be

3455
03:16:05,480 --> 03:16:07,480
this huge fucking phenomenon,

3456
03:16:07,480 --> 03:16:09,480
it just feels like a pretty

3457
03:16:09,480 --> 03:16:11,480
niche game that somehow

3458
03:16:11,480 --> 03:16:13,480
managed to come out.

3459
03:16:13,480 --> 03:16:15,480
There's nothing about it that stands out as

3460
03:16:15,480 --> 03:16:17,480
like, oh, this is a revolution in gaming,

3461
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:19,480
clearly.

3462
03:16:19,480 --> 03:16:21,480
It's just really good.

3463
03:16:21,480 --> 03:16:23,480
I suppose I should really balance the elements.

3464
03:16:23,480 --> 03:16:25,480
I suppose I should walk back a little

3465
03:16:25,480 --> 03:16:27,480
just so I'm not just being

3466
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:29,480
contrarian, because that's not what I'm trying to do.

3467
03:16:29,480 --> 03:16:31,480
I think it's just, it came out when

3468
03:16:31,480 --> 03:16:33,480
there was a big discussion on

3469
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:35,480
AAA games that are too easy

3470
03:16:35,480 --> 03:16:37,480
and it

3471
03:16:37,480 --> 03:16:39,480
right place at the right time.

3472
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:41,480
That's very true.

3473
03:16:41,480 --> 03:16:43,480
Definitely, definitely.

3474
03:16:43,480 --> 03:16:45,480
And it's like, right place at the right time, it was refreshing

3475
03:16:45,480 --> 03:16:47,480
for that, but I've been

3476
03:16:47,480 --> 03:16:49,480
like, oh, this is going to sound really arrogant,

3477
03:16:49,480 --> 03:16:51,480
and I apologize to anyone who takes it.

3478
03:16:51,480 --> 03:16:53,480
I've been playing weird jank PC games my whole life,

3479
03:16:53,480 --> 03:16:55,480
and it was, I don't know,

3480
03:16:55,480 --> 03:16:57,480
it was

3481
03:16:57,480 --> 03:16:59,480
interesting from the outside

3482
03:16:59,480 --> 03:17:01,480
in that regard.

3483
03:17:01,480 --> 03:17:03,480
Discussing difficulties always going to be kind of hard.

3484
03:17:03,480 --> 03:17:05,480
It's tricky, because

3485
03:17:05,480 --> 03:17:07,480
it's a tricky debate, because

3486
03:17:07,480 --> 03:17:09,480
everyone is at a different skill level.

3487
03:17:09,480 --> 03:17:11,480
There's no perfect baseline to

3488
03:17:11,480 --> 03:17:13,480
judge it from.

3489
03:17:13,480 --> 03:17:15,480
And I don't even think like, difficulty is

3490
03:17:15,480 --> 03:17:17,480
the interesting, well, people are

3491
03:17:17,480 --> 03:17:19,480
key to it nowadays, but it's like, difficulty

3492
03:17:19,480 --> 03:17:21,480
is being part of Dark Souls.

3493
03:17:21,480 --> 03:17:23,480
It's the tone and atmosphere.

3494
03:17:23,480 --> 03:17:25,480
If there wasn't like a hook

3495
03:17:25,480 --> 03:17:27,480
to push you through the difficulty, no one would

3496
03:17:27,480 --> 03:17:29,480
beat the game, you know?

3497
03:17:29,480 --> 03:17:31,480
It's like a nice oppressive

3498
03:17:31,480 --> 03:17:33,480
atmosphere, which I am, okay, just

3499
03:17:33,480 --> 03:17:35,480
tonally for myself, I'm not into like

3500
03:17:35,480 --> 03:17:37,480
really oppressive shit.

3501
03:17:37,480 --> 03:17:39,480
It's not really my jam, I guess.

3502
03:17:41,480 --> 03:17:43,480
You're a berserk snake.

3503
03:17:43,480 --> 03:17:45,480
I've tried, I want to,

3504
03:17:45,480 --> 03:17:47,480
I feel bad that I can't get into berserk.

3505
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:49,480
Yeah, that's it.

3506
03:17:49,480 --> 03:17:51,480
Not even like the

3507
03:17:51,480 --> 03:17:53,480
first arc?

3508
03:17:53,480 --> 03:17:55,480
Oh, no. I'm really bad about

3509
03:17:55,480 --> 03:17:57,480
reading manga, like really bad.

3510
03:17:57,480 --> 03:17:59,480
And I kind of don't just want to watch the anime.

3511
03:17:59,480 --> 03:18:01,480
That is one I feel like

3512
03:18:01,480 --> 03:18:03,480
I've got to actually read this.

3513
03:18:03,480 --> 03:18:05,480
I finished two manga in my

3514
03:18:05,480 --> 03:18:07,480
I finished two manga in my life, and I can only remember one

3515
03:18:07,480 --> 03:18:09,480
of them, and it was Anna Satsushin,

3516
03:18:09,480 --> 03:18:11,480
which was a digestible read.

3517
03:18:11,480 --> 03:18:13,480
Unfortunately, none of us are ever going to finish berserk,

3518
03:18:13,480 --> 03:18:15,480
because Mira's dead, and it really

3519
03:18:15,480 --> 03:18:17,480
fucking sucks.

3520
03:18:17,480 --> 03:18:19,480
I don't read that much, but I did

3521
03:18:19,480 --> 03:18:21,480
manage to read all through the

3522
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:23,480
like the first bit,

3523
03:18:23,480 --> 03:18:25,480
the first part of

3524
03:18:25,480 --> 03:18:27,480
berserk that everybody knows.

3525
03:18:27,480 --> 03:18:29,480
I mean, I have been saying that I'm

3526
03:18:29,480 --> 03:18:31,480
going to catch up on one piece for like three years

3527
03:18:31,480 --> 03:18:33,480
now, and I haven't done it.

3528
03:18:33,480 --> 03:18:35,480
The last chapter was really cool there.

3529
03:18:35,480 --> 03:18:37,480
You got so close at Radcon 4, and then you just fell off

3530
03:18:37,480 --> 03:18:39,480
the bandwagon again. Yeah, yeah.

3531
03:18:39,480 --> 03:18:41,480
Now I'll never fulfill the prophecy

3532
03:18:41,480 --> 03:18:43,480
of appearing on an episode, the podcast.

3533
03:18:43,480 --> 03:18:45,480
I

3534
03:18:45,480 --> 03:18:47,480
I did read

3535
03:18:47,480 --> 03:18:49,480
I read all of Death Note, I read all of

3536
03:18:49,480 --> 03:18:51,480
Bakuman.

3537
03:18:51,480 --> 03:18:53,480
Those are really good.

3538
03:18:53,480 --> 03:18:55,480
I read

3539
03:18:55,480 --> 03:18:57,480
You read Chainsaw Man?

3540
03:18:57,480 --> 03:18:59,480
I have not, but I

3541
03:18:59,480 --> 03:19:01,480
I kind of want it.

3542
03:19:01,480 --> 03:19:03,480
I've heard good things. I just don't

3543
03:19:03,480 --> 03:19:05,480
know anything about it other than that it's fucking dope.

3544
03:19:05,480 --> 03:19:07,480
It's a show, it's shown in action,

3545
03:19:07,480 --> 03:19:09,480
so if you like that,

3546
03:19:09,480 --> 03:19:11,480
I think it's probably one of the best

3547
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:13,480
shows in action stories I've

3548
03:19:13,480 --> 03:19:15,480
read.

3549
03:19:15,480 --> 03:19:17,480
I kind of troll about

3550
03:19:17,480 --> 03:19:19,480
on the two best friends

3551
03:19:19,480 --> 03:19:21,480
subreddit a lot. It's actually a decent

3552
03:19:21,480 --> 03:19:23,480
place, and they love

3553
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:25,480
Chainsaw Man, and they're like, okay, I gotta

3554
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:27,480
read that at some point.

3555
03:19:27,480 --> 03:19:29,480
I read one chapter

3556
03:19:29,480 --> 03:19:31,480
while I was on my

3557
03:19:31,480 --> 03:19:33,480
break at work, and when I got home, I just

3558
03:19:33,480 --> 03:19:35,480
like I bingeed the entire run.

3559
03:19:35,480 --> 03:19:37,480
It's technically not done yet.

3560
03:19:37,480 --> 03:19:39,480
I was told it was done,

3561
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:41,480
but it's just like only the first arc

3562
03:19:41,480 --> 03:19:43,480
is over, and it's just sound like hey,

3563
03:19:43,480 --> 03:19:45,480
this for now.

3564
03:19:45,480 --> 03:19:47,480
But what's out right now is

3565
03:19:47,480 --> 03:19:49,480
it's a complete story.

3566
03:19:49,480 --> 03:19:51,480
And it's

3567
03:19:51,480 --> 03:19:53,480
really good. It's like 90-something chapters.

3568
03:19:53,480 --> 03:19:55,480
Cool.

3569
03:19:55,480 --> 03:19:57,480
That's definitely dope.

3570
03:19:57,480 --> 03:19:59,480
Okay, stupid question.

3571
03:19:59,480 --> 03:20:01,480
Mob Psycho 100

3572
03:20:01,480 --> 03:20:03,480
was not a manga, right? It was just an anime.

3573
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:05,480
No, it was

3574
03:20:05,480 --> 03:20:07,480
by the one punch man guy.

3575
03:20:07,480 --> 03:20:09,480
It was a webcomic? Yes.

3576
03:20:09,480 --> 03:20:11,480
No, wait.

3577
03:20:11,480 --> 03:20:13,480
And then it got mangled by

3578
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:15,480
or is there only one punch man getting mangled by the guy you

3579
03:20:15,480 --> 03:20:17,480
did? I assume.

3580
03:20:17,480 --> 03:20:19,480
I know that happened to one punch man.

3581
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:21,480
But I feel like

3582
03:20:21,480 --> 03:20:23,480
Mob Psycho

3583
03:20:23,480 --> 03:20:25,480
Sorry.

3584
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:27,480
One punch man got really big,

3585
03:20:27,480 --> 03:20:29,480
but

3586
03:20:29,480 --> 03:20:31,480
I feel like

3587
03:20:31,480 --> 03:20:33,480
it was a direct to anime.

3588
03:20:33,480 --> 03:20:35,480
No.

3589
03:20:35,480 --> 03:20:37,480
I know the answer to this.

3590
03:20:37,480 --> 03:20:39,480
So one punch man was a webcomic first,

3591
03:20:39,480 --> 03:20:41,480
then it got redone as a manga

3592
03:20:41,480 --> 03:20:43,480
by a really good artist, then it got an anime adaptation.

3593
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:45,480
By the time Mob Psycho

3594
03:20:45,480 --> 03:20:47,480
was started, the webcomic artist had gotten

3595
03:20:47,480 --> 03:20:49,480
a lot better, and they were able to just

3596
03:20:49,480 --> 03:20:51,480
do the manga themselves.

3597
03:20:51,480 --> 03:20:53,480
And then it also got an anime adaptation.

3598
03:20:53,480 --> 03:20:55,480
That's why the art style looks

3599
03:20:55,480 --> 03:20:57,480
a lot more like the webcomic style for one punch man.

3600
03:20:59,480 --> 03:21:01,480
I've not watched all of anime in recent years.

3601
03:21:01,480 --> 03:21:03,480
I fell a thing, but I am going to definitely

3602
03:21:03,480 --> 03:21:05,480
come back for Mob Psycho

3603
03:21:05,480 --> 03:21:07,480
Season 3.

3604
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:09,480
I need to watch Mob Psycho.

3605
03:21:09,480 --> 03:21:11,480
I adore Mob Psycho.

3606
03:21:11,480 --> 03:21:13,480
I read a bunch of one punch man.

3607
03:21:13,480 --> 03:21:15,480
I

3608
03:21:15,480 --> 03:21:17,480
have not read or seen

3609
03:21:17,480 --> 03:21:19,480
Mob Psycho, but I saw

3610
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:21,480
Alec Robbins, the Mr. Boot Guy.

3611
03:21:21,480 --> 03:21:23,480
I guess he just finished Mob Psycho,

3612
03:21:23,480 --> 03:21:25,480
and he said he loved it. He was gushing on Twitter.

3613
03:21:25,480 --> 03:21:27,480
He said it was amazing.

3614
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:29,480
If he likes it, maybe I should read it.

3615
03:21:29,480 --> 03:21:31,480
I adore it because

3616
03:21:31,480 --> 03:21:33,480
it takes a similar theme

3617
03:21:33,480 --> 03:21:35,480
from one punch man of, you know,

3618
03:21:35,480 --> 03:21:37,480
this is the one person with these powers, but it puts it in a more

3619
03:21:37,480 --> 03:21:39,480
kind of juvenile finding oneself

3620
03:21:39,480 --> 03:21:41,480
perspective and not putting all

3621
03:21:41,480 --> 03:21:43,480
of your stock in powers you have, and

3622
03:21:43,480 --> 03:21:45,480
more the thing you want over the natural gifts

3623
03:21:45,480 --> 03:21:47,480
you've been given, and it's very heart

3624
03:21:47,480 --> 03:21:49,480
warming and very nice, and I really like it.

3625
03:21:49,480 --> 03:21:51,480
Let's see.

3626
03:21:51,480 --> 03:21:53,480
Yeah, that's...

3627
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:55,480
I guess I've recently moved that onto

3628
03:21:55,480 --> 03:21:57,480
my shortlist.

3629
03:21:57,480 --> 03:21:59,480
You know what? I gotta admit

3630
03:21:59,480 --> 03:22:01,480
I'm not really sure what you're saying.

3631
03:22:01,480 --> 03:22:03,480
The other day,

3632
03:22:03,480 --> 03:22:05,480
everyone was telling me to watch OddTaxi,

3633
03:22:05,480 --> 03:22:07,480
and I said, no, fuck you.

3634
03:22:07,480 --> 03:22:09,480
But then the other day

3635
03:22:09,480 --> 03:22:11,480
at Friends Giving, I was at Munchie's

3636
03:22:11,480 --> 03:22:13,480
house, and somebody put on OddTaxi,

3637
03:22:13,480 --> 03:22:15,480
and I watched one episode of it, and I was like,

3638
03:22:15,480 --> 03:22:17,480
oh, I'm kind of intrigued.

3639
03:22:17,480 --> 03:22:19,480
Maybe I should watch three of those.

3640
03:22:19,480 --> 03:22:21,480
I watched one...

3641
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:23,480
The one episode, I think it was the first episode,

3642
03:22:23,480 --> 03:22:25,480
and it seemed pretty good, so...

3643
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:27,480
And I was immediately

3644
03:22:27,480 --> 03:22:29,480
like, okay, you know what? Everyone that said

3645
03:22:29,480 --> 03:22:31,480
this is a Ben sort of thing,

3646
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:33,480
they were absolutely right. This is exactly

3647
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:35,480
the kind of thing that I would like.

3648
03:22:35,480 --> 03:22:37,480
So...

3649
03:22:37,480 --> 03:22:39,480
That's not a guarantee that I'll actually watch it,

3650
03:22:39,480 --> 03:22:41,480
because I'm lazy about watching things, even things that I like.

3651
03:22:41,480 --> 03:22:43,480
But we'll see.

3652
03:22:43,480 --> 03:22:45,480
Yeah.

3653
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:47,480
LaMau.

3654
03:22:47,480 --> 03:22:49,480
Next one?

3655
03:22:49,480 --> 03:22:51,480
That was a good episode of GamerZone, we just did.

3656
03:22:51,480 --> 03:22:53,480
Was that an episode of GamerZone?

3657
03:22:53,480 --> 03:22:55,480
We talked about games and anime.

3658
03:22:55,480 --> 03:22:57,480
I'm assuming that's what GamerZone is.

3659
03:22:57,480 --> 03:22:59,480
Oh.

3660
03:22:59,480 --> 03:23:01,480
Sure, sure.

3661
03:23:01,480 --> 03:23:03,480
We should call this podcast the GamerZone.

3662
03:23:03,480 --> 03:23:05,480
The Gaming Zone.

3663
03:23:05,480 --> 03:23:07,480
Gaming.

3664
03:23:07,480 --> 03:23:09,480
The Gaming Zone.

3665
03:23:09,480 --> 03:23:11,480
Next voicemail.

3666
03:23:11,480 --> 03:23:13,480
No!

3667
03:23:13,480 --> 03:23:15,480
Shut up!

3668
03:23:15,480 --> 03:23:17,480
You can't...

3669
03:23:17,480 --> 03:23:19,480
The Bone Zone is the Undertale podcast.

3670
03:23:19,480 --> 03:23:21,480
That's our Undertale side story.

3671
03:23:21,480 --> 03:23:23,480
Oh, goddammit.

3672
03:23:23,480 --> 03:23:25,480
GamerZone only. NSFW.

3673
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:27,480
Next voicemail.

3674
03:23:27,480 --> 03:23:29,480
No!

3675
03:23:29,480 --> 03:23:31,480
Next voicemail is called...

3676
03:23:31,480 --> 03:23:33,480
Wait, no, that's the wrong one.

3677
03:23:33,480 --> 03:23:35,480
I think you posted this one.

3678
03:23:35,480 --> 03:23:37,480
I think this is the wrong one.

3679
03:23:37,480 --> 03:23:39,480
What the fuck?

3680
03:23:41,480 --> 03:23:43,480
Why are these all out of order?

3681
03:23:43,480 --> 03:23:45,480
This man does not have his voicemails together.

3682
03:23:45,480 --> 03:23:47,480
The show's over, we did it.

3683
03:23:47,480 --> 03:23:49,480
This man doesn't...

3684
03:23:49,480 --> 03:23:51,480
Show me a man, I will show you someone

3685
03:23:51,480 --> 03:23:53,480
who doesn't have his voicemails.

3686
03:23:53,480 --> 03:23:55,480
Here's the real one, sorry.

3687
03:23:55,480 --> 03:23:57,480
This one is called Clarification.

3688
03:23:57,480 --> 03:23:59,480
3, 2, 1, go.

3689
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:01,480
I have...

3690
03:24:01,480 --> 03:24:03,480
Bipolar...

3691
03:24:03,480 --> 03:24:05,480
This is so hard.

3692
03:24:05,480 --> 03:24:07,480
This is the same one as last time.

3693
03:24:07,480 --> 03:24:09,480
Wait, we've heard this.

3694
03:24:09,480 --> 03:24:11,480
Yeah.

3695
03:24:11,480 --> 03:24:13,480
You already posted this one, Ben.

3696
03:24:13,480 --> 03:24:15,480
Yeah, this was the file you posted just a second ago.

3697
03:24:15,480 --> 03:24:17,480
Yeah.

3698
03:24:17,480 --> 03:24:19,480
You really rattled today.

3699
03:24:19,480 --> 03:24:21,480
Okay, sorry, sorry.

3700
03:24:21,480 --> 03:24:23,480
Okay, no, this is it.

3701
03:24:23,480 --> 03:24:25,480
This one is called Clarification.

3702
03:24:25,480 --> 03:24:27,480
3, 2, 1, go.

3703
03:24:27,480 --> 03:24:29,480
I just wanted to clear this up.

3704
03:24:29,480 --> 03:24:31,480
When I say you guys in a voicemail,

3705
03:24:31,480 --> 03:24:33,480
I am speaking to Ben

3706
03:24:33,480 --> 03:24:35,480
and presumably a guest

3707
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:37,480
and or Tom if he's there.

3708
03:24:37,480 --> 03:24:39,480
I am in fact not referring to Gib

3709
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:41,480
because I do not speak to women.

3710
03:24:41,480 --> 03:24:43,480
Yes!

3711
03:24:43,480 --> 03:24:45,480
Yes!

3712
03:24:45,480 --> 03:24:47,480
Excellent!

3713
03:24:47,480 --> 03:24:49,480
You've got his priority straight.

3714
03:24:49,480 --> 03:24:51,480
Good man.

3715
03:24:51,480 --> 03:24:53,480
The American people are tired of women.

3716
03:24:53,480 --> 03:24:55,480
Tired of women.

3717
03:24:55,480 --> 03:24:57,480
Women!

3718
03:24:57,480 --> 03:24:59,480
Good for you.

3719
03:24:59,480 --> 03:25:01,480
You can never misgender

3720
03:25:01,480 --> 03:25:03,480
if you don't acknowledge

3721
03:25:03,480 --> 03:25:05,480
their existence

3722
03:25:05,480 --> 03:25:07,480
ever.

3723
03:25:07,480 --> 03:25:09,480
That's a lesson in that.

3724
03:25:09,480 --> 03:25:11,480
Just the facts.

3725
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:13,480
Just the facts, sir, just the facts.

3726
03:25:13,480 --> 03:25:15,480
And by sir,

3727
03:25:15,480 --> 03:25:17,480
there's no one here.

3728
03:25:17,480 --> 03:25:19,480
All assembled.

3729
03:25:19,480 --> 03:25:21,480
Next one,

3730
03:25:21,480 --> 03:25:23,480
and this is the real...

3731
03:25:23,480 --> 03:25:25,480
I swear I'm going to do it right this time.

3732
03:25:25,480 --> 03:25:27,480
Next one is called Timmy's Big USA Adventure.

3733
03:25:27,480 --> 03:25:29,480
3, 2, 1, go.

3734
03:25:29,480 --> 03:25:31,480
3, 2, 1, go.

3735
03:25:31,480 --> 03:25:33,480
3, 2, 1, go.

3736
03:25:33,480 --> 03:25:35,480
Oh my lord!

3737
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:37,480
I do have to say

3738
03:25:37,480 --> 03:25:39,480
hearing Ben talk about the creator's satisfaction

3739
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:41,480
he finds in creating Phantom Worms

3740
03:25:41,480 --> 03:25:43,480
revenge really warms my heart.

3741
03:25:43,480 --> 03:25:45,480
Thanks man.

3742
03:25:45,480 --> 03:25:47,480
When you work really brings

3743
03:25:47,480 --> 03:25:49,480
all the themes and emotional beach

3744
03:25:49,480 --> 03:25:51,480
out in mind to fruition

3745
03:25:51,480 --> 03:25:53,480
it's a beautiful thing.

3746
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:55,480
Now, just to by road

3747
03:25:55,480 --> 03:25:57,480
to Radcon straight from his doorstep

3748
03:25:57,480 --> 03:25:59,480
to fulfill my parasocial fantasy.

3749
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:01,480
Let me see here.

3750
03:26:01,480 --> 03:26:03,480
By road to Radcon.

3751
03:26:03,480 --> 03:26:05,480
Hey sir, is this bus coming

3752
03:26:05,480 --> 03:26:07,480
anytime soon?

3753
03:26:07,480 --> 03:26:09,480
No?

3754
03:26:09,480 --> 03:26:11,480
Why do they keep around these boards

3755
03:26:11,480 --> 03:26:13,480
to leave bus times?

3756
03:26:13,480 --> 03:26:15,480
It's hard enough to find a stop.

3757
03:26:15,480 --> 03:26:17,480
Well,

3758
03:26:17,480 --> 03:26:19,480
let me just take a subway then.

3759
03:26:19,480 --> 03:26:21,480
Wait.

3760
03:26:21,480 --> 03:26:23,480
An isekai to meet Ben Saint

3761
03:26:23,480 --> 03:26:25,480
in Rhapsody.

3762
03:26:25,480 --> 03:26:27,480
You mean in America they close perfectly good subway lines?

3763
03:26:27,480 --> 03:26:29,480
Just to force people to take the car?

3764
03:26:29,480 --> 03:26:31,480
Damn you city planners!

3765
03:26:31,480 --> 03:26:33,480
Just admit it!

3766
03:26:33,480 --> 03:26:35,480
How far do the car companies have their hands

3767
03:26:35,480 --> 03:26:37,480
off your ass?

3768
03:26:37,480 --> 03:26:39,480
How many fingers are they sticking up?

3769
03:26:39,480 --> 03:26:41,480
Fuck this!

3770
03:26:41,480 --> 03:26:43,480
I'm going back to Europe!

3771
03:26:43,480 --> 03:26:45,480
At least stock and give can be done by public transport.

3772
03:26:47,480 --> 03:26:49,480
I don't want to encourage shawking.

3773
03:26:49,480 --> 03:26:51,480
I do like the point that yes,

3774
03:26:51,480 --> 03:26:53,480
our public transport infrastructure

3775
03:26:53,480 --> 03:26:55,480
is just bangin'.

3776
03:26:55,480 --> 03:26:57,480
Like that pride I can take in that.

3777
03:26:57,480 --> 03:26:59,480
The whole country is shit

3778
03:26:59,480 --> 03:27:01,480
but we can get anywhere in it.

3779
03:27:01,480 --> 03:27:03,480
If your country wasn't such a

3780
03:27:03,480 --> 03:27:05,480
piddly little

3781
03:27:05,480 --> 03:27:07,480
such a miserable tiny little island

3782
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:09,480
then

3783
03:27:09,480 --> 03:27:11,480
you say it's piddly and little

3784
03:27:11,480 --> 03:27:13,480
I say it's focused.

3785
03:27:13,480 --> 03:27:15,480
We would have high speed rail

3786
03:27:15,480 --> 03:27:17,480
all over our country if we were tiny.

3787
03:27:17,480 --> 03:27:19,480
That's all I'm saying.

3788
03:27:19,480 --> 03:27:21,480
There's nowhere to even go.

3789
03:27:21,480 --> 03:27:23,480
Maybe you shouldn't have settled

3790
03:27:23,480 --> 03:27:25,480
on such a big lion mess.

3791
03:27:25,480 --> 03:27:27,480
It was our destiny

3792
03:27:27,480 --> 03:27:29,480
and we were manifesting it.

3793
03:27:29,480 --> 03:27:31,480
Thank you and good night.

3794
03:27:31,480 --> 03:27:33,480
The only thing tiny about America

3795
03:27:33,480 --> 03:27:35,480
is our consideration for the working class

3796
03:27:35,480 --> 03:27:37,480
and we're damn proud of it.

3797
03:27:37,480 --> 03:27:39,480
Come on, don't pretend English.

3798
03:27:39,480 --> 03:27:41,480
I thought you were going to mention

3799
03:27:41,480 --> 03:27:43,480
my penis.

3800
03:27:43,480 --> 03:27:45,480
I figured we all knew that by now.

3801
03:27:45,480 --> 03:27:47,480
It seemed redundant.

3802
03:27:47,480 --> 03:27:49,480
So there's two things. Two things tiny

3803
03:27:49,480 --> 03:27:51,480
about America.

3804
03:27:51,480 --> 03:27:53,480
Ben, you're a traitor to America.

3805
03:27:53,480 --> 03:27:55,480
You don't count anymore.

3806
03:27:55,480 --> 03:27:57,480
Someone in America has to have the little dick.

3807
03:27:57,480 --> 03:27:59,480
It's just a law of nature.

3808
03:27:59,480 --> 03:28:01,480
Somebody. It's me.

3809
03:28:01,480 --> 03:28:03,480
I'm somebody.

3810
03:28:03,480 --> 03:28:05,480
I'm the burden for everybody else.

3811
03:28:05,480 --> 03:28:07,480
Somebody

3812
03:28:07,480 --> 03:28:09,480
in the earth has to do

3813
03:28:09,480 --> 03:28:11,480
the Christ-like sacrifice

3814
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:13,480
of having the smallest dick in the world

3815
03:28:13,480 --> 03:28:15,480
so that everyone else can feel

3816
03:28:15,480 --> 03:28:17,480
better about themselves in comparison.

3817
03:28:17,480 --> 03:28:19,480
It's me. You're welcome.

3818
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:21,480
I provide a public service.

3819
03:28:21,480 --> 03:28:23,480
This reminds me,

3820
03:28:23,480 --> 03:28:25,480
it was an interesting bit.

3821
03:28:25,480 --> 03:28:27,480
You guys watched Noah Caldwell-Gervais?

3822
03:28:27,480 --> 03:28:29,480
You know him? I love

3823
03:28:29,480 --> 03:28:31,480
Noah Caldwell-Gervais.

3824
03:28:31,480 --> 03:28:33,480
Did you see his new Forza video?

3825
03:28:33,480 --> 03:28:35,480
Yeah, I have watched that.

3826
03:28:35,480 --> 03:28:37,480
It's great. I'm not even a car guy.

3827
03:28:37,480 --> 03:28:39,480
No, me either.

3828
03:28:39,480 --> 03:28:41,480
And I know he's a car guy,

3829
03:28:41,480 --> 03:28:43,480
but he mentions

3830
03:28:43,480 --> 03:28:45,480
the bit about how

3831
03:28:45,480 --> 03:28:47,480
he has seen a lot of anti-car

3832
03:28:47,480 --> 03:28:49,480
sentiment grow.

3833
03:28:49,480 --> 03:28:51,480
He's a car guy, and I'm an anti-car guy.

3834
03:28:51,480 --> 03:28:53,480
And he said

3835
03:28:53,480 --> 03:28:55,480
it's been interesting watching anti-car

3836
03:28:55,480 --> 03:28:57,480
sentiment grow up around him in recent years.

3837
03:28:57,480 --> 03:28:59,480
And he kind of agrees with a lot of it.

3838
03:28:59,480 --> 03:29:01,480
But he's still a car guy.

3839
03:29:01,480 --> 03:29:03,480
He just loves cars.

3840
03:29:03,480 --> 03:29:05,480
And I don't know.

3841
03:29:05,480 --> 03:29:07,480
I guess I thought that was interesting.

3842
03:29:07,480 --> 03:29:09,480
I just thought that was interesting.

3843
03:29:09,480 --> 03:29:11,480
Maybe we'll get another watch.

3844
03:29:11,480 --> 03:29:13,480
I don't think it's quite cognitive dissonance

3845
03:29:13,480 --> 03:29:15,480
to just kind of understand the

3846
03:29:15,480 --> 03:29:17,480
ramifications of Caldwell.

3847
03:29:17,480 --> 03:29:19,480
But also just know

3848
03:29:19,480 --> 03:29:21,480
it's undeniably fun

3849
03:29:21,480 --> 03:29:23,480
to go fast in a car

3850
03:29:23,480 --> 03:29:25,480
and to enjoy the

3851
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:27,480
engineering thing.

3852
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:29,480
I hate that.

3853
03:29:29,480 --> 03:29:31,480
In that bit, he describes

3854
03:29:31,480 --> 03:29:33,480
the American dream

3855
03:29:33,480 --> 03:29:35,480
and how the car is

3856
03:29:35,480 --> 03:29:37,480
intertwined with the American dream

3857
03:29:37,480 --> 03:29:39,480
and the open road and the freedom to go anywhere.

3858
03:29:39,480 --> 03:29:41,480
In a country

3859
03:29:41,480 --> 03:29:43,480
that's as big and spread out as America,

3860
03:29:43,480 --> 03:29:45,480
car ownership is

3861
03:29:45,480 --> 03:29:47,480
the freedom to go

3862
03:29:47,480 --> 03:29:49,480
whenever you want.

3863
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:51,480
That's fine. That's cool.

3864
03:29:51,480 --> 03:29:53,480
I do understand the appeal of that.

3865
03:29:53,480 --> 03:29:55,480
So like it's

3866
03:29:57,480 --> 03:29:59,480
I just think no is a cool guy.

3867
03:29:59,480 --> 03:30:01,480
I just thought that was interesting.

3868
03:30:01,480 --> 03:30:03,480
I would like to present

3869
03:30:03,480 --> 03:30:05,480
your statement that buses suck.

3870
03:30:05,480 --> 03:30:07,480
Maybe in America they do.

3871
03:30:07,480 --> 03:30:09,480
But America has shit public transport.

3872
03:30:09,480 --> 03:30:11,480
So not surprising.

3873
03:30:11,480 --> 03:30:13,480
Buses in New Zealand are fucking great.

3874
03:30:13,480 --> 03:30:15,480
They're clean. They're shiny.

3875
03:30:15,480 --> 03:30:17,480
They're modern and they're comfortable.

3876
03:30:17,480 --> 03:30:19,480
I would say this.

3877
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:21,480
I won't say all buses are clean,

3878
03:30:21,480 --> 03:30:23,480
but I would say

3879
03:30:23,480 --> 03:30:25,480
the public infrastructure

3880
03:30:25,480 --> 03:30:27,480
we have and you find

3881
03:30:27,480 --> 03:30:29,480
the funniest, craziest people on the bus.

3882
03:30:29,480 --> 03:30:31,480
So got that going.

3883
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:33,480
I don't like that.

3884
03:30:33,480 --> 03:30:35,480
Boston is basically

3885
03:30:35,480 --> 03:30:37,480
good.

3886
03:30:37,480 --> 03:30:39,480
Boston is one of the places

3887
03:30:39,480 --> 03:30:41,480
in America that does have

3888
03:30:41,480 --> 03:30:43,480
a workable public transit system.

3889
03:30:43,480 --> 03:30:45,480
So feeling blessed.

3890
03:30:45,480 --> 03:30:47,480
Feeling blessed.

3891
03:30:47,480 --> 03:30:49,480
Speaking of crazy people on the bus,

3892
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:51,480
I went to high school and I took the bus

3893
03:30:51,480 --> 03:30:53,480
during the last couple of years of high school.

3894
03:30:53,480 --> 03:30:55,480
There was just this guy probably in his 30s

3895
03:30:55,480 --> 03:30:57,480
who was always on the bus.

3896
03:30:57,480 --> 03:30:59,480
He looked like he was permanently cracked out on meth.

3897
03:30:59,480 --> 03:31:01,480
He had the face of a rat.

3898
03:31:01,480 --> 03:31:03,480
His eyes were perfectly circular bulging out of his face.

3899
03:31:03,480 --> 03:31:05,480
Or was he messed out on crack?

3900
03:31:05,480 --> 03:31:07,480
He was one of those things.

3901
03:31:07,480 --> 03:31:09,480
Nobody knows.

3902
03:31:09,480 --> 03:31:11,480
He was one or both.

3903
03:31:11,480 --> 03:31:13,480
His eyes were red

3904
03:31:13,480 --> 03:31:15,480
and he had like a hook nose.

3905
03:31:15,480 --> 03:31:17,480
He looked like an NPC

3906
03:31:17,480 --> 03:31:19,480
in some medieval setting

3907
03:31:19,480 --> 03:31:21,480
who was like...

3908
03:31:21,480 --> 03:31:23,480
He hunched over with a hunch bank.

3909
03:31:23,480 --> 03:31:25,480
Yeah, please, sir, give me a fucking coin.

3910
03:31:25,480 --> 03:31:27,480
Was this an old man?

3911
03:31:27,480 --> 03:31:29,480
No, he was probably

3912
03:31:29,480 --> 03:31:31,480
like early 30s.

3913
03:31:31,480 --> 03:31:33,480
He just had that face.

3914
03:31:33,480 --> 03:31:35,480
He had that build.

3915
03:31:35,480 --> 03:31:37,480
He looked like a goblin of a man.

3916
03:31:37,480 --> 03:31:39,480
And he was on the bus

3917
03:31:39,480 --> 03:31:41,480
every single time in the same spot.

3918
03:31:41,480 --> 03:31:43,480
Wow.

3919
03:31:43,480 --> 03:31:45,480
But a couple of the kids

3920
03:31:45,480 --> 03:31:47,480
would be friendly with him

3921
03:31:47,480 --> 03:31:49,480
because they would just chat with him.

3922
03:31:49,480 --> 03:31:51,480
I say kids because I was

3923
03:31:51,480 --> 03:31:53,480
mid to late teens

3924
03:31:53,480 --> 03:31:55,480
and the kids were probably 11 or 12

3925
03:31:55,480 --> 03:31:57,480
but they were just friendly with him for whatever reason.

3926
03:31:57,480 --> 03:31:59,480
I was always concerned.

3927
03:31:59,480 --> 03:32:01,480
I'm like, no, maybe he's just a nice guy.

3928
03:32:01,480 --> 03:32:03,480
Why wouldn't you want to befriend the local goblin?

3929
03:32:03,480 --> 03:32:05,480
In New Zealand,

3930
03:32:05,480 --> 03:32:07,480
do you get

3931
03:32:07,480 --> 03:32:09,480
the school kids on the back of a bus

3932
03:32:09,480 --> 03:32:11,480
who are blasting tinny music out of their phones?

3933
03:32:11,480 --> 03:32:13,480
No.

3934
03:32:13,480 --> 03:32:15,480
Okay, that's a

3935
03:32:15,480 --> 03:32:17,480
a phenomena for England.

3936
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:19,480
People have their headphones

3937
03:32:19,480 --> 03:32:21,480
in the middle school.

3938
03:32:21,480 --> 03:32:23,480
If you played music,

3939
03:32:23,480 --> 03:32:25,480
the bus driver would turn around and be like, oh, I stop it.

3940
03:32:25,480 --> 03:32:27,480
Oh, no, it wouldn't happen.

3941
03:32:27,480 --> 03:32:29,480
We have the double deck as it'd be upstairs

3942
03:32:29,480 --> 03:32:31,480
and just blasting

3943
03:32:31,480 --> 03:32:33,480
some kind of music.

3944
03:32:33,480 --> 03:32:35,480
It does not that it happens that often

3945
03:32:35,480 --> 03:32:37,480
but when it does happen that someone's

3946
03:32:37,480 --> 03:32:39,480
blasting music out of their phone,

3947
03:32:39,480 --> 03:32:41,480
it's not school kids that usually do it

3948
03:32:41,480 --> 03:32:43,480
or buses that I see.

3949
03:32:43,480 --> 03:32:45,480
It's usually just like some guy

3950
03:32:45,480 --> 03:32:47,480
or just some person.

3951
03:32:47,480 --> 03:32:49,480
Over here, it's always like a gaggle of secondary kids

3952
03:32:49,480 --> 03:32:51,480
which is

3953
03:32:51,480 --> 03:32:53,480
I mean, I guess they got to ride the bus home.

3954
03:32:53,480 --> 03:32:55,480
Gotta do something to entertain yourself.

3955
03:32:55,480 --> 03:32:57,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3956
03:32:59,480 --> 03:33:01,480
I'm always surprised.

3957
03:33:01,480 --> 03:33:03,480
I'm always surprised to see a gang of school kids

3958
03:33:03,480 --> 03:33:05,480
get on the bus

3959
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:07,480
because I rode the bus to school

3960
03:33:07,480 --> 03:33:09,480
but we had school buses.

3961
03:33:09,480 --> 03:33:11,480
They were like, oh yeah, in a city,

3962
03:33:11,480 --> 03:33:13,480
I guess you could just

3963
03:33:13,480 --> 03:33:15,480
sometimes just take the regular bus.

3964
03:33:15,480 --> 03:33:17,480
Why would they have new buses?

3965
03:33:17,480 --> 03:33:19,480
School buses aren't really a thing

3966
03:33:19,480 --> 03:33:21,480
in London unless...

3967
03:33:21,480 --> 03:33:23,480
They're not a thing either in New Zealand.

3968
03:33:23,480 --> 03:33:25,480
It's just for regular buses but we have them everywhere

3969
03:33:25,480 --> 03:33:27,480
running all the time,

3970
03:33:27,480 --> 03:33:29,480
every 30 to 15 minutes for the bus

3971
03:33:29,480 --> 03:33:31,480
at every stop all day around pretty much.

3972
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:33,480
There will be a bus for

3973
03:33:33,480 --> 03:33:35,480
special needs kids

3974
03:33:35,480 --> 03:33:37,480
but besides that,

3975
03:33:37,480 --> 03:33:39,480
yeah, that makes sense.

3976
03:33:41,480 --> 03:33:43,480
Okay,

3977
03:33:43,480 --> 03:33:45,480
well, love

3978
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:47,480
public transport, obviously.

3979
03:33:47,480 --> 03:33:49,480
It's good, that's great.

3980
03:33:49,480 --> 03:33:51,480
This is the last voicemail

3981
03:33:51,480 --> 03:33:53,480
is the next one, I think.

3982
03:33:53,480 --> 03:33:55,480
It's called, I know.

3983
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:57,480
Not that many this week

3984
03:33:57,480 --> 03:33:59,480
in the grand scheme of things.

3985
03:33:59,480 --> 03:34:01,480
This one is called, Why Nate Still Loves Ben?

3986
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:03,480
Three, two, one, go.

3987
03:34:03,480 --> 03:34:05,480
Well, yeah, you're right.

3988
03:34:05,480 --> 03:34:07,480
But I wasn't even talking about Ben.

3989
03:34:07,480 --> 03:34:09,480
Oh, I mean Ben, you know.

3990
03:34:09,480 --> 03:34:11,480
Ben would not

3991
03:34:11,480 --> 03:34:13,480
hold back his hand

3992
03:34:13,480 --> 03:34:15,480
when a woman's talking smack

3993
03:34:15,480 --> 03:34:17,480
and that's why I love him.

3994
03:34:17,480 --> 03:34:19,480
That's why he's still my brother.

3995
03:34:19,480 --> 03:34:21,480
Was this on the...

3996
03:34:21,480 --> 03:34:23,480
Any idea what this is from?

3997
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:25,480
It sounds like it's from a stream.

3998
03:34:25,480 --> 03:34:27,480
I can hear like Pokemon music in the background

3999
03:34:27,480 --> 03:34:29,480
or something.

4000
03:34:29,480 --> 03:34:31,480
Ben would not hold back his hand

4001
03:34:31,480 --> 03:34:33,480
if it was...

4002
03:34:33,480 --> 03:34:35,480
That's why I love my brother.

4003
03:34:35,480 --> 03:34:37,480
That's kind of sweet, actually.

4004
03:34:37,480 --> 03:34:39,480
That's sweet in his relic-y way.

4005
03:34:39,480 --> 03:34:41,480
Into the dirt is what keeps us

4006
03:34:41,480 --> 03:34:43,480
related.

4007
03:34:43,480 --> 03:34:45,480
In his relic-y way, I appreciate it.

4008
03:34:45,480 --> 03:34:47,480
Honestly, that does warm my heart

4009
03:34:47,480 --> 03:34:49,480
a little bit.

4010
03:34:49,480 --> 03:34:51,480
What a sweetheart.

4011
03:34:51,480 --> 03:34:53,480
I mean, if it was serious...

4012
03:34:53,480 --> 03:34:55,480
If we're talking about serious smack,

4013
03:34:55,480 --> 03:34:57,480
then, you know,

4014
03:34:57,480 --> 03:34:59,480
like if a woman were to call me

4015
03:34:59,480 --> 03:35:01,480
say, a knife

4016
03:35:01,480 --> 03:35:03,480
or say that I had

4017
03:35:03,480 --> 03:35:05,480
Arger or Rargi

4018
03:35:05,480 --> 03:35:07,480
or some other form of dishonor like that,

4019
03:35:07,480 --> 03:35:09,480
then, if you watch...

4020
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:11,480
If you listen to the Fun Fact Challenge

4021
03:35:11,480 --> 03:35:13,480
bonus episode, then you'll know

4022
03:35:13,480 --> 03:35:15,480
that Nate is correct.

4023
03:35:15,480 --> 03:35:17,480
You know what I would do to a woman

4024
03:35:17,480 --> 03:35:19,480
that said such a thing

4025
03:35:19,480 --> 03:35:21,480
as what anyone would do

4026
03:35:21,480 --> 03:35:23,480
or to anyone to protect my...

4027
03:35:23,480 --> 03:35:25,480
to protect my honor.

4028
03:35:25,480 --> 03:35:27,480
To protect the world from devastation.

4029
03:35:27,480 --> 03:35:29,480
Yes, yes.

4030
03:35:31,480 --> 03:35:33,480
Snake, do you know

4031
03:35:33,480 --> 03:35:35,480
what to do if someone

4032
03:35:35,480 --> 03:35:37,480
calls you a gay wizard?

4033
03:35:39,480 --> 03:35:41,480
What would you do in that fucked up situation?

4034
03:35:41,480 --> 03:35:43,480
Pray the gay away?

4035
03:35:43,480 --> 03:35:45,480
Which is don't pray.

4036
03:35:45,480 --> 03:35:47,480
An admirable effort,

4037
03:35:47,480 --> 03:35:49,480
but I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough.

4038
03:35:49,480 --> 03:35:51,480
I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough to save you.

4039
03:35:51,480 --> 03:35:53,480
I'm sorry.

4040
03:35:53,480 --> 03:35:55,480
I mean, yeah, I was wrong from the start.

4041
03:35:55,480 --> 03:35:57,480
It would be like a paladin thing.

4042
03:35:57,480 --> 03:35:59,480
A wizard wouldn't do pray.

4043
03:35:59,480 --> 03:36:01,480
You just got to accept the compliment

4044
03:36:01,480 --> 03:36:03,480
and move on with your day.

4045
03:36:03,480 --> 03:36:05,480
That's not the...

4046
03:36:05,480 --> 03:36:07,480
That's not the Nordic way.

4047
03:36:07,480 --> 03:36:09,480
Ben, they can actually say

4048
03:36:09,480 --> 03:36:11,480
what to do if you're called a gay wizard.

4049
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:13,480
Otherwise, then there'd be no point

4050
03:36:13,480 --> 03:36:15,480
to subscribe to the Patreon

4051
03:36:15,480 --> 03:36:17,480
and listen to the Fun Fact Challenge.

4052
03:36:17,480 --> 03:36:19,480
Exactly! Guys, thank you so much

4053
03:36:19,480 --> 03:36:21,480
for playing along with the bit where you pretend

4054
03:36:21,480 --> 03:36:23,480
not to know what I'm talking about.

4055
03:36:23,480 --> 03:36:25,480
Yes.

4056
03:36:25,480 --> 03:36:27,480
I totally know.

4057
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:29,480
I was just reaching into my D&D lore

4058
03:36:29,480 --> 03:36:31,480
which is how I understand history.

4059
03:36:31,480 --> 03:36:33,480
I know, I know.

4060
03:36:33,480 --> 03:36:35,480
I mean, those are my textbook.

4061
03:36:35,480 --> 03:36:37,480
That'll be the death of you.

4062
03:36:37,480 --> 03:36:39,480
That'll be the death of you.

4063
03:36:39,480 --> 03:36:41,480
The only history I need is right here.

4064
03:36:41,480 --> 03:36:43,480
I'd say patting my

4065
03:36:43,480 --> 03:36:45,480
second edition monsters manual.

4066
03:36:45,480 --> 03:36:47,480
Yeah.

4067
03:36:49,480 --> 03:36:51,480
One time, a long time ago,

4068
03:36:51,480 --> 03:36:53,480
I wanted to buy

4069
03:36:53,480 --> 03:36:55,480
my copy of the second edition

4070
03:36:55,480 --> 03:36:57,480
Rules Cyclopedia.

4071
03:36:57,480 --> 03:36:59,480
He was going to buy it from me for $200.

4072
03:36:59,480 --> 03:37:01,480
What?

4073
03:37:01,480 --> 03:37:03,480
And then I just forgot to get back to him.

4074
03:37:03,480 --> 03:37:05,480
You should message him right now

4075
03:37:05,480 --> 03:37:07,480
and be like, yeah, still got it

4076
03:37:07,480 --> 03:37:09,480
if you're interested.

4077
03:37:09,480 --> 03:37:11,480
I have a set of the

4078
03:37:11,480 --> 03:37:13,480
three years ago.

4079
03:37:13,480 --> 03:37:15,480
The D&D first edition

4080
03:37:15,480 --> 03:37:17,480
player's handbook,

4081
03:37:17,480 --> 03:37:19,480
Dungeon Masters' Guide in a Monster Manual.

4082
03:37:19,480 --> 03:37:21,480
It's like $20 from a friend.

4083
03:37:21,480 --> 03:37:23,480
I don't know what edition...

4084
03:37:23,480 --> 03:37:25,480
I'm not sure what edition the Rules Cyclopedia

4085
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:27,480
is from.

4086
03:37:27,480 --> 03:37:29,480
Rules Cyclopedia...

4087
03:37:29,480 --> 03:37:31,480
I've been a...

4088
03:37:31,480 --> 03:37:33,480
not a D&D, I've been a tabletop guy

4089
03:37:33,480 --> 03:37:35,480
for about 10 years now

4090
03:37:35,480 --> 03:37:37,480
and I have genuinely never actually played D&D itself

4091
03:37:37,480 --> 03:37:39,480
just because I find it.

4092
03:37:39,480 --> 03:37:41,480
I don't...

4093
03:37:41,480 --> 03:37:43,480
Oh, you've played other games.

4094
03:37:43,480 --> 03:37:45,480
I've played games that focus more on the actual...

4095
03:37:45,480 --> 03:37:47,480
I prefer games that are lighter

4096
03:37:47,480 --> 03:37:49,480
and just focus more on the actual role-playing

4097
03:37:49,480 --> 03:37:51,480
and combat.

4098
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:53,480
You would like 5e, then. 5e is definitely

4099
03:37:53,480 --> 03:37:55,480
Rules Light.

4100
03:37:55,480 --> 03:37:57,480
I haven't played that one yet.

4101
03:37:57,480 --> 03:37:59,480
I'm a Dungeon World guy.

4102
03:37:59,480 --> 03:38:01,480
Snake, have you done that one?

4103
03:38:01,480 --> 03:38:03,480
I bought the book for Dungeon World. I haven't played it yet.

4104
03:38:03,480 --> 03:38:05,480
It's a lot of fun.

4105
03:38:05,480 --> 03:38:07,480
There's a ton of custom classes for it, though.

4106
03:38:07,480 --> 03:38:09,480
The base ones are like fine.

4107
03:38:09,480 --> 03:38:11,480
Only meld them in if you're not getting enough

4108
03:38:11,480 --> 03:38:13,480
out of those base classes.

4109
03:38:13,480 --> 03:38:15,480
I just need friends so I can actually play

4110
03:38:15,480 --> 03:38:17,480
with people.

4111
03:38:17,480 --> 03:38:19,480
That's the big missing component right now.

4112
03:38:19,480 --> 03:38:21,480
Have you ever played Powered by the Apocalypse?

4113
03:38:21,480 --> 03:38:23,480
Snake?

4114
03:38:23,480 --> 03:38:25,480
Dungeon World is Powered by the Apocalypse.

4115
03:38:25,480 --> 03:38:27,480
Oh, right, right, right.

4116
03:38:27,480 --> 03:38:29,480
I have played Apocalypse World, which was the origin

4117
03:38:29,480 --> 03:38:31,480
of it, and I've played

4118
03:38:31,480 --> 03:38:33,480
Spirit of 77, which is a

4119
03:38:33,480 --> 03:38:35,480
7e's buddy cop show

4120
03:38:35,480 --> 03:38:37,480
kind of take on it, which is really fun.

4121
03:38:37,480 --> 03:38:39,480
It sounds very funny.

4122
03:38:39,480 --> 03:38:41,480
I played the tabletop game once.

4123
03:38:41,480 --> 03:38:43,480
I only did it one time, but it was fun.

4124
03:38:43,480 --> 03:38:45,480
It was Powered by the Apocalypse. It was

4125
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:47,480
Monster of the Week, where it was basically

4126
03:38:47,480 --> 03:38:49,480
like...Gib would like this.

4127
03:38:49,480 --> 03:38:51,480
It's basically like Buffy,

4128
03:38:51,480 --> 03:38:53,480
where you solve

4129
03:38:53,480 --> 03:38:55,480
mysteries and fight monsters and stuff.

4130
03:38:55,480 --> 03:38:57,480
It's really...

4131
03:38:57,480 --> 03:38:59,480
I don't want to say low stakes, but it's not

4132
03:38:59,480 --> 03:39:01,480
very combat heavy because it's very easy

4133
03:39:01,480 --> 03:39:03,480
to get yourself killed.

4134
03:39:03,480 --> 03:39:05,480
Yeah, it's more about the investigation

4135
03:39:05,480 --> 03:39:07,480
and working out what the

4136
03:39:07,480 --> 03:39:09,480
Paranole thing is. I played one game of

4137
03:39:09,480 --> 03:39:11,480
Monster of the Week. It was really fun.

4138
03:39:11,480 --> 03:39:13,480
The leader

4139
03:39:13,480 --> 03:39:15,480
of the party, I say in quotes because it's just

4140
03:39:15,480 --> 03:39:17,480
thing, we did a gag party

4141
03:39:17,480 --> 03:39:19,480
where the guy leading it was basically

4142
03:39:19,480 --> 03:39:21,480
playing Ghost from True Capitalist Radio

4143
03:39:21,480 --> 03:39:23,480
if he was a Paranormal Investigator.

4144
03:39:23,480 --> 03:39:25,480
That's good.

4145
03:39:25,480 --> 03:39:27,480
He was just really pissed off and mad,

4146
03:39:27,480 --> 03:39:29,480
and I was his driver and bodyguard.

4147
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:31,480
Oh, you were the engineer?

4148
03:39:31,480 --> 03:39:33,480
No, I wasn't engineer. I was Scott

4149
03:39:33,480 --> 03:39:35,480
Shelby from Heavy Rain, but even

4150
03:39:35,480 --> 03:39:37,480
Dumber. I was just like a fat

4151
03:39:37,480 --> 03:39:39,480
lumbering guy, just following him around.

4152
03:39:39,480 --> 03:39:41,480
And that was a really fun

4153
03:39:41,480 --> 03:39:43,480
session.

4154
03:39:43,480 --> 03:39:45,480
Yeah,

4155
03:39:45,480 --> 03:39:47,480
D&D is fun and all.

4156
03:39:47,480 --> 03:39:49,480
I made a video about

4157
03:39:49,480 --> 03:39:51,480
the piece of channel. I actually remember you bringing it up on an episode

4158
03:39:51,480 --> 03:39:53,480
of things you can't get into.

4159
03:39:53,480 --> 03:39:55,480
The classic.

4160
03:39:55,480 --> 03:39:57,480
Yeah, I'm very...

4161
03:39:57,480 --> 03:39:59,480
I always chafe and feel irritated

4162
03:39:59,480 --> 03:40:01,480
by all the

4163
03:40:01,480 --> 03:40:03,480
minutiae and the nitty-gritty of the rules

4164
03:40:03,480 --> 03:40:05,480
and stuff.

4165
03:40:05,480 --> 03:40:07,480
That's why I like Dungeon World because it gets out

4166
03:40:07,480 --> 03:40:09,480
of the way and it's very interpretive.

4167
03:40:09,480 --> 03:40:11,480
And also, I genuinely think

4168
03:40:11,480 --> 03:40:13,480
it's a problem of having the right group of people

4169
03:40:13,480 --> 03:40:15,480
who... and kind of knowing what

4170
03:40:15,480 --> 03:40:17,480
your rule there for what you want.

4171
03:40:17,480 --> 03:40:19,480
Because a good GM will like, if something's more fun,

4172
03:40:19,480 --> 03:40:21,480
the rules can maybe take a backseat.

4173
03:40:21,480 --> 03:40:23,480
The point of dice

4174
03:40:23,480 --> 03:40:25,480
roles are, you're just playing make-believe

4175
03:40:25,480 --> 03:40:27,480
if there isn't some skeleton to

4176
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:29,480
like, oh, am I going to be able to

4177
03:40:29,480 --> 03:40:31,480
do this? Am I going to be able to...

4178
03:40:31,480 --> 03:40:33,480
That's the stakes of it.

4179
03:40:33,480 --> 03:40:35,480
It's about having the right

4180
03:40:35,480 --> 03:40:37,480
group and all knowing what you're there for.

4181
03:40:37,480 --> 03:40:39,480
There's a rules-light

4182
03:40:39,480 --> 03:40:41,480
RPG game that I found

4183
03:40:41,480 --> 03:40:43,480
and I thought it was really interesting

4184
03:40:43,480 --> 03:40:45,480
and I always wanted to DM a game of it

4185
03:40:45,480 --> 03:40:47,480
with the PCP.

4186
03:40:47,480 --> 03:40:49,480
I always wanted to do at a Radcon.

4187
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:51,480
We could do a game of it and we never did.

4188
03:40:51,480 --> 03:40:53,480
The game is called Rises

4189
03:40:53,480 --> 03:40:55,480
and you have only one stat

4190
03:40:55,480 --> 03:40:57,480
and it's just your class.

4191
03:40:57,480 --> 03:40:59,480
But your class can be something

4192
03:40:59,480 --> 03:41:01,480
like vague.

4193
03:41:01,480 --> 03:41:03,480
It's like a...

4194
03:41:03,480 --> 03:41:05,480
This is like a fiction trope, something like

4195
03:41:05,480 --> 03:41:07,480
Damsel in Distress

4196
03:41:07,480 --> 03:41:09,480
or like

4197
03:41:09,480 --> 03:41:11,480
Viking Berserker or something.

4198
03:41:11,480 --> 03:41:13,480
It's just something...

4199
03:41:13,480 --> 03:41:15,480
And basically, anytime you want to do

4200
03:41:15,480 --> 03:41:17,480
something that someone of

4201
03:41:17,480 --> 03:41:19,480
your class might theoretically be able

4202
03:41:19,480 --> 03:41:21,480
to do, like if you're a Viking, maybe

4203
03:41:21,480 --> 03:41:23,480
barge down a door, or flip

4204
03:41:23,480 --> 03:41:25,480
a table, or chop

4205
03:41:25,480 --> 03:41:27,480
a tree down,

4206
03:41:27,480 --> 03:41:29,480
you can make a Viking check where Damsel in Distress

4207
03:41:29,480 --> 03:41:31,480
would be like, climb a rope down the

4208
03:41:31,480 --> 03:41:33,480
side of a castle, or

4209
03:41:33,480 --> 03:41:35,480
convince a noble of something

4210
03:41:35,480 --> 03:41:37,480
or something like that.

4211
03:41:37,480 --> 03:41:39,480
That's the only stat you check against

4212
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:41,480
is the number of this class

4213
03:41:41,480 --> 03:41:43,480
but it's a nebulously defined class.

4214
03:41:43,480 --> 03:41:45,480
And I thought that was really neat

4215
03:41:45,480 --> 03:41:47,480
and I never got to play it.

4216
03:41:47,480 --> 03:41:49,480
But on the other side...

4217
03:41:49,480 --> 03:41:51,480
I have played

4218
03:41:51,480 --> 03:41:53,480
D&D before.

4219
03:41:53,480 --> 03:41:55,480
I played in regular D&D

4220
03:41:55,480 --> 03:41:57,480
like a third...

4221
03:41:57,480 --> 03:41:59,480
I played in third, fourth, and fifth edition.

4222
03:41:59,480 --> 03:42:01,480
Actually, when I was a kid, I played in second

4223
03:42:01,480 --> 03:42:03,480
edition too.

4224
03:42:03,480 --> 03:42:05,480
I'm looking at the character sheet for Rysus

4225
03:42:05,480 --> 03:42:07,480
and this is very interesting.

4226
03:42:07,480 --> 03:42:09,480
I thought it

4227
03:42:09,480 --> 03:42:11,480
sounded really neat and I never got to play it.

4228
03:42:13,480 --> 03:42:15,480
I would love to someday.

4229
03:42:17,480 --> 03:42:19,480
On the other hand...

4230
03:42:19,480 --> 03:42:21,480
I was...

4231
03:42:21,480 --> 03:42:23,480
I think I was just googling around for like rules, light

4232
03:42:23,480 --> 03:42:25,480
systems, and this was

4233
03:42:25,480 --> 03:42:27,480
the rules, lightest system I could find.

4234
03:42:27,480 --> 03:42:29,480
This was the most minimal one.

4235
03:42:31,480 --> 03:42:33,480
But on the other hand, there's another system

4236
03:42:33,480 --> 03:42:35,480
that I thought was really cool once upon a time.

4237
03:42:35,480 --> 03:42:37,480
I tried to run a game and it was very short lived.

4238
03:42:37,480 --> 03:42:39,480
Mutants & Masterminds

4239
03:42:39,480 --> 03:42:41,480
is the exact...

4240
03:42:41,480 --> 03:42:43,480
I don't know if you've ever tried to play it

4241
03:42:43,480 --> 03:42:45,480
but it's the exact opposite. Mutants & Masterminds

4242
03:42:45,480 --> 03:42:47,480
it's very free form

4243
03:42:47,480 --> 03:42:49,480
in that you can basically be whatever you want.

4244
03:42:49,480 --> 03:42:51,480
It's a super RPG where you can codify your own powers

4245
03:42:51,480 --> 03:42:53,480
and you can get very crazy with it.

4246
03:42:53,480 --> 03:42:55,480
Yes.

4247
03:42:55,480 --> 03:42:57,480
You can basically have whatever power...

4248
03:42:57,480 --> 03:42:59,480
What?

4249
03:42:59,480 --> 03:43:01,480
I've not played that one itself

4250
03:43:01,480 --> 03:43:03,480
but I do know the system because I...

4251
03:43:03,480 --> 03:43:05,480
I think a few years ago that one was on my brain

4252
03:43:05,480 --> 03:43:07,480
a bunch.

4253
03:43:07,480 --> 03:43:09,480
The interesting thing about it

4254
03:43:09,480 --> 03:43:11,480
is the way that it makes you able to do

4255
03:43:11,480 --> 03:43:13,480
basically anything you want. Your character can have

4256
03:43:13,480 --> 03:43:15,480
whatever power you want. The way that it controls

4257
03:43:15,480 --> 03:43:17,480
for that is it doesn't...

4258
03:43:17,480 --> 03:43:19,480
it's not focused on like what exactly

4259
03:43:19,480 --> 03:43:21,480
your powers are or what their themes are

4260
03:43:21,480 --> 03:43:23,480
or why you can do them. The only rules in the game

4261
03:43:23,480 --> 03:43:25,480
are about like the parameters

4262
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:27,480
and they literally will have like a table

4263
03:43:27,480 --> 03:43:29,480
where like your power can...

4264
03:43:29,480 --> 03:43:31,480
you can have a power

4265
03:43:31,480 --> 03:43:33,480
that like... at like a level 5 power

4266
03:43:33,480 --> 03:43:35,480
can push

4267
03:43:35,480 --> 03:43:37,480
you know maybe a thousand

4268
03:43:37,480 --> 03:43:39,480
pounds but it can only push it...

4269
03:43:39,480 --> 03:43:41,480
but if it pushes that much

4270
03:43:41,480 --> 03:43:43,480
it's only at a certain speed

4271
03:43:43,480 --> 03:43:45,480
right? So it can only push...

4272
03:43:45,480 --> 03:43:47,480
if it's more it can push it slower

4273
03:43:47,480 --> 03:43:49,480
but if it's less it can push it faster

4274
03:43:49,480 --> 03:43:51,480
and then if you take a hit to the overall

4275
03:43:51,480 --> 03:43:53,480
power balance of those two things

4276
03:43:53,480 --> 03:43:55,480
you can also make it modular

4277
03:43:55,480 --> 03:43:57,480
whereby you can like do a sliding

4278
03:43:57,480 --> 03:43:59,480
scale where like okay well I want to push

4279
03:43:59,480 --> 03:44:01,480
more slower or less faster and I can control

4280
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:03,480
for it. It's like...

4281
03:44:03,480 --> 03:44:05,480
it's granular like that. It's like

4282
03:44:05,480 --> 03:44:07,480
mathematically defined

4283
03:44:07,480 --> 03:44:09,480
in a way that allows...

4284
03:44:09,480 --> 03:44:11,480
that means that it can aesthetically be

4285
03:44:11,480 --> 03:44:13,480
sort of whatever you want it to be.

4286
03:44:13,480 --> 03:44:15,480
I used that system

4287
03:44:15,480 --> 03:44:17,480
to run... I tried to run a one piece

4288
03:44:17,480 --> 03:44:19,480
campaign and I thought that system

4289
03:44:19,480 --> 03:44:21,480
was good for like thinking up care

4290
03:44:21,480 --> 03:44:23,480
because one piece is so loosely defined

4291
03:44:23,480 --> 03:44:25,480
and like I don't know everybody just kind of

4292
03:44:25,480 --> 03:44:27,480
you know there's fruit powers

4293
03:44:27,480 --> 03:44:29,480
but none of them are consistent in how they work

4294
03:44:29,480 --> 03:44:31,480
and like other people are just basically

4295
03:44:31,480 --> 03:44:33,480
have superpowers just like for no reason

4296
03:44:33,480 --> 03:44:35,480
like Zoro...

4297
03:44:35,480 --> 03:44:37,480
can just cut steel... he's a hockey

4298
03:44:37,480 --> 03:44:39,480
I don't know whatever

4299
03:44:39,480 --> 03:44:41,480
some people are just hypnotists

4300
03:44:41,480 --> 03:44:43,480
and have mind powers just because

4301
03:44:43,480 --> 03:44:45,480
you know...

4302
03:44:45,480 --> 03:44:47,480
We made a friend we found a system

4303
03:44:47,480 --> 03:44:49,480
that meant for running JoJo RPGs

4304
03:44:49,480 --> 03:44:51,480
and a lot of the mechanics were

4305
03:44:51,480 --> 03:44:53,480
interesting. It's very funny.

4306
03:44:53,480 --> 03:44:55,480
It was funny because

4307
03:44:55,480 --> 03:44:57,480
essentially that the system was

4308
03:44:57,480 --> 03:44:59,480
it had momentum where you're kind of

4309
03:44:59,480 --> 03:45:01,480
standing and pacing a battle can change to try

4310
03:45:01,480 --> 03:45:03,480
and emulate the idea of when you have

4311
03:45:03,480 --> 03:45:05,480
all the leverage in a fight you can expend

4312
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:07,480
it to do that one big move or whatever

4313
03:45:07,480 --> 03:45:09,480
and it was a cool idea

4314
03:45:09,480 --> 03:45:11,480
but it had the same thing of the powers are

4315
03:45:11,480 --> 03:45:13,480
very nebulous like it just says

4316
03:45:13,480 --> 03:45:15,480
write in your power and let

4317
03:45:15,480 --> 03:45:17,480
the GM determine what the point cost

4318
03:45:17,480 --> 03:45:19,480
of it should be

4319
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:21,480
and then choose your deficiencies

4320
03:45:21,480 --> 03:45:23,480
and I think that was a cool idea but

4321
03:45:23,480 --> 03:45:25,480
me and a friend were like we started

4322
03:45:25,480 --> 03:45:27,480
co-engineering an idea where

4323
03:45:27,480 --> 03:45:29,480
I would run one heart I would run

4324
03:45:29,480 --> 03:45:31,480
one run campaign and they would run another

4325
03:45:31,480 --> 03:45:33,480
and

4326
03:45:33,480 --> 03:45:35,480
my campaign was

4327
03:45:35,480 --> 03:45:37,480
like JoJo part 4 it was very low stakes

4328
03:45:37,480 --> 03:45:39,480
the powers were kind of

4329
03:45:39,480 --> 03:45:41,480
lighthearted and silly and not too lethal

4330
03:45:41,480 --> 03:45:43,480
and

4331
03:45:43,480 --> 03:45:45,480
meanwhile so I made that campaign

4332
03:45:45,480 --> 03:45:47,480
while they made characters for it and then vice

4333
03:45:47,480 --> 03:45:49,480
versa and we were going to get more people in

4334
03:45:49,480 --> 03:45:51,480
and when we compared all of mine

4335
03:45:51,480 --> 03:45:53,480
was just like joke characters

4336
03:45:53,480 --> 03:45:55,480
they were like all the battles were weird

4337
03:45:55,480 --> 03:45:57,480
puzzles but you wouldn't really die

4338
03:45:57,480 --> 03:45:59,480
and it was a murder mystery investigation

4339
03:45:59,480 --> 03:46:01,480
hers was

4340
03:46:01,480 --> 03:46:03,480
everyone had like part

4341
03:46:03,480 --> 03:46:05,480
5 bullshit death powers

4342
03:46:05,480 --> 03:46:07,480
it would like could like

4343
03:46:07,480 --> 03:46:09,480
instant kill you

4344
03:46:09,480 --> 03:46:11,480
meanwhile all the characters I made to tackle it

4345
03:46:11,480 --> 03:46:13,480
were my brand of joke characters

4346
03:46:13,480 --> 03:46:15,480
and all the characters she made for my

4347
03:46:15,480 --> 03:46:17,480
campaign had absurd power levels

4348
03:46:19,480 --> 03:46:21,480
it was like shit we've got a bit of an imbalance

4349
03:46:21,480 --> 03:46:23,480
you could easily annihilate

4350
03:46:23,480 --> 03:46:25,480
there's a mismatch here

4351
03:46:25,480 --> 03:46:27,480
you could annihilate any of my people

4352
03:46:27,480 --> 03:46:29,480
while I would die

4353
03:46:29,480 --> 03:46:31,480
instantly in your universe unless

4354
03:46:31,480 --> 03:46:33,480
I was way cleverer than I actually

4355
03:46:33,480 --> 03:46:35,480
am

4356
03:46:35,480 --> 03:46:37,480
I think one of hers

4357
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:39,480
one of hers

4358
03:46:39,480 --> 03:46:41,480
it's like

4359
03:46:41,480 --> 03:46:43,480
you're in a video game and you wandered into

4360
03:46:43,480 --> 03:46:45,480
the area that you're not leveled up enough

4361
03:46:45,480 --> 03:46:47,480
for yet it's like oops

4362
03:46:47,480 --> 03:46:49,480
fuck

4363
03:46:49,480 --> 03:46:51,480
my bloody villain

4364
03:46:51,480 --> 03:46:53,480
his stan

4365
03:46:53,480 --> 03:46:55,480
the only thing I'm proud of it was because I really liked

4366
03:46:55,480 --> 03:46:57,480
the stan name I picked for the main villain was

4367
03:46:57,480 --> 03:46:59,480
heaven helps the man and it was just

4368
03:46:59,480 --> 03:47:01,480
is that a song reference

4369
03:47:01,480 --> 03:47:03,480
it's gotta be

4370
03:47:03,480 --> 03:47:05,480
heaven helps the man

4371
03:47:05,480 --> 03:47:07,480
I'm not familiar

4372
03:47:07,480 --> 03:47:09,480
yeah it's a good song

4373
03:47:09,480 --> 03:47:11,480
and I'm why am I struggling

4374
03:47:11,480 --> 03:47:13,480
to tell you

4375
03:47:13,480 --> 03:47:15,480
Kenny Loggins

4376
03:47:15,480 --> 03:47:17,480
oh really

4377
03:47:17,480 --> 03:47:19,480
wait, okay

4378
03:47:19,480 --> 03:47:21,480
that's really funny actually

4379
03:47:21,480 --> 03:47:23,480
like

4380
03:47:23,480 --> 03:47:25,480
usually I would think of like a more

4381
03:47:25,480 --> 03:47:27,480
like heavy

4382
03:47:27,480 --> 03:47:29,480
or like a more like musicians

4383
03:47:29,480 --> 03:47:31,480
Kenny Loggins is like some fucking

4384
03:47:31,480 --> 03:47:33,480
80 soundtracks bullshit

4385
03:47:33,480 --> 03:47:35,480
it's really funny to have

4386
03:47:35,480 --> 03:47:37,480
a good stan named after a Kenny Loggins song

4387
03:47:37,480 --> 03:47:39,480
from Footloose

4388
03:47:39,480 --> 03:47:41,480
danger zone would be a good stan name if it isn't already

4389
03:47:41,480 --> 03:47:43,480
it would be

4390
03:47:43,480 --> 03:47:45,480
I prefer heaven helps the man it was also just

4391
03:47:45,480 --> 03:47:47,480
his aspect was like

4392
03:47:47,480 --> 03:47:49,480
gravity powered he had like a bunch of

4393
03:47:49,480 --> 03:47:51,480
his stan was actually just tattoos over his body

4394
03:47:51,480 --> 03:47:53,480
and he just basically exuded

4395
03:47:53,480 --> 03:47:55,480
push

4396
03:47:55,480 --> 03:47:57,480
and I had a very convoluted murder mystery

4397
03:47:57,480 --> 03:47:59,480
the players had to work out

4398
03:47:59,480 --> 03:48:01,480
around why this guy had stan powers and shit

4399
03:48:01,480 --> 03:48:03,480
meanwhile hers was there's a dying old

4400
03:48:03,480 --> 03:48:05,480
man who wants to learn the secrets

4401
03:48:05,480 --> 03:48:07,480
of immortality was like so he's got

4402
03:48:07,480 --> 03:48:09,480
intergalactic race through space

4403
03:48:09,480 --> 03:48:11,480
to find something

4404
03:48:11,480 --> 03:48:13,480
and there's going to be a bunch

4405
03:48:13,480 --> 03:48:15,480
of people murdering each other on the way

4406
03:48:15,480 --> 03:48:17,480
one stand was which was called snow

4407
03:48:17,480 --> 03:48:19,480
halation by the way had poisoned the whole

4408
03:48:19,480 --> 03:48:21,480
planet like it was just a planetary

4409
03:48:21,480 --> 03:48:23,480
scale you die here

4410
03:48:23,480 --> 03:48:25,480
it was yeah that was

4411
03:48:25,480 --> 03:48:27,480
her campaign that was her campaign

4412
03:48:27,480 --> 03:48:29,480
did the stories

4413
03:48:29,480 --> 03:48:31,480
regret that we never played it if only because I kind of wanted

4414
03:48:31,480 --> 03:48:33,480
to get the full

4415
03:48:33,480 --> 03:48:35,480
experience of it

4416
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:37,480
I don't know

4417
03:48:37,480 --> 03:48:39,480
I have tainted this for jojo

4418
03:48:39,480 --> 03:48:41,480
but yeah I don't know anything about Kenny

4419
03:48:41,480 --> 03:48:43,480
logins other than that he's dangerous

4420
03:48:43,480 --> 03:48:45,480
what

4421
03:48:45,480 --> 03:48:47,480
I heard you mentioning his name and it just gave me

4422
03:48:47,480 --> 03:48:49,480
PTSD

4423
03:48:49,480 --> 03:48:51,480
I put it in general

4424
03:48:51,480 --> 03:48:53,480
let's have a gander

4425
03:48:53,480 --> 03:48:55,480
does he have a song called read minds

4426
03:48:55,480 --> 03:48:57,480
oh no this is

4427
03:48:57,480 --> 03:48:59,480
from like an obscure like blog from

4428
03:48:59,480 --> 03:49:01,480
like 2010

4429
03:49:01,480 --> 03:49:03,480
no I know what this blog is

4430
03:49:03,480 --> 03:49:05,480
wait what

4431
03:49:05,480 --> 03:49:07,480
Kenny logins ruined Christmas

4432
03:49:07,480 --> 03:49:09,480
I think

4433
03:49:09,480 --> 03:49:11,480
there was like a

4434
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:13,480
I think there was a mad TV bit

4435
03:49:13,480 --> 03:49:15,480
with Kenny logins where he like constantly

4436
03:49:15,480 --> 03:49:17,480
pisses his pants

4437
03:49:17,480 --> 03:49:19,480
I have no idea why

4438
03:49:19,480 --> 03:49:21,480
but for some reason I can remember

4439
03:49:21,480 --> 03:49:23,480
that very vividly

4440
03:49:23,480 --> 03:49:25,480
yeah like okay

4441
03:49:25,480 --> 03:49:27,480
time there's a different time

4442
03:49:27,480 --> 03:49:29,480
I believe he's a fictional character

4443
03:49:29,480 --> 03:49:31,480
that was invented

4444
03:49:31,480 --> 03:49:33,480
yeah

4445
03:49:33,480 --> 03:49:35,480
but

4446
03:49:35,480 --> 03:49:37,480
maybe I should have given him

4447
03:49:37,480 --> 03:49:39,480
Sam Powers

4448
03:49:41,480 --> 03:49:43,480
what was that

4449
03:49:43,480 --> 03:49:45,480
I should have given him the power to read minds

4450
03:49:45,480 --> 03:49:47,480
if he was gonna

4451
03:49:47,480 --> 03:49:49,480
have a Kenny logins song

4452
03:49:49,480 --> 03:49:51,480
that would have been

4453
03:49:51,480 --> 03:49:53,480
it would have stopped

4454
03:49:53,480 --> 03:49:55,480
all the other players in their tracks like Ben

4455
03:49:55,480 --> 03:49:57,480
right now

4456
03:49:57,480 --> 03:49:59,480
I always wondered actually

4457
03:49:59,480 --> 03:50:01,480
how should it be to just like

4458
03:50:01,480 --> 03:50:03,480
say yeah

4459
03:50:03,480 --> 03:50:05,480
the enemy in this tabletop RPG has mind control

4460
03:50:05,480 --> 03:50:07,480
has like mind reading powers

4461
03:50:07,480 --> 03:50:09,480
so just tell us what your character is thinking

4462
03:50:09,480 --> 03:50:11,480
right now

4463
03:50:11,480 --> 03:50:13,480
even better oh my NPC has

4464
03:50:13,480 --> 03:50:15,480
mind control powers so actually your character

4465
03:50:15,480 --> 03:50:17,480
doesn't do that thing that would be

4466
03:50:17,480 --> 03:50:19,480
inconvenient for me if you did

4467
03:50:19,480 --> 03:50:21,480
actually he has this other thing

4468
03:50:21,480 --> 03:50:23,480
I had an evening

4469
03:50:23,480 --> 03:50:25,480
just binge reading

4470
03:50:25,480 --> 03:50:27,480
RPG horror stories

4471
03:50:27,480 --> 03:50:29,480
just like terrible GM

4472
03:50:29,480 --> 03:50:31,480
oh as in games like games gone wrong

4473
03:50:31,480 --> 03:50:33,480
yeah yeah

4474
03:50:33,480 --> 03:50:35,480
there is a subreddit for it called RPG

4475
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:37,480
horror stories which is just

4476
03:50:37,480 --> 03:50:39,480
some of them are really painful

4477
03:50:39,480 --> 03:50:41,480
like there was

4478
03:50:41,480 --> 03:50:43,480
I haven't been able to find the story again

4479
03:50:43,480 --> 03:50:45,480
but there was one which just sent me a fucking

4480
03:50:45,480 --> 03:50:47,480
on edge which was

4481
03:50:47,480 --> 03:50:49,480
they found out that they had been playing online

4482
03:50:49,480 --> 03:50:51,480
they found out that for months one guy

4483
03:50:51,480 --> 03:50:53,480
had been without them knowing streaming

4484
03:50:53,480 --> 03:50:55,480
their game and had been getting an audience

4485
03:50:59,480 --> 03:51:01,480
so violated

4486
03:51:01,480 --> 03:51:03,480
the only reason

4487
03:51:03,480 --> 03:51:05,480
they were able to like start suspecting him

4488
03:51:05,480 --> 03:51:07,480
was they realized he started like getting

4489
03:51:07,480 --> 03:51:09,480
more and more like twitch

4490
03:51:09,480 --> 03:51:11,480
streamer-y and acting things up

4491
03:51:11,480 --> 03:51:13,480
and trying to take the lead in situations

4492
03:51:13,480 --> 03:51:15,480
he like

4493
03:51:15,480 --> 03:51:17,480
accidentally said to smash that like button

4494
03:51:17,480 --> 03:51:19,480
like in casual conversation

4495
03:51:19,480 --> 03:51:21,480
nothing

4496
03:51:21,480 --> 03:51:23,480
shit hooker thanks for the sub

4497
03:51:23,480 --> 03:51:25,480
anyway my character attached

4498
03:51:25,480 --> 03:51:27,480
hey he's been streaming us for months

4499
03:51:27,480 --> 03:51:29,480
it's like yeah

4500
03:51:29,480 --> 03:51:31,480
the advice in the friend was

4501
03:51:31,480 --> 03:51:33,480
you need to sue the shit out of this guy

4502
03:51:33,480 --> 03:51:35,480
he just

4503
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:37,480
trueman showed all of you

4504
03:51:37,480 --> 03:51:39,480
it's like you show up to the game

4505
03:51:39,480 --> 03:51:41,480
and someone brought quiz nose

4506
03:51:41,480 --> 03:51:43,480
and he's handed them out

4507
03:51:43,480 --> 03:51:45,480
and when somebody else goes

4508
03:51:45,480 --> 03:51:47,480
hey thanks for the sub and the guy just starts sweating

4509
03:51:47,480 --> 03:51:49,480
he's like

4510
03:51:51,480 --> 03:51:53,480
that's why in this day and age

4511
03:51:53,480 --> 03:51:55,480
where you never know if you're being recorded

4512
03:51:55,480 --> 03:51:57,480
you just say that to everyone and just see

4513
03:51:57,480 --> 03:51:59,480
see if it picks them

4514
03:51:59,480 --> 03:52:01,480
a little bit

4515
03:52:01,480 --> 03:52:03,480
you never know if you're talking to a live streamer

4516
03:52:05,480 --> 03:52:07,480
I heard a um

4517
03:52:07,480 --> 03:52:09,480
I read a story or something

4518
03:52:09,480 --> 03:52:11,480
about like a kid

4519
03:52:11,480 --> 03:52:13,480
I think maybe this some kids

4520
03:52:13,480 --> 03:52:15,480
maybe it was just one kid I don't know but like

4521
03:52:15,480 --> 03:52:17,480
this kid watched youtube all the time

4522
03:52:17,480 --> 03:52:19,480
and he started saying like

4523
03:52:19,480 --> 03:52:21,480
like comment subscribe as like

4524
03:52:21,480 --> 03:52:23,480
he would say that like instead of goodbye

4525
03:52:23,480 --> 03:52:25,480
cause he like all the youtube channels he watched

4526
03:52:25,480 --> 03:52:27,480
would end their videos with like comment subscribe

4527
03:52:27,480 --> 03:52:29,480
so the kid started saying like comment subscribe

4528
03:52:29,480 --> 03:52:31,480
it was when his parents tucked him into bed

4529
03:52:31,480 --> 03:52:33,480
at night he would say that yeah

4530
03:52:33,480 --> 03:52:35,480
yeah he said like comment subscribe

4531
03:52:35,480 --> 03:52:37,480
that really makes you think about

4532
03:52:37,480 --> 03:52:39,480
anthropology

4533
03:52:39,480 --> 03:52:41,480
that's humanical right there

4534
03:52:43,480 --> 03:52:45,480
really makes you think about

4535
03:52:45,480 --> 03:52:47,480
I'm gonna have like comment subscribe

4536
03:52:47,480 --> 03:52:49,480
on my headstone

4537
03:52:49,480 --> 03:52:51,480
and my sub count

4538
03:52:51,480 --> 03:52:53,480
not even the day I lived and died

4539
03:52:53,480 --> 03:52:55,480
just the sub count

4540
03:52:55,480 --> 03:52:57,480
that's all that's gonna matter

4541
03:52:57,480 --> 03:52:59,480
in the future anyway

4542
03:52:59,480 --> 03:53:01,480
subscribe

4543
03:53:01,480 --> 03:53:03,480
I'll have a little uh

4544
03:53:03,480 --> 03:53:05,480
one of those um

4545
03:53:05,480 --> 03:53:07,480
those like code those bar code

4546
03:53:07,480 --> 03:53:09,480
that you can scan

4547
03:53:09,480 --> 03:53:11,480
that will give you a

4548
03:53:11,480 --> 03:53:13,480
yeah QR code

4549
03:53:13,480 --> 03:53:15,480
to scan if you want to send

4550
03:53:15,480 --> 03:53:17,480
bitcoin to my estate

4551
03:53:17,480 --> 03:53:19,480
in the future

4552
03:53:19,480 --> 03:53:21,480
please thank you

4553
03:53:21,480 --> 03:53:23,480
this is the worst thought I've had

4554
03:53:23,480 --> 03:53:25,480
but I had had it so let's throw it out there

4555
03:53:25,480 --> 03:53:27,480
there is on the youtube

4556
03:53:27,480 --> 03:53:29,480
the youtube wikia there is like

4557
03:53:29,480 --> 03:53:31,480
a page that is the list of deceased youtubers

4558
03:53:31,480 --> 03:53:33,480
and I swear

4559
03:53:33,480 --> 03:53:35,480
it's like right my sub counts

4560
03:53:36,480 --> 03:53:38,480
what the fuck

4561
03:53:38,480 --> 03:53:40,480
I gotta see if I'm right

4562
03:53:40,480 --> 03:53:42,480
let me double check myself

4563
03:53:42,480 --> 03:53:44,480
that's so cool

4564
03:53:44,480 --> 03:53:45,480
wait wait what

4565
03:53:45,480 --> 03:53:47,480
how many did you achieve

4566
03:53:47,480 --> 03:53:49,480
while you were still alive what was your high score

4567
03:53:49,480 --> 03:53:51,480
I mean that's okay

4568
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:53,480
it's literally ranked

4569
03:53:53,480 --> 03:53:55,480
that was my fault I've linked

4570
03:53:55,480 --> 03:53:57,480
that was like my that was my fault

4571
03:53:57,480 --> 03:53:59,480
it is ranked it is ranked

4572
03:53:59,480 --> 03:54:01,480
okay well this is

4573
03:54:01,480 --> 03:54:03,480
this is wikitubio

4574
03:54:03,480 --> 03:54:05,480
actually wikipedia

4575
03:54:05,480 --> 03:54:07,480
the fact is someone

4576
03:54:07,480 --> 03:54:09,480
went this right

4577
03:54:09,480 --> 03:54:11,480
and I have a question

4578
03:54:11,480 --> 03:54:13,480
and this is a ghoulish question

4579
03:54:13,480 --> 03:54:15,480
should the count stop

4580
03:54:15,480 --> 03:54:17,480
once you're dead

4581
03:54:17,480 --> 03:54:19,480
is that you

4582
03:54:19,480 --> 03:54:21,480
that's the cut off that's like

4583
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:23,480
it's your high score

4584
03:54:23,480 --> 03:54:25,480
I think it should because

4585
03:54:25,480 --> 03:54:27,480
if you're gone

4586
03:54:27,480 --> 03:54:29,480
then you can't make anymore videos

4587
03:54:29,480 --> 03:54:31,480
you're not on the grind anymore

4588
03:54:31,480 --> 03:54:33,480
yeah you're not on the grind anymore

4589
03:54:33,480 --> 03:54:35,480
so the project as ray william johnson

4590
03:54:35,480 --> 03:54:37,480
once said this project

4591
03:54:37,480 --> 03:54:39,480
this project has discontinued

4592
03:54:39,480 --> 03:54:41,480
so it should stay at the sub count

4593
03:54:41,480 --> 03:54:43,480
when they died

4594
03:54:43,480 --> 03:54:45,480
okay I disagree I think

4595
03:54:45,480 --> 03:54:47,480
they should just track both because

4596
03:54:47,480 --> 03:54:49,480
I think it would be interesting

4597
03:54:49,480 --> 03:54:51,480
if people's channels like got a big influx

4598
03:54:51,480 --> 03:54:53,480
of subs after they died

4599
03:54:53,480 --> 03:54:55,480
and I think that probably in some cases

4600
03:54:55,480 --> 03:54:57,480
would happen and I think it's worth

4601
03:54:57,480 --> 03:54:59,480
having both numbers

4602
03:54:59,480 --> 03:55:01,480
I think that count should be segregated

4603
03:55:01,480 --> 03:55:03,480
so that's your post def momentum

4604
03:55:05,480 --> 03:55:07,480
the word suicide appears

4605
03:55:07,480 --> 03:55:09,480
on this page 107 times

4606
03:55:09,480 --> 03:55:11,480
if someone

4607
03:55:11,480 --> 03:55:13,480
died

4608
03:55:13,480 --> 03:55:15,480
if someone died with like a million subs

4609
03:55:15,480 --> 03:55:17,480
and then after they died

4610
03:55:17,480 --> 03:55:19,480
their work was discovered

4611
03:55:19,480 --> 03:55:21,480
they get 50 million people

4612
03:55:21,480 --> 03:55:23,480
sub and like

4613
03:55:23,480 --> 03:55:25,480
I guess

4614
03:55:25,480 --> 03:55:27,480
no but why would you sub

4615
03:55:27,480 --> 03:55:29,480
there won't be any more updates

4616
03:55:29,480 --> 03:55:31,480
I mean you're looking at

4617
03:55:31,480 --> 03:55:33,480
in purely rational terms

4618
03:55:33,480 --> 03:55:35,480
rather than like emotional ones

4619
03:55:35,480 --> 03:55:37,480
or someone not knowing

4620
03:55:37,480 --> 03:55:39,480
oh yeah

4621
03:55:39,480 --> 03:55:41,480
I know it's a bit of a weird gesture

4622
03:55:41,480 --> 03:55:43,480
but you know

4623
03:55:47,480 --> 03:55:49,480
I mean including the sub count

4624
03:55:49,480 --> 03:55:51,480
is pretty gauche either way

4625
03:55:51,480 --> 03:55:53,480
yeah no

4626
03:55:53,480 --> 03:55:55,480
that was when I read this

4627
03:55:55,480 --> 03:55:57,480
it was really fucked up

4628
03:55:57,480 --> 03:55:59,480
and then a part of my brain did go

4629
03:55:59,480 --> 03:56:01,480
they really all stop counting once they're dead right

4630
03:56:03,480 --> 03:56:05,480
the duality

4631
03:56:05,480 --> 03:56:07,480
they should publish

4632
03:56:07,480 --> 03:56:09,480
obituaries in the newspaper

4633
03:56:09,480 --> 03:56:11,480
and say like how many people showed up

4634
03:56:11,480 --> 03:56:13,480
to your funeral and like rank them

4635
03:56:13,480 --> 03:56:15,480
that week

4636
03:56:15,480 --> 03:56:17,480
who was the highest scoring death this week

4637
03:56:17,480 --> 03:56:19,480
okay I'm scrolling through this

4638
03:56:19,480 --> 03:56:21,480
I'm just looking through them I'm seeing like

4639
03:56:21,480 --> 03:56:23,480
Total Biscuit, Christina Grimmie

4640
03:56:23,480 --> 03:56:25,480
was on Steph and Carl okay

4641
03:56:25,480 --> 03:56:27,480
David Bowie is not a YouTuber

4642
03:56:27,480 --> 03:56:29,480
I don't care if he has a YouTube channel

4643
03:56:29,480 --> 03:56:31,480
you don't get the put them on this list

4644
03:56:31,480 --> 03:56:33,480
oh that

4645
03:56:33,480 --> 03:56:35,480
he doesn't deserve the cloud

4646
03:56:35,480 --> 03:56:37,480
he didn't even break a million subs

4647
03:56:37,480 --> 03:56:39,480
no free cloud David

4648
03:56:39,480 --> 03:56:41,480
yeah come on David

4649
03:56:43,480 --> 03:56:45,480
social climbers man

4650
03:56:45,480 --> 03:56:47,480
member of the prodigy you can't

4651
03:56:47,480 --> 03:56:49,480
like guys

4652
03:56:49,480 --> 03:56:51,480
Prince Philip

4653
03:56:51,480 --> 03:56:53,480
wait

4654
03:56:53,480 --> 03:56:55,480
is that what killed him

4655
03:56:55,480 --> 03:56:57,480
is that his reason for death

4656
03:56:57,480 --> 03:56:59,480
yeah not released to the public

4657
03:56:59,480 --> 03:57:01,480
this is so stupid

4658
03:57:01,480 --> 03:57:03,480
this list is really funny

4659
03:57:03,480 --> 03:57:05,480
it includes people with like

4660
03:57:05,480 --> 03:57:07,480
700 subs in the bottom

4661
03:57:07,480 --> 03:57:09,480
smaller than I expected

4662
03:57:09,480 --> 03:57:11,480
that even put on here

4663
03:57:11,480 --> 03:57:13,480
I know who hardly any of these people are

4664
03:57:13,480 --> 03:57:15,480
Joe Strummer

4665
03:57:15,480 --> 03:57:17,480
wait yeah there's people

4666
03:57:17,480 --> 03:57:19,480
Joe Strummer died before YouTube came out

4667
03:57:19,480 --> 03:57:21,480
what is this

4668
03:57:21,480 --> 03:57:23,480
there's people on this list with 500 subs

4669
03:57:23,480 --> 03:57:25,480
like these aren't YouTubers

4670
03:57:25,480 --> 03:57:27,480
they're just people who had one channel

4671
03:57:27,480 --> 03:57:29,480
I don't know

4672
03:57:29,480 --> 03:57:31,480
they make me wonder how they found those

4673
03:57:31,480 --> 03:57:33,480
random people who had an account with no

4674
03:57:33,480 --> 03:57:35,480
with like barely any followers but like

4675
03:57:35,480 --> 03:57:37,480
ugh

4676
03:57:37,480 --> 03:57:39,480
that's like what is the point of this list

4677
03:57:39,480 --> 03:57:41,480
that's like kind of worse because they're definitely not public figures

4678
03:57:41,480 --> 03:57:43,480
and they don't

4679
03:57:43,480 --> 03:57:45,480
you don't need that shit

4680
03:57:45,480 --> 03:57:47,480
and they are ranked below a bunch of people

4681
03:57:47,480 --> 03:57:49,480
I don't like this

4682
03:57:49,480 --> 03:57:51,480
what the

4683
03:57:51,480 --> 03:57:53,480
God we really could have ended this episode

4684
03:57:53,480 --> 03:57:55,480
on a high note with that Nate joke

4685
03:57:55,480 --> 03:57:57,480
but instead we sent down this rabbit hole

4686
03:57:57,480 --> 03:57:59,480
and now we're here

4687
03:57:59,480 --> 03:58:01,480
I am so proud I remembered this

4688
03:58:01,480 --> 03:58:03,480
and I can just drag us down

4689
03:58:03,480 --> 03:58:05,480
into the depths

4690
03:58:05,480 --> 03:58:07,480
no wasted content Tom

4691
03:58:07,480 --> 03:58:09,480
you know that's fair

4692
03:58:09,480 --> 03:58:11,480
I just you know I shouldn't have brought it back

4693
03:58:11,480 --> 03:58:13,480
I shouldn't have brought this up I could have saved this if I ever came back

4694
03:58:13,480 --> 03:58:15,480
it could have been a topic of discussion

4695
03:58:15,480 --> 03:58:17,480
but I guess it is now

4696
03:58:17,480 --> 03:58:19,480
you can click

4697
03:58:19,480 --> 03:58:21,480
you can click on

4698
03:58:21,480 --> 03:58:23,480

03:58:39,480 --> 03:58:41,480
what's really fucked up is

4708
03:58:41,480 --> 03:58:43,480
this list has gotten so much

4709
03:58:43,480 --> 03:58:45,480

4710
03:58:45,480 --> 03:58:47,480

guys bad wolf gaming's last

4721
03:59:07,480 --> 03:59:09,480
video he looks visibly

4722
03:59:09,480 --> 03:59:11,480
emaciated his last video

4723
03:59:11,480 --> 03:59:13,480
it's called I've got some bad news

4724
03:59:13,480 --> 03:59:15,480
and he's saying like they found

4725
03:59:15,480 --> 03:59:17,480
like a tumor in his abdomen

4726
03:59:17,480 --> 03:59:19,480
and it's like

4727
03:59:19,480 --> 03:59:21,480
he's literally saying he's sick and might die

4728
03:59:21,480 --> 03:59:23,480
and that's his last video and it happened

4729
03:59:23,480 --> 03:59:25,480
oh my god

4730
03:59:25,480 --> 03:59:27,480
this is macabre but just

4731
03:59:27,480 --> 03:59:29,480
the way it's worded is fucking

4732
03:59:29,480 --> 03:59:31,480
you know

4733
03:59:31,480 --> 03:59:33,480
you know what

4734
03:59:33,480 --> 03:59:35,480
you know what though I would describe

4735
03:59:35,480 --> 03:59:37,480
I would describe this list

4736
03:59:37,480 --> 03:59:39,480
of deceased youtubers ranked

4737
03:59:39,480 --> 03:59:41,480
according to sub count as rather

4738
03:59:41,480 --> 03:59:43,480
lynchian I really would

4739
03:59:43,480 --> 03:59:45,480
I would say

4740
03:59:45,480 --> 03:59:47,480
that this juxtaposes

4741
03:59:47,480 --> 03:59:49,480
I would say that this juxtaposes

4742
03:59:49,480 --> 03:59:51,480
the mundane with the macabre in a way

4743
03:59:51,480 --> 03:59:53,480
that calls the attention to the

4744
03:59:53,480 --> 03:59:55,480
containment of one inside of the other

4745
03:59:55,480 --> 03:59:57,480
I really would

4746
03:59:57,480 --> 03:59:59,480
where's the electricity

4747
03:59:59,480 --> 04:00:01,480
oh no

4748
04:00:01,480 --> 04:00:03,480
wow you did it

4749
04:00:03,480 --> 04:00:05,480
you made it so cool

4750
04:00:05,480 --> 04:00:07,480
it's like the fourth circle

4751
04:00:07,480 --> 04:00:09,480
oh I'm noticing at the top

4752
04:00:09,480 --> 04:00:11,480
that there is some standards

4753
04:00:11,480 --> 04:00:13,480
please note channels need to have at least

4754
04:00:13,480 --> 04:00:15,480
500 subscribers to be added

4755
04:00:15,480 --> 04:00:17,480
what

4756
04:00:17,480 --> 04:00:19,480
alright pro tip to anyone

4757
04:00:19,480 --> 04:00:21,480
listening get a youtube channel

4758
04:00:21,480 --> 04:00:23,480

4760
04:00:25,480 --> 04:00:27,480

4761
04:00:27,480 --> 04:00:29,480
won't die

4762
04:00:29,480 --> 04:00:31,480
there's one I've got to bring up which

4763
04:00:31,480 --> 04:00:33,480
it's not funny that a guy died

4764
04:00:33,480 --> 04:00:35,480
but good god the fucking wording

4765
04:00:35,480 --> 04:00:37,480
on this

4766
04:00:37,480 --> 04:00:39,480
yeah lung cancer the lung cancer was

4767
04:00:39,480 --> 04:00:41,480
caused by his excessive indulgence

4768
04:00:41,480 --> 04:00:43,480
in tobacco huh okay

4769
04:00:43,480 --> 04:00:45,480

was he like a tobacco review channel

4771
04:00:47,480 --> 04:00:49,480
I imagine by

4772
04:00:49,480 --> 04:00:51,480
okay this one this one is the one I

4773
04:00:51,480 --> 04:00:53,480
always remember Asia McGowan

4774
04:00:53,480 --> 04:00:55,480
just because there's a certain

4775
04:00:55,480 --> 04:00:57,480
indignity in this

4776
04:00:57,480 --> 04:00:59,480
McGowan was shot dead

4777
04:00:59,480 --> 04:01:01,480
at Henry Ford college by Tony

4778
04:01:01,480 --> 04:01:03,480

4785
04:01:15,480 --> 04:01:17,480
design of tobacco pipes part 3

4786
04:01:19,480 --> 04:01:21,480

4787
04:01:21,480 --> 04:01:23,480

4788
04:01:23,480 --> 04:01:25,480

4789
04:01:27,480 --> 04:01:29,480

4790
04:01:29,480 --> 04:01:31,480
