1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Panel number one, a demon fox?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello everybody and welcome to the Nauru Cast. I am your host, Mumkey Jones.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,960
But I'm Mage, I guess.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:22,000
And me and Mage right now, we decided, evidently, there is an opening slot here on the PCP for a new podcast.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,240
I guess there is some other podcast on this channel that has moved to a different one, I don't know.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,680
But Mage and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to start our own manga, anime book reviewing podcast.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,400
But, you know, instead of doing it chapter by chapter or something stupid like that, we decided it would be better

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,960
to enrich our Naruto reading experience, to dissect this, to analyze this beautiful piece of art.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,600
Panel by panel. So each week we're gonna review a new panel of the Naruto manga. How does that sound to you, Mage?

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,040
That's great because when you review it like by chapter, you miss out on all the wonderful art and detail that goes into each every panel.

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,120
So we're gonna go into very detailed stuff.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Yeah, because when you're doing it by chapter, you're gonna be more focused on like the plot and the characters.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,320
And you really do miss out like the showmanship that goes into each panel. You know, how big should this individual panel be?

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,760
What will be happening? What is the art style we want to go for here? Where do we put the words? Are the words in Japanese?

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know. There's so many decisions that go into every little intricate detail of manga that people don't appreciate when you review it on a grand scale.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,240
Yeah, they just take it for granted. Like, have you ever tried making a manga? You know how hard it is to make panels? That's an actual problem.

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,320
Yes. And we are blessed because the first panel of the Naruto manga is an entire page.

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,040
It's a full page. So we're gonna review the first panel and the first page at the same time.

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Now up at the top, we have the introduction. You know, it's chapter one.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,520
And what's interesting is that before the one, instead of like a number sign or something, they have this this ominous looking paw print.

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
Do you do you see what I'm looking at here? Yeah, yeah, I see it.

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Now we don't know starting off because we're only looking at the the chapter number right now.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,600
We don't know if this is the paw of like a wolf of a dog of a cat.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
You know, we don't know what this is going to be, but I think having read this first panel,

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,400
I think this might be foreshadowing to what the first paragraph of the panel is going to tell us. Very subtle of them.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,400
And then we have we have a colon and then it tells us the name of the chapter, which is Uzumaki Naruto.

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,800
With two exclamation points. Not three. It's very exciting. Not one. It's two.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,240
Now, why do you now you're a bit of an artist, right, Mage?

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
Why do you think that the artist chose to do two

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,560
exclamation points instead of one or three? See, because one would not be enough and three just makes it like

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
it's kind of a bit too much.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
So I'm guessing it seems like they're trying too hard.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,840
Yeah, so I think like to find that perfect unique balance because you don't see people use two exclamation points.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,680
If people always just kind of go between one or three or like infinity, but never two.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,320
And you know, that's a pretty good angle because I think from the very beginning Naruto is trying to be original.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,080
So even the number of exclamation points, you know, it the originality shines through even in something like the first chapter title.

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
Very interesting.

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
So now we move into there were

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,840
Four sentences on this page one in each corner and the center image is

40
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,240
Should we talk about the art first before we dive into the exposition?

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
We should we should read the text first because oh, okay. Yeah

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,760
Yeah, go ahead

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
Okay, so should I read out the first?

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,880
Oh, yeah, I think we should I think we should always read what's on the page since these are short enough

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah, okay. So like any manga we start reading from the right side rather than the left side

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,560
Now that always confused me as a kid because they always teach you you know with you know, English books

47
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
You read left to right. So I'm a kid. I'm sitting there holding this what I assume is a comic book

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't know what Japan is. I don't know what a manga is or an anime as far as I know

49
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,840
Everything is just a cartoon or a comic book. So when I'm start reading this shit as a kid

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,840
It starts off, you know on the left. I'm like, well, that doesn't make any sense

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
It'd make more sense to start on the right. So

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
It's like a big cultural gap

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,800
And that's another thing that that I appreciate about this is that it stays true to Japanese culture to Japanese customs

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,120
And it teaches American kids our English kids

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,960
What have you about how cultures can have even something simple like reading can be completely

56
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,880
Backwards and different and I really like that. Yeah, I remember when in Latviania manga became a thing

57
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,720
Um, they had this sort of old warning that like, oh, you're supposed to read it that way not that way

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360
But I think they only did it on popular manga like Dragon Ball Z and Naruto

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
The other mangas that I bought

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,000
They didn't have that warning but luckily for me. I already knew what manga was. So I knew how to read it. Yeah

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
You were a cultured child

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,360
Well, manga came in pretty late in telephony. So I was already a teen by that time

63
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,440
No longer. Oh, that's so unfortunate. You didn't get to grow up with Naruto

64
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
Uh

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,520
Kind of like I I discovered Naruto in my early teens when I discovered internet and it was actually one of the first

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Animes I've watched

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,360
So I think it's the ideal gateway anime because it it opens you up to this wonderful world of Japanese cartoon

68
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
I absolutely loved Naruto when I was younger

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay, so should we read this first sentence? Okay, you want to start?

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, I can it says once appeared a nine-tailed demon fox

71
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,560
Now this is interesting because and I know we don't want to dive into the art yet, but it looks like

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,080
It's it's kind of an abstract depiction of what I think this fox would be like

73
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,560
And it has these weird spirals coming off and if I count them one two three four

74
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
There's nine. Okay. So it's consistent with the words on the page. That's good. Yep

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,400
Uh, it it's mighty tails could crumble mountains and cause tsunamis

76
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Well, okay, so

77
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,760
So it's setting up this concept of a giant evil demon fox now

78
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Do you think that this is kind of

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,800
Ostracizing to a new viewer if they if they pick up a Naruto book and they see like this orange ninja

80
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
Who looks like he's having crazy adventures?

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,360
And then you open it up in the first panel is like talking about some weird mythology stuff with like a magic demon fox

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Do you think that was kind of a risky move on the part of the artist?

83
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
Or do you think it's a good way to introduce us to the world of Naruto?

84
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,320
The art probably is confusing because when I first saw the the whole page

85
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,560
I I couldn't make heads or tails of what it was

86
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,040
But after reading the words and looking into the picture. I was like, oh, I see now

87
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
I see what they're what they're saying and

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
Like

89
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,320
It's it's a 50 50

90
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,040
I think on a lot of people it depends on how interested they are if they're just flipping through and they're

91
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Probably just going to see

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,600
Like a mess and they're just going to you know skip it not bother to look into it

93
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,960
But those who stop and smell the roses so to speak will get treated to the nice little

94
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
imagery of the actual words on so

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
I don't know um

96
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Do you want to move on to the next? Yeah

97
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,080
Okay, should I read it?

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,880
Yeah, yeah, go ahead to fight the demon the people assembled all the shinobi from the village

99
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,520
Now I don't know about you and this might be an issue with just the translation

100
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,400
But I think the word assembled is spelled wrong on this page. Is it spelled wrong for you too?

101
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,360
Oh, I I yeah now that you mentioned it it might be spelled wrong

102
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,760
They have it spelled a s s e n m b l e d

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,880
Now do you think that in the original japanese kanji that they spelled it wrong as well as some sort of symbolic reference to the people

104
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
Assembling although later on in the show and this will probably be a good

105
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,640
Since we're doing this panel by panel we'll probably get to this in about 80 years

106
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,920
But there's a great ninja war from all the different clans

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,760
And so this might be foreshadowing to how the people didn't actually assemble and that's why they spelled it wrong on purpose

108
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
as sort of you know

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,160
A symbolic way of saying these people might be assembling but as we all know that's not actually going to happen

110
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,600
Hmm

111
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,560
No, I think it might be just a spelling error on the translators part

112
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,160
You know, I think I think both of our hypotheses are equally possible. Well, yes, but at the same time, I'd like to believe that you know, um

113
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,320
It's kind of like you're going like you're giving too much stuff to it at least

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
How I see it made me

115
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,800
because

116
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,680
um

117
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,720
By the time they get to that part where this little hint makes sense, I think people would have forgotten that misspelling

118
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
That's a good point. That's a good point

119
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
All right, I'll move on to the third sentence. It says

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,040
One brave shinobi was able to seal up the demon but because of that he lost his life

121
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,720
Tragedy on the very first page. We have somebody dying

122
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,600
It it tells you that this is going to be a series of fights and death

123
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,480
And sorrow and sadness and violence and in the third sentence of the entire

124
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,280
Manga, we have we have a brave shinobi dying. What do you make of this?

125
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,240
Well, it is certainly tragic and once we get to the fourth sentence

126
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,480
I might talk a little bit more not about the tragedy but about the

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
All the whole thing. Um, I would just like to say that

128
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,800
The word shinobi first time comers would probably not know what it means

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,440
And no, no, I don't think do do the ever explain it. Um

130
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
Meet me. I think you you just kind of have to

131
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,320
Figure out on your own that kind of role looks like warrior ninja that kind of thing

132
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah, I think like

133
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,360
Now it's popular to say oh Naruto's a ninja and stuff like that

134
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
But in the manga they use the word shinobi

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
Which is I'm guessing that Japanese word for it or something like it or you know

136
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,080
Uh, but yeah for newcomers it might be confusing. Um, to

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,720
Uh be be uh assaulted right on the first page with unknown words with all this weird terminology

138
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,560
In the vernacular that you might not be accustomed to but again, that's just it's introducing us to a different culture

139
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
And I think it's an important thing

140
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,240
That's the second time on this page that Japanese culture has been you know thrust upon

141
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
non-Japanese

142
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Readers but in a good way. Yes

143
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,280
And the final sentence in the bottom left corner says

144
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
That shinobi was called

145
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
The fourth hokage again

146
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,800
We're not only do we have the word shinobi again, but now we have something called a hokage, which you know as a reader

147
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,520
I don't have any idea what hokage is supposed to be let alone being the fourth

148
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, but I think they actually do explain later on what a hokage is or what a kage is but

149
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,040
Unlike shinobi, which I'm not sure if they do or not

150
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:29,120
Right, but yeah, there's now there's two words right on the first page that the readers might not be familiar with

151
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,520
Right, it's opening them up to this whole new world where even the words are different

152
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,720
It's quite risky though a risky action for the translator because a lot of people might drop things if they feel like they can't

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,520
Understand what's going on and usually that's a result of using unknown words

154
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,600
It's what a lot of creative people suffer from when they try to explain the mechanics of their world

155
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
And right off the bat

156
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
But because people don't know the setting or the story or the characters or anything

157
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,520
They have no one or nothing to relate it to so this is just a big blurb

158
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,280
They can't really picture it in their heads and they don't understand what's going on

159
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,920
So yeah, at least it's only two words rather than like, you know four or five on the first page

160
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,760
And speaking of of setting up, you know the world of your fiction at the beginning

161
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,680
This you know panel this page consists of four sentences, but already we have so much lore

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,720
We have so much backstory so much exposition just from these four not that long sentences

163
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,040
We know that there's a magical demon fuck

164
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,840
So now we know we're thrust into a world where magic and demons exist and that there are

165
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,800
You know, there are different villages full of shinobi. We don't know what a shinobi is necessarily

166
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,760
But we can assume if they're gathering to fight there's some sort of warrior or fighter or something like that

167
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
We know that

168
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,640
You can seal demons with magic spells and that there is something called a hokage

169
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
And evidently there have been four of them and we can assume because the shinobi

170
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,840
Who sealed the demon became hokage that in some way being a hokage means you're very powerful or you're some sort of

171
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,160
Tragic hero something like that. So I think it's astonishing how

172
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,960
Miyamoto when he wrote this was able to

173
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,400
Have so much lore within four short sentences

174
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,080
Another thing the fourth sentence that I quite like is that instead of giving the character a name like, uh, you know

175
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,400
Bob or whatever

176
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,520
They specifically said this person was called the four of hokage

177
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,240
Which sounds like, you know a title the fourth something like the fourth president or something

178
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,440
So it means that this person's status is more important than this person's actual person

179
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,880
It's more important to the story to the plot to know what he is rather than who he is

180
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,080
And it's probably a good thing that they that they do that for two reasons one

181
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,440
You're right. It does establish that you know a hokage is a it's a title

182
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
That's more important than your name

183
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,160
But two and this might be spoilers for for 800,000 panels in the future

184
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,240
But when we find out who the fourth hokage actually was that's a huge turning point for naruto

185
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,880
So I think it's good that we keep this a secret all the way back from panel one. Yes

186
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,320
Now ready to talk a bit about the artwork now. Yes. I have quite a few things to say

187
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,920
Sheer go ahead

188
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,400
Okay, so like at the very bottom under the fox thing that we already established has nine tails and stuff like that

189
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
There's a there's a circle and within that circle

190
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,240
We can see an inches star that not a lot of people at least not first comers would be familiar with if they're not familiar with

191
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,000
Japanese culture and whatnot right but within that

192
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,280
Star you can see a figure standing on top of a frog that has a symbol on its belly. You see that

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
Yeah, yeah, do you do read japanese? Do you know what that symbol means?

194
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
Sadly, no, uh, I used to be familiar with a few

195
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,680
Symbols, but this is not a symbol unfamiliar with no

196
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,920
That's too bad. Somebody in the comments will have to let us know. Yes

197
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,720
And he is surrounded by little fire things which usually

198
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,880
Denotes like magic because they're floating fire things like wisps or whatever

199
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,600
So I'm assuming it's you know referencing how he sealed demon

200
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,920
And if you go back up to see right behind the the demon fox you can almost make out like a little

201
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Sigil the word may be like a kind of not a circle

202
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
um

203
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,400
How many corners I can't really tell how many corners it is, but it's like uh

204
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Well, it kind of looks like an alchemy circle

205
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,600
Yeah, it kind of almost looks like a seal which makes sense because this person is sealing up the demon

206
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,560
And the whole picture is connected like that

207
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,520
And basically now it's a go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah, and it's basically just illustrating

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Illustrating the force the four sentences we just read. That's why I wanted to read the sentences first rather than analyzing the image

209
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,120
Uh, I think it's a good thing that we're analyzing this one panel at a time because there's so many little details to the art that you know

210
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
I never would have even thought of before unless I was doing a show like this

211
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,320
But your description was pretty apt of you have the big ninja star and then the guy on the frog is standing in front of it

212
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,360
But what i'm noticing now is a bit of jesus imagery because the the shinobi

213
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Ninja star is is sitting up in a way that it resembles, you know, the cross

214
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,600
You know, it's like, you know up and then across, you know, yeah

215
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,360
And it can also resemble, you know, the death of the person

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
Exactly because

217
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,720
The whole point of the cross is that jesus is making the ultimate sacrifice for the good of the people around him

218
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,360
And this shinobi is standing in front of this ninja star that is in the shape of a cross

219
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,560
So it's like he is sacrificing his life to save the people around him, which is exactly what he's doing

220
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,040
According to the text exactly. So that's crazy. He died to save others

221
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,960
That's just it's phenomenal. I never would have observed something like that

222
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,280
So do we have anything else we should talk about on this panel or should we should we save it for next time?

223
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
um

224
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,760
I think we're done here. I I just wanted to point out that um, I quite like the sort of messy inky look of this

225
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,400
It looks tattered and kind of old

226
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Of like you're reading an old ninja scroll that is telling you stories of the past. Yes, it's very very messy very

227
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,320
Uh, maybe almost rushed in a way, but at the same time you can still make out the important details

228
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,880
And and also it's rather than written. It's illustrated. So anyone at any point any time from anywhere could

229
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Try and understand what's going on

230
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,960
Yeah, it's kind of like when somebody messes up their hair on purpose to make it seem like they don't care about how their hair looks

231
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,800
You know, this art is kind of wacky and crazy and sloppy on purpose to resemble something greater

232
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,720
Maybe the chaos that the demon had brought upon the land

233
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
That's brilliant

234
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,480
All right. Well, everybody. Thank you for joining us for the naru cast where we review the naruto manga one panel at a time

235
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm looking forward to the next one made. Should we do this daily?

236
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,040
Should we put these up once a day once a week once a month once an hour?

237
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,440
What do you think how often should we put these up? Let's keep it a surprise

238
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Okay, okay. We'll keep it a surprise. We'll see you guys next time for panel two of chapter one

239
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,760
Of page two of naruto. I've been monkey jones and this has been mage
