00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here we are on episode 9 of Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers 9, frog fractions episode 2, part 2, frog fractions 2, part 3.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You've been waiting for this moment your entire fucking lives and I know that you aren't ready. You think you're ready. You think you've been preparing.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You think that you're the biggest reference cop killers fan there is and there ever was, but you don't know fucking anything.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You don't know what you're about to witness today. Here, on Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers 9, frog fractions 2, episode 3.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're going to be waiting to show it. This is great.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, there you go. There's the table of contents for this video guy.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, wait, wait. Should I not have shown that?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No, it's fine.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's what you're in for on this lovely day.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hang on, hang on. I'm having a problem, which is now that I've started the game, your audio is kind of crunchy and clippy and shitty.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, yeah?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A little bit here. Let me close a bunch of tabs and see if that helps.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Everyone have noticed you and all the PCP just love having fucking thousands of tabs open, where if I have more than two open at a single time, I feel like I'm passing on.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I feel like I am. I have passed.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's nothing to pass.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have passed.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I, oh my god, this sucks.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Here.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Wait, say something?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is on show, by the way. This is not going to be edited out.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, starting the game, starting the game made my cursor all like flickery and shitty looking.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Maybe Discord isn't powerful enough to handle referee scopulars. Maybe you have to go to the more simple and traditional Amish program known as Skype.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Dude, Skype's so much worse. Skype did the same shit. Skype fucked the whole thing up as well.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know. Can you just fucking deal with it, bro? Oh wait, does it? It happens through OBS too, huh? So it's going to fuck up for like the actual recording.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I think. I mean, I don't know. I could, I could, okay, I could stop recording and go back and listen to the audio and see how it sounds.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, do that. And also, yeah, that's fine.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to do that.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's looking to be intro though, so.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And we're back. Sorry for that.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we're back with Rowdy fuckers, cop killers, episode nine, frog fractions, part two, episode, uh, frog fractions two, a part three.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Uh, yeah.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I just want to, before we get into this, man, it's doing that shitty cursor thing again.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I just want to say that before we started, I ran around the game for like the better part of an hour, trying to recover all the keys and items that I had found.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because as you can see in the top, on the right side there, my, my, I'm missing keys from the inventory only to discover that the game fucking does it for me.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And it has this storage area at the beginning where all my shit is saved.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it was totally pointless.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Uh, yeah. And that's, that's my story.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I went to a fortune teller, like, like, uh, like a, you know, like a, like a carnival, like fucking like gypsy, like fucking like a cemetery gypsy.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And, uh, sure. And I want to get, I want to get my, you know, I want to see, cause I was just weighed with Bain breath for the next episode of breath.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know everyone in the audience was as well.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I just had to know what, what, what, how was going to go and what was going to happen in it.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And, and, and, and so I went, I went to, I went to this gypsy, I went to this fabled gypsy to understand what, what exactly was going to transpire.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then they said that all the sins and hatred I have cast throughout my entire life is going to come back now.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And it's going to completely obliterate me on every level and fucking take me out, uh, Adam by Adam.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And it's going to, and it's going to, it's going to be so, so vitriolic for everyone in the audience.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Cause I'm just going to have my, my, my royal of comments.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I'm going to be, you know, I'm going to be, I'm going to be a tear to part limb by limb for all the sins and hatred.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I fucking put on to all, to all the Brony analysis community.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I think it's time I have my royal, my royal of comments.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That gypsy was probably just a butthurt, Brony.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That, that, that, that gypsy was probably a fucking, uh, uh, mean commenter on her first video.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If I, if I had to guess, she had an agenda.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You know, that gypsy was probably a lightning bliss in disguise, if we're going to be honest with her.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Lighting bliss looks like she could be a gypsy on the side.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She could moonlight as a gypsy.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh God.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, this fucking game.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Uh, have we seen a single frog yet, by the way?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just wondering.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No frog.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no frog.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, no frog.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No frog.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How unfortunate.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And now I'm realizing that, um, even though I spent all that time playing this game and trying to get back, uh, Max revive, uh, I don't.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Excellent.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't remember how.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
God, I can't, now that I have the sword, I literally cannot even go through this fucking doorway.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Wait, wait, wait.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I might be, oh.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now I'm literally trapped.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My sword is wedged into the door and I cannot move.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
God.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, okay, I guess I don't.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Was this fucking game programmed by fucking immigrants?

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I might have to actually, like, re-boot the game, like, to get in there because the sword is too fucking big.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Uh, and it doesn't work.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's what he said when I chopped him in half.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because with my sword.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ooh, child.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You get saucy entertainment here.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You get saucy entertainment.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is only for mature audiences.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Refuge cop killers is, like, rated M for mature.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Rated M for mature.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Um, just like, you know.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Rated B for brony.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Um, God, I love bronies.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Can you just name a single subculture better than bronies, other than furries?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Um, breeders.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
People with the sick fetish of having intercourse with people of the opposite sex and conceiving children.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know, you really brought up a source topic for me specifically.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I once met a breeder, and let me tell you Benid did not go over well.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Did I go over well for anyone involved?

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What about all of his children?

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I assume that he's dead now.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean, I'm sure you didn't let a menace like that continue to run the streets.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, I'll say this.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's not going to be consummating any marriage anytime soon.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, thank God.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let me tell you that.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Rest assured, rest assured, his impotence will not be faked after our encounter.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Few.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, I think we have some unfinished business.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Not in the realm of My Little Pony, even though that's all I care about within my life.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And there's no other, there's no other true as other than My Little Pony.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think we've left our audience hanging for all the real bro-on-bro action that we've

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
hinted at and alluded to in our very first, reference copular seven, Frog Fractions 2,

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Episode 1.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
God, it seems like a lifetime ago.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It feels like a literal few months ago, and it truly was.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, it truly was.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It truly was, months and years.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
God, and what have we done in that time?

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nothing.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here we are.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're still playing Frog Fractions.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Nothing's changed, Munchy.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Nothing's changed.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Nothing's changed in our life, and nothing really ever will.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, me and you are going to be meeting up this October.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know, this might be released in January or February, but it's October 2nd right now.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And we're going to be meeting up on the 27th.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, and I'm real excited.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am really looking forward to seeing my boy Munch again.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My boy.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We're probably going to record some sort of Frog Fractions copular live there, possibly

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
with some sort of weird camera perspective with Uch on the couch and like horribly close

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
up to our face.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Or maybe so far away that you can barely see us thus defeating the point of recording

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
in the first place.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, I think it would pretty much be a crime not to do that.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, basically.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The reason I'm so eager, not only just to see my good friend and frat bro been saying,

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but I also want to scope out the area because it's looking like I might be there for the

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
rest of my life.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Shit.

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not fucking dammit.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not fucking dammit.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I cannot get this item because my sword is in the way again.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can't you like die angle it and then like flip turnways and then fucking like...

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I tried.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I tried two different ways.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
My sword can't turn this way.

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And if I bring it this way, I can get my sword up there.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But then...

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're so close.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's the best I can do.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay, whatever.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't think it matters that much.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I thought this game surely wouldn't make the sword literally incapable of you finishing

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the game.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sure.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Surely.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, I'll have to just restart.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have to just close the game and start it up again, swordless, to go back to these places.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Even though I fucking needed the sword to get here in the first place.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So I don't fucking...

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Never mind, actually.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There's no plan.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They have no plan.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
God has abandoned us.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Incredible.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So yeah.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I want to scope out the area.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I want to see Lanna.

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I want to see what my prison's going to look like.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I want to check out the cell before I commit the crime.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, before you buy the prison.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, it's my cat.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And on top of that, I'm also going to be in Boston in December as well as Ben and Nate

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and Tom and possibly Digi.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So we're probably going to do a little pow-wow there as well, to some extent.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
To some extent, currently not known.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But something.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Something.

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Something, I'm sure.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, so I'm excited for both of those occasions.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Both of those brocations.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And so, you know, do you have any more things to say about, like, we were pretty gung-ho

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
about Atlanta when we first recorded all of those moons ago.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The first episode of Froggy Fractions 2.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you have any, you know, do you have anything to follow up with on?

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because, I don't know, I feel like in some ways, Atlanta has only strengthened and in

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
some ways, it's weakened.

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like, enthusiasm-wise.

202
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will tell you right now that me, I personally, I don't actually go to Atlanta proper very

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
much because what the fuck would I do there.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But it's nice, and it's good, and it's cheap.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like, the biggest thing I can say is that the Atlanta area is pretty cheap, like, compared

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to similar places across the country.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So that's the highest recommendation it's got for me.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And like, it's got a subway, and like, I don't know, I think, I mean, it's no Boston or

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
anything, but it seems like a pretty good place, a pretty good city that's easy to get

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
around, and that there's a lot of shit going on in.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, and it's cheap, so there you go.

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Those are like, those are my two, those are my two qualifications for a good place to

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
live, and I think it's got both of them.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So, yeah.

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's interesting to say it's no Boston.

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Did you see the Google Doc I sent you?

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I had like, compiled a giant Google Doc of like, what each PCPimmer wants in their ideal

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
PCPHQ city, and like, the various things that we would all want, and then I wrote out all

219
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the cities where we were even thinking about, which included Atlanta first, then Boston,

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
then Austin, then LA, which the only thing written down for Atlanta whatsoever is the

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
pro that's in like, 96 font size, the only thing that's written that big in the entire

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
document, and it's just said, close to Si, and then a motocon.

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Honestly, I did not look at that document because I don't really have any requirements

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
for a place to live because I'll just say, I'm not moving.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh yeah?

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like, yeah, I'm not, I'm not looking to move for like, you know, yeah.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, well fuck.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Like, I'm hoping everyone comes here, but if they don't, well, you know, that's fine too,

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I guess.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I see, I see.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, well, well, there you go.

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah, yes.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, okay, on that document, me and Nate are the most, you know, active, obviously,

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
because me and Nate are the only people who do any bureaucracy within the PZP.

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We're the one who like, you know, file the taxes and stuff.

236
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait, you too?

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Are you in there pushing pencils?

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, oh, oh, I pushed so many pencils.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I have lead poisoning.

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've pushed so many pencils in my day.

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm gonna fucking be foaming at the next time there's an insulin shot in the area.

244
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Uh, a Scalawag is the support.

245
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay, according to Google, a white Southerner who collaborated with Northern Republicans

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
during deep reconstruction.

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay, yeah, reconstruction.

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay.

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So basically a trader, a trader for good.

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Someone who betrayed the South and fought against slavery.

251
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Scalawag is actually a pretty.

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to be a Scalawag now.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I want to be racist.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Racist against my own race.

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The bad race.

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
People should, I'm surprised that people haven't appropriated that term.

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I feel like that term is more relevant than ever now in this era of white privilege we live in.

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah.

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know, I'm gonna start wherever I see a good man fighting against his forefather's sins.

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And whenever I see, you know, whenever I see, whenever I go to the LA area to get my Roscoe's House of Chicken Waffles meal for the day,

263
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
then, then, then, and I see a man with, you know, a full beard, thick rimmed glasses and, you know, clean cut haircut,

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
wearing possibly flannel and an over shirt in the LA heat.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I'm gonna call him a Scalawag.

266
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And he'll know exactly, he'll know exactly how much love I have for him.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That'll be the secret code word.

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That'll be secret.

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What is happening in this game, by the way?

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I just had to answer a quiz to prove that I was, in fact, 32 years old, which I am not.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I won the test and now I get to play a super passive aggressive Xenomorph roommate irritation simulator,

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
wherein I have to annoy my Xenomorph roommate enough that he'll move out.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Okay, excellent.

274
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, and I, yeah, yeah, yeah, have until 8PM to convince him to move out, so what's doing?

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, it's short notice, short notice.

276
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I just have to up his annoyance and keep his suspicion down.

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Current inventory self-loathing...

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, oh, oh! Frackzio, you know me so well...

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,240
all right um yeah yes so on this document uh me and Ben uh or sorry me and Nate were uh

280
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,360
i've never compared you uh me uh we were filling out shit and uh me me me and Nate were actually

281
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,800
rapping a lot about Boston and uh how fucking uh much we like it and we wrote down a ton of

282
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,120
pros for it and it's it's my first pick and his first quote emotional pick which uh take with

283
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:53,600
that what you will uh it's Nate best man mm-hmm uh yeah uh so yeah um but you know fucking i guess

285
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,760
you could you could you sum that up for me uh basically me me me and Nate oh i i wanted i

286
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,720
wanted to see what your what your opinion on like of Boston was in general i love it it's the best

287
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,400
okay all right um um okay well okay here let me make the case real quick here let let let me

288
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,600
red pill you on on on my affection real quick i went to Boston for for for for various business

289
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,800
reasons back in august and um it was one of the most delightful experiences i've ever had in my

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,120
entire fucking life not not just for the business that that was that had transpired in said location

291
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,880
but just um um i'd never been okay like like San Diego i i truly love my hometown however um it

292
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,720
kind of is fucking shit and i don't like it anymore i have realized that it's not as good as Boston

293
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
because okay but like like what i had said San Diego has good public transport i truly

294
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,120
benched at the time but like i i i i took the subway or i guess the tea it's called uh and yeah

295
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,240
yeah the tea yeah and it was the most fucking transcendent experience in my entire life

296
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,280
it was fucking insane just how like simple and easy and how quick and like like just how like

297
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,480
reliable it is in every single way and how like everything's color coded so it's super easy and

298
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,400
super easy to get around and it's like not like it's not like expensive really i mean i don't know

299
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,960
it like i it's it's very good very very fucking good and a lot of time and that's really important

300
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,000
because i don't know um um i'm kind of scared of driving i don't know i mean i'm scared of driving

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
too i'm convinced that if i'm gonna die on early death it's gonna be in a car yeah yeah um same

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,480
same yeah so uh i want to uh you know uh minimize that as much as possible also just i don't know

303
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,040
fuck it just i i don't i don't want to i don't have to pay gas i don't want to have to do any of

304
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:56,960
that and insurance and and all taxes and all this shit all the shit that goes with a car ownership

305
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,560
that's why that's why i always wanted to live in a in a city so i could just fucking do public

306
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,640
transport and not have to fuck around with cars and things like that and and even and even if you

307
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,720
didn't want to like take the subway in boston like in san diego every like street is on like a grid

308
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,800
like like everything is super like mathematically like like you know like like structurally like

309
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,200
sound and like like like mathematically uh poised to make the best possible experience uh like like

310
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,320
like like like like size and distance wise however in boston everything's so fucking dense and the

311
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,720
treats are and the streets are so fucking wibbly wobbly they can just like walk you just walk like

312
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,240
a block and you'll already have met like five new incredible stores that are fucking sick yeah

313
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,400
that's what it's like yeah it's it's fucking incredible and and i love it and it's it's like

314
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,880
super um i really appreciate density in any way my name's digi brony i love uh apple book season

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,800
we we don't live we only survive and and by and by joe that's the way i like it but yeah

324
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,440
boston was a great was it was a great time and um um tom like lives there currently i mean like

325
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,320
like like outside the sea but like you know he lives there unless he still lives with his parents

326
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,760
right um i think so he says he he's pretty i went i went to his his old place with his parents and

327
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,200
he's pretty far from boston if he's still in the same place he says he's like 30 minutes away

328
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,160
uh maybe that seems that seems generous but okay if he says so i believe it

329
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,240
mm-hmm um but yeah that's why that's why i remember at least he's like he's like he's like

330
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,840
30 minutes like 30 or 40 minutes well i i lived like a little less than an hour from from him

331
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:34,400
and he is like to the west of me so i would think he would be further but i don't know um

332
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,280
here here let me fact check myself let me fact check myself um even if he was like an hour i don't

333
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,920
know maybe it just means i live in california but it's like i don't know an hour is not that long

334
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,600
to me considering like in the east on the east coast everything is fucking like providence and

335
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,520
boston are two major cities that are like fucking an hour away from each other yeah where if you

336
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,040
want to go from uh san yago to la it's gonna cost you like three hours at like yeah normal traffic

337
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,680
um um um here fucking tom okay okay so so sorry he is an hour away it's specifically an hour um

338
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,040
um but um i don't know fuck off that's that's still boston that counts that fucking counts

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,000
doesn't it i mean i don't know that looks like blue that would describe as blue i think well that's

495
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,960
cyan is blue cyan is fucking bright blue okay well i think that might be okay i think that's

496
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,400
actually green uh and it just like looks looks blue because of tricks because of tricks and yeah

497
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:19,680
because of a clever spell because of because of pranks yeah due to shenanigans do do do emotional

498
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:28,400
manipulation that that that sure looks blue um what what were we talking about we're talking

499
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,720
we've gotten off track we were talking about how i want to move to boston is what we were talking

500
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:43,680
about i need that cyan key so fucking bad um well you should i mean boston's good i think i mean i

501
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,760
think you should move to atlanta because that's where i am but yeah i would never blame you for

502
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,440
moving to boston because it's a great it's a great city and it's a great place um whoa would

503
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,240
you see that guy running yeah i did i think i think it's a thief yeah he looks like a thief

504
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,000
i i have good eyes i've worked in a kevinia store for 35 years i know a thief when i see one

505
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,800
yeah yeah um that guy just he just had a certain he just had a certain air of um arrestability

506
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,360
about him you know i'm not gonna jump to conclusions here ben and you know i'm not a racist or anything

507
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,000
but when i see an ethnic what when i see an ethnic walking into my bodega i know

508
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:33,200
shit my bodega uh oh i found fuel for my autosword oh oh excellent worthless

509
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,080
oh excellent my autosword ran out of fuel oh what a shame what a fucking shame

510
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,560
uh i'm trying to get through tight corridors with that

511
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,360
you're dead yeah there's no there's no way maybe you can slash the thing i don't think so

512
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,880
there must be another way there must be another way to fucking achieve our goals

513
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,520
let me try to slash it no

514
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,820
no

515
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,400
what i thought maybe i could possibly

516
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,520
maybe the autosword like will actually help oh wait no the fuels i already ran out of fuel

517
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,760
it's too late yeah maybe i can break these barrels try try try doffing skates they don't make

518
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,160
you run faster uh i need the white key to doff the skates okay or you should already have them

519
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,920
take it away i do not have the white key um no no it says to take off the skate so i guess

520
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,520
yeah yeah the skates are already on this this skate i complained about this last time when i run into

521
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,000
a wall it like automatically changes my direction and that's what the skates do that's these are the

522
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:57,360
skates in action right now excellent i'm just holding up okay good yeah um oh god frog fractions

523
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,200
too all right this i don't know what i'm supposed to do here i feel like oh

524
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,640
yeah i i don't think uh i don't think i have what it takes for that challenge at the moment

525
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,680
uh well fuck um we'll never catch that ethnic red handed just just like how i always wanted

526
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:28,720
someday i mean we live in a world of possibilities speaking of real shit we alluded to we alluded

527
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,920
to a project of ours an ongoing um um business venture um in the first episode but we were

528
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,520
going to try and reconnect to our roots and you know regain our emotional stranglehold over the

529
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,200
pcp and all of its and all of its uh tentacles yeah yeah and be like real human beings again

530
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,560
yeah and and reconnect with our humanity and not be fucking twisted emotionally stunted freaks

531
00:43:52,560 --> 00:44:00,160
yeah for a change perhaps you know if at all possible yeah um and and so we've created the

532
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,960
real friend initiative where um roughly every week or so around sunday i believe we we try and

533
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:15,120
pop into a call and you should know uh spitfire you know you know you know rhyme you know um um you

534
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:22,560
know fucking you know all those sort of uh quote unquote lit activities yeah yeah yeah um drop

535
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:34,000
unbelievable beats how yeah we've been it's been uh challenging uh it doesn't uh work yeah it sucks

536
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:42,720
yeah it sucks um we tried it last week and very quickly very quickly it devolved into like

537
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,000
okay here's where we're moving and here's what we're gonna be doing in the future of youtube

538
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,240
so i left because i don't care um law um um i i okay well personally i love talking about

539
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,720
moving since i don't know um you know it's um it'll be my first time but but i will admit that

540
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,560
the youtube is not what this is for no well that's what that's what like like digi came in and then

541
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,080
it all became like okay what about what business opportunities are we looking for in atlanta

542
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,600
and like news to me that that's even a consideration i don't i don't see it happening

543
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,560
like fucking what are we all going to become jeff no fuck it it's pointless it's all pointless

544
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,640
and retarded you gotta voice those concerns dude if you just you just gotta voice your opinion

545
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,080
you just you gotta you know when when when when when when when shit goes haywire and and and when

546
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,360
and when you and when you feel bad you gotta talk about you can't bottle it up dude i guess

547
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,320
i guess you're right but no i feel like nobody's i feel like no one's on the same page as us

548
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:57,200
munchie like i feel like you and i are really just in it to have fun but like digi and davoo

549
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,720
and nate are just and and and tom and major only kind of sort of here i mean i guess they're just

550
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,680
yeah they're they mean they're just here to have fun too but like digi and nate and davoo are just so

551
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,600
they're so fucking business focused like there's there's so economically viable it makes me sick

552
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:25,200
yeah well so i don't i don't know i don't have anything i don't like have anything to say about

553
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,240
that whole aspect of it and it makes me mad sometimes i i don't know and i and i feel not

554
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,400
excluded okay maybe a little excluded i don't know i just feel like the conversation isn't

555
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,320
what i wanted to be so sometimes i get frustrated with the real friend initiative for that

556
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,000
well you know news news bulletin board turn on your tv click off of charlotte's

557
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
bill and you will see this currently what i'm about to say uh you can speak been

558
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:07,040
you do have a voice i but i don't have anything to say you can just say i don't have anything to

559
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,880
say and i don't want to be part of this conversation here's what we should talk about well i can i can

560
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,000
do the first part i can i can i can say i don't want to be a part of this conversation but i don't

561
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,480
have a follow-up of like alternative conversation that i do want to be a part of um i don't know i

562
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,960
agree with you that you know like like like no matter where we move to i think the business like

563
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,680
like i don't know it's not like we aren't in like a good business location right now like like i don't

564
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,120
know like like like not really any of us like i don't know like i think no matter where we go it

565
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,320
will work out because i don't know i like the pcb is only growing like it's working out fine now

566
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,240
like yeah i mean the plan was when we move when me and divu moved in with digi like divu thought

567
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,960
there was going to be stuff happening and i was like okay i was like down with it if stuff was

568
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,280
happening like if we were doing stuff and making stuff it didn't end up happening what ended up

569
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,920
happening was i just fucking did what i was already doing and then since i've left i've just

570
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,520
continued just doing what i was already doing so like i think what i've found is i don't really

571
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,360
like sure i'd love to live nearby all my pcp buddies and stuff like that would be great but

572
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:22,560
like i don't have any i don't have any expectation of like oh if we live together

573
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,400
we can do things like we can do things together i'm just i don't think it's going to make a

574
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,640
difference like it for my like work life whether i whether i'm with whether i'm physically near

575
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,560
to anyone with the exception being of lectures because i would do more lectures if i live near

576
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,960
the pcp and lectures are those profitable thing like both of the most popular pcp videos are you

577
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:51,680
and my lectures so yeah you know yeah um yeah so i god i'm i i regret so much not doing another one

578
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:59,520
at radcon too um it's i'm i'm gonna fucking rect i'm i will do another one like as soon as the pcp

579
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,560
is all in one place or even just a few of them i'm doing another one it's like it's so important

580
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,320
um um definitely definitely i i have a few ideas for lectures i don't think i'll be able to follow

581
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,320
up the dark jane one but you know it's something to humble probably yeah i'm gonna get into it um um

582
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,360
but yeah i don't know i i i i i'm i'm a young fella i i i i i'm a young baby boy and so yeah

583
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:31,920
young buck a young buck a young suave man yeah a young child and so i don't know i i i i i i i

584
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,760
i am with digi somewhat and you know everyone well i like in the sense that like i don't know

585
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,200
it would sure be nice to live in a place where you know uh you know opportunities and like

586
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,240
the sky's the limit and and stuff that effect but i don't know no matter where we are we like i

587
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,320
don't know i i don't buy that like for a second that there's like nothing that we are going to

588
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,800
like do together and like we have to be in like a fucking like you know through through like fucking

589
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:03,120
like la or like you know filmmaking sort of area i don't buy that for a second like like yeah like

590
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,560
we're oh no matter what is like like we were talking me and you were talking about how rag

591
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,840
com 3 years wants to be a chilling out uh you know uh sort of like real like real like real

592
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,640
friend place hangout time and you know nay didn't really understand because you wanted to just you

593
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,520
know work and do stuff but like see the thing is is that all of us are fucking broken and we all

594
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,840
just want to record let's plays and things we all want to record we all want to make stuff and

595
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,480
that's what we that is just what we want to do naturally maybe not do like the fucking grind

596
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,320
or anything but you know we we we aren't you know we we we like making things we are content creators

597
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,720
so we're always going to do things no matter fucking what so we could live in fucking tim buck

598
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,720
tour any or you know anywhere and we would still be making content together there was nothing

599
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:54,560
that's going to like change that uh yeah that's what that's why i'm saying it doesn't i don't see

600
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,080
i don't i don't i'm no longer think that a pcp headquarters would like really change all that

601
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,400
much it would just really yeah um i don't know i think it would change a lot and i think everything

602
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,720
would change a lot and be really nice i'm very gung-ho about the idea i mean no no matter where

603
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:20,800
the pcp hq is i will go despite my my yearnings for a specific location yeah i'm very dedicated to

604
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:30,640
the idea um i i don't think it's gonna change i mean i would like it a lot because i would i would

605
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:38,160
have very happily be in things with people but it's not i'm i'm not gonna be like radically

606
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:45,040
changing what i'm doing on my own because they're because i'm near y'all i i don't think it's about

607
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,280
like i don't know like there's there's like it like i think everyone trying to like think of

608
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,920
like specific things that we can do that like are in live action that that benefit live action

609
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,600
specifically it's kind of missing the point of the entire thing because like like like everything

610
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:07,920
we do rather as copulars it's perfect example everything we we can do we like we can do it online

611
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,040
but it would be so much easier and like there's no there'll be no technical difficulties and

612
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,320
we'll just be funner and better if we were just in person like everything we do more or less

613
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,600
would just be better if it was in person so it'd be like a spruce like you know we'd spruce up our

614
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:27,760
fucking lives and and and all that sort of jazz i feel pretty spruce yeah i would feel pretty

615
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:34,400
fucking spruce and i don't know it's important i i know like i have offline friends here and i do

616
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:41,120
and i love them dearly but nothing can fucking top my fucking love and and my love and admiration

617
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:48,080
of my fellow fucking pcp brothers and and you know um i really want to be by you guys specifically

618
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,680
because um i feel like you guys are really cool and i like you so i don't know um it like if you

619
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,840
know even if there was no business aspect to it even if i didn't truly believe that it's just

620
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,320
going to be better for our content to be together in the same room in any way and we can always like

621
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,760
make new content we don't have to just like stick with our old stuff but like no matter what it's

622
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,920
going to be better in every way even if i didn't believe that i still just want to be by you guys

623
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,680
just because i like you and it's it's good for me emotionally to be like be near people who i like

624
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,960
yeah and i think i think it's i think it's a legitimate uh you know reason to want to you know

625
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,920
move um i think it's i think it's legitimate i mean i'm really hoping that it that it happens

626
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:34,880
but like i said i'm i'm all all this is to say that like since i don't see it as being like

627
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,800
that much of a game changer like i'm i'm not moving just for pcp headquarters so that's why

628
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:49,360
i'm like uh you know like it'd be i'm just i'm just kind of hoping i'm just hoping it works out

629
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,440
but if for me like everyone comes here but if it doesn't well that's life

630
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:03,680
yeah um um uh well you know whatever happens happens and you know pretty much i mean i don't

631
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,040
know i i i want to be near you so so you know i don't want to be near you too much you you're my

632
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:17,440
you're my bestest buddy you're my bestest buddy as well um yeah so you know whatever we go we go

633
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,960
yeah and and that's and that's i guess that's the really all to say on the matter uh on that

634
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,280
particular subject i really i don't know maybe maybe not for you specifically but i think no i

635
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,760
think for you i mean like like being in live action will affect like like we don't have to like

636
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,960
always record what we're doing but just like being in the same room together is going to

637
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,000
breed so many new opportunities just for like everything just just for everything that the

638
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,360
opportunities are fucking limitless for what you can do when we are together and we are like

639
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,240
available actors like i don't know none of our current content like your choirs that

640
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,920
would be in live action but it will just enhance it in in ways that we just cannot even like tell

641
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,640
yet like like like like like if i were to be able to speak to you in the same room that'd be such

642
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,120
a different energy i mean we would and like we would be less tired and groggy because it's like

643
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:10,320
it's it's fucking like 10 in the morning and you know it would be a far different experience we

644
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,840
could just do um you know whenever and it would be a completely different atmosphere and it would

645
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,400
make a a much better project product all of the let's plays and fucking radcon were like so incredible

646
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,320
and the ever so much better than than they could have ever been if it was just us talking over the

647
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:31,360
internet being being together in the same room just like breeds such like like just great content

648
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,280
and you know i'm like fucking like like you know me and you are gonna be doing like comics and

649
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,200
stuff so that's not really thing you can like do together but that doesn't mean like you know

650
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,160
like being around people and like and like being you know close to one another in person will not

651
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,920
affect it in some way because you know the experience you have or you're gonna like write

652
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,480
into your comic and it's kind of like you know um fucking you know change change it's gonna change

653
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,040
your fucking life to like like i don't know i fully perceive like my life is gonna be completely

654
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,840
different once i fucking move to the pcbhq not like in like a fucking like you know everything's

655
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,480
gonna be different way but like in like you know i'm gonna be around like like you're i'm gonna be

656
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,120
around people who i legit legitimately love and i'm gonna cherish every fucking second that i'm

657
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,120
with you guys so like i don't know i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be a difference gonna be a

658
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,560
different different sort of uh experience it's really gonna change uh malik on life i believe

659
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:29,040
truly yeah i'm fucking hopeful i'm fucking hopeful that it that it happens and i mean i

660
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,880
think it would be good i mean i i'd like it but i think everyone would like it and we'd all be a

661
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:41,120
lot less miserable um yeah the the or sorry the real friend initiative currently though is pretty

662
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:46,800
awful it's pretty awful and no i feel like you know is it shitty of me to be like nobody's doing it

663
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:55,360
right um i don't know i mean like like with my friends i want like i want to talk about real

664
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:01,120
shit i want to talk about like real things and well like i don't know i do want to chill and hang

665
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,840
like move like like moving specifically i i am more than comfortable with because i don't know

666
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,000
it's it's a big thing that's on my future that i that i want to like but and i want to be serious

667
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,680
and you know um fucking normal and not fucking freakish like i am online yeah um i want i want

668
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,800
to not be a freak for just a few moments of my life yeah well that's a total order but

669
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:33,120
yeah um um yeah so in theory i understand yeah um i i like that aspect but you know um i i don't

670
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:38,160
particularly and like i don't know i like talking about the future of pcp and stuff like that but

671
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,640
i don't know i i i do as well just want to you know chill and hang when i'm there um i i i don't

672
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,920
want to like preclude any conversation topics because i don't know um it's important and i don't

673
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,360
either the ratty fuckers cop killers like it almost immediately you know it was when nate

674
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:00,000
showed up that it became like let's talk about let's talk about yeah let's talk about the future

675
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,680
of the pcp let's talk about pcp headquarters and that's fine but it's not what it's for and it made

676
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,160
me mad um yeah i believe it's not what it's for but i don't know like like i don't know it's it's

677
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:20,320
on all of our minds it's it's it's it's what i'm thinking about a lot yeah i guess i guess

678
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:30,320
whatever bro um i i do i do agree though i i i i want to you know i don't know maybe you and

679
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:37,120
me should just do stuff um yeah maybe that should be what happens i don't know yeah i guess i don't

680
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,240
like how everyone else does does things yeah i should just take it upon myself

681
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,520
um i don't know i mean i i i like i like the real friend industry but it's it's

682
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,320
it's just such a pain to talk to my friends it's just such a fucking hassle in order to do it

683
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:00,240
it's like like there has to be a scheduled time which which is what we wanted like in our video

684
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,360
but i don't know it's like it's like harpy's i don't know i'm i'm i'm doing stuff i i want and

685
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,800
not like business stuff like i don't know i am just existing and so it's hard to like you know

686
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,040
like set aside time and do it davoo has been the one who's constantly been doing it and i'm very

687
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:20,480
thankful of that and i want i want to do a friend initiative yeah every single time he's been there

688
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:27,040
i think at least close to that yeah and i appreciate i appreciate that but davoo's also the one who

689
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,920
immediately wants to talk about well no no that's not actually not true he he talked he he has a lot

690
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,320
to say about the business side of things but he also has like talks about his personal life and

691
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,280
things so i i appreciate that yeah davoo's good i i would like to talk more about the personal

692
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,680
life stuff on yeah i mean i don't know it like like is where we live not personal stuff i i guess

693
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:54,080
it is i guess it is but fuck i just i just hate you know what i just hate the fact i just hate

694
00:59:54,080 --> 01:00:00,240
the fact that everyone's youtubers i don't like youtubers or respect them and uh i think it sucks

695
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,760
and when youtube stuff comes up i just want to tune out uh so yeah that's how i feel about that

696
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:14,160
um understandable yeah understandable um um well i'm gonna try and be in more since for a while

697
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,120
there i kind of skipped not not because i didn't want to be in just because i was doing uh stuff

698
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:26,640
this remember was a very busy month for me uh fucking well oh god i need to drink some more of my

699
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:32,160
for some of my starbucks double shot energy mexican mocha flavored i'm almost through my uh fruit

700
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:39,280
punch pure zero rock star here uh it's a treat it's a treat and a treasure uh and my favorite

701
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:47,360
thing i found monchi have you ever heard of aldi no well it's just it's like german supermarket

702
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,440
and it's like a it's like a piece of shit and it's run like garbage but it's really cheap so that's

703
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,800
the trade-off that's what that's that's aldi um but i found these off-brand knockoff monsters

704
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,880
that are actually pretty good they're like they're 99 cents for a full can of something

705
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,960
that tastes almost like a monster yeah and i love it it's called it's called gridlock

706
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,760
it's it's it's it's called it's called the future and yeah yeah it's called it's my future that's for

707
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,920
sure yeah um excellent do you think there's anything more to say about us being uh not freaks

708
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,280
do you think there's anything do you think you think we're doomed to be freaks been you think

709
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:41,040
we're always gonna be like this um i think i mean you and i you and i want more i don't know how

710
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:50,640
everyone else feels but like surely oh wait oh here we go all four decided

711
01:01:50,800 --> 01:02:11,040
in the 2004 election uh i was saying i mean it takes two to tango so if nobody else wants to be

712
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,280
real friends if nobody else wants to fucking have anything

713
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:23,920
going on other than like oh let's fucking let's fucking get our fucking youtube let's get our

714
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,080
push our youtube and get our fucking sub counts up um then fuck them uh it's like it's like it's not

715
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:35,040
just on us you know like it's on everyone i yeah i think we're supposed to do here's just take

716
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,120
it you're supposed to like write all this down and like write the map of the area then come back

717
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,400
because like there's gonna be no light switch when you come down from below who's like it wants

718
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,920
you to memorize what's going on here so like yeah you're gonna have already got it i've already

719
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,480
got everything oh well then fucking skedaddle yeah i don't there was no point there was there was no

720
01:02:52,480 --> 01:03:01,920
point okay cool okay cool yeah super good super good uh yeah like i don't know i mean i would sure

721
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,640
like i feel like i feel like i'm i'm far more forgiving of the youtube aspect because i don't

722
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:13,680
know like i like that's part of their lives and while i hate it it's all been i'm just i'm just

723
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,680
gonna fucking say it it's been it's been this no this has been a problem for me forever it has

724
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,920
always been that like the piece ever since the early days of the pcp whenever the youtube stuff

725
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,120
comes up i just i zone out and i stop paying attention and i don't care and i just i hate it

726
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:38,880
i i hate that whole side of it i want it to stop i wish youtube would never been invented um

727
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:48,000
it's boring and it's like i don't know man am i crazy i just it always feels the same every

728
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,400
time it comes up it feels like the same conversation it it more that part i completely agree with

729
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,760
it's it's a lot of the same sort of stuff but i don't know it we just all want oh my god i guess

730
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,920
i just blew up all right awesome yeah cool like like like it is it is the same shit over and over

731
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,120
again but like i think it's like we all want to like make sure like of what we're doing because i

732
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,800
don't know there's a lot of there's a lot of i don't know is no there's a lot of um you should get

733
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,600
you should get you should get out you should get out of there okay there we go okay i just need to

734
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:26,240
figure out what i need to blow up um excellent yeah there's a lot of like you know i'm sure and

735
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:33,280

01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:34,160
it's like a real thing that like is going on oh well what's what's this the fairy queen sent

745
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,400
that big green thing down here to help with sanitation each of the head serves a multi-tool

746
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:51,040
pipe cleaner uh all right excellent gross this game is incredible by the way yeah oh my god oh goodness

747
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:04,720
oh okay well um yeah um um i i just think i just think that uh like like like like once

748
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:10,240
okay we should decide here's here's what i think i think we should decide where we want to go

749
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:18,080
based on like where we like want to live and like um because like i i know i know that no matter

750
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,720
where we go it's going like like the business side will work out because it's working out currently

751
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,360
and we aren't in the same place you know like we we are all in different locations so no matter

752
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,000
where we all are it's going to be instantly better and like i don't know they're like they're like

753
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,840
best possible solutions but i don't know i i want to i want to be happy where i live sure and i don't

754
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:45,520
know i mean every place is pretty much the same that's the secret that's the secret about that

755
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,440
sure but there's a little court there's i don't know there's a little quirks

756
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:56,640
boston was way different than san diego i i guess slightly i don't know it's different

757
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,560
dude that might just be a west coast east coast thing though okay i've almost i've almost defeated

758
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:09,920
this uh this piece of shit here this fucking asshole he is oh no he shot my bomb this is

759
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,600
this is fucking scary this is so good this is the best game i've ever played oh i got shot but

760
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:24,480
it doesn't matter he's dead he's dead excellent i guess three heads really aren't better well they are

761
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,840
because it took me three bombs to kill it yeah instead of one so it's definitely better um

762
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:37,600
you really got ahead of that challenge though yep heads up you're the bomb okay yeah okay

763
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,760
yeah yeah oh bad puns oh good good what

764
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:51,440
fuck yeah uh what were we talking about i'm talking about how we hate our friends

765
01:07:51,440 --> 01:08:01,440
yeah i hate them they're the worst um i don't know wherever the pc phq may be um no no no not

766
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,360
not even that no no matter where i decide to spend the rest of my life i hope it's somewhere near you

767
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:16,080
been um well i feel the same way i hope i mean i'm i'm not i'm not moving i'm not moving because i

768
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:24,320
have a real good stable setup here but okay it's my hope that uh it works i mean i was i'm real

769
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:30,400
relieved that it looks like digi wants to move here nate i think will go wherever digi goes um

770
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:37,680
and so on and so forth so if uh that's this is what i always hope that everyone would just

771
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:44,960
end up moving here and it didn't uh so it's that's still my hope for the future yeah um you know um

772
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:52,800
um i i i i i hope so too again no matter no matter where it is i'll go yeah i'm i'm i'm

773

post it which we won't and we will post no matter what occurs um yeah so like okay and literally

887
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:46,160
has this the setup is like usually me and bin record locally with um you know audacity but now

888
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:50,720
we're recording uh like bin's getting my audio through obs so even if he tries to bitch out and

889
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,960
like delete his own audio we still have his audio on record and there's nothing he can possibly do to

890
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:01,600
fucking clear his name or you know state his case um we are we are villains we are we are villains and

934
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:04,960
ago he was here you know what i bet he fucking chickened out just like he did just like with um

935
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,560
mr meeketer or meet me toker or whatever that god did you did you see that did you see that video

936
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,920
about anthony i watched a little bit of it but you know what i remembered what like when when when

937
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,080
he made a video on us he didn't watch our video he just watched someone like he would just watch

938
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:24,320
mishandler upon his video and then commented completely based on that so i just figured why would

939
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,760
i even give him the grace of doing that i was gonna go completely in blind just accuse him of random

940
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:41,120
things um yeah um anthony is he he just fucking the the the short version is he mr me toker whatever

941
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:50,080
his name is he um he made a video about inflation fetishists and in that video he made a unrelated

942
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:55,280
comment about god is dead like you know as a joke like haha ooh it's so bad ooh faith in humanity

943
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:01,120
lost ooh god is dead and we killed him and anthony got but heard about just about the simple act of

944
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:08,720
saying god is dead um and he never heard that before i guess not so he called him out and was

945
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:19,200
like debate me debate me on whether god is dead and uh and mr me toker was like oh uh oh i found it

946
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:26,480
it was like okay i will and anthony got scared and was like okay well i need to bring my posse

947
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:33,360
along with me like i'll only do it if my friends can be in the call with me and mr me toker agreed

948
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:39,600
to that and was like okay fine if if that's okay you're you're yeah bring your fucking friends

949
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:45,680
and then even after that he's still anthony still chickened out waited till the last day

950
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:50,400
said he had to work but then was tweeting at the time that uh he was supposed to be having

951
01:28:50,400 --> 01:29:02,080
the debate with it with the guy long miserable if a coward well um god god the sad part is i

952
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:09,520
feel like we he could have been on if he would just did this earlier maybe we made a critical

953
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:15,360
misstep talking about our friends and how much we love them probably that's usually a mistake

954
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:24,480
um god damn this is really this is truly distressing this is this is really this this

955

1011
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:50,560
that works for like attention span but it all the pub crawls that were really good that like

1012
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,720
where they would go all deep and shit wouldn't happen anymore because of that and i'm like

yeah quite often in fact so so so each time ben's gonna say anthony i'm just gonna get like this

1019
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,880
well yeah anyway it's good to have you on i hope we don't seem too scary here we just um

1020
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,200
like like like as as i'm sure you can tell by you know our video and by us not knowing if you

1021
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,040
got kicked out of the pub crawl we're not we're not super into this uh whole community more but

1022
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:48,320
we are i don't know it was a big part of our lives so we're still pretty no no this is what

1023
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:53,040
happened originally um i i had like a couple of my friends like hey ben's talking shit about you

1024
01:36:53,040 --> 01:37:00,080
i'm like what no no that's never no then i don't believe it and they're like oh it's on this for

1025
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,800
our video and i'm like and they're like you wouldn't take that shit from us you're like you're right

1026
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:11,280
i wouldn't i don't i don't remember if we specifically i don't think it wasn't much i don't

1027
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:16,800
think we did we we like we touched on you very briefly yeah i all admitted i had a bug up my

1028
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,200
ass and they're like it was it was very kind of like off the cuff dismissive thing i don't know

1029
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,880
but maybe it was because like right afterwards i tried tweeting him like hey ben are we cool

1030
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,800
you're like yeah whatever and then like you kind of goofed on me a bit when i kept asking it up

1031
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:35,040
because you you like you kept asking and i didn't you like i didn't know what you were talking about

1032
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:40,560
and then like i was like what are you talking about and you wouldn't tell me oh i was i was

1033
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,120
assuming that i was like oh i thought we had heat or something all of a sudden and then the no we

1034
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:51,040
didn't because like i didn't even i didn't even talk about you in that video yeah so so i was so

1035
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,760
i was confused that you were asking that like there seemed to be anything to clear up so that so

1036
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:02,800
that's why i didn't that's why i was i was like oh i was talking about yeah part of my reaction

1037
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:08,160
was um i talked to uh freaking again i asked my friends and then i saw the video go down i was

1038
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:19,120
like oh see it's nothing we're cool up it's back up again he thinks you're a faggot um yeah so really

1039
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:23,040
we just want to have you on to you know catch up and you know clearly like bad bloods in the air i

1040
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,600
mean i don't think i don't think you know any of us are really i don't know you know like i don't

1041
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,440
know if we consider each other friends but you know i don't think we're enemies at all no i don't

1042
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,800
i don't have any real problems but it was just one of those things is like you know what this is

1043
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,480
going to be one of those things i'll just do it and then forget about it um yeah sure i mean i don't

1044
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:46,800
know um um like like i don't know i would understand if our video was you know an attack piece on you

1045
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:52,000
but i don't know like we we we mentioned you for maybe like 30 seconds in passing i don't

1046
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,280
mean i i truly don't even remember what we had to say and like i don't know it was we talked more

1047
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:03,040
about vita we talked more about vita we did dig into vita that is oh no that's fine here i'll

1048
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,800
yeah we can get to that now currently yeah so what what what happened with vita or something like

1049
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,120
that is that we were good friends for like the longest time and i don't even know why you stopped

1050
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:17,200
talking to me originally but he currently hates my current girlfriend he's like sending her like

1051
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:22,400
pictures and leaving notes on da and like steps on how to hang herself and shit like that oh good

1052
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:27,280
good yeah i don't i don't yeah i don't want to sit there and say well you know because people

1053
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,640
throw around online harassment like nobody's business like the shit's going out of fucking

1054
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:37,200
business but i'm like hey i i could take a hit and she's not so good at it so i'd prefer he just hit

1055
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:46,080
me that'd be better yeah sure i feel it um yeah so so um how did you originally find our our our

1056
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:51,840
our original frog fractions video i had a couple friends and fans go hey what about this and yeah

1057
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:59,280
i know i didn't have any problems with it um i'd listened to procrastinators a while ago and uh it

1058
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:03,760
wasn't like the length or anything like that i i'd like to format when you guys used to do it on

1059
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:10,880
jesse's channel but uh your first one was on what was undertale uh no our first person was nuclear

1060
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:17,520
thrown oh no no i know i'm sorry the first pcp was on undertale yeah you're right oh oh god it was

1061
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,960
wasn't it god yeah i will look again i probably you know maybe i was just in a bad mood but i was

1062
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:27,520
listening to it and i hear like nate's really busting his ass trying to get the podcast over and

1063
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:35,360
bends over there heckling him but i'm like ah this just isn't for me um you know you know i i don't

1064
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:40,880
think anyone will you know deny but nate does the work the hardest um i i think i think it's the

1065
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:48,160
casual atmosphere that makes the pcp like like what it is but you know um um did you watch uh the

1066
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,600
original video i assume not completion because i don't think anyone has a time for that other than

1067
01:40:51,600 --> 01:41:01,520
our fans um i mean even them i think are pretty like touch and go about it um uh did you uh you

1068
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:08,000
like you like saw missy antherpony's video on the subject right um i glanced at it and i was like well

1069
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,360
it's kind of all over the place i didn't hold you up on the the the keyframe thing if you would like

1070
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:18,560
me to speak on that frankly i'd be glad to yeah yeah sure go ahead okay you're probably you're

1071
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:24,320
probably not going to get this analogy are you familiar with um some he's he just had like a

1072
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:28,960
big boxing fight i'm trying to get kind of a greger do you know who that is no i don't i think i

1073
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,920
think i've heard i think i know i think i know the name greller okay so long story short he's

1074
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,480
this mixed martial artist because he's you know irish and stuff that's the the the nationality

1075
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:44,240
you push because it draws money i don't know why the the the irish are bred for that yeah but you

1076
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:49,840
know it sells well and the way i've described keyframe and i say this with all due respect

1077
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:56,320
nope nobody jumped on me i like keyframe we're cool but i i've said her her push is equivalent

1078
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,560
to conor McGregor it's not that she's bad that i could see what if ben ben was annoyed that

1079
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,680
she got a lot of um opportunities that other people didn't and i could see where people

1080
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:11,040
would be resentful and that's how i'm going to very gently do that yeah she she does have skill

1081
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:20,880
though uh i'll give you an exclusive which she she oh yeah no doubt she spoke highly about you

1082
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,200
got uh she talked spoke highly of ben's freaking she loved the picture you know uh what was it

1083
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:28,560
knights and beta armor she laughed she laughed her ass off but that's why i got away with it too

1084
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:35,840
she was dating goldie that thing yeah yeah i remember that i have it on my i have it on my

1085
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:42,800
i have it in my shame folder somewhere you did a lot of work for that money ben i appreciate it

1086
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:51,920
uh yes i'm that's i i i do my best i do my best uh in all things um anyway yeah the the keyframe

1087
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:58,240
thing uh yeah i never uh there's been there's been confusion people have said that i've called it a

1088
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:04,240
scam i haven't called it a scam like i don't think there's any like outright falsehood or anything's

1089
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:12,320
being misrepresented strictly speaking but i do think that like you know it is getting it did get

1090
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:19,680
sold a little bit it did it did get swept up in that shitty brony thing of like it literally anyone

1091
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:25,440
deserves money for any reason i should have warned you her dad just passed away oh well that's that's

1092
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:33,680
fine but this doesn't really change anything all right we're a little brutal here on the right

1093
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:41,680
okay jeez man um i mean i'm like i know my condolences my condolences yeah i'd like to quote

1094
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:51,920
that i was laughing uncomfortably there sure um okay yeah well i think yeah um um so yeah um miss

1095
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:57,120
for our first firefighters cop killers like frog factions we um like like originally we were just

1096
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:01,360
playing a game but the the really shitty website we were using like didn't allow us to progress any

1097
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:05,360
further and so we were just we just got pretty bored but we didn't want to stop recording because

1098
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:10,000
you know like it was pretty short and also we just wanted to like see if it would just work we just

1099
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,440
came back to it later which it did funnily enough i don't know how but um yeah so uh we just like

1100
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,560
sort of tabbed over when we started you know google searching what we were talking about i i think

1101
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,760
before the show there's been something about like like like like like some sort of like brony uh

1102
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:28,000
stuff i forget we just was on our mind for whatever reason and so we wanted to search and and you

1103
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:34,480
know me and ben were both heavily in that community uh me especially i was i mean well he actually made

1104
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:41,120
a show so him especially but you know yeah yeah yeah um so we wanted to you know go back and it

1105
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,920
didn't really it didn't start out as like a hit piece person i don't i don't i don't think i would

1106
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,840
even describe as a hit piece because it's not it's not like we're doing you know intense research to

1107
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,880
drag someone down like i don't like our intention with the entire video was not to like shit on

1108
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:58,640
anyone particularly well i would not to like like to like spread rumors or like fucking like smear

1109
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:05,120
campaign anyone we um we were just we were just grouchy we were grouchy people we wanted to fucking

1110
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:10,640
you know um it was it was funny and it led you know it led to some stories from our past i think

1111
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:15,360
we're good entertainment for our fans so that was the real like mindset going into it it was not

1112
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:20,880
like you know let's fucking you know let's let's obliterate these people's souls uh it was just you

1113
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,960
know um these people a lot of people not even you just you know some people like uh dr wolf

1114
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,920
and fucking or some other people like some like like like like kp and lightning bliss or we had

1115
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,160
like real like history and stuff and then fucking josh scorcher especially we had like history with

1116
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:42,160
these people that we wanted to have you know air now oh no because like you're free there was

1117
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:48,800
dr wolf at any moment in time yeah yeah like we kind of we kind of conspicuously hadn't talked

1118
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,680
about the whole pony thing like since since back in the day uh so i mean i felt like it was time

1119
01:45:55,680 --> 01:46:02,240
that we that we uh that we air out that dirty laundry and what better way than our not on our

1120
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:08,240
fucking weird side show that no one watches yeah yeah well i actually think that thanks to that

1121
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:12,240
video it's getting pretty good views now so i guess you know thank god i i guess trauma does

1122
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:19,600
really does sell well oh it does oh it's definitely sure to be sure um i think after i think after

1123
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:26,080
this this whole saga we're gonna go back to our you know uh staying to ourselves because you know

1124
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:33,440
the uh the well it does get views the response is usually not i mean it's been it's been a lot of

1125
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:40,560
bullshit uh and other such i mean a lot of a lot of a lot of what you might call drama has erupted

1126
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,680
from it which is like that's fine that's fine and everything you know but like i got you i was

1127
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:52,240
gonna say doughnut took it kind of bad on the chin at the time i feel a little bad about i think i

1128
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:57,040
think i went a little hard and i'm like the things that i complained about doughnut are are things that

1129
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:02,080
i think are true and that annoyed me but i feel a little bad that i went so far as like to just

1130
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:07,200
overall say you know he sucks he's an idiot you know wow i didn't even know about all like i said

1131
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,560
i focused on myself uh look there's there's there's critiques i'd have on the burning

1132
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,960
doughnut i don't want to go into it right now unless you really press me for it i was i was i was a

1133
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:22,160
little too hard on yeah oh that if i really was like trying to grot then i would have been like

1134
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:27,360
ah maybe i did maybe i made this how dare you the burning doughnut fuck the world of you didn't

1135
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:33,360
have all the money in the world we still threw you a couple of bucks here and there wait i don't

1136
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:39,600
remember that i thought he did the mayor i don't know my collection but that's never here nor there

1137
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:46,960
i guess um yeah um we you're gonna touch on up on that later but uh for uh you know with with you

1138
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:52,160
we um like like once we had made the first five practice video we didn't i i thought it was a

1139
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:57,600
possibility that people might you know um make a whole big deal about but that was not really my

1140
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:03,760
intention i didn't really expect for the amount of response because um the like like a couple days

1141
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:09,440
afterward we got this long like 20 minute video from misanthropony and i think like maybe even on

1142
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:14,560
the same day or like maybe or i think i found them both on the same day um there there was a video

1143
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:19,600
by you that was about like i think us and then lily p i believe i have a series where i touch on

1144
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:24,640
fucking yeah yeah you know whatever the fuck i feel like rambling on about yeah yeah and i was

1145
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:29,280
like okay i think your part was like what two to four minutes i think yeah i think i think it was like

1146
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,680
i think it was like four minutes like four they did put it at the start i'll be honest yeah yeah

1147
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:40,320
did want it to be seen yeah yeah um true and yeah uh i i i didn't think of my wildest dreams i would

1148
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:44,880
become the star of youtube drama but but i guess if i'm gonna be in drama it might as well be brony

1149
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:50,160
drama because that's the most fucking interesting one of course of course it's the only interesting

1150
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:56,400
one yeah it's my personal favorite highly recommended and and so me and ben we're talking about it and

1151
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:01,920
and and and we and we were really surprised and you know we like like like on some level we were

1152
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:07,520
fucking ecstatic that that that was that like that like the like like especially with misanthropony we

1153
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:14,080
were pretty much blown away about uh the sheer level of incompetence on display that's true hey

1154
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:19,120
look look he contacted me they said i'm doing my own thing you go do your own thing go have fun

1155
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:24,800
yeah that's you and you and i'm be over here um you know uh you know ever since this last

1156
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,840
fifth i think we have some sort of closure on that subject but yeah we were just i at least had never

1157
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:34,240
been in you know in the spotlight like that before so it was a really interesting experience uh so

1158
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:40,320
yeah so so we made um a second video uh what the the way it went is we made five fractions one

1159
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,400
a video on that just one video and then uh right now we're recording our third episode

1160
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:47,280
rough raw fractions two and on the first one we didn't talk about the pruning drama but the

1161
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:52,080
second one we did and that was the um that was the one that went up on t-baff uh benzel channel

1162
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,600
and that was the one that was like like like five hours long because we had a lot to say on the

1163
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:01,760
subject uh so what we did basically was we just watched through um santhropony's video and you

1164
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:06,480
know um picked it apart more or less and then we and then we watched uh your video and we didn't

1165
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:12,720
really know uh we didn't really know your angle at the time uh so yeah um have you seen have you

1166
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:17,920
seen our our response i didn't see the response i basically like i said when my friends came with

1167
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,800
me the second time i was like look i feel stupid for the fucking first reply it's from what people

1168
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,560
said it's at the end of a four hour video and i was like well if it's at the end of a four hour

1169
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:32,080
video that means don't look that means like like i should have took that as a hint that's how i

1170
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:36,400
be read it the first time like if you put it at the end of three hours it must have not been that

1171
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:40,560
big of a thing i read into it too much like an idiot and if i keep fucking digging through three

1172
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:46,160
to four hours every time i'm gonna look fucking retarded so i'm like yeah let let let ben be ben

1173
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:53,760
fuck it yeah indeed um yeah um yeah maybe i was slow on bullshit that week i'm gonna just shock it

1174
01:50:53,840 --> 01:51:00,880
up to that i yeah i mean um um you know like like we we we we definitely wanted everyone we touched

1175
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:06,400
on we we touched on you missy on the point and then some of the comments uh there's just one reply

1176
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,160
by vita that i really wanted to bring up uh that was a really funny exchange that happened on missy

1177
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,440
on the ponies video i'm gonna read that right now since i don't want to forget it because it's one

1178
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:19,200
of my favorite uh comment chains of all time it's something along the lines of uh vita saying that uh

1179
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:22,880
he doesn't want to like like like like he heard that i was saying something bad about it on the

1180
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,360
ponies video and he was like munchy i don't watch that channel i have standards ha ha

1181
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:32,320
whoo whoo whoo whoo uh like he laughs covering his fucking mouth like a fucking rich person

1182
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,440
and then and then and then someone uh comments vita you're using munchies artwork as your avatar

1183
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:45,040
right now which i think the way i think is incredible can i get that for a sound bite really

1184
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:51,360
quick i want to get that repeat that one more time please um vita you're using munchies artwork

1185
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:58,080
as your avatar right now yes right now talking about standards as as we speak

1186
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:05,680
yeah and then he responds with some like some nonsense like waffling about like oh no well

1187
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:11,280
this is fine but you but but everything else is bad or something his response was this is this is

1188
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:17,040
iconic this is iconic yeah yeah yeah munchie sucks but this particular piece of his work is is just

1189
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:21,760
too iconic to like it's just it's just it's just too great to let slip through my fucking stubby

1190
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,080
fingers yeah yeah oh unfortunately i can't even find that comment because missy had probably

1191
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:31,840
took down his original video which is uh i remember it yeah i remember oh god that that drives me

1192
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:35,040
insane i'm sure i'm sure you can like internet archive it i think i might have a save as well

1193
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:40,480
but but you know um it trust me it was incredible oh no fucking every time miss anthra pony takes

1194
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:46,160
down one of his drama videos like just scores and scores of untouched gold is lost to the yeah

1195
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:52,720
yeah it's really upsetting what a shame what a shame um so yeah um like like there was a there's

1196
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:58,640
a lot of stuff we talked about um like we really dug into miss anthra pony but both yours we didn't

1197
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:03,840
really like know what was going on and so we like we didn't really know what your like angle was

1198
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:08,560
and i think we like know now um i think i think we like know you know it like it was a big production

1199
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:13,040
or no i didn't i didn't even want to hit ben that's why content i reached out to mage i was like

1200
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:17,600
is ben angry at me i think she's like oh just go ask her just i don't understand why you thought i

1201
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:22,960
was angry at you based on that first video because like we seriously didn't say anything about you

1202
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:31,440
okay i'm sorry yeah it's fine i'm a little mental what do you want it's fine i think we are um but

1203
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:37,200
yeah we were just really like like for me i was concerned because yeah because like we didn't say

1204
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:41,120
like anything about you i think we like mentioned your name i think i think the worst we said about

1205
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:44,400
you is that you were friends with the video which which is the worst thing you could accuse someone

1206
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:51,920
with you know um yeah um but like yeah and and and and then we get to your video and like like

1207
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,400
miss anthra pony's video was like you know talking about how like the video we made was like a bad

1208
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:01,200
video which while we disagree with that it was still like you know about something but like we

1209
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:06,800
were confused by your video on like multiple levels and we didn't really like like like we were we

1210
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,440
were we were a little hurt we were a little we were a little hurt i think yeah you said some serious

1211
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:16,720
you said some real some real shit in that video and we were we were confused and we're not asking you

1212
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:21,840
apologize we just you know we just want to make sure that like our fans know we don't hate each other

1213
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,640
okay i'll put it to this way everybody listening if you're gonna do something wrong do it right

1214
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:31,760
yeah if you're gonna if you're gonna hurt somebody's feelings don't half-ass it well that makes sense

1215
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:38,000
yeah that makes sense uh but there's a large section of our of our you know like there's a

1216
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,240
large tradition in the right focus cop killers of like going in and like like looking at our

1217
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:46,720
responses and like see and like in like seeing the way people are reacting to us and going to

1218
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:52,320
watch together and like you know um editing that uh uh like like like in in in the episode that went

1219
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:58,320

1221
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:08,160
that right now to like to like see you know like to help like clear things up because because again

1222
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:13,520
we don't want there to be any bad blood and you know we were a little harsh too but i but i think

1223
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:17,760
i think you know we've come to an agreement here that you know there's no bad blood yeah sure no

1224
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,880
problem all right yeah sure here uh let me get that right here shall we shall we uh begin shall we

1225
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:28,720
take a take a look oh i just want to i i feel annoying for having to throw the same person

1226
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:33,920
under the bus but i'm i'm pretty sure if you see the name foxwell or night eye die in your comment

1227
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:38,240
section this person is does not speak for me that you're not my friend they're not my fan

1228
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:46,960
foxwell or night eye die yeah okay no yeah he yeah he's he's been distanced from a lot of people

1229
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:52,480
when you say i'm thinking this was mishandler upon these people what what what what exactly

1230
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:57,840
does he do yeah what's it what's his name what's he all about when when he gets himself into

1231
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:02,080
trouble he'll be like mentioned oh i'm associated with us and thus and like no no he's not with us

1232
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:06,960
weird so he's just like a weird commenter i guess um

1233
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:16,240
he he or is he more sure i'll put a deal like this do you know who fallen wishes um i know a

1234
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:20,000
little bit i i i i i i i i i i have heard the name i believe it's someone's girlfriend

1235
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:27,200
everybody's somebody's girlfriend muncher true yeah well a long time ago i i dated her a long

1236
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:33,920
time ago okay and he he got brought along into a lot of groups and after she left for reasons uh i have

1237
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:41,200
that whatever another time uh okay he would screw up just enough not to be tossed until eventually

1238
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:47,520
he was and it's a long headache that's uninteresting so so just like he's just

1239
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:51,160
like a weird kind of ski v guy that used to be friends with you and now is he

1240
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:55,600

1262
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:54,200
interested I'm gonna be interested to hear yeah this is as new to this is

1263
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,680
like that oh here here we go I skipped too far

1264
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:10,400
it's too fucking long been the scrubbers and back here and I know I know I'm

1265

1270
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:40,120
fucking nobody you know Vita made friends with him and ditched him it was funny oh yeah we talked

1271
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:44,680
about him because he was one of the three people that made actual videos other than the comments

1272
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:50,840

02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:19,560
impression um this is you know Ben St from back in the day he is laughing his ass off and you

1288
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,840
yeah yeah I'm laughing all the way I'm laughing all the way I'm laughing all the way to the bank

1289
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:31,640
to take out a big fat deposit by an oculus rift look look look what he did to pork doughnut

1290
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:36,120
look what he said I do I do feel bad there's only a couple things that I actually would

1291
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:40,920
walk back from a video and the first is I was too hard on doughnut and there was like one other

1292
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:45,960
bronig I think his name was wooden toaster who I think was like I was a little like mean to him

1293
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:51,480
when he didn't really deserve it but uh yeah like the majority of it we're not going to take a bag

1294
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:57,400
yeah yeah yeah so yeah that's gonna set the tune for this it's really just funny in retrospect

1295
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:01,320
I don't know like I just don't know what's happening there's a lot of times where I saw

1296
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:05,480
where Ben would fuck up and he'd like you know like wave his hands off and everybody else because

1297
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:10,760
they're bronies we just let it slide and I was like I'm I'm I'm not going to give you a walk today

1298
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:19,080
yeah yeah fair enough you're gonna have a bad day yeah yeah oh yeah you know what the point of

1299
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:24,360
that video was like like reading between reading between the lines you can understand what it is

1300
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:30,120
that misanthropony feels about the video and like what it is that's bothering him that video was a

1301
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:34,600
response to right for his cup of his fog fractions that was describing what happened in the video

1302
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,320
that made him upset sure none of his points make sense but you can understand what the video is

1303
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:43,160
yeah I do not understand what this for no good reason video is

1304
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:52,440
just to cause harm no no good reason things he says like point to any like central idea

1305
02:02:52,440 --> 02:03:01,080
or like reason which I guess that's his name yeah yeah good um like this one is like basically

1306
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:06,920
the like I'd like to state for the record I do have a point sometimes I just yeah sometimes

1307
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,640
but there was I thought there was a fight going on and I mean I mean but but like the subs I mean

1308
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:17,960
okay I guess we'll we'll get into it in a minute but like if I remember from what I remember the

1309
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:24,120
substance of what you say in this video is basically just a bunch of insults that don't

1310
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:31,320
really have any relation to the video in question um but that's but I wish I wish we

1311
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:38,280
would stop fucking rambling this fucking video yeah this entire not the whole video this does go

1312
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:44,120
on for a while but the part that is is like just calling us shit and like not even trying to back

1313
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:53,400
that up yeah go ahead and start it are we first or we later oh no I don't I love the song oh it's

1314
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:59,720
from super jail yeah this is a last minute pre-word before I I had this video done by the way

1315
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:04,680
before yeah I think I'd skip with me sorry sorry I don't want to I skip the important

1316
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:10,280
god so bad I think it only goes I think the first like eight minutes or so are about us

1317
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:13,800
it's so hard to know like really first speaking if they're in the video or if they're in the

1318
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:22,440
now yeah oh I should say that before this video came out fngr tweeted at me and he was just like

1319
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:28,920
I don't remember what he said but he was asking me like are we cool and I was like what what do you

1320
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:34,040
mean like what wouldn't we be cool about I think I don't even know if I mentioned him in the frog

1321
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:40,760
fractions video but I think I did maybe maybe you did but he was asked all right no no I do remember

1322
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:46,600
that oh no Ben you have to check this out you have to look at this thing and Ben's like

1323
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:53,640
wait to stir the pot over there check what up like he was like trying to show my channel and I know

1324
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:59,720
Ben was being uninterested oh I mean I've seen your channel before okay I mean I was I was on

1325
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:05,640
your channel yeah no I appreciate it I got an animation from your brother asking me like are we cool

1326
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:10,120

1327
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:14,360
cool are we cool I'm just checking and finally I was like what are you fucking talking about

1328
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:19,560
and I forget how I phrase it but I got mad I was like what I said like what are you talking about

1329
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:25,720
you cagey fuck yeah he was like yeah cagey fuck and like and then a couple days later this video

1330
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:30,040
comes out oh okay and let me just read the text on screen uh yeah boy I can't wait to get to this

1331
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:35,960
puke uh this puke class this is what a fail abortion looks like that I wasn't capitalized

1332
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:41,640
much to such a garbage human being if he was the crap and the Davoo's diaper uh the dude who's

1333
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:48,680
girlfriend's I ever read I I'm retarded I can't I can't read pretty good so far I'm enjoying this

1334
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:55,560
content pretty yeah yeah pretty good content so far really in the lulls here bro really in the lulls

1335
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:00,760
here I'm gonna laugh at this this is the setting of the tone for what to expect yeah yeah this is

1336
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:06,760
this amount of intelligence we're dealing with here we'll get there Ben I need you to focus reach

1337
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:12,360
down deep present like there's a big bag of pain chips waiting look at how he spells oh yeah no

1338
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:17,320
my oh all right I'd like to answer this right now but there's a reason why I do youtube videos

1339
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:22,600
is because I can't write where the shit if you have no what do you what do you pretend like

1340
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:28,360
there's a big bag of pain chips paint chips paint chips do I eat do I eat paint chips

1341
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,400
oh is that the joke like I'm like I'm retarded because I eat paint because I eat lip paint or

1342
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:41,400
something sure sure sure gotcha I'm making so far yeah yeah there we go there we go there we go

1343
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:47,320
yeah yeah look just look at how he spells theirs like I don't understand the grammar nazi he's trying

1344
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:53,880
to make just the spelling is legendary grammar nazi as well as regular nazi situation but that looks

1345
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:59,720
like a big one oh corpulent brony I remember him before I get to being needlessly bitchy he used

1346
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:05,080
to patron me before I stopped doing pony stuff and then he didn't care anymore oh well I'll talk about

1347
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:11,080
the classic or anything yeah every every week like whenever you I think he would like cancel his

1348
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:17,880
patrons like so he could show that he was on there but not give you the money oh luckily

1349
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:24,360
luckily patreon doesn't let you do that anymore yeah really yeah what a real stand up fucking guy

1350
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:28,520
he did he did actually I think he did actually give me a couple months worth so like yeah but

1351
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:33,400
there were a lot of them just let you know free heads up okay great okay great cool cool I've glanced

1352
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,520
at and skimmed this anthroponist video on this topic and lifted up for attention so he can get his

1353
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:44,760
sweet 20 minutes I could work really hard to pander why I'm right Ben's wrong I'm just gonna be salty

1354
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:50,440
right yeah wrong about what we called chelise's bluff last night that being Tuesday to have a talk

1356
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:02,680
I don't know I don't know what horse snooze is exactly okay you don't have to go super in

1357
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:07,480
death here since I'm a student a whole a whole nother thing yeah no it's like the huffington

1362
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:43,640
job all right I guess we'll just let this part play yeah go ahead chelise in true horse news

1363
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:48,520
fashion dick tucked despite having a Skype account he said that he didn't have the means to log on

1364
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:53,480
to it anymore journalism folks like even if he forgot the password it would take him what 60

1365
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:59,800
seconds I guess this is some guy like chickening out talking I think oh yeah she was talking about

1366
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:06,840
fucking he he had to talk to yeah yeah okay oh here we go here we go goldfish I nasty youtube thing

1367
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:13,640
dear ben saint I know you all right I gotta pause here and be like uh he looks like a 20 year old

1368
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:19,640
silver quill like I'm sick I'm well over 20 years old so I mean thanks I guess

1369
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:27,640
I don't know if I have to really explain that I don't know I guess choosing the hairline yeah

1370
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:34,360
sure I just I just have to mention I can see it yeah I can see it kind of looks like a 20 year

1371
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:40,840
old I'm actually older than that okay here we go I said yeah gotta revisit and revisit

1372
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:48,120
where he had tried to cross over backwards to impress his fellow pcp member

1373
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:56,920
why were you why were you under the impression that I was that like that this was an attempt to

1374
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:04,600
impress much like this is like this is like I'm forcing Ben to fucking up dance for me and

1375
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:12,120
fucking appease me it made it made the most humorous sense of my head at the time I was like

1376
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:18,440
I guess it's a funny idea if I'm gonna do this retarded thing this is the narrative I'm going

1377
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:25,000
with in my head sure sure yeah um I would get really confused by this later I'm like I didn't

1378
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I didn't tell him to do this it's real it's real funny you literally were like oh no no don't

1379
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:36,280
Ben check this out like you literally were doing that in the video like like like for your channel

1380
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:41,720
maybe but like the entire like like the entire like like the entire video was not me trying to

1381
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:47,640
fucking like get like like like like fucking lasso and fucking wrangle Ben this is looking at the

1382
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:52,120
shit one of the things that is the strangest to me about the whole reception of this video is the

1383
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,520
way that like the dynamic between munchie and me is perceived because like the reality is that we're

1384
02:10:56,520 --> 02:11:02,360
both in here just of our own accord as like purely as equals just just talking about this stuff

1385
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:09,560
just as we see fit but like I mean yeah the fngr you you say this thing about I'm trying to impress

1386
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:14,600
munchie and then misanthropony has this other entire interpretation he doesn't even address munchie

1387
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:19,320
no he makes this out like this is all a scheme by me and you're like my you're like my crony in

1388
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:26,200
carrying out my will uh and I don't fucking get it he says at one point later later in like the

1389
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:30,680
first video that like like like fuck you munchie not for like being in this field like like like

1390
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:37,640
like he says like allowing Ben to do this like as though it was just as though it was just me

1391
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:44,360
yeah as though you aren't equally participating yeah oh man he's mentioned me other than like

1392
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:50,360
shit on my on a video series of mine which is fine and all well and good but just extremely

1393
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:56,520
confusing in multiple ways okay from the outside looking in now I again I'm not like super clued

1394
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:01,000
into the fucking passenger podcast I'm assuming that people on the outside just looking at going

1395
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,080
okay here's the pecking order here's like did you at the top and I don't know where it goes from

1396
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:11,400
down there because I mean well yeah I mean I guess I guess certain ignorant people certain certain

1397
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:17,800
fucking certain fucking jokes of of humanity might might think that I I I get where you're

1398
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:22,840
coming from there are definitely core members but I think me and Ben are among the core members

1399
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:30,600
yeah no especially Ben and like yeah and rowdy fuckers rowdy fuckers is our show it is me it is a

1400
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:37,480
the me and munchie project yeah since we're talking about misconceptions let's bring up mother's

1401
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:43,640
basement was he just like I'm assuming that mother's basement treated freaking uh procrastinators how

1402
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:48,920
you guys treated the burning fandom that he's like oh I kind of have a little time for these guys

1403
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:53,880
just a little bit I'll make it he didn't really he didn't really do anything yeah yeah like he was

1404
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:59,080
just kind of there and he would pop in and he would pop in and like announce when like he was

1405
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:06,040
doing a thing but like he just wasn't like really part of it he wasn't really contributing he just

1406
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:11,240
wasn't contributing and it wasn't like we kick like we didn't kick him out per se I mean I guess we

1407
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:15,880
did but it wasn't like a you know fuck this guy it was just like it was just like we don't there's

1408
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:20,760
no reason for this guy to be here so we're just we're just gonna and he didn't take it he didn't

1409
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:24,600
take it badly at all he wouldn't be super proud of it and we're still like most of us are still

1410
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:32,280
friends with them so yeah but Ben you're a fucking you're a recluse you're a recluse and brutal

1411
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:37,480
yeah no I I talked to Jeff a lifetime ago he's super cool well he was a lot more available before

1412
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:46,600
you got like I I guess it's okay I had the opportunity to meet him and max but unfortunately

1413
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:50,680
I was at like the trigger panel so I didn't get to it I'm super upset about it Nate did though so

1414
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:55,800
I'm feel I he was he was there with me uh that's a relate though uh should we continue yeah absolutely

1415
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:59,400
right oh here like knuckle dragon of the group

1416
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:10,520
okay first yeah what the fuck are you talking about I don't I mean there's so there's just so

1417
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:16,440
like everything he says is nonsense if he was trying to make Pete like he didn't try to make peace

1418
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:21,400
he asked me if there was anything wrong and I said I didn't know what would be wrong like I don't

1419
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:26,040
know what and then he kept pressing me until I got annoyed and basically told him to go away

1420
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:34,520
yeah and then he left and yeah that's how I remember it like okay first of all it's obviously he calls

1421
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:39,960
it a hidden video yeah yeah that that he didn't even watch misanthroponies for 20 minute response

1422
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:45,000
to it yeah he just skimmed he just okay so right off the bat he just doesn't know he just does not

1423
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:50,760
understand it yeah so he so so I can't wait for our video to get copyrighted I was very up front

1424
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:57,080
yeah no I was very up front when I was doing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like we shouldn't

1425
02:14:57,080 --> 02:15:02,200
even be doing this because he obviously just does not understand anything I mean I said it about

1426
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:07,000
misanthroponi I said about fngr I really believe it in both cases like I really think they're retarded

1427
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:13,560
and they just don't act or speak or behave or like convey thoughts in the way that like oh we're so

1428
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:18,760
being does yeah and like we wouldn't I like if it was just like I don't really understand what's

1429
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:24,280
going on or they were being mean to key for like no no I heard that they they know you're saying that

1430
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:32,920
I was white knighting keyframe no no I was white knighting myself I wasn't I didn't do it for anybody

1431
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:38,520
else that makes me look worse to admit that but that's exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah you were very

1432
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:45,480
up for it but that is nice I think I think I was talking about I don't know I don't know I think

1433
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:53,080
there's a certain like nobility in being selfish yeah you know I I'm with you I agree yeah I mean

1434
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:57,560
because I mean it's definitely I mean it's definitely I mean the way misanthroponi handled it was

1435
02:15:57,560 --> 02:16:02,040
annoying so I'm glad at least you didn't fall into that trap there's a reason why I didn't want to do

1436
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:06,760
it for everybody else because I'd heard enough bronies in the community going oh those people I'm

1437
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:11,320
like no like this is when I did my video when I did my video on digi which I got permission to do

1438
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:17,400
from digi um I ran into so many of those fucking that guy with the glasses josh scorcher spirits

1439
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:22,520
like oh no one of us now I'm like no faggot no I'm not I am not one of you people why would they think

1440
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:28,280
that because they wanted they they wanted someone desperately to be their fucking voice they wanted

1441
02:16:28,280 --> 02:16:36,040
someone to be basically map fucking fucking josh scorcher Jesus Christ oh don't don't even get me

1442
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:41,720
started he started fucking finally talking to me and everybody talks to you well it's I need this

1443
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:46,440
and then he fucks right off hey do you have somebody do you have somebody as good as these

1444
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:52,040
these two artists just laying around okay cool bye thanks hey I I need something and then he'll

1445
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:57,720
get back oh I accidentally blocked you you are such a faggot josh suck a dick I think in I think in

1446
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:03,560
this video I talk about josh and like how much he annoyed me no maybe not this maybe it was in

1447
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:09,480
no it was the first video I talk about josh and how annoying I found his like his way he literally

1448
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:14,680
he called me an a an a apostrophe apostrophe hole and then he fucking gets on his fucking high horse

1449
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:21,880
about how he doesn't swear like get fucked dude um yeah I really don't understand it but yeah

1450
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:25,480
like like it's not there it's been a financial point of view again just just to clarify again

1451
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:30,120
so it doesn't seem like we're fucking grilling you here it's like we like we like understood

1452
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:35,640
Miss Ant's point even if you didn't like get it per se like get what he was going on about

1453
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:40,840
but in this we're just so utterly confused that we just don't know what's going on I'm eager to get

1454
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:46,120
to the part I'm eager to get to the part where you really rip into me like I really don't want

1455
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:50,920
to hear it Ben I know your recluse I know you don't like talking to people that's why I lightly

1456
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:55,640
went hey are we cool because I wanted to get in and out and leave you the fuck alone I'm not as much

1457
02:17:55,640 --> 02:18:03,480
of a recluse as all that I do have some degree of people's skill and sure enough news to me news to

1458
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:09,000
me yeah and sure enough you got annoyed by just me asking some very little things because

1459
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:14,680
I asked you what was wrong and you didn't fucking tell me

1460
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:21,640
how did you not think hey I just did a video on this guy because I didn't fucking talk to you I

1461
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:26,200
didn't even fucking mention you do it no it's cool no it's cool though it's good it's good we're all

1462
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:34,840
good everything's great but this guy gets like mean he gets me and never says why he never says why

1463
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:38,840
but yeah okay killed a sensei in a duel and he never said why

1464
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:45,720
made the process to bend over backwards to appease me the mongrel where does he get that idea

1465
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:51,240
like where does that come from what does that mean it's so annoying how like everything we're

1466
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:57,080
saying now is stuff we already say yeah oh all right I'll touch him on this too yeah it leads

1467
02:18:57,080 --> 02:19:02,120
back to like the digi thing when when digi had his drama I was like oh yeah I was really upset

1468
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:05,240
about that he's like well he didn't say anything to me I was like I don't want to yell at you digi well

1469
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:11,400
who did you yell at I yelled at Asher well why why did you yell at him oh because he's a communist

1470
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:17,480
he doesn't have a soul you're okay digi okay sure I'm sorry I'm sorry you got answered munchy I'm

1471
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:23,960
really sorry solid solid it's like what does it not enter these people's heads that maybe we're

1472
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:27,960
just friends and we want to hang out and be friends and talk shit about people that suck

1473
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:34,520
yeah like yeah that is that not a reasonable explanation for why this is a video

1474
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:41,080
that's not like a marketable like you can't even say that was to be fair when my people do that

1475
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:44,760
people do think it's a master plan and I don't stop them from thinking that because it's funnier that

1476
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:51,720
way um no no there's no there's no master plan we're fully transparent see that's that wouldn't

1477
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:57,800
hear a rowdy fucker's cop killie and how would that appease me to do that how would you like

1478
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:04,280
like I don't even know yeah like I don't love them we're literally agog we're agog after listening

1479
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:09,400
to your to the things you had to say I'm here I just kind of ride the beef I've got flummoxed

1480
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:15,480
like I want like I want to theorize like where this idea comes from but I've just got nothing like

1481
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:21,800
I've got no idea why he thinks that like I'm trying to impress you with any of we're pretty hung

1482
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:29,080
up on this aren't we yeah I don't understand no I'm gonna take care of you right now this is my

1483
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:34,760
friend Vita I could spare 100 months nice nice photo of him by the way yeah no he got that was when

1484
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:40,920
he was drunk trying to big cider to hang out with him oh my god yeah Vita out because and Vita got

1485
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:46,440
all bitchy and huffy about it and the ensuing shit storm has reached levels of fuckery that the

1486
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:52,520
brony fandom might not have known well if not for this channel munchies case unlike digis where digi

1487
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:57,320
just cut Vita off and Vita ended up taking it very poorly about as bad as say lily peat took

1488
02:20:57,320 --> 02:21:03,000
being cut off from joss scorcher munchie did the same thing and Vita asked for me to go find out

1489
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:08,200
to which munchie told me sometimes some niggas just oh hold on you did say that word for word

1490
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:13,160
absolutely yeah yeah no no no no no definitely and I'm not denying that and I like I just want to

1491
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:18,920
say like I'm gonna try and not say what I say in here so I'm just gonna stay silent but yeah I'm

1492
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:24,760
gonna touch up on all the shit yeah and that's fine and Vita's response was and nothing of value

1493
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:31,320
was lost Vita didn't mindlessly harass munchie he let shit go in fact I was really proud that Vita

1494
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:37,160
had the most mature rare moment I've ever seen him have in one of these situations later on Vita

1495
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:44,440
here here my positive so I can explain what's going on uh Vita made accounts on steam over and

1496
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:49,560
over trying to add me that is a fact that is what he did and I'm pretty sure the timeline of this

1497
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:54,600
after fng you're asked me he didn't do it anymore which was fine the fact still remains

1498
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:59,000
after I blocked him and I'm fairly certain that I that I said I blocked you or even if I didn't

1499
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
he could take the hint making a ton of accounts to message me and me ignoring every single one

1500
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:14,360
probably doesn't seem like I want to talk does it you know like he's I which like fng are just he

1501
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:19,800
just goes off on this thing and like there's no context given as to like why there's beat like

1502
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:28,040
he says that like Vita used to be boys with digi and then something about you and something see

1503
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:34,600
this isn't even like drama this is just like a weird sort of like Vita wanted to be friends still

1504
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:39,320
or maybe he just it just I do want to say fng thanks for coming on and sorry about the weight

1505
02:22:39,320 --> 02:22:46,760
yeah oh no no it's it's fine or something like that yeah um oh yeah yeah you want to come here

1506
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:53,240
sorry sorry let myself finish okay but the again about this I was cool with him at the time and

1507
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:58,520
basically I I understood why people cut Vita off understand that you guys were getting busy and you

1508
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:02,760
know digi was starting to take off and that was around like when he had 50 000 subs just imagine

1509
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:07,960
now he absolutely I've I've saw tons of his videos like I don't even have time for really cool people

1510
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:13,640
anymore yeah and Vita didn't understand that and my knee jerk reaction is I didn't know about all this

1511
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:19,080
my thought was I was like oh cool he like left fng munchy the fng alone he's growing up which is not

1512
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:26,360
true I mean Vita I mean I wanted to believe that's so bad I'm like oh he's he's finally maturing he's

1513
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:32,440
finally it's no I've heard I've heard did you talk about Vita and I got I think there's more

1514
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:39,480
to it than just that he was too busy for friends like Vita was a real fucker it to hear digi tell

1515
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:46,280
it um um one time um I forget I might mention this later but I just want to mention it again

1516
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:52,360
real quick uh you you know about how like Vita molested digi's computer chair right okay now

1517
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:57,640
I've heard stories go back whether that was legit or not it's funny to believe it's legit

1518
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:03,080
I mean I don't think digi would lie about it yeah he doesn't strike me as the kind

1519
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:09,800
who just tells tall tales tells tall tales tales in such a way okay and and Vita was happy to

1520
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:14,840
acknowledge that this was a fact like after it happened for a while but but but now that we try

1521
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:21,400
and bring it up as like Vita you're fucking crazy you have no proof I'll I'll I'll I guess we don't

1522
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:26,520
but hold up I've hung out with freaking Vita at least to a certain period at like two different

1523
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:31,400
30 cons and I remember everybody was terrified of him until like I remember South fire hearts

1524
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:37,000
like oh he's the worst thing ever after like five minutes he's yeah he's not so bad well digi says

1525
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:42,520
that he's bad digi says that he's real bad when he's off his meds and uh apparently he was off

1526
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:48,360
his meds the time when he hung out with digi so I'm sure that contributed yeah um I don't know I

1527
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:54,840
mean I don't know I don't like Vita but I don't know if I'm I I don't know I'm sure there's some

1528
02:24:54,840 --> 02:25:01,320
good things about him yeah all all I know is this originally when basically we added bunchy to the

1529
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:06,280
the pfc chat which I don't even remember how that happened because I don't know how I did multiple

1530
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:13,240
okay I know Vita Vita and I were like we were we were acquaintances at the very least at the very

1531
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:19,720
least we were acquaintances and I know that he I don't know if it was the chat proper but I know

1532
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:25,000
at the very least I was in a chat at one point with I believe I think you were there and I think

1533
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:30,360
a couple like one or two girls were there and I know Vita was there and uh like I was there multiple

1534
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:36,040
like three different instances at least yeah no this is why that was so funny yeah by the time

1535
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:41,880
before you had just been thrown out we had a a week long vote to get Vita kicked out of the room

1536
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:46,760
okay and yeah and then we added some kid who started screeching really loud into his mic

1537
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:51,560
and we're like oh who the fuck is this crazy asshole and I'm just mentioning I have no doubt that

1538
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:54,920
I did that yeah yeah no you totally did and I mentioned it to Vita he's like hey is that munchy

1539
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:59,320
and I look at Sheldon he's like he knows who it is should I put him in he's like put him in

1540
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:07,000
after spending the week throwing him out so Vita made you magical that's it yeah I want to I I

1541
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:14,120
I think Sheldon he posted some like novel of a response to Miss Anthropony's video

1542
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:21,080
and it was I think it was vaguely anti-Miss Anthropony pro us so I appreciated that but

1543
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:26,920
man that guy typed like a fucking essay about the whole thing it's a real shame it's a real

1544
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:32,680
shame that that Miss Anthropony took his video down although I think you do see the comment in

1545
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:40,440
our response to it so it's preserved in some way I I I really hope so I'm really upset that that

1546
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:44,040
video is fucking gone because there were so many great comments and just the video itself was a

1547
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:50,200
fucking masterpiece yeah it was the only wreck we're we're we've archived it we have the only

1548
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:56,360
record of it yeah yeah I'm here on the rowdy fucker's cop killer yeah um we're in a historians

1549
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:02,760
but yeah I touch up upon more of you stuff in a second reason oh I didn't want to do a lot

1550
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:07,400
so I didn't accept this friend's request that's it that's the entirety what transpired you know

1551
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:12,840
the entire the entire second was just uh me and Vita didn't talk anymore that's it the the thing

1552
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:18,120
that I'm getting here like I've thought about this before and I like the closest thing I can get to

1553
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:24,840
like an underlying reason for why fngr is so upset is I really think that was like Vita that was

1554
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:28,920
upset like I really think he's upset on behalf of his speculation because of probably because

1555
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:33,880
my shit talked to him and we like went and tried and I rampage even though I knew it would come back

1556
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:39,400
yeah um so like yeah I think I think that he's indignant because we were mean to Vita and I think

1557
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:45,960
that probably what this video is is just like a sort of diarrhea stream that like came squirting

1558
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:51,720
out as the like as the aftermath of like some really angry like back and forthing between like

1559
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:59,240
the people that like fngr hangs out with like you know corpulent brony and vita okay yeah please

1560
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:04,200
respond I I have not hung out with corpulent brony in some significant time okay but you

1561
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:09,960
should but you showed him earlier in this video I was alluding to like the horse news drama he

1562
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:18,520
wrote a horse news article about someone I was dating was that um wish feather fallen wish

1563
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:24,360
fallen wish yeah yes and I basically like I was trying I bent over back I tried doing everything

1564
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:28,600
I can I was like here I'll throw you a podcast right beforehand and be kissed his ass praying

1565
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:32,920
that it would appeal upon him and you're like hey come on be cool and he didn't put it out

1566
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:38,200
anyways the next day just because he's a fat cunt um yeah we did get a comment from someone named

1567
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:46,680
like mom yuleus or something malimines yeah oh Jesus he was like malimines really fucking

1568
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:52,280
hate you ben because I think you made some kind of remark about like he got in I don't want to

1569
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:57,560
it was some kind of remark about some sexual thing that he had done back in the day oh yeah

1570
02:28:57,560 --> 02:29:05,880
you know I think I remember I think I remember like faith remembers I think I remember like I

1571
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:13,240
didn't know who he was or she was or whatever um yeah I think I like kind of came to some conclusion

1572
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:17,800
that he might be a pedophile or something based on absolutely nothing so I can't I can't

1573
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:22,520
really blame I can't really blame this person if he has something against me because that was

1574
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:26,520
yeah yeah yeah I'd like to state for the record faith if you're watching the thoughts of opinions

1575
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:31,640
have been saying do not reflect the do not sue me and do not call you a pedophile yeah I don't

1576
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:36,920
know I hate I hate you faith and I'd like you to burn in hell for all eternity but I'm not calling

1577
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:42,760
you a pedophile I think I think it was I think maybe I was listening to a to a pony fuckers podcast

1578
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:49,400
or something and uh the maluminous I don't know said something and it sounded weird and it and I

1579
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:52,920
was like this person's a fucking creep and then I jumped to a whole bunch of conclusions I don't

1580
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:59,320
remember I'll be completely honest with you maluminous is completely 100% unlikable uh maluminous

1581
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:06,200
is you've seen boondocks right yeah uh yeah okay do you you know uncle ruckus right oh of course

1582
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:14,600
maluminous is the uncle ruckus of transgender people oh my god yes sir uncle he worships

1583
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:19,240
sargon of a cod loves worships every skeptic in the world and still tries to say that you know

1584
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:24,040
I'm transgender and I'm this that the other and it's in it's just a complete contrarian

1585
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:27,000
how bizarre oh

1586
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:35,880
anyway he fucking nice thank you Ben you're welcome he commented something like

1587
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:44,920
like like me and corp like don't hang out with f and gr which you know sorry like like again we

1588
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:49,800
kind of removed from this so we don't really I mean I that was the case at one point so I just assumed

1589
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:54,840
you know yeah cuz he cuz corp cuz corpulent was in there was a picture of him so I assumed he was

1590
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:59,960
still like involved or something that was alluding to like the horse do's thing okay okay well sorry

1591
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:05,480
for that uh we you know we just um we didn't really know yeah yeah all right let's just tell me and

1592
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:09,800
like whoever the fuck else like I think this is like they kind of took this idea that like oh

1593
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:14,280
ben and munchie were me and devita echo chambered it around being like oh well they're bad they're

1594
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:19,240
the ones who are bad they're shitty and I hate them and then like this video is what's like squirted

1595
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:24,760
out like of the black box like you'd we don't see we don't get to see there's another thing here

1596
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:31,640
yeah yeah but Vita and corpulent hate each other like to a fucking zenith okay part of the reason

1597
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:35,720
why I started lose like you know they wouldn't make me a mod and freaking the pfc like Vita would

1598
02:31:35,720 --> 02:31:39,480
tap you on the show he's like hey mod me why because I want to kick out corpulent and he would do

1599
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:43,000
it like absolutely he would shoot like a complete punching bag and they're like why are you letting

1600
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:50,920
him do that because like because it's funny what a real stand-up guy that oh well I didn't like

1601
02:31:50,920 --> 02:31:55,560
corpulent fucking this is like maybe you know what if corpulent comes forward said that's why

1602
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:59,960
harassed your girlfriend because you treated me like I was a joke you know at least I'd understand

1603
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:05,560
that we don't we don't really know what happened there we just know that this is like the feeling

1604
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:12,280
that this indescribable in like unfathomable video is what was was what was created we don't

1605
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:16,920
like it's just we can't describe what it is because it makes no sense it's really like

1606
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:23,160
it really feels like it's all based on like some some like cultural some like like clicky

1607
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:28,760
shit that is like deeply understood by like five people yeah no no offense ben but that's how they

1608
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:35,640
look at you guys and the the fucking procrastinators that's fair you guys have literally called

1609
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:39,720
yourselves the click and yeah it takes a lot that takes cherry peat levels of fucking

1610
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:45,080
unawareness to say that shit uh I mean I don't know like it's true that that that that is that

1611
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:51,240
like I don't know we do know that's retarded so okay like I don't know like okay well I was I

1612
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:56,440
wasn't around for doing it unironically we're doing it ironically only takes you so far let's

1613
02:32:56,440 --> 02:33:00,760
continue true true but we don't have no context for but then like a thousand people watch it

1614
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:05,160
anyway because it's like vaguely related to the brony fandom and that means it's worth watching

1615
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:11,560
for some reason it I just I don't understand by the way and none of this is a point about the video

1616
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:17,080
this is just like weird backstory between me and Vita continue oh yeah yeah yeah we're he was getting

1617
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:22,600
along with people in there well more the fans and say the pcp members but that was never gonna happen

1618
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:27,960
I fully understand that Vita didn't belong there we kind of popped in the call and much he showed

1619
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:33,320
up and went what are you doing here there was a call in the discord chat in the press news call

1620
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:38,920
yeah um yeah it was it was like the voice server and then they were and for the record I was going

1621
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:44,760
to join but I was like that's probably not gonna lead to good things I thought you did I'm almost

1622
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:49,640
positive that you came in and said Vita what are you doing here kill yourself oh you're okay and I'm

1623
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:52,920
sitting there thinking if this were my room I'd say something but I don't feel like being

1624
02:33:52,920 --> 02:34:00,360
thrown no I I definitely said that in text no I I definitely said all of that and more in text

1625
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:04,760
I don't know I don't know if I joined the voice call specifically though um yeah and and and I'll

1626
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:10,600
say this I'll say this later but just you know to clarify um I I stand by Vita kill yourself I stand by

1627
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:16,440
that statement um and I don't know like um we'll hear here I'll explain in a second here

1628
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:23,880
okay like why call kill yourself oh hi fng are you're cool let me respond muchy no I don't also

1629
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:30,360
when you first of all I don't think I like my entire okay I know I might have said

1630
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:37,960
me you know fng are you're cool my entire knowledge of fng are was that he was like this weird like

1631
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:43,240
shady sketchy that I didn't like but I knew I knew that people thought were cool so I was like

1632
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:49,400
okay I guess I guess you flounder like friends with fng I just thought like okay I won't start

1633
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:55,400
shit like I'll start shit with Vita because I hate yeah yeah and uh that's my entire thing

1634
02:34:55,400 --> 02:35:00,840
like I I never was like trying like like no no I didn't think it was that yeah I'm not saying

1635
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:04,520
that you were trying to boot like me I just thought it was like oh we're cool and then I was like

1636
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:09,480
I thought Vita was cool at the time and I thought it was just kind of shitty to go up and do that

1637
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:13,240
like if I'm trying to be like reasonable with somebody I'm not gonna like turn to their friend

1638
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:19,880
to be like hate for yourself that's okay well me me and Vita are on no reasonable terms and we

1639
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:27,240
know I like like we did not leave as like friends I was missing I was missing a ton of details

1640
02:35:27,240 --> 02:35:32,360
and we are yeah yeah because I I didn't like him but I I didn't think it was okay to not like him

1641
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:39,400
so I didn't want to start any shit yeah by the way I still like don't even know like what's being

1642
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:44,520
like I guess they came into a call at some point like I don't know what the call was I don't know

1643
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:50,280
like when this was happening or why I will explain the entirety of what he of of of what this person

1644
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:57,080
tried so I will explain it in like human terms yeah one day in the pcp fan chat Vita came in

1645
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:02,520
and uh he was acting kind of weird and then I was like oh man it's Vita what a fucking weird

1646
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:06,680
asshole and then I called him a weird asshole and told him kill himself and then I told sorry

1647
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:12,040
but how he fucked did his chair and he got all embarrassed and and uh people made fun of him a

1648
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:16,920
lot because he was being weird and creepy and an asshole I think I just heard myself he wasn't even

1649
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:21,720
being like that you know he wasn't even being that weird it was just you know and I hate Vita so I

1650
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:26,680
wanted to make fun of him that wasn't like a that's understandable to me yeah I just don't like Vita

1651
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:31,560
so I wanted to give him a bad time like I've heard enough I've heard enough about Vita that I don't

1652
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:36,600
think he deserves the benefit of the doubt yeah and so that happened and then fngr was there too

1653
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:41,560
and they they got into a call by them like in a voice call by themselves like in like they joined

1654
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:45,800
the voice channels what I'm saying like a call off on their own uh they got into the voice channel

1655
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:50,120
I was going to but I was out of the house and uh so I just I just told him to kill himself and the

1656
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:55,480
I think he's gay and then Jesse came in and then uh me and Jesse talked about how uh stupid and uh

1657
02:36:55,480 --> 02:37:00,760
faggy uh Vita is and Vita got really pissed off and like mad and like uh like like angry uh

1658
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:05,400
like angry and started crying like pissing his pants and then he like left or no he didn't

1659
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:09,400
left we banned him and then he tried to make all the accounts to come back and spam the pcp chat

1660
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:15,480
because quote okay to be fair Jesse was already there because I he was venting about somebody

1661
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:20,680
else so you can ask me not to show them the comment for he was bitching about somebody you were

1662
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:25,240
mentioning before leave it at that you should be able to figure out who that was yeah it was me

1663
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:33,640
no I would have told you then yeah I trust you okay okay that's fine I didn't know that

1664
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:37,480
he said this to one of the mods quote there's nothing more dangerous than man with nothing left

1665
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:41,240
to lose did you spit into this real quick like like like like like like like like I don't know if you

1666
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:49,320
caught that but like like Vita said like like seven times in a row um Vita said like we banned him

1667
02:37:49,320 --> 02:37:54,440
and then Vita said to one of the moderators like I'm going to come back and I'm like I'm gonna raise

1668
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:58,600
hell and quote there's nothing more dangerous than man with nothing left to lose which is

1669
02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:03,800
fucking ridiculous and fucking like so like fucking like edgy it's hilarious yeah and then

1670
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:10,760
and then he proceeds to we should get him on the pcp but oh my god all of his attempts to come back

1671
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:15,720
to the pcp fan chat were in vain because we immediately realized and banned him we just immediately

1672
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:20,440
banned him he didn't even have time to spam like like he came back like six or seven times and

1673
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:25,320
I'm fairly certain and uh we just banned him like immediately and he didn't he didn't have any of the

1674
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:30,200
epic trolling walls that he wanted to he was completely and utterly defeated and nothing he did

1675
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:36,040
ever did so he was just kissing his pants publicly and we always made fun of him for being retarded

1676
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:42,280
and it was great it was a great time uh sounds pretty good um should I continue yeah go ahead

1677
02:38:42,280 --> 02:38:47,000
dude we're in the pfc yeah the work reacted like a cringy autistic kid who literally screeched him

1678
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:53,880
to his mic you went full retard and everyone bent over that did happen yeah yeah yeah Vita came

1679
02:38:54,600 --> 02:39:00,600
to say hi and he acted like you were a big deal you're a star fucker munchie I want Ben to know

1680
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:05,480
if you could ever step over him for something bigger you wouldn't a heartbeat so you could be an

1681
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:11,960
even bigger toadie munchie you're a sniveling groveling two-faced cute once upon a time ago you

1682
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:17,240
gave your nose and showed it to do you and that was something that was an old fan art and you

1683
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:23,800
endeared yourself to someone talented that's why you are that was that was me you're insane

1684
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:29,640
okay wait we we we gotta we gotta pause about that we we we gotta we gotta discuss what you'll

1685
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:35,640
betray me if I am here yeah but but you're like just let our past version speak for a little bit

1686
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:39,560
and then that's just what I would expect like okay like I wouldn't ever I wouldn't expect anything

1687
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:45,000
less of you so like I keep you around to keep me on my toes so I don't slip up and get sloppy

1688
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,480
oh okay okay so so a lot of things a lot of things first of all go go back like well let

1689
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:53,720
don't not go back I'm gonna go back in my brain to the beginning of that clip where he describes

1690
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:58,680
a story I told on five fractions one where I once went through the pony forecast which

1691
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:05,000
I don't really remember my interaction with them a lot I I do I like I described a story where

1692
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,040
me and a couple friends went into that chat room and described the history of the Byzantine empire

1693
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:16,920
to I don't remember that I don't know if you were there that I do I love history so I wouldn't

1694
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:21,800
remember yeah like I don't think you were there like I know I know I was kind of a dodgy memory

1695
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:26,200
I'm pretty sure and that's the memory of the goldfish and I don't truly remember how often I was

1696
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:31,720
associated with the pony forecast but I know Vita added me to cause a lot I know that for a fact

1697
02:40:31,720 --> 02:40:37,160
so I had a lot of answers twice yeah yes so I'm sure I had a lot of interaction with them

1698
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:41,240
and I'm sure one time I did scream I'm sure it's a different time yeah yeah yeah I did

1699
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:45,640
scream for a while I don't doubt that that happened but I also don't doubt that my fucking

1700
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:50,520
weird Byzantine empire story happened so that's not really a gotcha that's not like there were

1701
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:55,720
just two times probably he's saying all these things like they're gotchas like it's like everything

1702
02:40:55,720 --> 02:41:00,840
he says it's like he thinks he's like really he's really like putting some shit out there

1703
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:07,720
and then it's all just like but it's all just like he was on to say that like I I'm only friends

1704
02:41:07,720 --> 02:41:13,240
with digi because I'm I gave him fanner one time and that is completely accurate yeah that is not

1718
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:29,400
like and then later on when I gave you like 10 bucks to shut up about I feel bad about it yeah

1719
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:35,880
but you're gonna keep the money yeah wait okay okay I do I do kind of remember let me let me make

1720
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:41,320
sure I'm getting this right I was so I was on king of limbo and months later I was still trying to

1721
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:46,920
get in touch with digi I did enjoy talking to you I enjoyed talking to everybody who was like part of

1722
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:52,920
the horseshoe crew I get we'll call it that for now um everybody was really cool even you know

1723
02:42:52,920 --> 02:43:00,440
when Nick kicks in fucking it was like a dipshit it was still fun yeah um and then you you went off

1724
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:07,240
on me when I tried to like thrive digi to like you know hey so I was so I was mad I was mad because

1725
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:13,240
I went on king of limbo and you didn't pay me anything and then because you were gonna pay digi

1726
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:20,200
to do the same thing is it do I have it right I threw digi some money to like try and like get

1727
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:27,080
him to not think I was a fuck you know so like okay okay well I don't know the truth okay well I

1728
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:33,160
think okay I do vaguely remember that I think what I thought was going on is that like you you I

1729
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:39,480
thought you paid digi or or someone maybe it was probably digi to be on the show so I guess I assumed

1730
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:43,160
that like oh digi wasn't even on yet he still wasn't talking to me he just took the money and

1731
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:48,440
never bothered to respond okay okay well yeah digi thought I was running the pfc at the time

1732
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:54,040
which never was the case well I'm okay well I'm not saying this is cool like because if I agreed

1733
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:58,760
to be on for free then I should have just then I should have just been happy with that I understand

1734
02:43:58,760 --> 02:44:03,480
I understand why Gibbon was angry because I mean you I I paid for your artwork which I I did use

1735
02:44:03,480 --> 02:44:08,440
and completely happy with it if you hire been our been saint for artwork I've never been I've never

1736
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:14,440
felt cheated I've definitely gotten mileage out of all those art pieces oh thank you yes I do I do

1737
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:20,360
my best um and and again look look if you want a pleasant memory of Ben saying we're all at Brony

1738
02:44:20,360 --> 02:44:25,800
con we're all drinking together and there's been taking his time this is free time teaching an

1739
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:30,120
artist to give them tips while we're all fucking around did I do your cool guy Ben yes you did

1740
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:34,360
there was a girl that was with them I don't it wasn't cotton candy uh whoever the hell the other

1741
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:39,400
girl that was there with the I think I know who you're talking about yeah no I I remember a lot

1742
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:43,160
of good things that Ben has done that's why I didn't want to get into him that's why I keep going

1743
02:44:43,160 --> 02:44:48,600
hey Ben are we cool I didn't want to fight with Ben I really didn't I swear we didn't want to fight

1744
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:57,560
either FNG are we didn't want to fight either uh yeah no we did not um well uh wait so why was

1745
02:44:57,560 --> 02:45:03,400
why was Gibbon angry um I think he he wasn't commissioned or anything like that I threw him

1746
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:08,520
like a dollar on patreon he might maybe you both were going back and forth on it I did throw him

1747
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:11,720
10 for it and I was like well look you know what Gibbon here here's your podcast it was cool I'll

1748
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:16,040
just give you 10 so there's no hard feelings I don't I don't want the people that I think are the

1749
02:45:16,040 --> 02:45:20,920
coolest people in the fandom to hate my guts I don't feel like I'm being shaken down right now

1750
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:26,120
well I guess I I guess I have to apologize for that yeah I think I think I remember that I figured

1751
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:31,560
that like because someone else was getting paid to to go on the show that I therefore deserve to

1752
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:36,760
to in hindsight that's pretty that's pretty fucking shitty so sorry about that my that's my bad

1753
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:40,600
well the yeah the the reason why Tom was paid is because he was up like Schitt's Creek I think he

1754
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:45,720
was like really in a lot of trouble back then yeah and I was like okay here you go I mean I mean if

1755
02:45:45,720 --> 02:45:50,120
you know if I if I agreed to be on then like you know what am I complaining about so it's that's

1756
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:56,600
on me that's on me okay all right let's hit play yeah like again this wasn't to appease me we just

1757
02:45:56,600 --> 02:46:02,440
did that because we were friends and we like to have fun it's like he's reading all these like

1758
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:08,520
sinister intentions he's reading he's reading all these like weird like Machiavellian power plays

1759
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:14,840
into the whole thing okay again to be fair I had to make a lot of Machiavellian power plays

1760
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:20,360
to different point A to point B so you understand my perspective I had to I had to move mountains

1761
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:23,560
to get to digi that's why I was laughing at him about the anime thing I was like so let me get

1762
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:29,560
this straight you you were complaining that people won't talk to you oh this is the smallest

1763
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:33,400
file in digi do you know what hell I had to go through to talk to you

1764
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:43,240
like yeah if I was a starfucker I could do a little bit better than Ben saying don't you think

1765
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:54,600
oh now I'm sad yeah yeah yeah you could go after just oh man um that'd be really easy

1766
02:46:54,680 --> 02:47:01,400
mean Jeff got into a good on a good fire red call we could easily I could easily use Jeff for subs

1767
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:06,840
that would be incredibly easy you know what I could do for subs I could not make the Japanese

1768
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:13,640
Juggalo ARG I could not do that I could make anime videos instead of making the Japanese Juggalo ARG

1769
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:18,200
but I don't because I'm a weird fucking emotionally stunted freak and I just want to do cool things

1770
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:26,920
yeah like we're like we're not we're not we're all here we're all here because this is where

1771
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:32,600
we belong you know not because not because we're not here on some like false pretense yeah because

1772
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:40,120
like there's there's if we were if we if like if the pcp were a thing that we're just like

1773
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:45,160
a business yeah if like if we were here to do business and we were here to like promote an

1774
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:51,640
agenda like there'd be better ways to do that like that's you know fngr he just doesn't fucking

1775
02:47:51,640 --> 02:47:55,880
get it and why would he you know yeah he just doesn't he just doesn't understand a single

1776
02:47:55,880 --> 02:48:01,560
fucking thing yeah could you know Ben fan you ever see the movie twins the one where

1777
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:07,320
Arnold Swartz yeah yeah yeah this part's good line in there where they're talking to old Arnold

1778
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:11,720
and saying that all the greatness went into him and all this shit that went into his brother

1779
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:13,720
I just imagine

1780
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:19,560
it's great I'm gonna do this nice and slow this is the Arnold in this situation

1781
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:34,120
I often repeat that line that I'm a pile of hot dog goo uh that one's a keeper that's that's

1782
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:42,920
not that's not true anymore by the way um why I don't know why is he so why is he so sweet on Nate

1783
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:48,360
yeah yeah like what did Nate do to be what did Nate didn't hit me that's what happened

1784
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:54,200
but his brother is like the cool Nate didn't shake me down for money that that guy's cool with me

1785
02:48:54,920 --> 02:48:58,600
do you know how I got Nate I was like I was like hey I could give you an animation like

1786
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:03,080
fucking Ben he's like oh I can't turn say no to that I I want that animation

1787
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:08,760
for that podcast the only thing that I could find safe that freaking crown prince would

1788
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:12,760
animate was the very beginning and she had had the table flip to make it interesting

1789
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:17,880
because everything Nate did was so brutal those those crown prince animations are pretty sweet I

1790
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:24,280
was pretty fucking stoked when I realized that I that yeah there was one of me uh fuck yeah she

1791
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:29,960
did that for free I was shocked yes yeah that's pretty impressive no no munchie about that I remember

1792
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:35,080
like right before she came on the show and as as a joke like as a goof I was like hey you could always

1793
02:49:35,080 --> 02:49:39,480
do an animation if you're coming on the show and I remember Sheldon contacted me while I was at work

1794
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:45,320
he's like look dude look what she did I'm like oh my god I just died she must think you people suck

1795
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:51,800
she's coming on my show and came in animation Sheldon kill yourself that's a wonder we're not

1796
02:49:51,800 --> 02:49:59,160
friends anymore yeah that's not a one-off thing he mentioned that again how like how like like

1797
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:06,200
Ben is like this groveling disgusting sack of shit but like Nate's so cool yeah what yeah he

1798
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:13,320
sounds like a Nate Fed fiction in hearse lecture is is that what got you on Nate that video that of

1799
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:20,840
all I I was totally mistaken I should have figured that I don't know he's like I don't think like

1800
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:24,760
I didn't know sure that Nate I almost forgotten that Nate was on king of limbo I'm sure that Nate

1801
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:32,120
thinks that fngr is is retarded just like I do like probably there's no doubt like we're completely

1802
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:41,160
on the same page about fngr and then why can't you be cool why can't you be nice and good and

1803
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:51,800
cool guy like this other guy that thinks I suck ass that had no there was no point there

1804
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:57,560
the point was simply that I was like oh it was simply that I was a mongoloid that was

1805
02:50:57,560 --> 02:51:04,040
the point here is simply that I am inferior to Nate yeah like there's no

1806
02:51:05,480 --> 02:51:14,360
this is so awkward I'm so I'm so gonna clip this together and make a video please oh please

1807
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:20,920
and and and because because I was mean to Vita justly therefore I'm a therefore I'm a mongoloid

1808
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:29,800
yeah and and why make this video you're not making any points of that the friday fuckers

1809
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:37,240
fired frack frack frack frack is a bad video we are bad people for like he called rowdy

1810
02:51:37,240 --> 02:51:43,320
he called rowdy fuckers a hit video but like a hit video is exactly what this is this is nothing but

1811
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:49,880
that and we and it wasn't a hit video it was just us shitting around yeah like it wasn't even mostly

1812
02:51:49,880 --> 02:51:56,680
about that yeah um all right okay continue one thousand subs than me I'm told that you're pissed

1813
02:51:56,680 --> 02:52:02,200
that tune critic is making more money than yourself well I did listen to that fucking yeah money

1814
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:08,200
you seem to have fun at the burning donut who unlike yourself went to be homeless then got a job

1815
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:14,040
and pulled himself up by his bootstrap a man yeah you were made in high regard do you regret

1816
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:18,440
how hard I was on burning donut in front of your little mongoloid friend here was 700

1817
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:24,760
but by the way fngr I want to comment you like very genuinely like genuinely like genuinely I love

1818
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:31,480
the way you like almost like animate me like like like me on screen like like earlier like earlier

1819
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:35,800
earlier when you were like you were doing an impression of me like like like oh fg you're cool

1820
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:40,280
you're like animated stills of me from the degil nation lecture which is fucking incredible and

1821
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:47,800
I'm going to steal that for if I ever make an like an analysis video I I love just the idea of just

1822
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:56,120
using me as like like a stilted like animation it's incredible I genuinely love it okay I'm really

1823
02:52:56,120 --> 02:53:02,840
upset you asked 700 subs so let me give you a first first of all how is your sub count relevant

1824
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:08,440
second of all yeah I'm second I mean you know I'm sorry if burning donut thinks I'm cool whatever

1825
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:13,000
the I don't I don't like his art and his fucking patreon was an embarrassment so what what the

1826
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:18,360
fucking it what am I supposed to say uh and and and wearing a homing became don't a dirty

1827
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:25,480
in home fucking birdie don't pull him by his bootstraps but how's your living situation how's

1828
02:53:25,480 --> 02:53:30,600
that going out how's that working out for you how's the majority of your of your fucking life

1829
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:36,600
how's that how's that how's your leftover eating situation how's that um it's on the upswing

1830
02:53:37,240 --> 02:53:47,160
I mean uh just for additional context bin eats trash um well one time I pulled some grapefruits

1831
02:53:47,160 --> 02:53:51,800
out of the trash can they were still fine divu had totally jumped the gun on throwing those

1832
02:53:51,800 --> 02:53:55,960
grapefruits away they were still juicy they were still juicy and delicious I will defend to the

1833
02:53:55,960 --> 02:54:03,320
death my decision to eat those trash grapefruits um bin eats trash so so often at the digi house

1834
02:54:03,320 --> 02:54:08,040
so often at the digi house there would be like takeout like takeout chinese or takeout

1835
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:12,360
sandwiches would get thrown away they'd be like fully uneaten and yeah I'd fucking eat that it's

1836
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:16,760
fucking good shit god damn it they paid good money for those and someone's got a fucking benefit

1837
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:22,920
from it when I went to radcon and I went to bin's house I went to bin's room it was covered

1838
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:28,920
wall to wall on the floor with peanut shells and and like and like like like like vape business

1839
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:34,920
card just thrown around on the ground and and and whenever I had to wake him up because we were

1840
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:39,560
recording he would he would like like slither on over to the door and fucking his his hair would

1841
02:54:39,560 --> 02:54:45,400
be in a fucking mane and and he would groggily like like like beg me to fucking um a couple more

1842
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:51,080
minutes basically yeah that's the story with him in a man bun that would have done it would have

1843
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:57,400
did you have a man bun uh I could have I could have certain points

1844
02:54:58,200 --> 02:55:02,760
I never actually pulled the trigger on it but but but yeah the point of that is that bin has always

1845
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:10,440
been falling on hard times I mean I mean I was I mean I was never homeless and I like homeless but

1846
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:15,800
rear that one time you tried a hitchhike from like LA to Boston or something yeah and I mean I did

1847
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:22,120
I did that to save money I mean I think one of your last birthdays I sent you money because

1848
02:55:22,120 --> 02:55:25,640
you're like oh I'm like how are you doing not so good and I think I threw you money just because

1849
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:31,560
it was your birthday I don't hate bin guys I don't I don't I don't remember I don't remember

1850
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:36,280
saying oh I'm not doing maybe I did I don't know I don't remember that I do remember you've

1851
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:41,160
thrown me some money a couple times and I mean I appreciate that each time I hear about like like

1852
02:55:41,160 --> 02:55:46,360
I hear stories from although that was like that was like years ago so yeah well you love Skype

1853
02:55:47,880 --> 02:55:53,640
I didn't I didn't have Skype program I abandoned Skype for discord so I guess I've made my bed

1854
02:55:54,360 --> 02:55:57,960
um but yeah but yeah each time I hear about bin's living situation I'm always I'm always

1855
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:07,960
incredibly intrigued by by the squalor um incredible please continue oh I never I never was homeless

1856
02:56:07,960 --> 02:56:13,720
you know I'll give him that much it never was never was fully homeless uh so you know lucky me

1857
02:56:13,720 --> 02:56:19,560
don't see what that has to do with my fucking criticisms of the way burning doughnut chooses

1858
02:56:19,560 --> 02:56:25,400
to run his fucking art PR campaign don't really see the relevant there sorry he was homeless wouldn't

1859
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:42,200
have wished that on him doesn't really make I love the hot dog no one cares about an architect

1860
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:50,040
whatsoever him saying like saying like I have more subs but for no good reason gets more views

1861
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:55,480
which is like it's not even true I looked so something about like some kind of point about

1862
02:56:55,480 --> 02:57:01,880
how my audience isn't as engaged as his which like sorry are you the police yeah um munchy

1863
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:11,400
you suck ass which I don't like I don't touch on that real quick okay because you looked at my

1864
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:15,640
content and you went me which was really dismissive and I was like all right let's let's let's have a

1865
02:57:15,640 --> 02:57:21,720
dick measuring contest okay okay that's that's basically sure sure sure this will come up again

1866
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:27,560
this will come up again but fngr is like is fixated on sub counts and view counts as a measure of a

1867
02:57:27,560 --> 02:57:35,080
person's worth yeah okay two yeah to be fair fngr I know you're gonna say Ben is very fixated on

1868
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:42,440
patreon money um well you know I think I've got good reason to be but I'll leave that up to the

1869
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:48,280
audience to decide I'll leave them to be judge jerry and execution on that subject don't don't

1870
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:56,360
worry fngr I'm with you on that point god damn it he was right he was right as soon you betrayed me

1871
02:57:56,360 --> 02:58:05,560
just like fngr promised you would for no good reason subs right now yeah that's fine yeah

1872
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:10,920
is that out there a bond as opposed to patreon money which is more because it shows how much

1873
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:20,120
people like your stuff yeah I mean it's definitely more of one than like a sub count I mean look at

1874
02:58:20,120 --> 02:58:26,920
sigh for example yeah exactly true your big revelation of leaving pony was to become a

1875
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:34,120
pokey tuber fresh and original Benny you know because brony is dying Benny no no no to get about

1876
02:58:34,120 --> 02:58:41,400
half the views that tvb ap used to make not just that but I mean does it even need saying that he

1877
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:45,960
just doesn't know what he's talking about yeah like he just obviously just does not understand

1878
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:51,480
like he thinks that all right I didn't watch nislac because I don't like pokemon well that's fair I

1879
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:56,680
mean I wouldn't expect you to go watch that no no the problem isn't that you don't like Ben's content

1880
02:58:56,680 --> 02:59:03,560
because you know who can blame you yeah who would but yeah yeah oh we touched on this in a second

1881
02:59:03,560 --> 02:59:09,480
though um yeah just let go yeah people can only exist on youtube and there's nothing else one

1882
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:15,800
could possibly do yeah yeah yeah yeah like like the thing the things off the things off youtube

1883
02:59:15,800 --> 02:59:21,480
are not even like entering into this dialogue for him like they're not relevant they just don't

1884
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:28,600
even exist in his mind yeah does he even know that you have made a comic before does he know that

1885
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:37,720
who knows who knows do you know yes yes I do know that okay okay you know how I know because

1886
02:59:37,720 --> 02:59:43,400
the burning donut would shut up about it really what did he say defending he's like oh yeah I really

1887
02:59:43,480 --> 02:59:55,960
like Ben's work and then this came out yeah yeah well okay I I deserve okay I deserve to feel like

1888
02:59:57,720 --> 03:00:01,800
there was a couple of little things that like kind of like if it's stock piled up and I was like

1889
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:06,680
well you know Bennett though we've kind of done stuff but here I'll just be blunt with it Ben

1890
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:11,880
might have been a faggot but he was a hard faggot oh no he's biting us in the ass well I'm not having

1891
03:00:11,880 --> 03:00:19,640
it that's that's what happens like there are creative aspirations outside of youtube I'm sorry if

1892
03:00:19,640 --> 03:00:25,720
that's a news flash to you yeah but there are there are things you can do outside of making youtube videos

1893
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:34,600
well god it's really frustrating it's really frustrating because he just it's like it's like

1894
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:44,520
trying to like explain don't touch a stove to a child yeah well you'll try it and you'll see

1895
03:00:44,520 --> 03:00:51,160
and then he tries it but he still doesn't get it and the way he calls you bunny Benny is the most

1896
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:57,800
disgusting Benny is creepy it's creepy oh no it's meant to be condescending it was supposed to piss

1897
03:00:57,880 --> 03:01:03,400
you the fuck off yeah I could tell I did yeah I could tell and it's it totally did what it was

1898
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:11,480
intended to do right there it's really creepy and like he's trying to be like demeaning about it

1899
03:01:11,480 --> 03:01:20,920
and it's like just makes me sweat just make it just makes me feel dirty it's so gross he's like

1900
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:27,560
such a gross disgusting person he's said the guy with the cheeseburger t-shirt yeah well hey don't

1901
03:01:27,560 --> 03:01:39,000
just the cheese for the cheese today are 10k that's two percent Benny which is okay for milk but not

1902
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:45,240
so much for youtube that's your I do I do like that yeah I've boosted that from somewhere I forget

1903
03:01:45,240 --> 03:01:50,280
where oh nice oh and here's the part where you'd make fun of my thumbnails I love my thumbnails

1904
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:56,680
I'll stand by them to the death okay the critique I said was is it I felt that it would it's the same

1905
03:01:56,680 --> 03:02:06,360
picture like every time yeah yeah you see well sure you know I'm not someone I'm not the target

1906
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:11,720
demographic audience and you could definitely sit there and say back but yeah I mean I well

1907
03:02:12,680 --> 03:02:19,560
yeah I think I think that my thumbnails are are they're they're supremely readable you know like

1908
03:02:19,560 --> 03:02:24,360
you can tell what it is like like it's it's it's I think I've done an excellent job of branding

1909
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:30,040
my content with my thumbnail so yeah when I when I see a bin saying thumb now I know it's a bin

1910
03:02:30,040 --> 03:02:42,600
st thumbnail yeah well yeah I was really offended because I really I really like my

1911
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:50,200
these thumbnails are a fucking nightmare they are in yeah they don't have that readability

1912
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:54,840
I'm an expert at readability it's my it's my highest stat even read like it doesn't even read

1913
03:02:54,840 --> 03:03:02,520
my fucking thumbnails are designed to read well there we go this guy and not only fucking that

1914
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:08,520
but the shit he said before that where it was like it was like can we just replay it can you just go

1915
03:03:08,520 --> 03:03:13,320
back like a little bit so I can just fucking go back to the hot dog I think it's not that far yeah

1916
03:03:13,320 --> 03:03:19,400
yeah yeah yeah yeah just like just like the fact that he again again he just does not understand

1917
03:03:19,960 --> 03:03:27,240
to he just doesn't understand that that's not what you do tvb ap used to make not just that but

1918
03:03:27,240 --> 03:03:33,720
see this ben this is proto mario he has 500k subs entertaining guy poke tuber his average views

1919
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:41,240
today are 10k that's 2 benny which is okay for milk but not so much for youtube uh f ngr do you

1920
03:03:41,240 --> 03:03:47,480
still talk to burning down uh a little bit why I don't know I don't know if he'll see this video

1921
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:52,920
but if you if you do oh no he did I believe a response I thought he was super nice I'm assuming

1922
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:58,200
oh yeah yeah I saw I saw the response um yeah so I don't know if he'll see this video and I'm not on

1923
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:02,840
Skype anymore but if you do talk to him and it comes up feel free to let him know that I feel kind

1924
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:09,560
of bad for how hard I was on no no I totally will fuck okay okay um yeah the whole point here

1925
03:04:09,560 --> 03:04:15,720
they're not being very concise is just that like ben just does he like ben is a comic artist and

1926
03:04:15,720 --> 03:04:21,960
like sometimes does youtube videos and I believe the sentiment after he made the last one was I'm

1927
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:28,680
never going to do that ever again yeah yeah so yeah so here so here we're so here we're like

1928
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:35,400
so here we're like uh we're just fucking around about like yeah because you're because you're

1929
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:42,280
criticizing me for for the the move from pony to to pokemon when it's really like a move from pony

1930
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:48,680
to comic yeah and the the pokemon stuff is like a side thing okay I'll be on like I said there's

1931
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:54,840
usually like for the the bernie's who were like pro horseshoe crew there's always been like a couple

1932
03:04:54,840 --> 03:04:57,960
of things on the tip of our tongue but we don't want to give the benefit of the doubt to the rest of

1933
03:04:57,960 --> 03:05:01,960
the faggots okay so we just shut up because hey they're they're not going to shit with us

1934
03:05:01,960 --> 03:05:08,520
oh they're fucking with us now you know donut can go over there and go in an ass ball or me well

1935
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:12,200
I've had a lot of things that I've wanted to say but you know what I'm gonna be cool

1936
03:05:13,320 --> 03:05:19,400
oh we're not cool well that changes a lot that's basically all that was but but again we we were

1937
03:05:19,400 --> 03:05:38,280
cool okay first of all he makes it seem like leaving teabap and going to pokemon well okay

1938
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:43,000
first of all that's not even what happened but even if that word to have been what happened

1939
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:46,920
like like that's what that's what that's what happened in his mind oh all right no no no no like

1940
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:51,000
look I was spinning a bullshit narrative I remembered you being on mage's podcast and talking

1941
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:54,920
about how art was important to you and how art was important to gibbon and her and this that

1942
03:05:54,920 --> 03:06:02,440
the other no I knew more I was I was on mage's podcast yeah you tom and gibbon all came on for

Ben saint is a deep talented artist oh yes I like his style when change it for the world

1947
03:06:27,240 --> 03:06:32,840
I was in a fight I thought I was and yeah yeah you were swinging punches and everyone's just confused

1948
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:39,320
I don't know man I feel like uh you got you got a little you got a little misled you got a little

1949
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:47,160
bit misled on the content of our video yeah yeah yeah that's not that's just not what it is on any

1950
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:57,560
level on any level okay hey you there yeah I'm here no no that was me in the video asking

1951
03:06:59,960 --> 03:07:03,880
oh god the the fucking the barriers are breaking down between past and future

1952
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:09,000
yeah it wasn't for money you didn't do that for me it's just because you wanted to do it

1953
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:13,240
it wasn't it would have been smart to be fair what what has been good isn't for money no one

1954
03:07:13,320 --> 03:07:20,280
down yeah it's all for that oculus rift and then I don't I don't even I really don't even know what

1955
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:29,400
to say about it like it's just so I mean I mean I don't I don't know what like yeah like but like

1956
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:34,920
here's the thing like he's he's he's saying all this like you know oh like I've clearly

1957
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:40,520
fucked up like I've clearly fucked up so much and like and like oh I made such a terrible decision

1958
03:07:40,520 --> 03:07:46,520
but like it worked out for me and like I fucking make more on patreon now than I ever have and like

1959
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:52,760
my fucking shit has like like shit has gotten better for me and like I consider everything

1960
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:57,880
I've done to like like I see it as like like I've really succeeded at what I set out to do

1961
03:07:57,880 --> 03:08:02,600
like I've really made good progress towards what I wanted to do and like the fact that he just like

1962
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:08,520
frames it all as the exact opposite of that just just what am I even supposed to say that

1963
03:08:08,600 --> 03:08:15,800
just like no I just wrong you wrong yeah like I've I've heard been no sell like a lot of

1964
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:20,680
accomplishments from other people so this this is a very high double standard bullshit

1965
03:08:21,400 --> 03:08:29,880
uh examples examples please I I know you absolutely there's it's a lot of the things

1966
03:08:29,880 --> 03:08:33,560
that the pfc basically picked up off a fucking horseshoe crew where like oh look someone else

1967
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:37,560
would be doing something else and like oh no no that's not so good that's that's not us

1968
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:47,000
well they're not quite I mean if it's brony stuff then sure yeah I'll stand by that yeah um okay

1969
03:08:48,520 --> 03:08:55,480
I'm yeah I I'm ready to believe all right so let me let me ask that um I'm assuming like if

1970
03:08:55,480 --> 03:09:00,360
I don't know if if you guys all win anime that probably the same attitude probably would have

1971
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:10,920
carried over there I didn't go anime yeah I mean yeah yeah I mean I don't know what if the world

1972
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:17,960
was very clicky now yeah yeah yeah wait what'd you say munchie so we're all still very clicky now so

1973
03:09:17,960 --> 03:09:23,880
yeah like even though that didn't happen yeah yeah we are we are clicky though yeah I'll cut to that

1974
03:09:24,680 --> 03:09:31,080
wrong like wrong by any metric yeah and like just told just there's there's not even like a basis

1975
03:09:31,080 --> 03:09:35,560
there's not even a basis for me to critique that on because it doesn't even get like the basic

1976
03:09:35,560 --> 03:09:45,640
assumptions of reality right yeah holy shit jesus should I continue yep going from mlp to pokemon

1977
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:51,800
with your staggering dead drive go ahead some males those numbers did not work here here like

1978
03:09:51,800 --> 03:09:56,600
move back oh sorry sorry um wait was that was that real lunch here was that in okay

1979
03:09:57,560 --> 03:10:07,400
guns such a fucking clusterfuck yeah one second here okay yeah we're fucking this up refresh the page

1980
03:10:07,400 --> 03:10:13,160
I can't even tell which plane yeah yeah yeah the only way you can tell is if the mouths are moving

1981
03:10:13,160 --> 03:10:19,240
yeah funny like I think it's explicitly designed to be part speaking of dead dry and boring look at

1982
03:10:19,240 --> 03:10:27,480
this fucking video yeah yeah um yeah we really we really shit this one out um for uh we really we

1983
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:33,640
really betrayed our fans trust yes hanging on to everyone else's coattails so the next time

1984
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:43,000
that's your big breakaway benny going from mlp to pokemon with your staggering dead god damn it again

1985
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:48,600
we hit this yeah we've seen this like four times you hanging on everyone else's coattails

1986
03:10:48,600 --> 03:10:55,160
so the next time that's kind of like it I challenge you to show me your retention to your shitty videos

1987
03:10:55,160 --> 03:10:59,560
and I bet mine beat the fuck out of yours by the way Ben I mean they don't ask him off was the

1988
03:10:59,560 --> 03:11:04,360
original reason why I turned off the pcp podcast I had to move my shit to my other channel but how

1989
03:11:04,440 --> 03:11:09,000
not to brony was beating fucking as luck like a faggot in the back uh see this whatever

1990
03:11:09,560 --> 03:11:16,360
no it's like the neat name get some screenshots if you want to play this game benny uh don't call me

1991
03:11:16,360 --> 03:11:24,360
benny uh sorry okay phantom horn to kidding kidding kidding do that again bad about fngr thank you

1992
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:31,160
whatever his cop killers I have no idea what he's talking about yeah and again that's really the

1993
03:11:31,160 --> 03:11:36,920
little breakaway from this she's not addressing the video he just does not say what's wrong with the

1994
03:11:36,920 --> 03:11:42,520
video no wouldn't that make more sense to describe is is there more or have we pretty much happy

1995
03:11:42,520 --> 03:11:50,440
no no no like he's like oh thank god yeah I think we've beaten we've beaten this dead

1996
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:56,040
if you go back and edit any of this I'd probably cut off like like somewhere towards like

1997
03:11:56,120 --> 03:12:00,680
a couple of like at least a loop yeah yeah yeah some of that at the end was a bit but

1998
03:12:00,680 --> 03:12:04,600
we're not fucking editing this this is this is oh yeah yeah roddy fuckers cop killers

1999
03:12:04,600 --> 03:12:10,040
doesn't believe in editing all right well uh is there a thing you want to say because I'm

2000
03:12:10,040 --> 03:12:14,920

what's the deal what's the story we made oh I do I do want to point out right now since I can't

2037
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:16,520
see the chat right now if if I go to your description it's a link to my encyclopedia dramatica

2038
03:16:17,160 --> 03:16:20,520
you're not going to be able to go no no no we weren't starting a fight yes you you will be

2040
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:33,000
no man because because well I ask I ask because like you know I like I have occasionally seen

2041
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:37,800
your youtube channel and I see and I see tune critic you know like mentioned in a lot of uh in a

2042
03:16:37,800 --> 03:16:44,360
lot of your videos and like I assumed that it was like you know pony news stuff or brony analysis

2043
03:16:44,360 --> 03:16:49,160
stuff but like I don't know I guess uh like from from what people were saying like I guess there's

2044
03:16:49,160 --> 03:16:56,520
like some personal shit that went down and I was and I was deeply interested okay so keeping it vague

2045
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:59,880
okay you don't have to say anything you don't want it you might want to really ask me after the

2046
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:07,320
discord's off because you'll get way juicier stuff yeah let's put it this way if if you don't see it

2047
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:14,040
on how not to brony what makes you think it's going to be here um I guess so um yeah I have a really

2048
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:20,280
hard time shutting up so that if that that that must be means it's really really something um

2049
03:17:20,280 --> 03:17:29,400
christ yeah um well will jeez louise can can can you say anything about the subject I mean okay me

2050
03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:36,920
me and ben are are are totally anti-tune critics yeah yeah we're you're not gonna we're not we're

2051
03:17:36,920 --> 03:17:42,600
not gonna be like we're not jumping to his defense or anything yeah in fact in fact we're we're eager

2052
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:48,600
to throw him under the buns of the very possible opportunity yeah okay so I'd like to say I'd like

2053
03:17:48,600 --> 03:17:54,840
to say this for the record that I'm I'm not doing that tune um I want to I want to put keyframe over

2054
03:17:54,840 --> 03:17:59,800
which is fucking beautiful you know what happened over there no Josh Scorcher and KP went up to

2055
03:17:59,800 --> 03:18:03,000
fucking tune and said you're gonna ditch him or we're not gonna work with you anymore and keyframe

2056
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:07,960
screen Josh Scorcher down wait wait wait wait KP and Josh Scorcher went up to keyframe and said

2057
03:18:08,280 --> 03:18:13,400
went up to tune went up to tune and said you're gonna ditch who me you're not gonna hang out with

2058
03:18:13,400 --> 03:18:17,720
fngr anymore we're not gonna work with you anymore well fucking went up to Josh Scorcher and told him

2059
03:18:17,720 --> 03:18:23,080
to shut the fuck up so so you still you still wanted to to hang out with tune critics no no

2060
03:18:23,080 --> 03:18:29,160
we're still cool this was something later like okay one we'd be here for four more hours two I can't

2061
03:18:29,160 --> 03:18:34,520
talk about oh no there's there's a that's my other problem here is that you don't seem eager to shut

2062
03:18:34,520 --> 03:18:43,000
up about it uh I mean well sorry you know no I got look I got well why don't you I understand why

2063
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:48,360
a lot of other people don't like to critic why don't you like well I mean I just think I mean I guess

2064
03:18:48,360 --> 03:18:52,920
he hasn't done anything to me personally I just think yes I just think he's we're not a fan of

2065
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:57,720
his content yeah we're just not a fan of his content think he's I don't understand what the

2066
03:18:57,720 --> 03:19:02,280
what the hype is there I mean he's not he's definitely not the worst brony yeah like his

2067
03:19:03,080 --> 03:19:06,840
his response to the first video was pretty like diplomatic and like he was like

2068
03:19:06,840 --> 03:19:11,720
he said that he found it funny that we were trash talking him I appreciate that yeah yeah

2069
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:17,000
yeah well like I don't know I mean we don't we don't exactly have a hard you know a hate

2070
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:23,720
boner for him but if I had access to this recording right now I'd be able to show

2071
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:30,200
right where the hate boners showed up well okay okay we're by no we're by no means allies

2072
03:19:30,200 --> 03:19:35,000
but no but like okay but I just because he's in a lot of your videos so I assumed that you

2073
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:40,440
guys were like enemies but you're saying that that's not the case okay he's in two videos

2074
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:46,120
and to the best of my knowledge other than I'm goofing around oh but I think it was fucking

2075
03:19:47,800 --> 03:19:55,160
maybe 41 43 I know I think in 38 where I made the remark there's someone I'm holding back on

2076
03:19:55,160 --> 03:19:59,400
talking about and then I think like two videos later is like okay guess what we're talking about

2077
03:19:59,400 --> 03:20:04,280
that thing today yeah okay yeah Vita put pushed me into that one he's like well come on say something

2078
03:20:04,280 --> 03:20:10,760
here and I'm trying to remember what I already talked about versus what I have to shut up about

2079
03:20:10,760 --> 03:20:15,720
and that's where you have to shut up about everything when you don't remember um well okay I mean

2080
03:20:15,720 --> 03:20:21,800
you you know um this show is a fucking you know like at this point there's no there we can't be

2081
03:20:21,800 --> 03:20:28,520
under any illusion that this is not a drama show whether we like it or not we've thrown our

2082
03:20:28,600 --> 03:20:34,520
hand into the ring uh the the the current the veil has been pulled aside um so yeah I mean I don't

2083
03:20:34,520 --> 03:20:39,320
know if you want to clear any mispossessions now's the time I suppose I'll I'll put it completely

2084
03:20:39,320 --> 03:20:46,920
clear so tune even if Ben and freaking munchy over here offered me procrastinators podcast you

2085
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:54,040
were not going under the bus tune yeah any further than you already have um okay all right well I

2086
03:20:54,120 --> 03:20:58,040
guess that settles there I could I could I could talk about it after we go off air

2087
03:20:59,640 --> 03:21:04,680
want a little nitty gritty of the details that I tell friends and shit which I'm glad to do which

2088
03:21:04,680 --> 03:21:12,120
will be you'll probably be amused by um okay I mean um well I want to switch gears for a second

2089
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:17,560
because uh one of the things because like I said people were talking about it in in uh in my own

2090
03:21:17,560 --> 03:21:23,240
discord I didn't know he had one until now who who I didn't know you had this like a

2091
03:21:23,240 --> 03:21:30,520
pd dramatic of age just now yeah um yeah I did I did some someone I don't know who went and dug

2092
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:37,240
it up but somebody did um so yeah I there's there's video okay this guy named Mr. Meadoker

2093
03:21:37,240 --> 03:21:41,880
would like apparently you got into some to some like okay let me challenge them to a dual

2094
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:47,320
basically like no no no no no let me explain how this happened okay all right no if you have the

2099
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:16,200
commentator by the name of Reno Rhino Mills and I didn't know that much about commentaries

2100
03:22:16,200 --> 03:22:20,760

of those encyclopedia dramaticus too uh made a video where she's like don't shame you know

2109
03:23:03,560 --> 03:23:08,120
and he made a bunch of da videos like making fun of that now I don't have a problem with Jim I even

2110
03:23:08,200 --> 03:23:13,400
got uh fan art done of him I've squashed whatever problems I had but at the time I was like oh wait

2111

2114
03:23:31,480 --> 03:23:36,360
him out and I'm like he responded back to me and he was like look you could bring three of your

2115
03:23:36,440 --> 03:23:41,480
cringy friends on to debate me and I'm like oh I'm gonna he thinks I'm gonna bring brony faggots

backed out like one almost the same day not gonna give the names um fucking thursday two days later

2118
03:23:54,200 --> 03:23:58,360
he made me wait a week I don't know why wait wait I'm curious what exactly was the was the point

2119
03:23:58,360 --> 03:24:04,040
of bringing in commentators to to the debate yeah and he winds you to do that for some reason

2120
03:24:04,040 --> 03:24:08,360
I originally did call him out I was like going oh yeah no I went to go pick a fight because he

2121
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:13,080
was given fucking doodle problem who I'm not really even friends with especially not now um

2122
03:24:14,040 --> 03:24:18,680
and then basically after like I lost my second person the only other person that was coming

2123
03:24:18,680 --> 03:24:24,920
with him was doodle who I'm not really friends with and I said I'm out okay they they they

2124
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:28,840
roasted me for two weeks and I'm not gonna call it harassment because I turned to Jim and I said

2125
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:36,280
and I quote hit me as hard as you can and to the best of my knowledge off the tip of my head he

2126
03:24:36,280 --> 03:24:41,720
didn't break any laws he shouldn't be thrown off a youtube nobody harassed Jim I watch his

2127
03:24:41,720 --> 03:24:45,400
shit today he makes fun of fucking um that guy with the glasses he has a series on that and it's

2128
03:24:45,400 --> 03:24:51,960
beautiful nobody tears down and by the way it's Medeker nobody tears down fucking Doug Walker

2129
03:24:52,040 --> 03:24:56,840
as beautifully and eloquently as fucking Medeker does his fucking videos on like

2130
03:24:57,720 --> 03:25:02,280
they're they're they're a trip fucking absolutely put him in my top 10 favorite youtubers okay

2131
03:25:02,280 --> 03:25:08,120
but yeah no I I got involved in something I shouldn't have um and that went sideways for me

2132
03:25:08,120 --> 03:25:15,640
that's it well but why why did you ultimately decide not to go not to I saw people who were

2133
03:25:15,640 --> 03:25:21,240
better at debate than me fuck off and I was like hmm this is a bad idea my common sense

2134
03:25:21,240 --> 03:25:30,920
is tingling yeah uh yeah yeah I mean that's understandable like I don't know um I can't

2135
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:40,120
say I blame you I stuck my dick in a bear trap and I got nipped clipped at the tip that's my fault

2136
03:25:40,120 --> 03:25:47,720
it happened absolutely okay have a good laugh if you want to if you want to link Medeker's video

2151
03:27:11,400 --> 03:27:16,040
time she was dating her to brony she was kind of screwing around with dark edge um all I knew

2152
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:22,920
is as I was single she seemed fun and I've always said that about fallen she's a very fun person

2153
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:29,320
not perfect but she's a fun person to hang out with um ironically enough I was sitting next to her

trying to put the move on her she shot me down the same time that I was showing her uh ciders

saying that okay you were not you were not dating uh what's her name until now okay now since you

2164
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:26,920
so so so so so so so when mr. Medecker says so when mr. Medecker says that you were cucked at

2165
03:28:26,920 --> 03:28:31,640
brony con that's a mischaracterization of what actually happened absolutely didn't happen this

2166
03:28:31,640 --> 03:28:36,760
is I will look if you want to press this I'll go this far did fallen wish start to cheat on me and

2167
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:40,520
they get the gentleman's name is the director at one point in time yes the relationship lasted

2168
03:28:40,520 --> 03:28:46,440
I think about two weeks the wait wait who who's do I know this person this other person this director

2169
03:28:46,440 --> 03:28:51,720
you could look it up if you want to but he's just some animator oh okay I never heard yeah I'm not

2170
03:28:51,720 --> 03:28:57,400
looking to come down on fallen wish I have my own personal opinions on that I I mean what really got

2171
03:28:57,400 --> 03:29:03,320
me was was because like I mean I don't know tune critic but like just from his public image like

2172
03:29:03,320 --> 03:29:08,920
I've seen him around and just imagining the okay apparently that's not how it actually went down but

2173
03:29:08,920 --> 03:29:14,840
but the situation described by mr. Medecker imagining imagining tune critic in that scenario

2174
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:19,640
would just blew my fucking mind so I had I had to fucking get I had to fucking get the scoop

2175
03:29:19,640 --> 03:29:25,560
all right so let me let me ask you a question yeah and are you are you a skeptic like in like about

2176
03:29:25,560 --> 03:29:32,600
like god are you even god no no no no no no no no no no no are you critical of when you hear

2177
03:29:32,600 --> 03:29:38,280
bullshit uh I like to think so yeah okay so let's let me please spend this to you yeah five of the

2178
03:29:38,280 --> 03:29:45,240
ugliest bronies in the community yeah got together and got laid okay there is no actual proof of this

2179
03:29:45,240 --> 03:29:50,120
other than corporal and brony a man who hasn't seen his penis in years oh right they did there was

2180
03:29:50,120 --> 03:29:57,720
something about an orgy all right so yes no I the two women in that group I won't go into specific

2181
03:29:57,720 --> 03:30:02,360
details okay I don't you wouldn't look at any of these people and think orgy when you saw them okay

2182
03:30:02,360 --> 03:30:09,000
sure yeah no yeah no I'm being dead seriously I understood no I I understand I know I know maybe

2183
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:13,480
you did maybe it did but here's the whole thing if everybody's like if you're skeptical and critical

2184
03:30:13,480 --> 03:30:18,760
what I was heard that basically I winded up going back to my fucking goddamn hotel we walked back

2185
03:30:18,760 --> 03:30:24,520
with stardust and eliora and then supposedly allegedly an orgy broke out on minty root's

2186
03:30:24,520 --> 03:30:30,280
bed where he wasn't invited to come into the room wait wait wait wait wait they I don't know who

2187
03:30:30,280 --> 03:30:36,200
minty roots is but it was supposedly in his bed and he was not allowed in no that's allegedly

2188
03:30:36,200 --> 03:30:41,880
allegedly what happened allegedly what happened according according to some unverifiable sources

2189
03:30:42,600 --> 03:30:48,360
yes okay um uh that's that that's all fine and and weird and odd

2190
03:30:49,080 --> 03:30:53,880
I just I just see I mean because I know because I know that I can't trust I know that I can't

2191
03:30:53,880 --> 03:30:58,680
trust in psych I can't take encyclopedia dramatic at face value I can't take what Mr. Medecker says

2192
03:30:58,680 --> 03:31:04,200
at face value so I yes I am a skeptic so I needed I wanted to hear it from the horse's mouth yeah

2193
03:31:04,200 --> 03:31:08,440
you could you could do better than that yeah tune and fall wish don't like each other like at all

2194
03:31:08,680 --> 03:31:16,440
yeah they've never dated um yeah I mean it's possible I suppose okay this is like a page

2195
03:31:16,440 --> 03:31:22,600
dramatic a page is very odd uh it says something about like like sock puppet accounts is that

2196
03:31:22,600 --> 03:31:27,480
is that a real thing that is occurring do I have multiple accounts I have analysis daily I

2197
03:31:27,480 --> 03:31:30,840
fend in frenzy and have a bunch of other I have an antineagular account on youtube yes I have

2198
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:36,680
multiple accounts on youtube okay jessie woodhead how many accounts I have I have multiple accounts

2199
03:31:37,960 --> 03:31:46,280
that is true yeah um yeah okay perfect perfect so yeah um well geez um you know man um sorry to

2200
03:31:46,280 --> 03:31:49,960
put you on sorry to put you on the spot there's there's nothing to put off here I'll explain this

2201
03:31:49,960 --> 03:31:55,000
to you but we got you we got you here and so no no I want to make an I used to screw with my friends

2202
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:58,760
like Sheldon used to worship jessie wood so you know what I changed the name on one of the accounts

2203
03:31:58,760 --> 03:32:05,000
to jessie wood and posted he's like oh my god jessie wood just commented on the pony I remember

2204
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:11,320
when Sheldon fake donated five thousand dollars to jessie's patreon I remember that happening

2205
03:32:12,200 --> 03:32:19,240
he was okay to be fair he was he did have hodge okay he said he had hodgekin lin

2206
03:32:19,880 --> 03:32:25,080
yeah I remember he had cancer of some kind hodgekins lymphoma stage three which sounds

2207
03:32:25,080 --> 03:32:33,240
very serious he's the one who said that it had a 60 percent uh 65 a decent uh chance to survive

2208
03:32:33,240 --> 03:32:39,880
yeah and what I said to jessie at the time was well look it's his 60 percent that's that's wonderful

2209
03:32:39,880 --> 03:32:45,560
odds at a casino not what I want on my life oh sure but I don't understand why that many had to go

2210
03:32:45,560 --> 03:32:50,120
and fuck with with jessie and okay no no I'll explain what Sheldon's thing is that he would

2211
03:32:50,120 --> 03:32:54,120
mention he's like look man I might be dying do you think he'd be able to come on my podcast and

2212
03:32:54,200 --> 03:32:57,960
he said that jessie said sure and he kept putting them off and he kept putting them off and

2213
03:32:58,680 --> 03:33:03,800
you know on chemo you he said he was very suicidal and he's like look I'm just going to get him on

2214
03:33:04,360 --> 03:33:08,360
now you could say that that's rude or not but that was a really dark place that he's in

2215
03:33:08,360 --> 03:33:12,200
look if you want to hate Sheldon we're not friends right now I don't I don't really hate Sheldon

2216
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:16,040
but I do remember this one thing as like a kind of a shitty thing that went down

2217
03:33:16,680 --> 03:33:21,560
oh yeah no it was a shitty thing I didn't know so are you saying that he did it as like kind of a

2218
03:33:21,560 --> 03:33:27,080
way to get jessie to be on his podcast or something like that jessie had agreed and yeah he was dying

2219
03:33:27,080 --> 03:33:33,800
suppose well he was in the realm of highly reasonably likely to be fatal did he how do you do

2220
03:33:33,800 --> 03:33:39,160
did he like beat it is he still sick he beat it okay well cool that was like two years ago three

2221
03:33:39,160 --> 03:33:44,440
years ago yeah yeah well I'm glad I'm glad to hear that now I remember basically when they were giving

2222
03:33:44,440 --> 03:33:48,520
me a hard time and I was like oh well you're a legit cancer and then they're like oh Vita's like

2223
03:33:48,520 --> 03:33:54,680
that's too far yeah show show me a medical report if you want to be like this prove to me that he

2224
03:33:54,680 --> 03:34:01,240
had cancer and that's where I became the bad guy yeah which I'll admit was a dick move but they were

2225
03:34:01,240 --> 03:34:07,560
pushing me don't do that I mean you know I'm glad I'm glad he I'm glad you know bounce back yeah

2226
03:34:07,560 --> 03:34:13,000
for sure um yeah I have a lot of cancer in my family so you know um hopefully I don't get cancer too

2227
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:19,240
bad I just get a like a light case of the cancer yeah the good the shield and kind

2228
03:34:26,200 --> 03:34:31,320
um I want I want to go back this it says you have like 2000 sock puppet accounts no

2229
03:34:33,400 --> 03:34:38,440

2264
03:37:55,880 --> 03:38:00,840
stretching the truth and like lies and shit I guess um I don't have it open up in front of me

uh well here fucking take it bro um I don't know all right fine I'll look it up on

2266
03:38:11,640 --> 03:38:16,920
yeah here um yeah this this seems this seems like a lot of taut tall tales to me

2267
03:38:18,520 --> 03:38:25,480
they also mention they describe like Vita as like some like undercover like spy for your

2268
03:38:25,480 --> 03:38:34,360
fucking group he did run interference but during the medica bullshit he was completely on my side

2269
03:38:34,360 --> 03:38:39,080
for the longest time um when I broke ties with the pfc he sided with me so no there was a lot of

2270
03:38:39,080 --> 03:38:43,240
times where Vita was super cool with me I'm not going to rewrite history just because you know he's

2271
03:38:43,240 --> 03:38:48,200
a dick now yeah there was a lot of times he was cool and he left the fucking the people I was with

2272
03:38:48,200 --> 03:38:52,200
for better I don't know yeah I don't know if you want to describe as he's a dick now more like he's

2273
03:38:52,280 --> 03:39:00,280
like he wasn't a dick to me okay okay he's like uh he's very easily to switch alliances

2274
03:39:00,280 --> 03:39:07,880
in very awkward ways you can see it took a while yeah okay um yeah I'll look a proper name one

2275
03:39:07,880 --> 03:39:14,200
sec yeah of course take as long as you need um I'm glad I'm glad we can clear this all up I mean

2276
03:39:14,200 --> 03:39:19,240
I mean this there's probably more than you bargained for but I'm glad you came oh no it's I was I was

2277
03:39:19,240 --> 03:39:24,040
like what I was hope was concerned about I was like I hope Ben isn't screaming at me the whole time

2281
03:39:48,520 --> 03:39:53,240
know if there's anything more to say about it really I'm having trouble freaking pulling it up on my

let me just fucking my my wife loves these wicker balls we've got a room full of them at home uh okay

2365
03:48:21,160 --> 03:48:29,560
by the way I'm really glad that we um that that that we legitimately just fucking like

2366
03:48:29,560 --> 03:48:37,720
played our video again yeah our video of his video like this is this this is a video of us

2367
03:48:37,720 --> 03:48:44,200
watching our old video about his video which features his video about our previous video

2368
03:48:44,200 --> 03:48:50,680
we're four layers deep and we're only getting deeper yeah um yeah fucking good stuff good stuff

2369
03:48:50,680 --> 03:48:56,040
I was I was really surprised how like admin he was about everything like like he didn't he didn't

2370
03:48:56,040 --> 03:49:01,160
back down about anything and I and I guess that's I I told I misjudged him I was I was afraid he was

2371
03:49:01,160 --> 03:49:06,120
going to you know fumble which which I which I guess he did a little bit but you but you know what

2372
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:15,400
you know what I guess it can't be two it can't be two I am man I still hate him though oh he's

2373
03:49:15,400 --> 03:49:21,400
he's terrible he's the worst um no no mercy yeah no mercy all right you want to you want to jump

2374
03:49:21,400 --> 03:49:25,880
into missanthopony yeah yeah by the way do you do you believe that the two great stuff happens

2375
03:49:25,880 --> 03:49:33,400
I totally do like like like his his language during that was totally like I if not that something

2376
03:49:33,400 --> 03:49:39,800
happened something definitely I mean the fact that it's framed as an orgy makes it sound like

2377
03:49:39,800 --> 03:49:47,080
someone just like being deliberately salacious with their rumor mongering so but yes something

2378
03:49:47,080 --> 03:49:52,600
almost for for it to have gotten any traction something definitely must have happened but

2379
03:49:53,720 --> 03:49:59,160
I was looking at I was looking at the um oh fuck did you did you link the uh the encyclopedia

2380
03:49:59,240 --> 03:50:08,920
Dramatica yeah yes I did okay um I was looking at a document uh that was linked at the bottom

2381
03:50:08,920 --> 03:50:18,040
it was like a uh the horse news article about fallen wish and let me let me control f for tune

2382
03:50:18,040 --> 03:50:25,880
critic I do that every single day of my life on every page I don't even see him mentioned here

2383
03:50:26,520 --> 03:50:33,960
so I don't know so now now I'm just curious what tune critics relation to this orgy is

2384
03:50:33,960 --> 03:50:43,080
do you believe that he that he wasn't dating her at the time um I believe due to my my my my

2385
03:50:43,080 --> 03:50:48,680
priviness to this sort of situation I believe they must have been communicating in a somewhat

2386
03:50:48,680 --> 03:50:53,720
lascivious way yeah I don't know if he was specifically dating her though I I totally

2387
03:50:53,880 --> 03:50:59,640
believe that he was quote unquote cucked yeah absolutely absolutely maybe he was like courting

2388
03:50:59,640 --> 03:51:04,280
her at the time yeah something like that like they weren't official but he was trying to get some and

2389
03:51:04,280 --> 03:51:10,680
then fucking to oh but you know I didn't realize that fngr was at brony con he was at this brony

2390
03:51:10,680 --> 03:51:16,200
yeah yeah I thought like it's he was somewhere else and this happened like no he was fucking there

2391
03:51:16,200 --> 03:51:25,880
and then this this this vague event occurred uh so that's pretty cool pretty great pretty what yeah

2392
03:51:25,880 --> 03:51:30,520
it's pretty good all right I'm pretty satisfied I'm pretty satisfied yeah yeah I'm pretty good

2400
03:52:21,720 --> 03:52:26,120
I did not think that we like originally I did not think we were going to do like an entire

2401
03:52:26,120 --> 03:52:30,520
thing about it because um I didn't know if we had enough to say is it so so misanthropone if you're

2406
03:52:57,160 --> 03:53:02,360
acknowledging this so that we can so that it can be over because yeah because I'm I'm tired of it

03:53:02,360 --> 03:53:07,080
I'm tired of it yeah yeah and like you don't get to have the last say in the matter since since he

03:53:07,080 --> 03:53:12,440
since he started it yeah I'll you know I'm I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not doing this to be

2415
03:53:49,160 --> 03:53:52,440
perhaps this video game will provide much needed interests

2416
03:53:57,240 --> 03:53:58,280
oh there's box okay

2417
03:54:08,200 --> 03:54:08,680

03:54:31,640 --> 03:54:35,400
let's fucking get these video game tunes pump in

2421
03:54:35,400 --> 03:54:48,840
the game is the game does a pretty good job of like when it wants something specific to happen

2422
03:54:48,840 --> 03:54:53,320
it it railroads you the way where it needs you to go that makes me out I bit my tongue

2424
03:54:58,600 --> 03:55:00,440
things up I really thought I fucked things up

2425
03:55:06,040 --> 03:55:09,640
I really thought that I fucked things up when I restarted the game and I didn't have the

2426
03:55:10,760 --> 03:55:16,920
what you call it I didn't have the sword but of course that was just me being confused because

2427
03:55:16,920 --> 03:55:21,960
as a matter of fact the sword was in my stockpile the whole time this game fucking rules

2428
03:55:22,920 --> 03:55:28,840
uh I I'm really hoping to finish it this video because I kind of don't want another video on

2433
03:55:57,480 --> 03:56:05,080

2434
03:56:05,640 --> 03:56:16,360
if at all possible oh there's a secret thing uh yeah yeah well I'll tell you what if it if we

04:01:14,120 --> 04:01:16,760
this is this is how beard physics work

2476
04:01:17,320 --> 04:01:26,840
I think I did pretty all right I don't know if you heard or if you saw

2477
04:01:27,800 --> 04:01:35,160
but the other day on Twitter I was very impressed with your looks at the fair at the carnival

2478
04:01:35,160 --> 04:01:41,160
I did see that I did yeah I liked that tweet um yeah it was nice yeah approaching approaching a

2479
04:01:42,120 --> 04:01:46,600
conventional I voted Q&A levels of conventional attractiveness or something along

2480
04:01:46,680 --> 04:01:52,200
yeah yeah something along those lines you're really doing you're really becoming you're

2481
04:01:52,200 --> 04:01:57,720
approaching conventionality yeah every this is what I'm like every every like six months or so

2482
04:01:57,720 --> 04:02:02,680
I'll I'll cut my own hair just because it's gotten too long and I'm sick of it and uh I did that

2483
04:02:02,680 --> 04:02:08,120
recently and uh you know so for a while I've got the uh I look like a normal human being

2484
04:02:09,160 --> 04:02:14,280
as as I described uh in the real friend initiative you look you had like medieval

2485
04:02:14,280 --> 04:02:18,200
poet hair and whenever and whenever you were in the room and I saw you I just like you're gonna

2486
04:02:18,200 --> 04:02:25,320
dance around and act like the bard you are yeah um I that actually made me miss the hair quite a bit

2487
04:02:25,320 --> 04:02:31,400
because I was like dammit I didn't capitalize on the on the bard look yeah you you were you were

2488
04:02:31,400 --> 04:02:40,200
definitely bardish yeah you resembled you resembled a bard in in in most ways in in on every level

2489
04:02:40,200 --> 04:02:52,120
including this in looks as well as demeanor yeah god dammit upsetting this is so goddamn hard

2490
04:02:52,120 --> 04:02:57,480
whenever you're on recording and there's discord open I get so fucking scared you had you had just

2493
04:03:08,600 --> 04:03:13,720
I would never edit anything here here or anywhere else

2494
04:03:16,040 --> 04:03:18,920
I did it I fucking did it

2495
04:03:19,400 --> 04:03:22,120

2496
04:03:28,200 --> 04:03:33,160

2500
04:03:55,800 --> 04:04:02,440
uh all right I'm glad we're clear how long does this go on for I don't know I hope it's over soon

2501
04:04:03,160 --> 04:04:09,800
it's oversight it's welcome it it really is I mean maybe I'm missing something

2502
04:04:12,680 --> 04:04:16,600
because like in in the in the toaster game there was like a secret thing that I had to do

2503
04:04:17,400 --> 04:04:24,120
to um you know to find to find that item which was like the real point of the game so I'm assuming

2504
04:04:24,120 --> 04:04:31,480
I'm supposed to get some kind of item from this um can I just like cut I just cut up his nose with

2505
04:04:31,480 --> 04:04:36,280
the uh with the razor that's good that's I'm probably on the right track so far you've done a

2506
04:04:36,280 --> 04:04:40,120
terrible job but the game is exceptionist I think it's just going forever until you like fuck with

2507
04:04:40,120 --> 04:04:52,360
them somehow I mean unfortunate look at tiny obama back there

2508
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:59,800
oh I got it oh oh oh there you there you go okay I just had to fucking

2509
04:05:01,400 --> 04:05:04,440
you wake with a start what a strange dream

2510
04:05:06,440 --> 04:05:11,160
dear god once I dreamt I was president obama I was conscious only of my happiness as president

2511
04:05:11,160 --> 04:05:15,400
obama unaware that I was myself now I do not know whether I was then a fairy dreaming I was president

2512
04:05:15,400 --> 04:05:21,480
obama or whether I'm now president obama dreaming I am a fairy yeah that's well that's life

2513
04:05:22,360 --> 04:05:29,240
they're gonna have to update this game sooner or later oh did you see that yeah

2514
04:05:33,000 --> 04:05:35,560
how odd how odd uh

2515
04:05:41,240 --> 04:05:47,480

04:08:43,400 --> 04:08:48,840
there we let our fucking crony friends um ruin the entire video by being incredibly

2542
04:08:48,840 --> 04:08:53,400
unenthusiastic and bored and tired uh one of them specifically because he woke up at

2543
04:08:53,400 --> 04:09:00,760
fucking at at at 4 a.m local time um great a good good good time well time for him

2545
04:09:08,760 --> 04:09:15,560
let's go ahead let's go ahead and put I I think I think this is really we have a couple more tricks

2546
04:09:15,560 --> 04:09:21,000
up our sleeves you know we're always looking we're always looking to you know be to be a

2547
04:09:21,000 --> 04:09:25,000
trickster and to be and to be a prankster but I think this is one of the last performances

2548
04:09:25,000 --> 04:09:30,440
we're gonna we're gonna give together I feel in my bones um you want to break up the band

2549
04:09:30,440 --> 04:09:35,240
you want to break up the band lunchy um I'm I'm I'm not saying that I'm just saying you know

2550
04:09:35,240 --> 04:09:39,560
I I feel I feel I feel I feel like I feel like we've overstayed our welcome I feel like we've

2551
04:09:39,560 --> 04:09:44,440
I feel like we've accomplished what we sad to do and and and to prolong our existence any longer

2552
04:09:44,440 --> 04:09:49,640
would it would just be would just be dishonest to our original goal sure yeah I mean I'm all about

2553
04:09:50,200 --> 04:09:55,000
I want to mean like like the integrity of the rowdy fuckers brand needs to be maintained above all

2554
04:09:55,000 --> 04:09:59,800
above all else even even if maintaining that integrity means destroying the entire operation

2555
04:09:59,800 --> 04:10:09,320
and pulling the yeah yeah yeah I'll stand by that um um so so phantom yeah this this is the

2556
04:10:09,320 --> 04:10:14,120

been killing cops well i mean we have we have that that's neither here nor there yeah we are

2583
04:13:19,480 --> 04:13:25,320
actually in charge of the entire police force and we're ready to we're not we're not killers of cops

2584
04:13:25,320 --> 04:13:31,480
we're cops who are killers yes yeah and we are killers of cops but but but again yeah it works

2585
04:13:31,720 --> 04:13:39,320
it works both ways yeah we're the true neutral of of the brawny nautz community here on tba we're

2586
04:13:39,320 --> 04:13:48,040
the true neutral um are you ready are you ready uh phantom i am ready i'm ready to uh put this to

2588
04:13:54,040 --> 04:13:59,800
sleeps go bed uh here we go certain stuff and i need to get back on track but there's something

2589
04:13:59,800 --> 04:14:04,920
that i want to bring proper closure to and i want to get the closure out before too long

2590
04:14:04,920 --> 04:14:10,840
months ago there was a certain fallout between me and ben saint and to say that i was upset about it

2591
04:14:10,840 --> 04:14:16,520
is an understatement let's just say things were said and it got me real riled up and i felt like

2592
04:14:16,520 --> 04:14:21,480
that it was something that needed to be addressed but looking back at it now i figured that it was

2593
04:14:21,480 --> 04:14:29,640
not the best way to handle this situation i think it oh okay okay well yeah okay well to

2594
04:14:29,640 --> 04:14:36,600
phrase it like that implies that you and this this beautiful beautiful star child this this this

2595
04:14:36,600 --> 04:14:44,120
indigo child this this this pure this purely elated fucking gentleman um on a cosmic level

2596
04:14:44,120 --> 04:14:49,720
where i don't know pals or something to see there's like a falling out when really we just made

2597
04:14:49,720 --> 04:14:54,120
a funny video well yeah yeah there was no there was no falling out there was just

2598
04:14:54,920 --> 04:15:01,880
this guy who i do not care about even the tiniest bit getting mad at us like he got it was him

2599
04:15:01,880 --> 04:15:10,120
getting mad it was not this was not like a breakup of the brain trust mm-hmm yeah and and you know

2600
04:15:10,120 --> 04:15:16,040
it's good it's good you've learned from your mistakes yeah for the a thousandth time yeah but

2601
04:15:16,040 --> 04:15:22,040
you know don't don't don't pin this on us bro don't don't don't don't don't don't try and say

2602
04:15:23,160 --> 04:15:30,040
that we we were equally at fault here um we would have never fucking even i don't think we even knew

2603
04:15:30,040 --> 04:15:38,040
who ms antherpony was in our original video uh i i did not know about him i i i had seen him around

2604
04:15:38,040 --> 04:15:41,960
well well i knew about him because he had pissed off we're not pissed off mage because he had

2605
04:15:41,960 --> 04:15:47,800
fucked with mage in the past and she was real sad about it for a while really yeah yeah she was uh

2606
04:15:48,840 --> 04:15:53,880
yeah she was really bothered by some shit map was saying about her uh and i guess and i guess

2607
04:15:54,520 --> 04:16:01,560
map is uh sorry about all that which is fine and and for the record uh we do not speak for mage

2608
04:16:01,560 --> 04:16:07,960
we speak purely for ourselves here and you're saying that we uh are uh not friends with you

2609
04:16:08,920 --> 04:16:17,640
i don't know how mage feels now yeah um um i'm sure she is benevolent yeah as she always is yeah

2610
04:16:18,520 --> 04:16:23,720
was because the main thing that was on my mind was how upset i was over what they said about keyframe

2611
04:16:23,720 --> 04:16:28,920
and it led me to making several errors in the process of that video i thought it was a reasonable

2612
04:16:28,920 --> 04:16:33,560
response at the time but looking back at it now there were plenty of things that i could have

2613
04:16:33,560 --> 04:16:40,360
done differently now keep it sure i mean i don't know i'm i'm i'm glad i'm glad this guy

2614
04:16:40,920 --> 04:16:48,200
is like sorry for being stupid um and like saying that there are errors and i truly am

2615
04:16:48,200 --> 04:16:53,480
appreciative he but i don't know like this is sort of like a like you know things could have been

2616
04:16:53,480 --> 04:17:01,400
better not like i was wrong uh yeah i did not i do not know he he's not quite apologizing well

2617
04:17:01,400 --> 04:17:09,720
well he i think he does apologize for some certain things later on uh but yeah there's a lot of what

2618
04:17:09,720 --> 04:17:15,320
there's a lot of what fngr was doing just before where it's like it's not apologizing it's excuse

2619
04:17:15,320 --> 04:17:21,480
making yeah yeah yeah yeah but like yeah we're not we're not getting we're not getting any apologies

2620
04:17:21,480 --> 04:17:25,560
here we're not being able to cash in any of our apology fund bugs here we're just we're

2621
04:17:25,560 --> 04:17:33,800
going to be taken for a ride exactly and and here and finally to fucking you know we we're not

2622
04:17:33,800 --> 04:17:40,280
probably caught him to fucking freaks around here no never um mind that this video oh what oh no i

2623
04:17:40,280 --> 04:17:47,160
was yeah continue please he's not meant to attack then saint on any level i just he says that now

2624
04:17:47,160 --> 04:17:52,200
but later on there's a couple points about the videos in question and i want to try and do it

2625
04:17:52,200 --> 04:17:57,320
properly and just to ensure that absolutely nothing is blown out of proportion i'm going to

2626
04:17:57,320 --> 04:18:03,240
take this quick vow i swear on the soul of my grandmother that i am not going to get angry

2627
04:18:03,240 --> 04:18:07,560
i'm not going to raise my voice he totally breaks this i will not reply to any comments in a way

2628
04:18:07,560 --> 04:18:12,680
that instigates more fighting and while we're on the subject i would deeply appreciate it if anyone

2629
04:18:12,680 --> 04:18:21,720
who chooses to comment he he says that he's not gonna the comments but i remember like the day

2630
04:18:21,800 --> 04:18:29,480
or like the day after this video came out i saw him being shitty in a comment thread on our video

2631
04:18:30,360 --> 04:18:35,560
so like okay great i'm i'm i don't want to go find the comment right now but i'm extremely

2632
04:18:35,560 --> 04:18:41,480
confident that it was posted at some point so he he yeah you know on this video did the same thing

2633
04:18:41,480 --> 04:18:47,000
i humbly ask that you will not leave any comments that will instigate more fighting this topic is

2634
04:18:47,000 --> 04:18:52,760
going to be controversial enough as it is and i want to keep it contained recently ben saint

2635
04:18:52,760 --> 04:18:58,120
uploaded a video on his old pony channel that he worked on with the best guy ever his brother it's

2636
04:18:58,120 --> 04:19:02,920
basically a follow-up to that first frog fraction video and as you probably guessed it contained a

2637
04:19:02,920 --> 04:19:07,880
response to my previous video on the matter now i'm not saying that ben was wrong to make a response

2638
04:19:07,880 --> 04:19:13,640
to my video he has every right to do that but i do feel there are many many things to address in

2639
04:19:13,640 --> 04:19:20,440
terms of how he and munchie respond to it now i i am i am pretty confident there's gonna be a lot

2640
04:19:20,440 --> 04:19:27,880
of things that we are going to respond to you right now he he gets progressively madder like he

2641
04:19:27,880 --> 04:19:35,720
definitely gets mad in this video or at least at least annoyed at the very least so um fucking let

2642
04:19:35,720 --> 04:19:41,080
let's see the response that they did was literally over an hour long so naturally there's going to

2643
04:19:41,640 --> 04:19:47,320
be a lot to say i'll try not to make it too long as this probably what are we're on they basically

2644
04:19:47,320 --> 04:19:53,560
start off by saying that t-bab was not a commentary series as i put it and i suppose that is correct

2645
04:19:53,560 --> 04:19:58,760
on some level commentaries and reviews are somewhat the same thing since they're both an expression

2646
04:19:58,760 --> 04:20:03,160
of opinion they do i don't know why he's even bothering to talk about saying that it's not

2647
04:20:03,160 --> 04:20:08,920
interesting but it's also unique despite that it is possible for something to be unique but still

2648
04:20:08,920 --> 04:20:13,640
lacking something good it was unique and how different it was from what other people were

2649
04:20:13,640 --> 04:20:19,880
doing at the time but that doesn't always equal interesting i can at least i mean we did have

2650
04:20:19,880 --> 04:20:26,840
some things to say about his criticisms of t-bab so i guess he felt the need to respond to those and

2651
04:20:26,840 --> 04:20:33,000
like explain what he didn't like about t-bab but like yeah who fucking cares you know i mean i don't

2652
04:20:33,000 --> 04:20:38,440
know like it's valid like you know it's valid but like it's really it's really not the point like

2653
04:20:39,080 --> 04:20:45,880
my issues the issues here had nothing to do with t-bab um and i don't know like i i suppose like

2654
04:20:45,880 --> 04:20:52,120
it's true that something can be unique and not good but he was saying that it was interesting so like

2655
04:20:52,120 --> 04:20:57,400
like i don't know like it doesn't have to be good per se you don't have to like t-bab i mean if you

2656
04:20:57,400 --> 04:21:03,960
don't then you're fucking moron yeah you don't have to yeah it's just you know like like like like

2657
04:21:04,120 --> 04:21:09,160
this was this was more unique and interesting than anything else happened in the entire fandom

2658
04:21:09,160 --> 04:21:14,440
at this point so fucking i mean i that's our full point i should think so but you know but

2659
04:21:15,720 --> 04:21:22,360
he says he says more later about like us versus the other brony analysis or something we'll

2660
04:21:22,360 --> 04:21:27,560
fucking get we'll understand like people would be interested in it it just didn't interest me but

2661
04:21:27,560 --> 04:21:32,440
then it gets confusing when they start talking about how complex it was without actually saying

2662
04:21:32,440 --> 04:21:38,520
why it was complex i mean they do say that it has jokes and editing and intros but basically

2663
04:21:38,520 --> 04:21:44,040
everyone had that stuff were they saying that the jokes were complex were the intros complex

2664
04:21:44,040 --> 04:21:49,320
was there something in the editing that was complex i'm just asking what exactly made it so

2665
04:21:50,040 --> 04:21:56,200
yeah yeah in a word yes there really wasn't any complexity to it getting together with a friend

2666
04:21:56,200 --> 04:22:01,240
or a relative and i don't want to oversell the genius of t-bath or anything like it was what it

2667
04:22:02,200 --> 04:22:06,520
placing cartoon caricatures of yourselves on real like especially later like

2668
04:22:07,400 --> 04:22:12,200
like the the fact that he could that he would find other analysis interesting like the fact

2669
04:22:12,200 --> 04:22:16,920
that he would find something like silver quill interesting and then be like oh well t-bap just

2670
04:22:16,920 --> 04:22:23,000
didn't have anything interesting for me like like i don't i i don't understand like and like okay

2671
04:22:23,720 --> 04:22:29,480
like sure at the end of the day you could say like t-bap is about two people talking about

2672
04:22:29,480 --> 04:22:34,120
my little point episode yeah and then a stand a standard reviewer is just a guy talking about my

2673
04:22:34,120 --> 04:22:40,200
little point episode yeah at the core and on paper they are the same yeah but t-bap has so much more

2674
04:22:40,200 --> 04:22:45,640
and first of all you have to account for like like like most my little pony reviewers have very limited

2675
04:22:45,640 --> 04:22:50,520
you know animation and changes in their voice where t-bap is a fucking ton and it's like basically

2676
04:22:50,520 --> 04:22:54,440
every episode there's a new twist there's one where you guys are in fucking like a night armor

2677
04:22:54,440 --> 04:22:58,760
there's one where you guys have like the body of fucking john scene and some black fucking basketball

2678
04:22:59,320 --> 04:23:03,880
yeah yeah yeah um there's crazy shit going on there's the one where we we uh we took those

2679
04:23:03,880 --> 04:23:08,600
cuteness pills and we got the big anime eyes that stayed through the entire video that i really

2680
04:23:08,600 --> 04:23:13,480
like that one um so there's so much shit going on with that aspect of the video not to mention the

2681
04:23:13,480 --> 04:23:20,520
intros which are fucking legendary and more like far and above like better than anything anyone

2682
04:23:20,520 --> 04:23:26,360
else is doing at the time more complex in every way there's that one where you like like like you

2683
04:23:26,360 --> 04:23:31,880
put more effort into this one than the entirety of the brony fandom did are in anywhere combined

2684
04:23:31,880 --> 04:23:36,920
whatsoever where you fucking you you got like fake horse hooves and like try to draw with

2685
04:23:36,920 --> 04:23:41,640
fucking horse hooves on and like spill the ink all over the fucking table and it was in jeans and

2686
04:23:41,640 --> 04:23:46,040
fucking incredible yeah um that's one of my favorite that's one of my favorite things i've

2687
04:23:46,040 --> 04:23:51,560
ever i've ever put on the internet yeah god i just i wish it had i wish i'd had a better camera

2688
04:23:51,560 --> 04:23:57,240
because the quality really sucks but whatever the the point gets across yeah uh yeah so that so

2689
04:23:57,240 --> 04:24:01,080
that's more complex than fucking just record like like just having those interests is that one where

2690
04:24:01,080 --> 04:24:06,280
you like anime and entire like visual novel fucking sequence yeah that one that got taken down

2691
04:24:06,280 --> 04:24:15,800
but it's uh it's back up it's back up now uh yeah um fucking yeah i don't see how you can

2692
04:24:15,800 --> 04:24:23,560
fucking ignore all that and be like oh well uh fucking uh dr wolf and kp and silver quill and

2693
04:24:23,560 --> 04:24:29,320
all these other fucking jabronis oh they all had jokes to fuck off you know well again it's

2694
04:24:29,320 --> 04:24:35,160
about the point like whether or not missanthropony likes tbap is not the point but if he doesn't

2695
04:24:35,160 --> 04:24:42,360
then he's retarded so is our humble opinion is our humble opinion okay but by the way i mean i

2696
04:24:42,360 --> 04:24:47,240
wouldn't even i wouldn't even i wouldn't wait wait sorry go on if evan jaren left the writer

2697
04:24:47,240 --> 04:24:54,840
for example there's boot camp oh good yeah he didn't make the cut he makes the cut yeah um

2698
04:24:54,840 --> 04:25:03,400
it can continue can he like i wouldn't i wouldn't hold it against anyone if they didn't like tbap

2699
04:25:03,400 --> 04:25:08,920
but the fact that he likes he doesn't like tbap but he likes i mean i don't know specifically

2700
04:25:08,920 --> 04:25:14,280
what he likes but i'm i'm just gonna fucking yeah dr wolf silver quill it's et cetera like

2701
04:25:14,280 --> 04:25:21,400
fuck off like jesus fucking christ um basically yeah basically that's how i feel okay screen in front

2702
04:25:21,400 --> 04:25:27,160
of a background and footage of the episode is only going to get you so far also for a series that was

2703
04:25:27,160 --> 04:25:32,600
so complex it really went through a decline in creativity when later reviews were just a boring

2704
04:25:32,600 --> 04:25:39,080
image of a screensaver with the i will agree there sure how stupid it was for him to complain about

2705
04:25:39,080 --> 04:25:45,000
how the video was called frog fractions but most of it was about shit talking people and no i'm still

2706
04:25:45,000 --> 04:25:50,680
not gonna let that go because it is a problem with the way that the video was being presented

2707
04:25:50,680 --> 04:25:56,040
it's a misleading title however you look at it the title is advertising something that isn't the main

2708
04:25:56,040 --> 04:26:00,600
focus of the video or something that's only there for a fraction of the length which comes

2709
04:26:00,600 --> 04:26:06,040
across as misrepresented like what really just annoys me about it is how it's a problem that can

2710
04:26:06,040 --> 04:26:13,560
easily be fit i feel like i feel like he's he's advocating troll movie titles you know yeah yeah

2711
04:26:13,560 --> 04:26:20,200
like like for it not for it to be fully honest the fucking title would have to be like several

2712
04:26:20,200 --> 04:26:26,520
sentences long explaining what we do and obviously that's taken into the stream he would just he would

2713
04:26:26,600 --> 04:26:32,040
just like to be called shaded on bronies and also frog fractions yeah but i don't know just like

2714
04:26:32,920 --> 04:26:38,280
the point of the video is that it blindsides you with fucking like like being this crazy that you

2715
04:26:38,280 --> 04:26:42,840
did not expect and also it what you could tell because we put lightning bless in the fucking

2716
04:26:42,840 --> 04:26:50,760
thumbnail yeah i don't i really i really do not get what the fucking problem is with the fact

2717
04:26:50,760 --> 04:26:57,320
with with with the title like oh my god it's it's it's got some stuff in it that the title didn't

2718
04:26:57,320 --> 04:27:03,800
fucking indicate what what ddo yeah fucking helps at it at the words two friends bitching at ponies

2719
04:27:03,800 --> 04:27:09,080
and the title youtube has something that allows you to do that they themselves said that the video

2720
04:27:09,080 --> 04:27:13,880
should have been split into two parts one on the game and one on them shit talking these people

2721
04:27:15,080 --> 04:27:20,680
i might have said it as a joke like i'm doing this by accident now to be clear i never accused

2722
04:27:20,680 --> 04:27:25,880
them of accidentally doing any of this i can tell that they meant to do all of this random

2723
04:27:25,880 --> 04:27:31,400
shit but because of the title it still feels like a trap it feels like it is a fucking trap it's

2724
04:27:31,400 --> 04:27:40,920
deliberately a trap that's part of the joke yeah i don't know how can he be so mundane and reserved

2725
04:27:40,920 --> 04:27:49,320
and calm when you see big baby boy i know he i mean i don't know he's just got some fucking he's got

2726
04:27:49,320 --> 04:27:55,560
some expectation i don't know i i feel like he's holding us to a higher standard than he would

2727
04:27:55,560 --> 04:28:02,040
for someone else like if someone else like if some vlog channel titled their vlog like uh sucking

2728
04:28:02,040 --> 04:28:08,200
sucking dick on the vegas strip and then like one minute was actually sucking dick yeah and the rest

2729
04:28:08,200 --> 04:28:12,920
is like what they had for breakfast that morning is he got is would he would he fucking complain i

2730
04:28:12,920 --> 04:28:17,640
sincerely doubt it so i don't i don't feel like these are reasonable expectations that he's operating

2731
04:28:17,640 --> 04:28:24,360
under and also that that's that's what like like it could we could make it that but that would be

2732
04:28:24,360 --> 04:28:29,800
way less funny yeah because like it's funny that someone to her click on this thinking it's just

2733
04:28:29,800 --> 04:28:34,200
going to be frog fractions when like a large portion of it isn't frog fractions that doesn't mean

2734
04:28:34,200 --> 04:28:40,760
it's dishonest that just mean that like it adds to the video and also we play frog fractions yeah

2735
04:28:40,760 --> 04:28:46,040
that's that's the game we play what do you want i don't know i don't know what

2736
04:28:46,760 --> 04:28:54,120
fucking would make map happy i don't know yeah i don't know yeah well and a lot of people are

2737
04:28:54,120 --> 04:28:59,720
extremely happy that we did that like yeah but we a lot of our fans love that fucking video they

2738
04:28:59,720 --> 04:29:06,920
love this video series so fucking um if you don't like it well sorry bro he's entitled to his opinion

2739
04:29:06,920 --> 04:29:14,120
but i think it's his opinion is dumb and misses the point and yeah whatever yeah yeah yeah this video

2740
04:29:14,120 --> 04:29:19,320
four hours long but they sidestep the idea of making it about frog fractions and they didn't

2741
04:29:19,320 --> 04:29:23,400
know what they wanted the other four hours of the video to be about it's not like in the other

2742
04:29:23,400 --> 04:29:28,600
rowdy fuckers cop killers we just talked about nuclear throne or whatever yeah yeah which only

2743
04:29:28,600 --> 04:29:34,280
further shows how bad the direction is and another thing about that video is that it just wasn't going

2744
04:29:34,280 --> 04:29:39,640
to be all that encouraging to watch with that ridiculous four hour length there's a reason why

2745
04:29:39,640 --> 04:29:45,160
people okay are now he's just yeah he's making plain assumptions about what our fans want he's

2746
04:29:45,160 --> 04:29:54,200
just like our our fans fucking love long videos this is a fact you you fucking goable fucking

2747
04:29:54,200 --> 04:29:59,800
sack of shit watching this right now not you miss hand they're funny all of our fans you fucking

2748
04:29:59,800 --> 04:30:06,280
eat this shit yeah you've been sitting here for four and a half hours and you're craving more and

2749
04:30:06,280 --> 04:30:12,520
guess what you're gonna get more yeah you're gonna get far more than you could ever fucking want of

2750
04:30:12,520 --> 04:30:19,480
us yeah um and that's and that's what keeps them coming back uh yeah so miss anthroproni our our

2751
04:30:19,480 --> 04:30:25,480
fans are not are not overly consenting but they are actively fucking they are actively pursuing

2752
04:30:25,480 --> 04:30:30,360
they are they are actively they are actively pursuing the most like fucking like mundane

2753
04:30:30,360 --> 04:30:38,120
and fucking long form content humanly possible they watch digi bro yeah these people watch digi bro

2754
04:30:38,120 --> 04:30:45,880
do you understand can you even imagine can you imagine the kind of person um i i frankly can't

2755
04:30:45,880 --> 04:30:52,840
i which is all to say thank you for watching our content i just i feel he's like he's trying to

2756
04:30:52,920 --> 04:30:58,200
offer blanket statements about what a video should be and it's like where do you get off

2757
04:30:58,200 --> 04:31:03,960
where do you get off telling me what this video should be so i'll never i'll never fucking agree

2758
04:31:04,520 --> 04:31:08,760
with anything that he says on the subject of the video's titled wrong the video's too long

2759
04:31:08,760 --> 04:31:13,320
blah blah but no it's the video is exactly what it's supposed to be it's perfect yeah it's

2760
04:31:15,160 --> 04:31:19,640
people break up their videos and departs if the thing they want to talk about is very long

2761
04:31:19,640 --> 04:31:23,880
it gives the audience a chance to collect themselves and be refreshed by the time the next

2762
04:31:23,880 --> 04:31:30,200
part comes out the idea of going through all four hours of that video in one sitting is extremely

2763
04:31:30,200 --> 04:31:36,120
overwhelmed it's no reasonable our video just has a has a high has a low has a high skill floor

2764
04:31:36,120 --> 04:31:41,560
one hour long be it one sitting or giving yourself a break from it every once in a while but quadrupling

2765
04:31:41,560 --> 04:31:47,000
that feels needlessly time consuming he also says that my accusation of his disappearing from the

2766
04:31:47,000 --> 04:31:53,080
fandom were incorrect perhaps that is true but he needs to know that i was a casual viewer of tbap

2767
04:31:53,080 --> 04:31:58,040
around the time okay so i obviously wasn't going to be that encouraged to go through his deviantart

2768
04:31:58,040 --> 04:32:04,280
or his twitter because i wasn't a huge fan of his work he's it's it's there's no denying but yeah

2769
04:32:04,280 --> 04:32:10,600
tbap did stop uploading and i guess i don't even i don't even blame him for saying that i disappeared

2770
04:32:10,600 --> 04:32:14,760
from the fandom like if that's i don't remember what he said in the video but if he said i disappeared

2771
04:32:14,760 --> 04:32:20,360
from the fandom like that's true and uh there's no arguing that he was like you blipped off the

2772
04:32:20,360 --> 04:32:26,760
fucking map with with no fucking rhyme or reason okay well that's if yeah if you're only looking

2773
04:32:26,760 --> 04:32:35,400
at tbap i i guess whatever it's fine nope no big no no big i also wasn't exactly aware of the pcp

2774
04:32:35,400 --> 04:32:40,440
until fairly later on and when i started watching its videos is when i got the idea that ben and

2775
04:32:40,440 --> 04:32:45,800
his brother had retired from mlp reviews i should point out that i did work the two starting their

2776
04:32:45,800 --> 04:32:50,840
own channels in an exaggerated way claiming that they split up but still stayed in contact they

2777
04:32:50,840 --> 04:32:55,640
never actually split up they simply stopped uploading on that channel and i could have worked it that

2778
04:32:55,640 --> 04:33:00,440
better okay there's an instance where he talks about what he thinks is my background in which he

2779
04:33:00,440 --> 04:33:06,040
states that there was a time that i hated jesse wood or drowning in horseshoes now that's not true

2780
04:33:06,120 --> 04:33:10,280
because i never really hated or i don't remember saying that but i'll take his

2781
04:33:10,280 --> 04:33:16,840
word for it during season four and i progressively became a fan of his stuff it did take time for

2782
04:33:16,840 --> 04:33:21,720
me to get used to his content as i was new to his channel but i quickly warmed up to it and really

2783
04:33:21,720 --> 04:33:27,080
got into the way that he reviews the show cool he was and still is a reviewer capable of providing

2784
04:33:27,080 --> 04:33:31,720
thought-provoking analysis breaking down the product in great detail while still injecting it

2785
04:33:31,720 --> 04:33:37,240
with a creative sense of humor he may not be as popular as a lot of the others but to this day

2786
04:33:37,240 --> 04:33:43,000
he's still one of my all-time favorite reviewers of mlp whether he thinks highly of it or not i felt

2787
04:33:43,000 --> 04:33:47,960
that it was necessary to bring this up because the way that he says this line is based on false

2788
04:33:47,960 --> 04:33:53,160
assumption he also states that i was oblivious to the way that he referenced that video that i made

2789
04:33:53,160 --> 04:33:59,000
in one of his pony cast videos i was aware that he was taking a stab at my video and i didn't want

2790
04:33:59,080 --> 04:34:04,360
that to bother me i just wanted to enjoy the video because i do think the man puts out great work

2791
04:34:04,360 --> 04:34:09,720
i will admit though i was very why why why couldn't you just leave us be then

2792
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:17,400
like yeah yeah it's like not just why why why do you have to make a video about us yeah what was

2793
04:34:17,400 --> 04:34:23,400
the point i i don't know why he wouldn't think i mean i'm so happy you did yeah i'm so ecstatic

2794
04:34:23,400 --> 04:34:29,240
that you decided to but from your point of view what did you gain like from like if you want if

2795
04:34:29,240 --> 04:34:36,840
you wanted to stay like if you if you wanted to stay in jesse's good graces like taking taking uh

2796
04:34:36,840 --> 04:34:43,000
you know taking a shit on us isn't isn't gonna help you do that uh but i mean

2797
04:34:45,560 --> 04:34:51,880
i don't know i i guess that's all i have to say yeah uh yeah just just i don't know like if you're

2798
04:34:52,120 --> 04:34:58,280
if you can dismiss that sort of thing which is an admirable trade then fucking where was that

2799
04:34:58,280 --> 04:35:02,920
where's that capability when we released five options one oh yeah yeah yeah oh right you're

2800
04:35:02,920 --> 04:35:09,640
you're saying like why didn't he get mad about jesse uh doing that like like what yeah um i don't

2801
04:35:09,640 --> 04:35:16,440
know yeah good question i guess he just likes jesse more i all right yeah fair enough and how i

2802
04:35:16,440 --> 04:35:21,240
pronounced him not liking burning donut my intention wasn't out of place but the way that i

2803
04:35:21,240 --> 04:35:26,120
said it was it was basically hypocritical of me to state that he was criticizing what someone

2804
04:35:26,120 --> 04:35:31,560
does on the internet when i myself was doing the same thing that first video i did was actually

2805
04:35:31,560 --> 04:35:36,680
unscripted which would explain why i didn't have good direction now when he originally went at

2806
04:35:36,680 --> 04:35:41,960
burning donut he stated that he fucking hates the guy because he's a good artist was able to upload

2807
04:35:41,960 --> 04:35:50,280
on a consistent schedule whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no i did not say i hate him because he's a good

2808
04:35:50,280 --> 04:35:55,720
artist who's able to upload on a consistent schedule there's no fucking way i said that

2809
04:35:57,160 --> 04:36:03,320
yeah that doesn't doesn't sound like your christ isn't okay i said i hated him and like i've said i

2810
04:36:03,320 --> 04:36:10,680
would i did i did not mean that that was i was hard i was hard on burning donut um but i didn't

2811
04:36:10,680 --> 04:36:16,360
say all right let's keep going yeah apparently he doesn't really delve into that much like he

2812
04:36:16,360 --> 04:36:21,400
literally gives us no reason to side with him on how burning donut is a stupid person deserving

2813
04:36:21,400 --> 04:36:26,360
i i explained what was wrong with the patron okay like all i knew about burning donut was how his

2814
04:36:26,360 --> 04:36:33,720
patreon was laid out and it fucking was asinine like i did i did i explain how like his page like

2815
04:36:33,720 --> 04:36:39,560
his top reward was like if you don't if you patron me for $50 you will become a part you will like

2816
04:36:39,560 --> 04:36:46,840
basically fucking write my comic for me yeah and i was like oh my god that's that like not i'm i'm

2817
04:36:46,840 --> 04:36:50,680
walking back what i said about burning donut but i'm not walking back that that is the stupidest

2818
04:36:50,680 --> 04:36:56,120
thing i've ever fucking heard and i think it's asinine and terrible uh it doesn't make burning

2819
04:36:56,120 --> 04:37:03,640
donut a bad person or even a bad artist necessarily um but whatever yeah i think his

2820
04:37:03,720 --> 04:37:09,640
matters patron are still valid it's just that you know yeah yeah yeah i i overstated i overstated

2821
04:37:09,640 --> 04:37:16,040
the the the level of enmity based on it there uh you know i was i was feeling it we were we were

2822
04:37:16,040 --> 04:37:22,360
riffing we were riffing on on dudes and and and you know burning donut got caught up in the crossfire

2823
04:37:22,360 --> 04:37:27,480
a little bit you know uh there was some collateral damage you know i could make i should make some

2824
04:37:27,480 --> 04:37:32,600
reparations and i might and i'm making them now yeah brain don't if you're watching this please

2825
04:37:32,600 --> 04:37:43,240
fix your page yeah i guess um yeah god anyway except that the two have different ways of

2826
04:37:43,240 --> 04:37:48,440
constructing their patreon if you need further context on this don't not recently made a video

2827
04:37:48,440 --> 04:37:53,240
with a portion talking about what exactly was wrong with ben's criticisms towards him then

2828
04:37:53,240 --> 04:37:58,040
might have stated in the newer video that he was too harsh on him but he doesn't do it oh did i already

2829
04:37:58,040 --> 04:38:03,320
say that and his ego boasting during that segment still feels really grating i admit again that the

2830
04:38:03,320 --> 04:38:08,200
way i worded that part of my video was wrong but burning donut does point out a lot of like

2831
04:38:08,840 --> 04:38:16,120
stupid nitpicks that we made like like when i like i i said like because it said listening to

2832
04:38:16,120 --> 04:38:21,080
and he put suicidal tendencies so i thought he was being emo and be like oh i'm listening to my own

2833
04:38:21,080 --> 04:38:27,000
suicidal tendencies turns out no that's a band so i'm just an idiot okay okay so there was a couple

2834
04:38:27,000 --> 04:38:31,960
of there was a couple of things like that that it's like you know it's not really it's not really

2835
04:38:31,960 --> 04:38:37,880
the main point but there were mistakes remain but nevermind nevermind but that doesn't make

2836
04:38:37,880 --> 04:38:43,720
what ben did above criticism he gave us no reason to justify him dissing burning donut except for

2837
04:38:43,720 --> 04:38:48,840
the patreon thing which even in itself isn't really valid evidence and even though what wasn't

2838
04:38:48,840 --> 04:38:53,880
really mentioned in the new video it still really bothers me how he thinks it's not evidence of a

2839
04:38:53,880 --> 04:38:58,840
larger crime it just is dumb on its own they were making more money than him b they were

2840
04:38:58,840 --> 04:39:04,040
making money at all or c he thinks these people are below him and don't deserve support for what

2841
04:39:04,040 --> 04:39:09,640
they do even if he does think he's better than a lot of these people it's still very condescending

2842
04:39:09,640 --> 04:39:15,080
how he actually puts time into explaining it in such visceral detail he complains about the

2843
04:39:15,800 --> 04:39:20,280
these people expressing their talents and making a living off of them which is not only selfish

2844
04:39:20,280 --> 04:39:25,960
but pointlessly childish now it was really misleading on my end to say that ben saint was

2845
04:39:25,960 --> 04:39:30,520
talking about these people like he didn't know any of them because he was very involved in the

2846
04:39:30,520 --> 04:39:35,720
community before i was even a part of it i did know beforehand that he was associated with these

2847
04:39:35,720 --> 04:39:40,440
people and that he even did a couple of panels with them i also know that he argued with josh

2848
04:39:40,440 --> 04:39:45,160
for hours over the pinky wrap which was actually what caused them to leave the original rinse

2849
04:39:45,160 --> 04:39:50,440
but the ways he complains about them well did i did i talk about that no i have no idea what he's

2850
04:39:50,440 --> 04:39:55,320
talking about that sounds incredible well do you remember that i forget i remember the stupid

2851
04:39:55,320 --> 04:39:59,400
fucking nineties pinky wrap and fucking that one where rambodash has like downstairs or which

2852
04:40:00,920 --> 04:40:07,880
yeah yeah well i really liked that part and yeah and yeah because it was because they really went

2853
04:40:07,880 --> 04:40:15,080
all out with like the the fucking the vhs the vhs effects and like the screen uh this what's

2854
04:40:15,080 --> 04:40:20,040
the screen resolution like they really sold that this is like a nineties wrap video and i

2855
04:40:20,040 --> 04:40:25,160
thought it was really great and josh comes and josh comes fucking wandering into the rift cafe

2856
04:40:25,160 --> 04:40:31,400
where all the cool bronies hang out and he just has a fucking problem with it he thinks it's he

2857
04:40:32,040 --> 04:40:36,520
you know he he calls it he called it cringy and then like would not elaborate

2858
04:40:36,520 --> 04:40:41,160
like he had no reason for calling it and i fucking yeah i picked a fucking fight with him over it

2859
04:40:43,800 --> 04:40:47,560
i don't remember if that is exactly what i left the rift for it might have been

2860
04:40:48,120 --> 04:40:53,400
but i mean i wouldn't have just left over that like i left because that happened and i already

2861
04:40:53,400 --> 04:40:58,440
thought it was a retarded thing anyway that was like the straw that broke the camel's back

2862
04:40:59,000 --> 04:41:07,880
bin yeah i want to do like a real t-bap one day yeah i want i want to watch my little pony with

04:42:21,720 --> 04:42:31,480
be seven hours long uh i didn't realize our our our our longest one was only like four four and

2874
04:42:31,480 --> 04:42:36,840
some hours so this might actually be the longest one we've ever done um that's fine yeah yeah yeah

2875
04:42:36,840 --> 04:42:41,800
yeah i'm push the push the limit i mean i mean i mean i mean you know missy other probably isn't

2876
04:42:41,800 --> 04:42:47,000
going to be able to watch the entire thing but you know yeah you know we we have we have a higher

2877
04:42:47,000 --> 04:42:54,360
skill floor we we we we we catered to wales you don't cater to the cater to wales yeah yeah yeah

2878
04:42:54,360 --> 04:43:00,040
that's true um all right you you ready should we go yeah yeah yeah go ahead mention any personal

2879
04:43:00,040 --> 04:43:05,320
experiences with the guy he doesn't even scroll down slow enough to even look at anything that was

2880
04:43:05,400 --> 04:43:10,600
on his page he just says that he wants to destroy the website which at this point really wouldn't

2881
04:43:10,600 --> 04:43:16,440
faze anyone and a lot of the segments he does in that first video are like this he knows several

2882
04:43:16,440 --> 04:43:21,320
of these people but he doesn't talk about any personal experiences he had with them and even

2883
04:43:21,320 --> 04:43:26,760
when he comes close to talking about something like that it's only more immature banter there's

2884
04:43:26,760 --> 04:43:32,040
no real earnesty to any of the ways he complains about these people i don't these are what these

2885
04:43:32,040 --> 04:43:39,720
are vague these are vague complaints like i he he doesn't talk about them but he kind of does

2886
04:43:39,720 --> 04:43:47,480
but when he does it's just immature banter so it doesn't count yeah it's i he's trying to be vague

2887
04:43:47,480 --> 04:43:54,120
so we can't pull it apart because i guess what he's saying is like technically true on some level

2888
04:43:54,120 --> 04:43:59,400
though mischaracterized and phrased weirdly to the point where i don't feel comfortable accepting

2889
04:44:00,360 --> 04:44:04,120
no i don't feel like he's really saying anything i feel like he's dancing around

2890
04:44:05,640 --> 04:44:10,680
because as we stated he doesn't care about this if this was just if these are the only

2891
04:44:10,680 --> 04:44:14,600
problems with the video he would not care here's about one thing specifically and we will get to

2892
04:44:14,600 --> 04:44:21,560
that later yeah um yeah it just feels like excuses for bitching as for using the rift website for

2893
04:44:21,560 --> 04:44:26,200
making points on these people there actually is an instance where me saying ben talks about

2894
04:44:26,280 --> 04:44:30,600
these people like he doesn't know them at all is correct yeah and that woman comes from him

2895
04:44:30,600 --> 04:44:35,240
talking down lightning bliss let's see wasn't even making a name for her i've never communicated

2896
04:44:35,240 --> 04:44:40,440
the time that ben left so i know from experience that he knows nothing about her and yet he judges

2897
04:44:40,440 --> 04:44:46,120
her specifically for what he sees on her page the lengths that he goes to just to talk her down feel

2898
04:44:46,120 --> 04:44:51,880
extremely grating it doesn't make me mad as you might assume it just feels really ignorant and

2899
04:44:51,880 --> 04:44:56,600
annoying he thinks he knows everything about her just by looking at her oc and saying that she had

2900
04:44:56,600 --> 04:45:01,480
a moment with dr wolf about being judged for having an alicorn oc and even though something

2901
04:45:01,480 --> 04:45:07,240
like that did happen you get the sensation that ben never saw the video or even knew that i specifically

2902
04:45:07,240 --> 04:45:15,640
talk about the video i did watch the video or at least a bunch of it and i i don't know i don't

2903
04:45:15,640 --> 04:45:24,120
know what he's going on about and like i is it is it not fair like i know i don't know this person

2904
04:45:24,120 --> 04:45:32,840
in real life but is it not fair like this this oc and that moment with dr wolf are our works of you

2905
04:45:32,840 --> 04:45:37,800
know art that were put out that were they were created by this person and put onto the internet

2906
04:45:37,800 --> 04:45:42,520
so how is it not fair to judge them based on them and i think they're terrible and embarrassing and

2907
04:45:42,520 --> 04:45:51,640
i hate them so like what's the fucking problem what do you want from me if you can't be judged by

2908
04:45:51,640 --> 04:45:58,520
your art then your art is worthless yeah yeah i agree if you don't put a part of you into your art

2909
04:45:58,520 --> 04:46:05,720
and you can't be judged based on a whatsoever then why then fucking why would would you even release

2910
04:46:05,720 --> 04:46:11,160
it if it doesn't say something about you i don't i don't remember exactly what i said about lightning

2911
04:46:11,160 --> 04:46:17,240
blitz but i mean i i'm guessing even hard on her well like tonight that do what did i say do you

2912
04:46:17,240 --> 04:46:22,120
remember i don't think any exact i think we just made fun of her uh we we we we we we we talk about

2913
04:46:22,120 --> 04:46:28,360
how she uh she feels so bad about having alicorn oc when she did it to herself yeah like that's all

2914
04:46:28,360 --> 04:46:34,200
i know about her and and we are going to criticize what we know and i mean is it wrong that she has

2915
04:46:34,200 --> 04:46:42,120
an alicorn oc like the fact that she made an alicorn oc and then you know experienced some

2916
04:46:42,120 --> 04:46:48,120
level of emotional instability and heartache over the fact that people did not accept her alicorn

2917

same thing over and over again listen i'm sorry dude and you know fucking i know you i know you

2928
04:47:51,960 --> 04:47:56,760
want closure here but fucking god damn we have to we had we owe to ourselves to fucking defend

2929
04:47:56,760 --> 04:48:03,480
ourselves when we feel like we're being fucking uh unjustly fucking attacked i mean i'm sure i'm

2930
04:48:03,480 --> 04:48:11,320
sure you feel the same way you fucking hypocrite i mean i guess we're just i guess we're just not

2931
04:48:11,320 --> 04:48:17,080
gonna agree on these things so all i'm all i'm trying to do i'm just trying to respond to all

2932
04:48:17,080 --> 04:48:22,520
this with with like how i genuinely feel clear up when i feel that i've been misunderstood

2933
04:48:22,520 --> 04:48:27,800
and defend myself when i feel that i'm being unfairly attacked for something that

2934
04:48:27,800 --> 04:48:35,000
i don't feel is i deserve to be and we're using terms like attacked and fucking you know misinterpreted

2935
04:48:35,000 --> 04:48:40,120
yeah which is accurate and we're trying to be genuine and serious but our real opinions is that

2936
04:48:40,120 --> 04:48:45,080
this is fucking crazy and you're fucking an insane person that is really really really funny it's

2937
04:48:45,080 --> 04:48:52,120
pretty funny um let's continue yeah assisted he literally had to guess that something like that

2938
04:48:52,120 --> 04:48:56,600
happened which gives you the impression that he doesn't know her at all i don't know her but

2939
04:48:56,600 --> 04:49:01,720
again i did watch the video about how she'll never amount to anything really speaks volumes on their

2940
04:49:01,720 --> 04:49:06,920
character if they really think that she's not gonna go anywhere then why does she have more subs than

2941
04:49:06,920 --> 04:49:13,800
either of damn well channel maintains a reasonable view why does why does dr wolf have more subs than

2942
04:49:13,800 --> 04:49:20,520
either of us uh you know same fucking question i i suppose he's true that he's that that that she's

2943
04:49:20,520 --> 04:49:26,280
doing more than like she she's she's getting more you know popularity than than than than we do i

2944
04:49:26,280 --> 04:49:31,000
don't know like like i like i don't know i don't know if i said she's not gonna go anywhere i don't

2945
04:49:31,000 --> 04:49:36,600
believe that like i i what i meant by she's not gonna go anywhere that is is that i don't value

2946
04:49:36,600 --> 04:49:41,240
her content is what i meant to say by that i'm sure she's gonna she's gonna be more popular than

2947
04:49:41,240 --> 04:49:45,480
will ever be yeah and i'm perfectly fine with that she'll she'll have a she'll have a huge

2948
04:49:45,480 --> 04:49:52,840
following of bronies that need to be validated and and just want to see the kind of thing that she

2949
04:49:52,840 --> 04:49:58,920
is only too happy to deliver uh and there and i can't argue with that that's that's just how it is

2950
04:49:58,920 --> 04:50:06,920
and uh she she what i there you go there you go that's all i gotta say but still you know

2951
04:50:06,920 --> 04:50:12,840
fuck lightning bliss she's terrible uh she's she's just uh she's terrible just she's terrible just

2952
04:50:12,840 --> 04:50:17,240
like dr wolf is terrible she's terrible like misanthropony is terrible she's terrible like

2953
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:23,640
fng r is terrible not in exactly the same ways but in many of the same ways um caught up in this

2954
04:50:23,640 --> 04:50:28,680
fucking caught up in this fucking nightmare hellscape that is brony analysis this fucking this

2955
04:50:28,680 --> 04:50:35,640
this this parent trap that's been laid and and and and and when and when and when you're a fucking

2956
04:50:35,640 --> 04:50:39,880
artist and when you have when when you have and when you have limited time and when you have to

2957
04:50:39,880 --> 04:50:46,840
do shit for a fucking living uh sometimes sometimes and and and and even when and even when you can

2958
04:50:46,840 --> 04:50:51,320
compile all the evidence sometimes you just have to admit to yourself and you just have to be

2959
04:50:51,320 --> 04:50:55,640
honest to yourself admit that the hunt and that your hunches are the only things you actually know

2960
04:50:56,840 --> 04:51:02,360
yep no no matter what your hunches are always going to be what you what you truly do believe

2961
04:51:02,360 --> 04:51:08,760
that's gonna be the only thing that you know for certain yeah um and no no one there's yeah

2962
04:51:08,760 --> 04:51:16,840
that's all that's the best you can do sometimes yeah and uh there's uh should i keep going go ahead

2963
04:51:17,480 --> 04:51:24,120
oh is an animation test with over 500 000 views she's hooked people inspired them and made a

2964
04:51:24,120 --> 04:51:29,560
difference oh she made she made a fucking pony mashup she made a fucking she made a pony parody

2965
04:51:29,560 --> 04:51:34,760
of a popular internet thing guess she proved me wrong guess she proved us right she really is going

2966
04:51:34,760 --> 04:51:43,880
places um sorry um yeah art and silly videos and being herself she's a kind-hearted and open-minded

2967
04:51:43,880 --> 04:51:48,920
woman and has rightfully earned everything she's gotten in this community i don't know her as much

2968
04:51:48,920 --> 04:51:53,880
as others do but i've still chatted with her from time to time and each experience that i've had with

2969
04:51:54,040 --> 04:51:59,480
her was really nice after that he states that i once okay i want to say something controversial

2970
04:51:59,480 --> 04:52:06,200
here that i don't know i i think you'll agree with um i don't necessarily look for people who are like

2971
04:52:06,200 --> 04:52:12,120
nice i feel the exact way i don't necessarily want to be friends with people who are nice and kind

2972
04:52:12,120 --> 04:52:18,760
no i that's like that's that's not that high that's not that high on my list of like the qualities

2973
04:52:18,760 --> 04:52:26,360
that i look for in a person yeah um i don't know i mean okay i i i'm sure like let's it is a sweet

2974
04:52:26,360 --> 04:52:33,000
person but sure that's not what i that's not what we're talking about yeah that's not what we're

2975
04:52:33,000 --> 04:52:39,160
talking about here uh yeah okay i'm glad we're on the same page about that yeah tated keyframe which

2976
04:52:39,160 --> 04:52:44,680
is also not true i don't mean to harp on this but this was the second time that ben has made an

2977
04:52:44,680 --> 04:52:51,000
assumption on me that was vastly incorrect i was a fan and and and and and did i say that he made

2978
04:52:51,000 --> 04:52:55,480
assumption keyframe did i say that he hated key i don't know why i would have come to that conclusion

2979
04:52:55,480 --> 04:53:01,960
that seems strange um i don't know i don't remember that okay and also okay this the second the second

2980
04:53:01,960 --> 04:53:05,400
time that we've come to an assumption about him that was completely accurate uh what's your

2981
04:53:05,400 --> 04:53:09,880
fucking count up at buddy what what's what's how many times have you completely misunderstood

2982
04:53:09,880 --> 04:53:17,800
what we're doing yeah yeah solid uh oh it's it's great it's great starting making those stupid

2983
04:53:17,800 --> 04:53:23,560
rant videos i was a fan of hers before i even started this youtube channel making broad statements

2984
04:53:23,560 --> 04:53:28,440
like this before making sure it's false information just making assumptions about a person when you

2985
04:53:28,440 --> 04:53:33,560
don't know them very well it shows that at this point ben is simply grasping at straws to find a

2986
04:53:33,560 --> 04:53:38,760
reason to shit talk me heck he even expresses concern that i didn't call him the c word and

2987
04:53:38,760 --> 04:53:43,720
that i wouldn't swear even though i clearly called him a stupid faggot earlier and a shit sucking

2988
04:53:43,720 --> 04:53:49,320
clearly yeah that's literally twice that he contradicts himself over the same subject no

2989
04:53:49,320 --> 04:53:55,480
no i didn't say why didn't you call him a c word then you i i said it's i complained that you

2990
04:53:55,480 --> 04:54:00,920
didn't say it because you didn't say i didn't fucking contradict myself jeez louise i don't

2991
04:54:00,920 --> 04:54:05,080
even i don't even know where to begin you didn't even say it the second time like we know that you

2992
04:54:05,080 --> 04:54:13,240
do swear sometimes yeah it's it's it's just like fucking jace w connors fucking parkour dude 91 like

2993
04:54:13,240 --> 04:54:18,120
i don't swear except for when i fucking do and don't call me out on it when i do because i don't

2994
04:54:18,120 --> 04:54:26,840
swear yeah um fucking nice job you you are you are you are the real parkour dude also the the

2995
04:54:26,840 --> 04:54:33,320
thing about how i'm just grasping at straws to uh to to to to to shit talking uh who's calling the

2996
04:54:33,400 --> 04:54:38,440
kettle black you know yeah and all that also once again he's addressing me specifically and not you

2997
04:54:38,440 --> 04:54:47,480
yeah yeah i miss at their point i me look at me yeah fucking notice acknowledge munchie Jesus

2998
04:54:47,480 --> 04:54:53,720
fucking crap this is not my thing i did not do this and munchie was along for the riot we did

2999
04:54:53,720 --> 04:55:01,080
this together no one under everyone just assumes that there's horrible there's horrible you know

3000
04:55:01,080 --> 04:55:06,920
sinister intentions here yeah when we could not be more delighted to have all this transpire

3001
04:55:07,640 --> 04:55:14,040
it's true uh it seems it says you left the room by the way it oh okay let me let me refresh

3002
04:55:15,800 --> 04:55:21,640
yeah i tried to play it just now and it wouldn't go all right all right you're back i'm already um so

3003
04:55:21,640 --> 04:55:29,480
yeah guys guys take our word for it we like doing the show we enjoyed shitting on people

3004
04:55:29,480 --> 04:55:36,440
we are currently enjoying and shitting people more yeah we like this we're yeah more than ever

3005
04:55:36,440 --> 04:55:41,640
it just gets better and better we're down guys we're down we're this this is consensual

3006
04:55:43,640 --> 04:55:51,160
continue please uh oh okay here we go now for the record i do believe that i went too far calling

3007
04:55:51,160 --> 04:55:55,800
him those names which is actually part of something that i'll get to later but this is still another

3008
04:55:55,800 --> 04:56:00,040
example of how he doesn't construct his thoughts in a way that's not counterintuitive

3009
04:56:00,600 --> 04:56:07,400
he doesn't construct his thoughts in a way that's not counterintuitive all right just putting that

3010
04:56:07,400 --> 04:56:13,800
out there yeah we've all been waiting for going back to the key yes basically it's the thing that

3011
04:56:13,800 --> 04:56:19,640
sparked all of this drama look i really don't want it to seem like i'm just obsessed with this topic

3012
04:56:19,640 --> 04:56:25,560
but the level of disrespect that he shows talking about it is just really hard to ignore then basically

3013
04:56:25,560 --> 04:56:30,520
says that she got pity money for a video that she did with dr wolf which was uploaded a year

3014
04:56:30,520 --> 04:56:36,440
after the situation was resolved okay okay okay okay maybe she maybe it wasn't that video that

3015
04:56:36,440 --> 04:56:43,960
got her the pity money but the bit the money was pity money like that's what it was um yeah

3016
04:56:43,960 --> 04:56:49,560
year after the donations were made and he speaks of it like it was a cheap stunt to gain sympathy

3017
04:56:49,560 --> 04:56:55,640
from people he doesn't directly call it a scam but it can count as him saying that it was a scam

3018
04:56:55,640 --> 04:57:02,680
there are people who say it i didn't call it a scam i didn't jesus uh it's fucking it's fucking

3019
04:57:02,680 --> 04:57:07,880
pity money that's what it is you fucking have it you bring a sob story i i don't it doesn't

3020
04:57:07,880 --> 04:57:14,680
matter like it doesn't matter how bad it was like like like it is even if the shit is all real and

3021
04:57:14,680 --> 04:57:19,240
maybe it is i don't fucking know but even so it's still pity money it doesn't change anything about

3022
04:57:19,240 --> 04:57:25,960
what i said what is so hard to understand i'm inclined to believe it is real and even it yeah i'm

3023
04:57:25,960 --> 04:57:30,040
inclined to believe is real like the things that are things that are claimed the things that are

3024
04:57:30,040 --> 04:57:35,640
claimed to have happened i don't contest that they probably happened yeah it doesn't change how i

3025
04:57:35,640 --> 04:57:43,320
feel about the whole thing yeah exactly so fucking god yeah jesus christ who actually think this was

3026
04:57:43,320 --> 04:57:48,600
a lie when there are plenty of ways to show it was an actual matter and why it was not to be taken

3027
04:57:48,600 --> 04:57:53,400
lightly and the main thing that ben and munchie seemed to harp on is over how i claimed to have

3028
04:57:53,400 --> 04:57:58,520
evidence but don't show any of it particularly that video that was on will's channel and everyone

3029
04:57:58,520 --> 04:58:03,960
talking in depth about the situation no of course i'm not going to upload something that sensitive

3030
04:58:03,960 --> 04:58:10,040
just to feel like i proved a point to these people it's not my call and it's not their call it's it's

3031
04:58:10,120 --> 04:58:18,040
it's not that i think he he should upload it it's that he shouldn't expect me to know what he knows

3032
04:58:18,600 --> 04:58:25,000
if the information is not publicly available yeah like this is this is this is guarded information

3033
04:58:25,000 --> 04:58:32,440
so why would i be expected to have it if i walked up to a fucking to you know some some some bum

3034
04:58:32,440 --> 04:58:38,520
fuck fucking homeless person and i was like hey dude you know about mk ultra and they're like uh no

3035
04:58:38,600 --> 04:58:43,800
i wouldn't be like you fucking moron how could you not know yeah yeah that's pretty much what's

3036
04:58:43,800 --> 04:58:50,440
happening here um so yeah that's that's yeah that's what's up with that it was keyframe

3037
04:58:50,440 --> 04:58:55,160
situation it was on will's channel i'd need permission from the two of them to even get

3038
04:58:55,160 --> 04:59:00,440
the right to mail it to them i'd also like to point out that there are people associated with ben

3039
04:59:00,440 --> 04:59:06,120
who were very very aware of the keyframe situation when it was going down one of them even made a

3040
04:59:06,120 --> 04:59:12,120
twitch stream to help raise awareness on it what i'm saying is ben doesn't need me in order to learn

3041
04:59:12,120 --> 04:59:18,120
about the keyframe situation he can just ask people about it ask his friends about it look it up just

3042
04:59:18,680 --> 04:59:24,200
i i have looked i have looked it up and i have what i believe is a pretty

3043
04:59:24,200 --> 04:59:30,760
gen solid general idea of the situation and nothing about what i have ever said on the subject

3044
04:59:30,760 --> 04:59:37,080
i i will i will not walk back anything it's it's pity money from fucking bronies who will pay for

3045
04:59:37,080 --> 04:59:46,200
anything uh it doesn't like fucking it's not this is like this is not the saddest story i've ever

3046
04:59:46,200 --> 04:59:52,920
heard you know like this is not this is not like this is not a fucking life or death scenario

3047
04:59:52,920 --> 04:59:59,160
this is not like a an a murder i don't know sure it's bad it sounds like her house really sucked

3048
04:59:59,160 --> 05:00:04,120
and i'm sorry for that but but you know but people have worse lives than that people have

3049
05:00:04,120 --> 05:00:08,600
worse situations and bigger emergencies and they don't get fucking pity money for it because

3050
05:00:08,600 --> 05:00:14,040
they're not fucking brony out analysis assists right that's what it comes down to she brings

3051
05:00:14,040 --> 05:00:18,600
her solid story to the brony analysis community and because they are who they are and they will do

3052
05:00:18,600 --> 05:00:24,200
literally anything for a fellow brony for no reason uh she that's that's that's what it was

3053
05:00:24,200 --> 05:00:30,040
that's what fucking happens there we go is my fucking is my fucking stance clear yet

3054
05:00:30,040 --> 05:00:37,880
jesus yeah like like i don't know like i'm a pretty you know um gullible person sure sure

3055
05:00:38,440 --> 05:00:44,520
i'm completely ready to buy that you know she she she had a bad home life and i don't know

3056
05:00:44,520 --> 05:00:51,000
if i were in the if i were particularly emotionally evoked i i would probably give fucking money

3057
05:00:51,000 --> 05:00:55,640
but it doesn't mean it's not pity money yeah that is the emotion i'm feeling and that's the

3058
05:00:55,640 --> 05:01:01,480
reason i'm giving money is because i feel pity yeah i don't think it's necessarily like a huge

3059
05:01:01,480 --> 05:01:06,760
problem no that's what it is and i and i don't know why you would want to say that it's not i

3060
05:01:07,400 --> 05:01:13,160
yeah i in my mind nothing that i have ever said on the subject should be controversial at all

3061
05:01:13,160 --> 05:01:19,640
yeah um it is just being the fact yeah it was a bunch of bronies heard a sob story and gave a

3062
05:01:19,640 --> 05:01:24,920
bunch of pity money and that's what happened yeah just a uh i'm going to assume a bad thing

3063
05:01:24,920 --> 05:01:30,520
happened to someone she told people they felt bad they gave her money that's pity money yeah

3064
05:01:30,520 --> 05:01:37,240
fucking what's your problem dude exactly yeah something even putting that aside keyframe

3065
05:01:37,240 --> 05:01:42,600
getting attacked by her mother was live streamed there were witnesses to the attack and this whole

3066
05:01:42,600 --> 05:01:48,280
ramble that he would not say it's fake yeah while i can understand why he did it still has some

3067
05:01:48,280 --> 05:01:54,200
misleading remarks to it i didn't make this oc a friend of mine did i admit that it's not

3068
05:01:54,200 --> 05:01:59,000
a complex design and you can joke about it i'll just say i don't really hate his oc that much

3069
05:01:59,000 --> 05:02:04,680
like there's so much like i hate it like he's no he's no tune critic you know okay well okay no one's

3070
05:02:05,720 --> 05:02:11,160
i don't know like i could make i could make fun of anyone's fucking pony oc you know like the

3071
05:02:11,160 --> 05:02:17,800
real the real problem is not the specific design of his oc it's just the fact that it is one yeah

3072
05:02:17,800 --> 05:02:23,400
yeah uh i agree being a rule 63 pinky however you want but i still thought that it was nice of

3073
05:02:23,400 --> 05:02:28,520
someone to do that for me and it would be rude sure sure and kind of dishonest of me to change

3074
05:02:28,520 --> 05:02:34,680
i mean i i'm not invested i'm not invested in shitting on his oc yeah a representation of comedy

3075
05:02:34,680 --> 05:02:42,360
and tragedy it represents my emotional duality it doesn't represent comedy and tragedy and it

3076
05:02:42,360 --> 05:02:49,160
makes me wonder where this assumption even came from and i also really don't like this rant i i i

3077
05:02:49,160 --> 05:02:54,120
don't know dude sorry i mean looking at it again it doesn't totally look like comedy and drama

3078
05:02:54,120 --> 05:03:03,400
drama uh i don't know sorry we're riffing i mean yeah like i think it's a pretty when i see like a

3079
05:03:03,400 --> 05:03:09,400
mask that is like half happy and half sad like i think that's a pretty reasonable leap to make uh

3080
05:03:09,400 --> 05:03:17,240
yeah like sorry if that wasn't your intention with it but like yeah whatever yeah um yeah please

3081
05:03:18,040 --> 05:03:29,800
please no bully yeah please god please god spare us we made a mistake please just just let us dive

3082
05:03:29,800 --> 05:03:38,680
and bear us where they go on about how the pcp is superior how ben and munchie are any better than

3083
05:03:38,680 --> 05:03:43,560
all of these people how the brony analysis community is the scum of society calling it a

3084
05:03:43,560 --> 05:03:47,880
hive mind that they're all basically lonely pete how they're all a bad influence how we're

3085
05:03:47,880 --> 05:03:52,920
corrupting people even them talking about how if everyone was like digibro and gibbon take it

3086
05:03:52,920 --> 05:03:57,960
would be better is just shooting themselves in the foot they complain about it being a bunch of copies

3087
05:03:57,960 --> 05:04:04,120
so they wanted to be a bunch of copies simply because those copies i don't remember okay i don't

3088
05:04:04,120 --> 05:04:12,200
remember saying that i think that all brony analysis sys should be like digi and gibbon if i

3089
05:04:12,200 --> 05:04:17,240
said anything like that i'm sure what i was getting at was not that they should be they should make

3090
05:04:17,240 --> 05:04:22,920
content just like them but that they should think outside the box the way those guys and other guys

3091
05:04:22,920 --> 05:04:30,120
did and yeah the thing is if everyone in the brony analysis community was like gibbon and digi and

3092
05:04:30,200 --> 05:04:35,240
fucking you know the rest of us they wouldn't be there anymore like that's that's what i'm getting

3093
05:04:35,240 --> 05:04:42,360
at it's it's not saying that they have to be like them in all the tangible details they like we just

3094
05:04:42,360 --> 05:04:48,040
want them to be good people yeah is what we're trying to say it's not it's not as though it's not as

3095
05:04:48,040 --> 05:04:54,280
though like if i went back to look at brony analysis videos and i saw that they were making videos

3096
05:04:54,600 --> 05:04:59,720
on waves of of giving clones i would not be thrilled yeah it yeah it wouldn't be like oh well

3097
05:04:59,720 --> 05:05:05,800
now this is good content that i do want to watch it's like no there's bigger fucking there's bigger

3098
05:05:05,800 --> 05:05:11,000
concerns here yeah there's bigger fish to fry and what you all need to do is realize that

3099
05:05:12,040 --> 05:05:18,040
uh do things that don't have to revolve around one specific fucking shitty tv show that we were

3100
05:05:18,040 --> 05:05:23,240
all tricked into liking yeah yeah but there's fucking money in it there's fucking money in it

3101
05:05:23,240 --> 05:05:29,560
because it's fucking people are so fucking they're crazy they're fucking crazy and they just want

3102
05:05:29,560 --> 05:05:35,800
more they just can't get enough of pony in the corner they're foaming in the mouth pony in the

3103
05:05:35,800 --> 05:05:44,680
corner review the show uh suck my dick and let get out of here please let it die please let it die

3104
05:05:44,680 --> 05:05:53,240
hashtag max venue hashtag max revive t-bap hashtag um hashtag uh cyanide uh poison to the rest of

3105
05:05:53,240 --> 05:05:58,840
the brony analysis community please i wish i wish the fucking well would just dry up and they would

3106
05:05:58,840 --> 05:06:07,240
stop fucking funding themselves god it bothers me just to no end that people that people are like

3107
05:06:07,240 --> 05:06:12,200
we need to keep this going we need to keep this going that's what they're doing they're putting

3108
05:06:12,200 --> 05:06:16,920
they're pumping money into the fucking brony analysis economy and that is what it's going

3109
05:06:16,920 --> 05:06:22,360
so much like like all of our complaints is that it is not good content but who cares if it's not

3110
05:06:22,360 --> 05:06:29,240
good content to us because they just fucking love it so much yeah yeah um so so so so i so i guess

3111
05:06:29,240 --> 05:06:34,520
so i guess you're fucking right miss antherpony maybe mirkan does does have fucking wealth and

3112
05:06:34,520 --> 05:06:42,120
and you know it is a fortune him but um sorry if i don't fucking like the people that yeah um

3113
05:06:43,000 --> 05:06:50,760
to me it's all fucking to me like any amount of recognition for for my little pony reviews

3114
05:06:50,760 --> 05:06:58,120
is like undeserved and too much and makes me mad yeah and i know he's gonna and i know he's gonna

3115
05:06:58,120 --> 05:07:03,400
say that i'm a hypocrite because i made fucking pony videos well i felt differently at the time

3116
05:07:03,400 --> 05:07:09,720
at the time i had nothing better going on but now i've moved on and that's what a good person would

3117
05:07:09,720 --> 05:07:15,000
do in my humble opinion so there that's my issue they haven't moved on and i don't get why

3118
05:07:16,760 --> 05:07:22,120
represent people that they personally like there are people in the pcp that i like but

3119
05:07:22,120 --> 05:07:27,080
saying the bro analysis leak should be like them would take away the idea of us being individual

3120
05:07:27,080 --> 05:07:32,760
people look it was never my intention and you're fucking individual people right now

3121
05:07:33,560 --> 05:07:37,240
you're you're you're so fucking different from one another from one another right now you

3122
05:07:38,200 --> 05:07:43,720
it's it's it's not like you could click on like like some fucking bum fuck 50 subscriber person

3123
05:07:43,720 --> 05:07:50,040
and not be able to really distinguish them from like like a fucking um um a big name yeah it's it's

3124
05:07:51,000 --> 05:08:00,680
it's he yeah he the amount the amount of appreciation for this for the art form of

3125
05:08:00,680 --> 05:08:05,880
brony analysis like the amount of individual care and attention that is implied to exist

3126
05:08:06,840 --> 05:08:12,360
is blows my mind and it just doesn't i mean i guess there are heroes like dr fowl among them

3127
05:08:12,360 --> 05:08:17,320
who are like creating like quality content that breaks the mold most definitely sure

3128
05:08:17,320 --> 05:08:23,640
sure of course there are exceptions but yeah the the by the numbers fucking shitty that guy with

3129
05:08:23,640 --> 05:08:29,720
the glasses jokes and and the fucking the pony in the corner and the flat the fucking the the

3130
05:08:29,720 --> 05:08:35,080
animation the limited flash animation fucking make it look like the show fucking i don't know

3131
05:08:35,080 --> 05:08:41,400
fucking attitude the fucking love and tolerate attitude and all the all this the whole melange

3132
05:08:41,400 --> 05:08:48,840
of things fucking bullshit that make up the brony analysis community i could talk forever about how

3133
05:08:48,840 --> 05:08:55,400
disgusting i find it and i'll just never fucking see every fucking level i'll just never fucking see

3134
05:08:55,400 --> 05:09:02,600
what it is that that is keeping people invested you know for me for me i was over a long time ago

3135
05:09:03,560 --> 05:09:10,680
and and i i'm really sad to see that people don't feel the same way yeah yeah me too me too

3136
05:09:11,560 --> 05:09:16,920
people with my first video on ben saint i just wanted to get some anger and heat off of my chest

3137
05:09:16,920 --> 05:09:21,640
over what he's been angry right now raising his voice i wasn't trying to rain wash people to think

3138
05:09:21,640 --> 05:09:27,560
like me people can choose to not agree with me for the way i made that video it's called free will

3139
05:09:27,560 --> 05:09:33,000
people may agree with me and i may agree with them but it's not because of a result of indoctrination

3140
05:09:33,000 --> 05:09:38,440
and that thing about them wanting all of us to be like digi bro this guy made a half hour long video

3141
05:09:38,440 --> 05:09:43,960
being a pretentious self internal jerk over how he thinks any enemy totally irrelevant isn't him

3142
05:09:43,960 --> 05:09:48,520
totally pointless now this was totally missing the point of what was meant maybe he's gotten

3143
05:09:48,520 --> 05:09:54,440
better and improved his attitude since then oh my god who fucking cares right i'm descending

3144
05:09:54,440 --> 05:10:03,480
arrogant on the one hand it's retarded being mad that digi complained about the way other

3145
05:10:03,560 --> 05:10:11,160
youtubers do their thing because on the other other hand it's shut the fuck up like that's

3146
05:10:11,160 --> 05:10:18,520
totally irrelevant yeah ah i just don't i just don't get i just don't get his angle

3147
05:10:18,520 --> 05:10:24,200
no me either i just don't i just and like hold on yeah just like okay he's going on about how

3148
05:10:24,200 --> 05:10:29,960
like fucking like you know oh how how could we want the brunettes community to be different

3149
05:10:29,960 --> 05:10:35,640
how dare we fucking express our opinions on the subject yeah like i don't know like i don't know

3150
05:10:35,640 --> 05:10:44,360
dude people say what they want i'm sorry we humans like to say what they want yeah is that such a

3151
05:10:44,360 --> 05:10:49,320
crime is that such a crime to express our fucking opinion like don't don't worry miss anthropony

3152
05:10:49,320 --> 05:10:55,560
we know we know that you're not brainwashing anyone here we know that what's on display is

3153
05:10:55,560 --> 05:11:00,840
just your opinion it's just that we disagree strongly with your opinion and want to fucking make

3154
05:11:00,840 --> 05:11:09,160
that known like the road this road goes both ways and and it's fine like you know like like you made

3155
05:11:09,160 --> 05:11:14,920
a response to our video you're expressing your opinion on the subject that's completely fine uh

3156
05:11:14,920 --> 05:11:18,440
but you know there were some things that we didn't fucking like advance we're going to express our

3157
05:11:18,440 --> 05:11:23,880
opinion right back it like like it's it's all about just fucking you know using common sense

3158
05:11:23,960 --> 05:11:29,800
and fucking try not to be a fucking weird asshole and i don't think we were going we were yeah

3159
05:11:31,720 --> 05:11:39,800
so um there you go like yeah it's a two-way street it's a two-way street and if you're immune

3160
05:11:39,800 --> 05:11:46,120
from criticism then so are we and if you're and if we're not then you're not yeah stick jerk talking

3164
05:12:03,640 --> 05:12:11,640
more of a reasonable adult than the two of you combined oh he swore on his grandmother's grave

3183
05:14:14,600 --> 05:14:19,960
why he made that video about ranting at the fandom and leaving it i agree that he shouldn't have felt

3184
05:14:19,960 --> 05:14:24,680
pressured into being dishonest with himself just to feel like he was entertaining an audience at

3185
05:14:24,680 --> 05:14:30,040
the time a lot of people were giving him a bad rep for no good reason and he was just sick of it

3186
05:14:30,040 --> 05:14:34,840
and on top of that he followed it up with a more constructive video explaining his decision to

3187
05:14:34,840 --> 05:14:40,840
move on with his life i don't just respect that i admire that about tom yeah nothing i've seen

3188
05:14:40,840 --> 05:14:46,200
from either ben or munchie so far has given me the impression that these two are like that as well

3189
05:14:46,200 --> 05:14:54,040
i cannot what does he mean like in what way yeah like what did he mean by this i don't know uh like

3190
05:14:55,000 --> 05:15:03,720
uh like tommy is good because he left and he ranted but then he did something constructive

3191
05:15:03,720 --> 05:15:09,320
he like clarified so what is this if not a clarification yeah this video if not clarification

3192
05:15:09,320 --> 05:15:18,280
what what is yeah uh we this is we're on we're we're like well over 10 or 15 hours of clarification

3193
05:15:18,840 --> 05:15:24,760
yeah yeah so no your problem is by the way quick quick aside here uh i'm so fucking upset with

3194
05:15:24,760 --> 05:15:30,280
myself that like i gave my dragon fucking facial hair because i because i made fun of that for

3195
05:15:30,280 --> 05:15:34,600
like other people and i truly i don't like it but i wanted to give phantom a beard and i thought it

3196
05:15:34,600 --> 05:15:39,240
would be weird if only he had a beard and i didn't so i put it on but i'm so unhappy with it and i

3197
05:15:39,240 --> 05:15:45,880
wish i didn't do it i'm i'm sorry i mean i think it works for i mean i think it looks fine it makes

3198
05:15:45,880 --> 05:15:52,600
sense for phantom because horses have hair uh yeah well then i mean you know i guess if i'm using

3199
05:15:52,600 --> 05:15:57,480
that logic strawberry shouldn't have head hair either or or those like just weird scales those

3200
05:15:57,480 --> 05:16:03,400
those are scale those are weird scales oh well so are the ones on his face then okay okay fair enough

3201
05:16:03,400 --> 05:16:12,120
yeah yeah just little little wispy um really long scales i hate it it's fine um phantom is perfect

3202
05:16:12,120 --> 05:16:17,320
i love strawberry milk phantom is perfect yeah but strawberry is fine too look look at his dingy

3203
05:16:17,320 --> 05:16:23,240
look at his nasty little teeth yeah look at those canines yeah horses aren't supposed to have those

3204
05:16:23,240 --> 05:16:32,280
you fucking brutal fuck i'm pretty brutal dog i'm i'm pretty cheeky understand any of the motivation

3205
05:16:32,280 --> 05:16:37,320
behind what ben and munchie did with that first video because they were bored wasn't just for a

3206
05:16:37,320 --> 05:16:42,680
cheap laugh yes it certainly wasn't funny on any level well one more thing that these guys accuse

3207
05:16:42,680 --> 05:16:48,040
the brony analysis community of is how everything should just be maintained i don't believe that

3208
05:16:48,040 --> 05:16:52,680
and i'm sure a lot of people don't either if someone wants to move on with their lives that's

3209
05:16:52,680 --> 05:16:58,440
their choice there's nothing i can do except try to respect their decision and i haven't been doing

3210
05:16:58,440 --> 05:17:03,240
that i know it's not something that's going to last forever and i'm hoping that when it's over

3211
05:17:03,240 --> 05:17:08,520
that something good came out of it we try our best to make a positive difference in well guess i mean

3212
05:17:08,520 --> 05:17:15,000
guess what the longer people stay mired in this brony analysis nonsense the more you're putting

3213
05:17:15,000 --> 05:17:20,920
off the possibility that anything good can come out of it like the time spent on brony analysis

3214
05:17:20,920 --> 05:17:27,480
is not the time is not is time not being spent making something good come out of it that's how

3215
05:17:27,560 --> 05:17:35,240
i mean okay i agree so i don't know i am completely consenting and willing and fucking

3216
05:17:35,240 --> 05:17:40,840
more than happy to say that some good came out of the brony analysis okay even the brony analysis

3217
05:17:40,840 --> 05:17:45,480
like even just like brony community as a whole i'm more than happy in fact i'm willing to say a

3218
05:17:45,480 --> 05:17:51,320
lot of good came out of it yeah but that doesn't excuse it's fucking false you know i guess i'll

3219
05:17:51,320 --> 05:18:00,200
say that like if someone like if someone stumbles upon the brony analysis community

3220
05:18:00,200 --> 05:18:06,280
sees that it's like an active community and takes it upon themselves to like jump in and make some

3221
05:18:06,280 --> 05:18:11,320
content and they put their own spin on it and like you know they they they grow as an artist

3222
05:18:11,320 --> 05:18:17,240
through this exercise you know like we did uh i guess i i guess i have no fault with that

3223
05:18:18,200 --> 05:18:23,640
so but but but but but but what offends me what what offends me is the old guard

3224
05:18:23,640 --> 05:18:29,960
of the the brony analysis community that wants that wants to keep forever that wants to keep

3225
05:18:29,960 --> 05:18:40,760
the same old shit going they yeah like i i i i okay i i'm i i'm i'm a big i'm a big brony

3226
05:18:40,840 --> 05:18:45,960
apologist yeah i mean i don't know i i met i met on my best buds like like like even not

3227
05:18:45,960 --> 05:18:51,560
not just the pcp my fucking best friend of like i don't know like fucking six years or something

3228
05:18:51,560 --> 05:18:56,600
yeah i met on a fucking deviant art con because he liked my drawing of scudaloo foe so fucking i

3229
05:18:56,600 --> 05:19:02,120
don't know yeah um i got a lot of shit out of this yeah um but that doesn't mean i think it's all

3230
05:19:02,120 --> 05:19:06,680
fine and dandy and i that that just proves that i want it to be better because i want to remember

3231
05:19:06,680 --> 05:19:11,880
it fondly i want i want to be happy fucking you know thinking back on it and you fucking

3232
05:19:12,840 --> 05:19:18,920
you fucking you you brutal you fucking brutal men and you brutal women are fucking tainting my

3233
05:19:18,920 --> 05:19:27,640
memories stop yeah please uh maybe someday maybe someday it'll all just end

3234
05:19:30,680 --> 05:19:35,320
i mean i'm in a brutal mood right now yeah me too i i honestly i did not think

3235
05:19:36,040 --> 05:19:40,840
i did not think i would be getting mad uh about this but thank you yeah i was right i was ready

3236
05:19:40,840 --> 05:19:44,040
to bury the fucking hatchet but now our guys we have to bury the hatchet and miss anthill probably

3237
05:19:44,040 --> 05:19:49,000
his fucking head yeah i watched it before and it left me ready to bury the hatchet but now watching

3238
05:19:49,000 --> 05:19:56,360
it again and thinking about it and discussing it with you i'm fucking incensed again yeah uh i mean

3239
05:19:56,360 --> 05:20:01,960
you know i mean like if you want to make it a asking for that per se it would be funny for us

3240
05:20:01,960 --> 05:20:07,800
but i don't know do what you want yeah but on the other hand i don't know like like like why

3241
05:20:07,800 --> 05:20:15,800
just like like if you really truly want things to just not happen anymore just say sorry um i was wrong

3242
05:20:16,440 --> 05:20:24,840
uh by yeah i mean he's he's free i mean he's free to disagree yeah uncertain on on you know on

3243
05:20:24,920 --> 05:20:34,040
whichever many points he wants to but i don't know i'm and so am i i'm here i am i'm fucking i'm

3244
05:20:34,040 --> 05:20:38,600
disagreeing real hard i'm disagreeing real hard i'm disagreeing as hard as a human fucking hand

3245
05:20:38,600 --> 05:20:45,800
yeah um so yeah i guess i'm with you that like no i guess i won't say that no good could ever come

3246
05:20:45,800 --> 05:20:52,680
out of the brony analysis community but like the the relentless the relentless adherence to formula

3247
05:20:53,480 --> 05:20:59,160
and the i don't know just the insularity of it and the the

3248
05:21:01,480 --> 05:21:06,280
yeah all that it sucks it makes it all all all how every fucking member is a hive mind

3249
05:21:06,280 --> 05:21:11,560
cause and it's i don't like that yeah and it's not fucking above criticism like you can't like

3250
05:21:11,560 --> 05:21:16,840
i'm not you can't fucking tell me that i'm not allowed to look at something like lightning

3251
05:21:16,840 --> 05:21:25,960
bliss is oc and be like oh god i i hate that it sucks and and then like why like why is that

3252
05:21:25,960 --> 05:21:30,520
why is that off the table for criticism oh because she's nice because you're her friend

3253
05:21:30,520 --> 05:21:36,920
well fuck that and and not even just like some random person doesn't have the right to criticize

3254
05:21:36,920 --> 05:21:42,680
it of course they do yeah but not even just that you were an influential member of the community

3255
05:21:42,680 --> 05:21:49,800
who else but you is able to criticize it well i mean i guess i guess because i left my opinion

3256
05:21:49,800 --> 05:21:55,560
doesn't count anymore you know like now that we were saying this shit in the fucking community

3257
05:21:55,560 --> 05:22:02,520
yeah we it's true it's true i was this like i've never changed my tune about this once um i don't

3258
05:22:03,160 --> 05:22:10,520
what what is this guy's fucking problem why i never i never i never liked the fucking

3259
05:22:10,520 --> 05:22:18,760
the formula and the the way that it was all just i don't know it was so refreshing it was so

3260
05:22:18,760 --> 05:22:24,280
refreshing when some originality shown through and that is how like fucking the pcp all met each

3261
05:22:24,280 --> 05:22:29,560
other because we all had like a fresh fucking voice in the midst of the sea of mediocrity

3262
05:22:30,200 --> 05:22:34,840
and like so that like that's the kind of thing that i think can can potentially come out of a

3263
05:22:34,840 --> 05:22:42,280
thing like this but like to me the the alternative to the everything that isn't that is bad like it's

3264
05:22:43,000 --> 05:22:48,600
like to argue like to me the pcp is like the cream that rose to the top of this of this fucking cess

3265
05:22:48,600 --> 05:22:54,360
pool and to say to suggest that there's anything wrong with me saying that the rest of them should

3266
05:22:54,360 --> 05:23:01,160
be like us in some way is to suggest that we are the bad and they are the good when no like they

3267
05:23:01,160 --> 05:23:07,080
like we're the ones that fucking stood out you know like we're the ones that that made something

3268
05:23:07,080 --> 05:23:13,320
happen with it and didn't fucking save it settle for the same old shit and to fucking to fucking

3269
05:23:13,320 --> 05:23:19,080
complain about that as though like why do you why do you want us to be like you don't you want us to

3270
05:23:19,080 --> 05:23:24,760
be individuals fucker we were the individuals we were the ones that were different i don't know

3271
05:23:25,480 --> 05:23:30,200
and and and to say like i don't know like i don't like t-bap or i don't like drying

3272
05:23:30,200 --> 05:23:37,960
horseshoes sure but i i i i don't know why why can't we why why can't we want people to be like us

3273
05:23:37,960 --> 05:23:42,120
what's the what's the problem at the end of the day does anyone does anyone want anything that's not

3274
05:23:42,120 --> 05:23:49,480
that when you really me really really when you look inside of yourself and ask you what you want

3275
05:23:49,560 --> 05:23:56,680
i don't know dude i don't i i yeah like it's it's like digi complaining about the anime like

3276
05:23:56,680 --> 05:24:03,240
he thinks the anime analysis should be done in a certain way and why is it controversial then

3277
05:24:03,800 --> 05:24:09,400
that he dislikes the alternative ways of doing it and prefers his own and thinks that the way

3278
05:24:09,400 --> 05:24:14,280
that he chooses to do it is the right way the reason he does it his way is because he feels

3279
05:24:14,280 --> 05:24:19,000
that's the right way to do it just like yeah you know the way that i did pony analysis was

3280
05:24:19,000 --> 05:24:23,000
what i felt was the right way to do it and ultimately i felt that leaving it was the

3281
05:24:23,000 --> 05:24:29,160
right thing to do with respect to it and that's the fucking that's what it is that's that's

3282
05:24:29,160 --> 05:24:34,600
lying short of it i'm yeah that's the longest short of it i'm kind of i'm kind of lost i've

3283
05:24:34,600 --> 05:24:39,160
kind of lost track of where this whole thing started i'm i'm i'm getting kind of like heat

3284
05:24:39,160 --> 05:24:46,680
stroke delirious right now yeah um there all right should we continue let let's continue

3285
05:24:47,320 --> 05:24:52,360
in people's lives because that's what life should be about making a positive difference

3286
05:24:52,360 --> 05:24:58,200
nothing that ben or mungee have done with these two videos has made a positive change of any kind

3287
05:24:58,200 --> 05:25:04,040
and if it did who are you to say for all of the wrong reasons these two are the bad there he goes

3288
05:25:04,040 --> 05:25:08,440
again it's just like when he was like they don't talk about it and when they do it doesn't count

3289
05:25:08,440 --> 05:25:13,720
he's like yeah it didn't make it didn't make a positive difference who are you to say if it did

3290
05:25:13,720 --> 05:25:17,800
then fuck you yeah and if it did it was for the wrong reasons well great i'm sorry you don't

3291
05:25:17,800 --> 05:25:23,480
like the reasons i'm sorry that you don't think that if someone agrees with what we're saying

3292
05:25:23,480 --> 05:25:28,280
that that's not valid for whatever reason like that's what he's fucking saying is he's fucking

3293
05:25:28,280 --> 05:25:32,600
are saying to say that he's fucking saying that anyone that disagrees with our points

3294
05:25:32,600 --> 05:25:36,760
is just invalid and their opinion doesn't count like that's what that's literally what he just

3295
05:25:36,760 --> 05:25:45,560
said or implied right there and yeah get the fuck out of here yeah seriously like can you not step

3296
05:25:45,560 --> 05:25:51,640
outside yourself and see and acknowledge that even if you don't agree with our stance on the

3297
05:25:51,640 --> 05:25:56,920
brony analysis thing and on the keyframe thing and on the way we made our video and on everything

3298
05:25:56,920 --> 05:26:01,800
that at least it is fucking legitimate that we see things the way that we do

3299
05:26:02,280 --> 05:26:11,400
yeah like it's just so baffling to me that he just he just is trying so hard to like discredit us

3300
05:26:11,400 --> 05:26:18,280
when we have thousands of people who love it yeah yeah i mean okay people like the rowdy

3301
05:26:18,280 --> 05:26:24,440
focus cop killers okay i i guess i don't know maybe that's hypocritical we were just saying that we

3302
05:26:24,440 --> 05:26:29,960
don't respect lightning bliss even though she has a lot of fucking you know popular like she is popular

3303
05:26:30,840 --> 05:26:38,520
yeah maybe that's her logic hmm well maybe like i don't know i i guess the difference is that i respect

3304
05:26:38,520 --> 05:26:42,920
the people who like us i don't respect people who like her then it comes down to a matter of opinion

3305
05:26:42,920 --> 05:26:47,640
and i'm fully ready to call it that just a matter of opinion i never thought this was an objective

3306
05:26:47,640 --> 05:26:55,480
fact based sort of fucking court case you know hmm i mean bullshit are we are we being are we being

3307
05:26:55,480 --> 05:27:00,600
overly dismissive of misanthropone's points like are we failing are we failing to step

3308
05:27:00,600 --> 05:27:08,200
us outside ourselves and like consider his point of view on this i don't know possibly i mean like

3309
05:27:08,200 --> 05:27:13,480
like like what more is there to analyze here like like what could we say differently i mean okay

3310
05:27:13,480 --> 05:27:21,080
from his perspective these are two people who he apparently knew about and respected on some level

3311
05:27:21,080 --> 05:27:28,520
i think uh maybe not me but but but you and so this is the and shitting on their roots so to speak

3312
05:27:28,520 --> 05:27:33,800
so i don't know i i get why he would be upset but we've clarified our stances and fucking

3313
05:27:34,600 --> 05:27:41,560
like i think clarified them pretty well so at this point i like maybe maybe maybe i'm like the

3314
05:27:41,560 --> 05:27:49,000
first response but like we've kept clarifying over and over again so i'm fully fucking ready to

3315
05:27:49,240 --> 05:27:57,240
fucking call him out and say that this is his fault yeah i mean i guess whether you think

3316
05:27:57,240 --> 05:28:06,200
brony analysis is a valid thing is a matter of opinion i guess i can't objectively prove to you

3317
05:28:06,200 --> 05:28:15,400
that it's not uh but i was never any i was never under the impression that it was like an objective

3318
05:28:15,400 --> 05:28:19,720
thing yeah and it's completely my opinion but you shouldn't have to clarify that because everyone

3319
05:28:19,720 --> 05:28:25,720
is everyone's opinion and you don't like everything you say will be your hunch or your opinion there

3320
05:28:25,720 --> 05:28:34,520
is nothing yeah yeah like i don't think you should have to say this is just my opinion but to then

3321
05:28:34,520 --> 05:28:41,640
state an opinion and have it you know treat regarded as an opinion yeah uh where

3322
05:28:43,800 --> 05:28:51,640
map is map is your your you're watching you're watching yeah all right let's shall we go we got

3323
05:28:51,640 --> 05:28:57,400
we got a bunch more we got like eight more minutes of this amaka situation relating to abusive

3324
05:28:57,400 --> 05:29:02,920
parenting publicly disgrace people who have done absolutely nothing to deserve their scorn

3325
05:29:02,920 --> 05:29:09,000
and believe that would be a lot better if every single solitary member was that guy who recluses

3326
05:29:09,000 --> 05:29:14,440
himself to his basement and brags about himself on tumblr i get that the point of these videos

3327
05:29:14,440 --> 05:29:20,120
just two guys messing around and having a good time i really do in fact that's the foundation that

3328
05:29:20,120 --> 05:29:26,600
the pcp is built upon this episode and talking about random topics and just having fun with them

3329
05:29:26,600 --> 05:29:32,280
but this series of videos this one with ben saint and munchy it takes such an ignorant and

3330
05:29:32,280 --> 05:29:37,720
disrespectful turn that it comes across as more of a two guys bitching at other people video than a

3331
05:29:37,720 --> 05:29:42,920
two guys just messing around that's what we can't get that's what it is that's what's fun to us

3332
05:29:42,920 --> 05:29:47,640
wouldn't have spent so much time trying to make them about other people for a series of videos

3333
05:29:47,640 --> 05:29:52,360
that's not meant to be taken seriously it sure does get sincere whenever they talk about this

3334
05:29:52,360 --> 05:29:57,720
community they once had no shame in associating themselves we're totally sincere we're totally

3335
05:29:57,720 --> 05:30:03,480
sincere in how we feel and wishes it could pull off and knowing that people actually embrace this

3336
05:30:03,480 --> 05:30:08,280
kind of material and the attitude wait wait what about wishes they could pull off right this video

3337
05:30:08,280 --> 05:30:13,800
only further show i want to hear that in fact that's the foundation that the pcp no god just

3338
05:30:13,800 --> 05:30:18,920
having fun get that shit out of here as more of a two guys bitching at other people video than a

3339
05:30:18,920 --> 05:30:24,040
two guys just messing around video if these videos were meant to be just about them then they

3340
05:30:24,040 --> 05:30:28,920
wouldn't have spent so much time trying to make them about other people for a series of videos

3341
05:30:28,920 --> 05:30:33,560
that's not meant to be taken seriously it sure does get sincere whenever they talk about this

3342
05:30:33,560 --> 05:30:39,160
community they once had no shame in associating themselves with these made me uncomfortable

3343
05:30:39,160 --> 05:30:46,200
in ways that a chan wishes it could pull off okay i mean did we ever say that like these videos

3344
05:30:46,200 --> 05:30:54,440
aren't meant to be taken seriously i don't know i mean i like okay that that's a whole

3345
05:30:54,440 --> 05:31:00,280
can of worms about like what exactly that means to not take something seriously yeah like i don't

3346
05:31:00,280 --> 05:31:06,440
know like like on some of i want all my videos to be taken seriously i want people to like

3347
05:31:06,440 --> 05:31:11,800
think about it and turn their brain on and intake it but that does that mean i think everything

3348
05:31:11,800 --> 05:31:17,960
needs to be like a fucking federal fucking issue no but like i don't know like like to not take

3349
05:31:17,960 --> 05:31:23,000
something seriously is to disrespect it in my opinion and if i were to ever say if i were to

3350
05:31:23,000 --> 05:31:28,840
ever say like just don't take it seriously i would just mean like it like it it's a sort of video

3351
05:31:28,840 --> 05:31:33,000
where like this is gonna sound like we really like really like weasley and like you know fucking

3352
05:31:33,000 --> 05:31:38,760
like everything it can be it can be waved off with this but i don't know to like to not take

3353
05:31:38,760 --> 05:31:43,000
something seriously i just mean to like view it in a certain sense that's like like i don't mean

3354
05:31:43,000 --> 05:31:48,840
turn your brain off exactly i just mean like i don't know i mean that it's silly i mean that

3355
05:31:48,840 --> 05:31:53,560
is a silly video when i say when i say like i don't take it seriously i mean it is silly i mean

3356
05:31:54,360 --> 05:31:59,480
the things we're saying should take it seriously per se like the things we say in these videos

3357
05:31:59,480 --> 05:32:05,800
like we're saying them on public record and like they do represent our true feelings but

3358
05:32:06,760 --> 05:32:13,080
like you wouldn't you wouldn't like you would take something anyone said with a grain of salt

3359
05:32:13,080 --> 05:32:17,000
right like when i said like when i said that i hate burning donut and think he's a fucking

3360
05:32:17,000 --> 05:32:26,440
idiot and a terrible person like you know like yeah i i meant it but not like in a fucking not

3361
05:32:26,440 --> 05:32:33,720
like a federal fucking case or anything like yeah like we're talking casually we're using hyper bowl

3362
05:32:33,880 --> 05:32:39,960
yeah we're using hyper bowl and like we're like we're stating our true feelings but we're stating

3363
05:32:39,960 --> 05:32:48,600
them in a way in a casual way so i'm not gonna sit here and be like i'm not one of these people

3364
05:32:48,600 --> 05:32:53,480
who's like dude the whole thing was just a joke dude like yeah like it was all just a joke a joke

3365
05:32:53,480 --> 05:33:00,280
why do you think we meant any of it you idiot like no uh yeah there's a there's a middle ground

3366
05:33:00,280 --> 05:33:06,440
here that the sincerity of this video uh falls in and it's the fucking and it's the same fucking

3367
05:33:06,440 --> 05:33:11,560
middle ground that like any anything should like any fucking thing that anyone says to you ever

3368
05:33:11,560 --> 05:33:17,480
should be taken seriously but not too seriously yeah like like jokes can be serious and being

3369
05:33:17,480 --> 05:33:24,680
silly can be important yeah exactly so fucking i don't know like you just have to just have to be

3370
05:33:24,680 --> 05:33:29,560
able to parse that and i think we've clarified ourselves extensively on what exactly we mean

3371
05:33:29,640 --> 05:33:33,480
yeah i mean i don't know you i feel like you could be forgiven on some level if we're not

3372
05:33:33,480 --> 05:33:37,560
totally understanding the first video if you came from a background of not knowing who we were

3373
05:33:37,560 --> 05:33:45,080
yeah but once with with all of this all of this said how can you not understand what we are trying

3374
05:33:45,080 --> 05:33:54,520
to say yeah um i don't know i wonder i wonder if this will i wonder if this will put the kibosh

3375
05:33:54,840 --> 05:34:01,720
once and for all or if it will just be more of the same after this misanthropony misanthropony

3376
05:34:02,280 --> 05:34:07,080
like if you're watching this we know you don't want to say you say anymore we know and we're not

3377
05:34:07,080 --> 05:34:11,880
going to beg you to make another video yeah just if there's just some way just like comment like

3378
05:34:11,880 --> 05:34:16,280
i understand if you get where we're coming from not even that you agree not even that you agree but

3379
05:34:16,280 --> 05:34:21,640
you just you get where we're coming from dude just like comment i understand please i'm fucking

3380
05:34:21,640 --> 05:34:26,760
begging you please i understand just type i don't understand and then we will that'll be

3381
05:34:26,760 --> 05:34:32,360
the fucking end of it please i need to fucking know are we insane are we crazy are we are we

3382
05:34:32,360 --> 05:34:44,040
fucking are we are we are we the are we the devil um yeah i um i don't know i don't know i don't

3383
05:34:44,040 --> 05:34:51,400
know how i'll take this like i i feel like he's not gonna be happy with how we've taken i mean

3384
05:34:51,720 --> 05:34:57,720
he made this video as like a clarification and i think maybe is somewhat of an apology but it

3385
05:34:57,720 --> 05:35:03,880
really hasn't felt like an apology at least this far and i haven't i haven't felt apologized to

3386
05:35:03,880 --> 05:35:11,080
i felt like he's said a lot of things that are like they're just continuing yeah yeah he's he's

3387
05:35:11,080 --> 05:35:17,240
explaining where he came from on these issues but he's not changing his stance on basically

3388
05:35:17,240 --> 05:35:24,120
anything he's clarifying a few like verbal missteps that he made and a few a few bad assumptions

3389
05:35:24,120 --> 05:35:30,040
that he made but his general stance on the whole thing has remained ironclad yeah like like he

3390
05:35:30,040 --> 05:35:36,600
keeps saying like you know i worded this wrong but it's still true and yeah i don't know did we

3391
05:35:36,600 --> 05:35:42,440
really misinterpret him that much i don't i don't think so i don't think so all right i think we

3392
05:35:42,440 --> 05:35:47,000
got his point we just didn't like the way he said it and also the idea behind it was retarded

3393
05:35:47,480 --> 05:35:53,560
yeah we felt yeah and knowing that people actually embrace this kind of material and

3394
05:35:53,560 --> 05:35:59,400
the attitude of the two making them is not right this video only further shows that they did not

3395
05:35:59,400 --> 05:36:04,920
know anything about what was going on and their refusal to even learn about it he's ashamed to

3396
05:36:04,920 --> 05:36:09,880
acknowledge that this was part of his life despite that it's the only reason that anyone even knows

3397
05:36:10,600 --> 05:36:19,400
i am not i'm not ashamed to acknowledge t-bap i mean it is a little like uh yeah i used to do

3398
05:36:19,400 --> 05:36:26,120
pony stuff i understand that that's where i fucking got my start and like yeah i'm a little

3399
05:36:26,120 --> 05:36:31,400
sheepish about it sometimes but i'm not ashamed of it and like i think a lot like a lot of the

3400
05:36:31,400 --> 05:36:38,680
stuff i did for t-bap was pretty great and like i don't know it's weird because it's not something

3401
05:36:38,680 --> 05:36:47,560
that i would show to anyone and expect them to like respect it on any level and i don't know i

3402
05:36:47,560 --> 05:36:52,760
guess i have complicated feelings about it i'm not i'm not ashamed of it and i don't i don't

3403
05:36:53,720 --> 05:36:58,840
like i was saying before like i don't think that i don't think that making a pony video makes you

3404
05:36:58,840 --> 05:37:04,840
a bad person inherently or makes you artistically bankrupt or anything like that it's just the way

3405
05:37:04,840 --> 05:37:09,640
that it's generally it's the way that it's done that i think is artistically bankrupt

3406
05:37:09,640 --> 05:37:14,760
there's always going to be you know in any fucking thing ever there's always going to be outliers and

3407
05:37:14,760 --> 05:37:19,640
there's always going to be things that prove your point wrong but you just have we are talking

3408
05:37:19,640 --> 05:37:24,120
generally we're talking generally and how like generally is the only way you can fucking speak

3409
05:37:24,120 --> 05:37:28,200
because if you if you didn't speak generally then every sentence would just be clarifying the previous

3410
05:37:28,200 --> 05:37:37,560
one forever uh yeah like you just you just like we are saying generally we don't like the way my

3411
05:37:37,560 --> 05:37:43,640
little pony analysis videos are conducted that is what we are saying and here are the reasons why

3412
05:37:44,360 --> 05:37:49,080
and like these are these are not problems that are all specific to the brony analysis thing

3413
05:37:49,080 --> 05:37:54,680
like i have like i have a lot of these same problems with like i don't know anime analysis

3414
05:37:54,680 --> 05:37:59,640
video yeah like the whole concept the whole concept of making an analysis video on youtube

3415
05:37:59,640 --> 05:38:07,080
i think is equally you know insular and and you know samey and retarded um and this this is just a

3416
05:38:07,080 --> 05:38:12,520
height an even more insular and hyper specific example of that that is even that it has a bunch

3417
05:38:12,520 --> 05:38:18,120
of like extra baggage on top of it um and i don't think i have i have no doubt that we would not

3418
05:38:18,120 --> 05:38:22,520
care about it all unless we were in it before because it matters to us personally and i think

3419
05:38:22,520 --> 05:38:28,040
that's good i think i think that that is what it would this this video series would be fucking

3420
05:38:28,040 --> 05:38:32,520
shit if we didn't actually know what we were talking about but we do because we fucking live this

3421
05:38:32,520 --> 05:38:39,960
shit motherfucker mm-hmm we know we know we were in the trenches we did we did this maybe not me

3422
05:38:39,960 --> 05:38:45,160
specifically but i was there i was there for the fucking ride yeah i and and and to say that you

3423
05:38:45,720 --> 05:38:53,480
this is completely wrong yeah um i feel like i'm entitled to my opinion of uh

3424
05:38:53,480 --> 05:38:59,240
brony analysis and what it all represents to me i don't think that there's he has any right to

3425
05:38:59,240 --> 05:39:05,800
tell me that it's you know wrong or not right uh that people that i that people are like agreeing

3426
05:39:05,800 --> 05:39:12,120
with the things i have to say about this you you you you you got you got both equally as valid

3427
05:39:12,120 --> 05:39:16,920
perspectives you got you got ben on our sorry phantom on the inside inside you got me strawberry

3428
05:39:16,920 --> 05:39:23,080
milk on the outside inside we're both on the inside we're like i was just a fan he was a creator we

3429
05:39:23,080 --> 05:39:28,600
both are coming to the same conclusion yeah does that not have some weight to it yeah like

3430
05:39:31,000 --> 05:39:39,960
i don't know i i mean i'm sure that not i'm sure that i'm sure there are plenty of brony analysis

3431
05:39:39,960 --> 05:39:47,400
who will cop to the fact that their chosen art form is like goofy and dumb and i

3432
05:39:49,160 --> 05:39:53,800
just i don't know i don't feel like i'm a monster for thinking that

3433
05:39:55,320 --> 05:40:04,360
but fuck whatever whatever i i i i i guess for the devil wanted to leave the fandom behind that

3434
05:40:04,360 --> 05:40:09,560
that would have been okay but just being a petulant child over this new way of looking at it

3435
05:40:09,640 --> 05:40:16,680
doesn't make him any better so years later years later i have a few things to say about the whole

3436
05:40:16,680 --> 05:40:22,680
thing and this is like and this is a crime mm-hmm you you aren't allowed to reflect on your own

3437
05:40:22,680 --> 05:40:27,800
life you aren't allowed to reflect on the things on my own my own life and the people that were a

3438
05:40:27,800 --> 05:40:34,040
part of it yeah yeah yeah god forbid that i say anything about that better than the people he's

3439
05:40:34,040 --> 05:40:39,320
been ranting on up to this point it's selfish and it's shameful and it's definitely not a good

3440
05:40:39,320 --> 05:40:46,600
influence there's that influence thing there's him breathing fucking hard now i've been saying

3441
05:40:46,600 --> 05:40:51,640
throughout this entire video that everything that ben and he used to be mad at mage and tommy for not

3442
05:40:51,640 --> 05:40:57,800
being a good influence being a good influence is apparently very important to him that's the entire

3443
05:40:57,800 --> 05:41:02,600
reason why we brought up that point i don't give a fuck if any of these people are good or bad

3444
05:41:02,600 --> 05:41:07,880
influences i made fun of that exact complaint in that video but if he's gonna say that then well

3445
05:41:07,880 --> 05:41:14,760
i'm gonna spin that right back at him yeah and munchie did was wrong and very hurtful and because

3446
05:41:14,760 --> 05:41:20,840
of all this you probably have the assumption that i hate them but the fact is that's not really true

3447
05:41:20,840 --> 05:41:26,200
i know it's hard to believe but i don't hate them as much as you think that i would especially with

3448
05:41:26,200 --> 05:41:31,240
that second video i don't think ben and munchie were in the wrong to respond to me and the reason

3449
05:41:31,240 --> 05:41:37,080
for that is because my own video i did on this was not a good influence either as a matter of fact

3450
05:41:37,080 --> 05:41:42,760
i really don't like that video looking back to it not because of the misinformation but because

3451
05:41:42,760 --> 05:41:48,280
of that angry outburst i went into at the end i admit that at the time i meant a lot of what i

3452
05:41:48,280 --> 05:41:53,800
said but now that time has passed and i've cooled down there were many many things that i shouldn't

3453
05:41:53,800 --> 05:41:59,560
have said jackie anderson was right about one thing i was not that mysterious bra when i was

3454
05:41:59,560 --> 05:42:04,840
making that video in fact i think i ended up breaking my own promise that i made when i did that

3455
05:42:04,840 --> 05:42:09,480
to not let my emotions get the best of me i thought i knew how she really let him have it

3456
05:42:09,480 --> 05:42:13,880
in the comments but i guess i'm still learning how rightfully so yeah the strongest of our emotions

3457
05:42:13,880 --> 05:42:20,120
and it's also the most dangerous it's an emotion that makes us act on impulse more so than fear and

3458
05:42:20,120 --> 05:42:27,240
disgust and when we let that get the best i hear here's this is not related to the point at hand

3459
05:42:27,240 --> 05:42:35,560
but i am deeply curious do you think that he phrased it that way because he knew that he would

3460
05:42:35,560 --> 05:42:42,520
be doing a visual reference to inside out or do you think that he really believes that human

3461
05:42:42,520 --> 05:42:49,560
emotions are anger joy sorrow fear and disgust like do you think do you think that's really how he

3462
05:42:49,640 --> 05:42:58,120
sees things i i i don't want to nitpick that because i know that he will say something about

3463
05:42:58,120 --> 05:43:03,480
it and he will miss our entire point of the video i just been harp on about it it's very yes i do

3464
05:43:03,480 --> 05:43:12,600
think it's fucking ridiculous i think it's really ridiculous that he like why those two why why those

3465
05:43:12,600 --> 05:43:21,240
two you know i mean i don't know it could be a coincidence i don't know i i i he i mean he's

3466
05:43:21,240 --> 05:43:26,360
proved before they just like to use media okay okay okay you're right i shouldn't i shouldn't harp on

3467
05:43:26,360 --> 05:43:33,160
about it it's it's that that part really stood out to me though as a strange way of saying it as

3468
05:43:33,160 --> 05:43:38,920
of us it leads us to making very bad decisions the decisions we make under that influence can be

3469
05:43:38,920 --> 05:43:44,920
things that we don't truly mean or things that we say in a moment of bad judgment it could take days

3470
05:43:44,920 --> 05:43:51,320
weeks months even years before we realized that we did something stupid i did a lot of stupid

3471
05:43:51,320 --> 05:43:56,760
things when i made that first video i think a lot of those mistakes came from the fact that i was so

3472
05:43:56,760 --> 05:44:01,880
mentally pissed off when i was recording for it i was only really thinking about what they said

3473
05:44:01,880 --> 05:44:06,840
about keyframe which led me to not thinking straight about a lot of the other topics i did

3474
05:44:06,840 --> 05:44:12,600
over exaggerating that i was going to one sub from the pcp because of that one video i

3475
05:44:12,600 --> 05:44:18,440
shouldn't have let it influence my feelings on the channel as a whole why not okay why not yeah

3476
05:44:19,320 --> 05:44:24,440
yeah like it's part of these kind of videos dude if you don't like the content on the channel

3477
05:44:24,440 --> 05:44:30,040
like like this is content on the pcp channel it should influence your feelings on the pcp as a

3478
05:44:30,040 --> 05:44:36,440
whole like that's fine okay and i want i want i want to say something yeah because i i feel like

3479
05:44:36,440 --> 05:44:42,280
i'm gonna psychoanalyze just just just a wee tad it it it it feel a little out yeah yeah please

3480
05:44:42,280 --> 05:44:49,560
i encourage it um the way he says that he was just so fucking overcome and fucking blind with rage

3481
05:44:49,560 --> 05:44:55,720
yeah um i don't buy for one single second because real humans don't act that way in cartoon if you

3482
05:44:55,720 --> 05:45:04,200
if you were an ad viewer of cartoons and animation and fucking uh and in general human abstractions

3483
05:45:04,200 --> 05:45:11,400
that we use to you know uh hyperbolically express our emotions then yes you could you would be led

3484
05:45:11,400 --> 05:45:18,760
to believe that you know one could just go fucking ballistic and just not think or act or feel straight

3485
05:45:18,760 --> 05:45:23,880
yeah um but the truth of the matter is if you're a fucking functioning human you don't do that and

3486
05:45:23,880 --> 05:45:29,160
that's not a real thing that actually occurs in your real actual i mean he had to edit that whole

3487
05:45:29,160 --> 05:45:35,560
video yeah this isn't like an instantaneous thing this this isn't like you're at a fucking party

3488
05:45:35,560 --> 05:45:39,480
and emotions are flying high and you and you call and you call someone's girlfriend a fucking whore

3489
05:45:39,480 --> 05:45:45,160
or something yeah that's a really i don't know why i was very specific but uh yeah this this took

3490
05:45:45,160 --> 05:45:50,680
him this took him like i don't know how long but probably at least you know a couple hours

3491
05:45:50,760 --> 05:45:55,720
all told probably to put this all together at least five hours and if you're blind with rage for

3492
05:45:55,720 --> 05:46:03,000
that long then something's up dude yeah he's just i mean he's just making excuses excuses yeah it's

3493
05:46:03,000 --> 05:46:07,000
just excuses yeah so i'm trying to say he's like just excuses because he doesn't actually want to

3494
05:46:07,000 --> 05:46:13,800
take responsibility that he lucidly and fucking with all of his brain power all of the fucking

3495
05:46:13,800 --> 05:46:18,440
neutrons in his brain fine all there is and synapses in his fucking brain starting up like

3496
05:46:18,520 --> 05:46:25,160
like a fucking thought revolution in his premium yeah with all of his power he was having a fucking

3497
05:46:25,160 --> 05:46:31,560
brain blast and this is the most poignant thought he'd ever thought of his entire life this yeah this

3498
05:46:31,560 --> 05:46:38,840
was not this is not like something i mean i get like sure you were mad when you said it but it's

3499
05:46:38,840 --> 05:46:45,960
not like you were out of control of your faculties or something yeah yeah this is not your your body

3500
05:46:45,960 --> 05:46:52,840
was fucking shutting down you had no control for what you said yeah like you you did this you can't

3501
05:46:52,840 --> 05:46:59,240
just say it was because you were angry i mean okay like okay i'm like you know he says he's angry

3502
05:46:59,240 --> 05:47:05,320
and that's why he did it and that's not like i don't know i don't know uh sure fine yeah i mean i

3503
05:47:05,320 --> 05:47:12,680
knew that like i mean i knew he was angry like yeah like that part i understand um just it's just

3504
05:47:12,680 --> 05:47:20,200
the specifics it's just the specifics that that i get tripped up on um because i just don't i don't

3505
05:47:20,200 --> 05:47:26,280
like him no i don't like this guy no no i did wrongly complain about people supporting him

3506
05:47:26,280 --> 05:47:32,040
through patreon that wasn't right and i shouldn't have control over that if ben's patreons want to

3507
05:47:32,040 --> 05:47:37,160
keep supporting him for expressing himself that's their choice and i don't have the right to keep

3508
05:47:37,160 --> 05:47:44,600
them from making that choice i mean no obviously like obviously he can't make anyone unpledged

3509
05:47:45,240 --> 05:47:52,760
i don't know i don't think this is a real like well sure to spread the word to like to say like

3510
05:47:52,760 --> 05:47:58,520
guys don't patron ben like yes that is hitting me where it hurts that is that is a serious thing

3511
05:47:59,320 --> 05:48:05,480
but like i'll i'll be honest like i basically did that to like tune i mean i didn't yeah i

3512
05:48:05,480 --> 05:48:11,800
basically said like i don't get why people support like tune critic or uh lightning or

3513
05:48:11,800 --> 05:48:18,680
fucking anyone you know like say i don't have a problem with someone saying like i don't like

3514
05:48:18,680 --> 05:48:23,480
what this guy does i mean i guess in this case it's kind of shitty because like it's not like the

3515
05:48:23,480 --> 05:48:28,440
patreon is for rowdy fuckers cop killers like it's like that's yeah it's just for you personally

3516
05:48:28,440 --> 05:48:31,800
yeah yeah it's for my other stuff which like this video is really not about so

3517
05:48:32,280 --> 05:48:39,080
mm i don't i forget the point i was making i guess what i'm saying is i'm not in principle

3518
05:48:39,080 --> 05:48:43,880
against someone being like fuck this guy he doesn't deserve your money like that's a fucking that's

3519
05:48:43,880 --> 05:48:53,240
a consumer judgment call and fair enough um but whatever dude whatever man i also really

3520
05:48:53,240 --> 05:48:57,960
shouldn't have said that jessie and gibbon would snore through his stuff i knew all along that

3521
05:48:58,040 --> 05:49:03,880
they've been friends for a very long time i was basically making stuff up because i wasn't really

3522
05:49:03,880 --> 05:49:08,680
thinking straight because of how bad i was at the time very good job yeah i'm pretty sure that this

3523
05:49:08,680 --> 05:49:13,480
scuffle between us cost me whatever chance i had at being on good terms with them i've already

3524
05:49:13,480 --> 05:49:18,760
gotten in trouble with them once for causing drama with members of the pcp i'm pretty sure they're

3525
05:49:18,760 --> 05:49:24,120
not happy with me for doing it a second time and something that i definitely should not have done

3526
05:49:24,120 --> 05:49:29,480
was make that statement at the end when i obviously wasn't in a good mindset then saint

3527
05:49:29,480 --> 05:49:35,080
if you're watching this i need to be very clear about this last segment i'm not sorry for calling

3528
05:49:35,080 --> 05:49:41,560
you out on your bad behavior but i am sorry that i got angry and i'm very sorry that i said i was

3529
05:49:41,560 --> 05:49:47,160
going to kick you in the day and i'm also sorry that i was overly harsh on munchie i don't want

3530
05:49:47,160 --> 05:49:52,440
to hate you i don't even want to dislike you but i understand that a lot has already happened

3531
05:49:52,440 --> 05:49:57,720
between us and it's stuff that's not just going to go away anytime soon if it helps in any way

3532
05:49:57,720 --> 05:50:02,360
there is something that you should know by the time you see this that first video that i made

3533
05:50:02,360 --> 05:50:09,400
of you will be gone not private not unlisted i mean straight up deleted from my channel not because

3534
05:50:09,400 --> 05:50:15,080
i got wrecked as some people on your side would say but because i don't want it to be a representation

3535
05:50:15,080 --> 05:50:20,440
of who i am i know that it'll still be up for people to see on t-bab but if that's what you want

3536
05:50:20,440 --> 05:50:26,200
on your channel then that's okay it's just not something that i want on my channel but i believe

3537
05:50:26,200 --> 05:50:33,480
that the best way for us to end is for us to admit that we both did something wrong and we both

3538
05:50:33,480 --> 05:50:38,840
handled this situation poorly if anything good comes out of this whole thing i'm hoping it's

3539
05:50:38,840 --> 05:50:44,840
that we just stop wasting our time making videos about how much we dislike the other guy okay okay

3540
05:50:45,640 --> 05:50:51,720
lot of stuff to say a lot to cover in this in a second lot lot to say first of all you don't have

3541
05:50:51,720 --> 05:50:56,120
to apologize for being overly harsh on me because you weren't and you didn't say anything about me

3542
05:50:56,120 --> 05:51:01,560
yeah basically yeah you you you said that saying your dad sucked basically oh yeah that's right he

3543
05:51:01,560 --> 05:51:08,120
did he did yeah he did shit on your stuff a little bit the i don't know like like this is like sorry

3544
05:51:08,120 --> 05:51:12,920
i i i like i like sorry i like i mess with like a friend of yours but like not like

3545
05:51:13,800 --> 05:51:20,360
sorry i mentioned the person who was your partner in this crime like i don't know

3546
05:51:20,920 --> 05:51:24,840
i isn't he why is he why doesn't he want to acknowledge that i'm just as guilty

3547
05:51:26,280 --> 05:51:30,680
why am i not why am i why why why is that man in this image not a double-headed person

3548
05:51:30,680 --> 05:51:37,240
with strawberry milk and phantom horn in it um that's a great that's a great question i also

3549
05:51:37,240 --> 05:51:45,640
unrelated but why did he use that picture of me like that's what not yeah i don't fucking know

3550
05:51:45,640 --> 05:51:49,560
i don't know why he would use that one like why not use one of the regular ones that i made yeah

3551
05:51:49,560 --> 05:51:57,720
like one of the ones that you drew yeah yeah yeah um okay so i hate i hate okay i hate this

3552
05:51:57,720 --> 05:52:03,240
implication that we both did something wrong i don't feel i have done anything wrong i mean

3553
05:52:04,120 --> 05:52:08,680
i guess in the broadest sense i guess in the broadest sense i don't really think that

3554
05:52:09,240 --> 05:52:14,200
misanthropony has done anything wrong either like making his video was not a crime

3555
05:52:14,840 --> 05:52:23,160
yeah but i but i what we have here is a disagreement and i think that misanthropony

3556
05:52:23,720 --> 05:52:29,560
is dumb and thinks stupid things um but like

3557
05:52:29,560 --> 05:52:33,320
where where what am i trying to say

3558
05:52:36,680 --> 05:52:44,200
i i'm i'm definitely not going to apologize for anything is where i'm going with this um

3559
05:52:44,200 --> 05:52:49,560
and i and i kind of resent this implication that this image makes and i think he goes on to say

3560
05:52:49,560 --> 05:52:55,480
a bit about it that like you know like like we're just having a spat and we need to like

3561
05:52:55,480 --> 05:53:00,040
we need to like you know resolve our differences so we can be on good terms again

3562
05:53:00,040 --> 05:53:05,160
like we were never on good terms yeah i i have never i have never thought highly of misanthropony

3563
05:53:05,160 --> 05:53:13,160
because he is among this group that i collectively yeah i fucking collectively look down on it and

3564
05:53:13,720 --> 05:53:22,120
he is he is in the thick of that and i can't fucking respect it and i don't think there's like

3565
05:53:23,080 --> 05:53:28,120
like it's not like we would be friends if we weren't in if this this drama was not happening

3566
05:53:28,120 --> 05:53:35,720
like this is this is this is not a bad this is not an argument between equals yeah i know i'm

3567
05:53:35,720 --> 05:53:41,640
coming off as real fucking as real fucking on my fucking high horse here but that's how i feel

3568
05:53:42,440 --> 05:53:49,480
and the sue me there is no there's no accord to be reached you know i will say that i do i do

3569
05:53:49,480 --> 05:53:56,920
appreciate that i do okay i do appreciate that misanthropony wants this this this argument to

3570
05:53:56,920 --> 05:54:01,720
end like i can see why he wants that because i feel like this has not gone well for him and i

3571
05:54:01,720 --> 05:54:08,040
would never have expected it to so from just on a on a purely like a functional level i can see

3572
05:54:08,040 --> 05:54:13,320
why he would want this to be over but i also think that wanting it to be over is the the mature

3573
05:54:13,320 --> 05:54:20,680
thing and the right thing to want and i appreciate that um i appreciate that he apologized for some

3574
05:54:20,680 --> 05:54:27,080
of the things um that he said like like especially like the that he was gonna like if i see you at

3575
05:54:27,080 --> 05:54:30,920
brony con i'm gonna kick you in the dick like that's not fucking okay so i'm glad he copped

3576
05:54:30,920 --> 05:54:37,720
to that and apologized for that um so that's all well and good and like i am ready to bury the

3577
05:54:37,720 --> 05:54:46,520
hatchet on this and my my final takeaway from it is just that like okay as long as as long as you're

3578
05:54:46,520 --> 05:54:51,640
on the side of like the bro analysis community like as long as you're in their court like we're

3579
05:54:51,640 --> 05:54:57,800
never going to agree we're never going to agree on this issue um as long as you don't see someone

3580
05:54:57,800 --> 05:55:04,440
like lightning bliss and just think and feel a little sick and and laugh through your puke um

3581
05:55:05,240 --> 05:55:09,640
like if that's not where your head's at then we're just not yeah then we're just not gonna

3582
05:55:11,160 --> 05:55:15,240
yeah we just do not think the same way we just do not have the same values and principles and

3583
05:55:15,240 --> 05:55:22,040
morals as one another yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah and i don't know um that's all fine and good

3584
05:55:22,040 --> 05:55:29,720
just stay away from me you fucking freak yeah um yeah that's that's pretty much i mean that's

3585
05:55:29,720 --> 05:55:38,040
pretty much it there we go yeah just like i don't like i don't know like why must what why why do you

3586
05:55:38,040 --> 05:55:44,120
want to be on good terms with us what do you nothing we don't like you none of our fans like you

3587
05:55:44,120 --> 05:55:49,400
like you've like i've laid my i've made my attitude clear yeah like we've we've explained how we feel

3588
05:55:49,400 --> 05:55:55,800
about it about the whole thing and this was his response to it so yeah why do you even want to

3589
05:55:55,800 --> 05:56:02,120
be like on good terms like yeah we're yeah he was still he was still really mad at us in this

3590

3595
05:56:34,920 --> 05:56:39,640
some of the nastier things i said about burning donut who really didn't deserve even like the

3596
05:56:39,640 --> 05:56:43,960
some of the specifics i complained about like the way his patreoners like i do think is retarded

3597
05:56:44,760 --> 05:56:49,880
but like yeah i went i went too far in in hating on the guy just for something like that

3598
05:56:50,520 --> 05:56:52,520
um and i don't know

3599
05:56:55,800 --> 05:56:59,480
what else what else what else am i willing to walk back some of the like

3600
05:57:00,280 --> 05:57:04,120
yeah not not everyone in the brony nests community is a terrible person and like

3601
05:57:04,680 --> 05:57:10,440
like making a pony video doesn't make you a monster or a retard or an artist or anything

3602
05:57:10,440 --> 05:57:18,760
it just gives you a 98 chance of being an awful person and like but like continuing like i won't

3603
05:57:18,760 --> 05:57:25,160
judge someone for dipping their toe into that cesspool but like once you've dived in and swam

3604
05:57:25,160 --> 05:57:30,440
around in it and gotten a feel for what's in it if you continue if you continue to do so

3605
05:57:31,160 --> 05:57:34,680
at that point i'll start to judge you for it and be like why are you still there

3606
05:57:35,320 --> 05:57:41,240
why have you not gotten have you not you know done what you needed to do here and moved on

3607
05:57:41,240 --> 05:57:45,000
like at this point i just have to assume that this is your native habitat you know what i mean yeah

3608
05:57:45,000 --> 05:57:50,920
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just like yeah just fucking please just please

3651
06:02:26,760 --> 06:02:32,040

3652
06:02:32,040 --> 06:02:37,960
or something i don't know i fucking i was i mean i don't know i didn't make videos but i was pretty

3653
06:02:37,960 --> 06:02:44,760
entrenched yeah i i i i i i did you you were involved you were involved with things yeah

3654

3658
06:03:10,040 --> 06:03:12,920
and i only had to use a couple thousand sock up accounts

3659
06:03:17,240 --> 06:03:23,560
please please let's just be okay and that doesn't fix anything there is more to both of us than we

3660
06:03:23,560 --> 06:03:29,080
give each other credit for and i want to believe that you understand that this is another one of

3661
06:03:29,080 --> 06:03:34,200
those videos that i wasn't expecting to make but the difference here is that it's something that

3662
06:03:34,200 --> 06:03:39,400
i want both of us to learn from it's true that i made this video with the idea of it being a response

3663
06:03:39,400 --> 06:03:44,440
to your second frog fractions video but i'm also hoping that this video can be a means for making

3664
06:03:44,440 --> 06:03:49,640
up for the really bad decisions that i made the first time the one thing that i want right now

3665
06:03:49,640 --> 06:03:55,160
more than anything is to bring proper closure to this drama okay bringing closure to a situation

3666
06:03:55,160 --> 06:04:01,000
like this is not something that can be done with a simple youtube comment it requires a lot of time

3667
06:04:01,000 --> 06:04:06,840
and thought about how you're going to vocally and properly convey how you feel about this if by any

3668
06:04:06,840 --> 06:04:12,280
chance there was something you wanted to tell me after seeing all of this you can freely PM me on

3669
06:04:12,280 --> 06:04:17,720
deviantart this is gonna sound really crazy but a part of me believes that we could have been on

3670
06:04:17,800 --> 06:04:22,520
good terms with each other if this situation didn't get so out of hand like i don't know what

3671
06:04:22,520 --> 06:04:29,560
gives i don't know what gives him that impression like i don't know like we it's it's we

3672
06:04:29,560 --> 06:04:36,440
meet we do not have history with you no like there's no there's no like warm feelings between us

3673
06:04:36,440 --> 06:04:43,240
there's no like oh what if there's no like god this this this has gone so awry this has gone so awry

3746
06:12:53,880 --> 06:13:02,120

3750
06:13:31,000 --> 06:13:38,280
pcp what the fuck i didn't know nature's mage was dating biter is that a thing she's been dating biter

3751
06:13:38,280 --> 06:13:43,960
since like as long as i've known her oh shit yeah yeah um

3752
06:13:47,240 --> 06:13:51,640
hmm i feel bad that you don't know a lot about mage and i think a lot of the audience feels bad

3753
06:13:51,640 --> 06:13:58,520
too uh they should feel bad well mage doesn't like broadcast a lot i mean she's pretty open

3754
06:13:58,520 --> 06:14:03,720
about the fact that she's with biter uh she's done a bunch of animations with him and and stuff

3755
06:14:03,720 --> 06:14:11,560
okay um cool uh i'm okay okay spino 41

3756
06:14:16,520 --> 06:14:21,720
okay this this guy's saying that like yeah misanthropony you're the one that fucking

3757
06:14:21,720 --> 06:14:24,520
blew this out of proportion and made a federal fucking issue of it

3758
06:14:25,880 --> 06:14:31,800
yep okay so that's pretty good hopefully you guys work thing hope diamond one two three four

3759
06:14:31,800 --> 06:14:36,040
well hopefully you guys work things out and end on some level of friendly terms with this olive

3760
06:14:36,040 --> 06:14:40,920
branch no shut up i don't want to be friends with misanthropony that's not the fucking happy ending

3761
06:14:40,920 --> 06:14:49,400
here uh the happy ending is him making more videos yeah the happy ending is that this goes on forever

3762
06:14:50,280 --> 06:14:56,120
years of rowdy fuckers cop killers devoted specifically to this one person we're gonna have

3763
06:14:56,120 --> 06:15:00,840
to break it into two shows dude yeah one right focus cop killers one right focus cop killers

3764
06:15:00,840 --> 06:15:08,360
like colon frog fractions this is the sister series no but the worst the only bad thing about

3765
06:15:08,360 --> 06:15:11,640
that lineup is that we're gonna have to actually play frog fractions which i don't think i can

3766
06:15:11,640 --> 06:15:18,200
bear to fucking do i think that what i might do is maybe at the next um maybe for the next real

3767
06:15:18,200 --> 06:15:25,000
friend initiative i might like pop in there while playing frog fractions and do screen share and just

3768
06:15:25,000 --> 06:15:29,640
kind of like play it and make that the next rowdy fuckers what do you think about that

3769
06:15:30,840 --> 06:15:36,920
maybe i might try it possibly because i want because i want to finish frog fractions three

3770
06:15:36,920 --> 06:15:40,440
but i don't i feel like i haven't made that much progress

3771
06:15:42,360 --> 06:15:47,480
uh and i don't even know if it has an ending it probably does i don't know i mean ben

3772
06:15:47,480 --> 06:15:50,760
fucking recording something in the real friend initiative kind of is the whole thing we didn't

3773
06:15:50,760 --> 06:15:56,680
want to have happen oh shit you know what that's a good point i don't even think of that yeah so

3776
06:16:09,800 --> 06:16:15,880

3780
06:16:38,280 --> 06:16:44,280

3781
06:16:44,280 --> 06:16:49,560
was gonna make a video too let me pop and make sure he hasn't done that yet his channel who okay look

3783
06:16:55,000 --> 06:17:02,360
hold on hold on uh wait where am i looking in the discord yeah in the discord this is the new guy

3784
06:17:02,360 --> 06:17:13,960
robert who uh this guy looks vaguely familiar but he might just look exactly like every single

3785
06:17:14,040 --> 06:17:21,640
yeah let's see i'm gonna i'm gonna what did this guy's comments say insane uh he comments a lot on

3786
06:17:21,640 --> 06:17:25,480
these sort of things and i believe at one point he said he was going to make some sort of video

3787
06:17:25,480 --> 06:17:29,800
i think it was like can you send me the footage or something that effect i'm gonna make a response

3788
06:17:30,520 --> 06:17:35,800
what the footage from rowdy fuckers that's fucking publicly available yeah yeah yeah like

3789
06:17:36,600 --> 06:17:40,280
when we go back through our old i think that was on seven points original video which is sadly

3790
06:17:40,280 --> 06:17:50,760
lost to fucking time yeah christ how unfortunate i cannot believe how unfortunate oh my god what an

3791
06:17:50,760 --> 06:18:07,400
asshole um someone says jojo fanatic uh uh 85 this is a good thing to do christian i'm proud of you

3792
06:18:08,360 --> 06:18:14,040
christian oh i guess his name is christian i forget that's like a name is his name christian well i

3793
06:18:14,040 --> 06:18:21,240
wonder i mean i wonder if it is or he just loves god that seems like the most reasonable explanation

3794
06:18:21,240 --> 06:18:29,240
to me um but i know but no it's um he's christian i want to believe yeah me too um do you want to

3795
06:18:29,240 --> 06:18:38,040
talk about brain donuts involvement oh um yeah well i watched i mean do you want to watch the video

3796
06:18:39,160 --> 06:18:45,320
if it's 20 minutes i don't know if we particularly need to like like i don't know what what's there

3797
06:18:45,320 --> 06:18:51,240
to say you're the one who wanted to fucking bring it up uh burning i don't know i think i've i think

3798
06:18:51,240 --> 06:18:54,600
i've pretty much said my piece on burning don't he pretty it's him and some other guy for some

3799
06:18:54,600 --> 06:19:01,720
podcast i don't know what it is but they're talking about the video and uh miss uh burning doughnut

3800
06:19:01,720 --> 06:19:06,120
gets he gets real hung up on like some of the small inaccuracies we made like the fact that i

3801
06:19:06,120 --> 06:19:12,920
didn't know that suicidal tendencies was a band um the other guy is like kind of more pissed that like

3802
06:19:12,920 --> 06:19:18,120
i criticized uh burning doughnuts artwork and burning doughnut is kind of humorously like

3803
06:19:18,120 --> 06:19:23,080
doesn't really care that i that we that i criticized that like he's like yeah whatever you know is you

3804
06:19:23,080 --> 06:19:28,440
know he can have whatever opinion on my art he wants which is fair and i respect that um uh

3805
06:19:29,640 --> 06:19:36,760
yeah so i made a bunch of factual inaccuracies and i don't know i i don't really have much to say

3806
06:19:36,760 --> 06:19:42,840
about the specifics of what went on and i just the fact that i want to acknowledge the fact that

3807
06:19:42,840 --> 06:19:48,680
video exists and i saw it and i've you know i think i've fucking made my stance on that whole thing

3808
06:19:49,240 --> 06:19:57,800
um um yeah um you know burning doughnut um hello yep that's that's that's what it's all about

3809
06:19:57,800 --> 06:20:02,440
right there um yeah here i'm gonna go to all three of our videos and i'm gonna start from

3810
06:20:02,440 --> 06:20:06,120
the beginning and scroll through the comments to see if there's anything that we want to point out

3811
06:20:06,120 --> 06:20:11,880
so go back all the way the beginning fucking in april jesus christ it's been six months jesus

3812
06:20:11,880 --> 06:20:19,880
fucking christ um right first copulars frog fractions bend makes munchie play frog fractions

3813
06:20:19,880 --> 06:20:26,680
but things don't go exactly he has plans indeed in in more ways than one if only we had if only

3814
06:20:26,680 --> 06:20:33,640
the if only those two rowdy fucking copulars had known yeah but how could they have only the benefit

3815
06:20:33,640 --> 06:20:41,080
of hindsight has allowed this someone says i don't even like munchie why did i watch this

3816
06:20:41,080 --> 06:20:51,160
because it's gold people that don't appreciate munchie are like you know i hate to look i hate to

3817
06:20:51,160 --> 06:20:55,800
like i hate to shit on a fan but like when people are like man i love the procrastinators but munchie's

3818
06:20:55,800 --> 06:21:00,680
so annoying i i just want to tell them to get the fuck out of here like i don't i don't get it

3819
06:21:01,800 --> 06:21:08,280
yeah well um yeah that happens um every episode i'm on i know i know it does and it pisses me off

3820
06:21:08,280 --> 06:21:14,200
every time i don't know if there's i don't know if i i think i might be the most like the thing is

3821
06:21:14,200 --> 06:21:18,680
a lot of people love me but a lot of people hate i think i'm the most divisive um i think i am the

3822
06:21:18,680 --> 06:21:26,920
most divisive pcp man they're possibly ever yeah uh i i could believe that and i don't know i'm i'm

3823
06:21:26,920 --> 06:21:33,480
happy to have contrast i suppose i mean it's better to be it's better to have people i mean better

3824
06:21:33,480 --> 06:21:38,280
to be controversial than to have no one like even have an opinion about you you know yeah like better

3825
06:21:38,280 --> 06:21:46,280
better to be munchie than to be sigh true i mean you know by the way i want to sigh is my burning

3826
06:21:46,280 --> 06:21:53,240
doughnut sigh is my burning doughnut on the first episode of on of referee sculptors uh uh eight i

3827
06:21:53,240 --> 06:21:59,160

06:30:13,640 --> 06:30:20,120
he's like um yeah he like he had such like a

3901
06:30:22,280 --> 06:30:28,120
he was so in he was so inconsistent like sometimes he he would be like f-king brave like sometimes

3902
06:30:28,120 --> 06:30:33,560
he would be real like uh i'm f-king challenging you and then and then he would turn around and be

3903
06:30:33,560 --> 06:30:38,760
like oh well yeah i'm i'm protected by law or something you know he's he's one of one of those

3904
06:30:38,760 --> 06:30:43,960
he's one of these cowards he it was you know he's not the only one that's guilty he was guilty of

3905
06:30:43,960 --> 06:30:49,000
this but he's very guilty of it is like you know putting acting tough on the internet and saying

3906
06:30:49,000 --> 06:30:53,320
oh ben saying if i see you at brony connell kick you in the dick and you know he f-king wouldn't

3907
06:30:53,960 --> 06:30:58,840

3908
06:30:59,560 --> 06:31:00,920
um it's bullshit

3909
06:31:03,480 --> 06:31:04,840
awful f-king awful

3910
06:31:08,520 --> 06:31:13,080
someone says for god's sakes learn how to use google hang get hangouts this is painful to watch um

3911
06:31:13,720 --> 06:31:17,800
no discord is discord is like google hangouts but better and for free

3912
06:31:17,800 --> 06:31:21,320
yeah exactly someone says we say that probably versus sigh who wins

3913
06:31:23,800 --> 06:31:27,320
um i'm gonna bet on sigh uh yeah me too

3914
06:31:28,840 --> 06:31:32,120
probably all the good comments were on my santa pranes video

3915
06:31:33,800 --> 06:31:38,360
oh accompanied by shelly d you don't don't let me in with these retards they're gay as fuck

3916
06:31:39,640 --> 06:31:44,760
uh what retards is he referring to specifically don't know probably

3917
06:31:46,440 --> 06:31:52,120
probably like me saying he's like with f and g r oh yeah that's probably what he means

3918
06:31:53,000 --> 06:31:57,240
but i thought he was like i thought he was too i don't even remember like i kind of i thought

3919
06:31:57,480 --> 06:32:03,960
because shelly and corpulent don't like each other and and f and g r doesn't like corpulent

3920
06:32:03,960 --> 06:32:10,120
anymore so i guess i assume that meant that shelly and f and g r are still tight but maybe they hate

3921
06:32:10,120 --> 06:32:15,720
each other too i don't i don't know i can't i'm f-king malomius says um uh he has a time code

3922
06:32:15,720 --> 06:32:20,840
where we're like we say like we like name off some people we don't name him we just name people we

3923
06:32:20,840 --> 06:32:25,640
just name like uh corpulent brownie and like shelly d yeah and she says uh none of us corp

3924
06:32:25,640 --> 06:32:35,560
shelly or me give a fuck what you do nor do we talk to f and g r the fuck uh sorry uh whatever

3925
06:32:35,560 --> 06:32:41,240
yeah i don't know what what what are we supposed to say to that major left to comment i don't think

3926
06:32:41,240 --> 06:32:48,760
she wants to involve this we won't say anything um but yeah um um um yeah just just just just like a

3927
06:32:48,760 --> 06:32:53,720
mix of people saying how could you and and and then another batch of people saying please more

3928
06:32:54,520 --> 06:33:02,840
yeah uh so but exactly what you'd expect um yeah for heroes like us let's see what f from

3929
06:33:02,840 --> 06:33:08,200
john zine is up to that that that that that that that that that wily type oh on his channel

3930
06:33:08,840 --> 06:33:16,120
yeah he's up to he's probably doing calm he's probably commentating on some other brownie

3931
06:33:16,120 --> 06:33:21,080
shit i wonder i wonder if he's had any wait a minute i just it got it saved and i don't know

3932
06:33:21,080 --> 06:33:27,080
why i wonder if anything's gone down between him and f and g r lately i hope not i feel like

3933
06:33:27,720 --> 06:33:32,200
or some sort of any shit with jerry peat god i fucking hate jerry peat so much who's that

3934
06:33:33,000 --> 06:33:39,480
he was part of the i think i don't know in my mind he's vaguely associated with f and g r i don't

3935
06:33:39,480 --> 06:33:50,680
know if it's true uh but he is basically brony a sargon of a cod and trans from john z's um like

3936
06:33:50,680 --> 06:33:58,520

3998
06:41:06,920 --> 06:41:14,040
never marked it on patreon or green the six the sweet eight dollars on the t-bet patreon by posting

3999

reverse cop killers nine what's funny is it is it eight dollars it's eight dollars

4000

um what's funnier oh man

4001
06:41:29,960 --> 06:41:35,560
