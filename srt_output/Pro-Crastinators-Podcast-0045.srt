00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Hey, what's up, everybody? It's Digibro. I'm not in this episode. I don't even know what this episode's about, but here's a rant I gotta give you.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:16,100
I'm sick of half measures by society when it comes to germs. Everyone washes their hands all the time after they take a piss.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,200
You don't even really touch anything, but you feel the need to wash your hands. People wash their hands after they touch this and that, when they touch trash, they touch this.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:29,800
But yet everyone goes to the grocery store and pushes around carts that a thousand other people's hands have been on, and no one washes their hands afterwards.

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Or even worries about it. No one puts shit on their hands to grab the cart, even though every fucking sick motherfucker who's been in that place has touched that cart.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,600
If you're touching carts, then you're doing it wrong. You're fucking up, and you're washing your hands after... I don't know what I'm talking about. Here's the episode.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:56,100
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Procrastinator's Podcast. I am back. It's just me today. Nobody else is here. I'm the best guy ever.

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,700
Creek, it's me. I just walked through the door.

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,500
Oh, I didn't... Oh, hey, what do you know? It's, uh...

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,300
Don't tell me, but I'm hiding under the table. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm here with the fool.

11
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, is that him? Are you under the table? Is that you?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
No, no, I'm not.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,300
Oh, you up-ended the table, god damn it.

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,800
Yeah, I see you guys.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,500
Here comes the crappy pants, man!

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,300
Everyone's favorite character.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm a superhero. No one knows my secret identity. You don't know who I really am. I'm the crappy pants man.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Who could I be? Which mysterious member of the PCP is actually me?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,600
AKA the Pooper Tailor.

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,500
Fill it with a shit. The crappy pants man can't do that.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:50,300
Hey, you kids. What are you all getting up to? It's me, your dad Ben... Your dad Ben St. here, and I've got my... I'm getting my fucking belt off, kids.

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:59,900
No. Okay dad, I'll do our homework. Don't take my belt off. My pants are the only things keeping in my crap.

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:07,700
My pants are the only thing that set me apart from the animals in the field. Please don't take my clothing. They're my badge of honor.

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:15,100
Okay, anyway, we're here at Procrastinate's podcast, and we're talking about some shit.

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,700
Okay, so we got a topic to Justin from a while ago. Oh, and DeVoo too. Of course. DeVoo encompasses the rest of us.

26
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,700
The furtive DeVoo.

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
So easily forgotten.

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
That's actually hilarious.

29
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,200
Except I made that same fucking joke about myself last week, and no one left any of us.

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,200
It wasn't hilarious when it was about Ben, because Ben's not cool.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,700
No, that was a lie.

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,200
It was harsh, harsh justice.

33
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,300
Okay, we got a suggestion here for a topic from our buddy. It's Mun Keh at Mun Keh Away, who I think has asked a question before.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Is that my secret evil twin brother?

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,300
Probably, probably. But here's what they got to say. It's not Mum Keh Jones, it's Mun Keh Away.

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:10,300
He says, are there any art mediums you think are crap? I, for instance, share Digi's views of disliking visual novels.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
So this guy's asking a question about the inherent worthiness of different artistic mediums, basically.

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,400
And a couple of us had been discussing this topic amongst themselves already, so this was a very apropos of a suggestion.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
So Ben and Mun Chee, I believe. You got things to say about this, right?

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Well, kinda. Kinda.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Like, okay, if by medium you mean like film, the pros, then I would say no. Probably not.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Well, I would say yes. However, continue Ben.

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I was gonna say, but there are, I think there are genres that are inherently worthless.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Okay.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Yeah.

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Well, this guy's talking about like visual novels, so I think we can define it however we want, it doesn't matter.

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
We'll run the entire game, but we'll go medium or genre.

48
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
We'll go fucking art itself being worthless, which is nice.

49
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm just saying.

50
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm gonna jump right into this and say that I think any medium or genre can be good, but not necessarily any...

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Like, there may not be a good one in that genre yet, so they are using that.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I think anything can be good, but I think that being good, I think that like a porn, for example, that is good

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,600
is just inherently worthless than like a real book that is good, or a real movie that is good.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,600
There are definitely tiers of goodness, depending like a sign to each class or medium.

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Well, hang on.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah, it's interesting.

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
And you will not go above that stat.

59
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,700
What if there's a book and there's like six in it at some point?

60
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Yeah.

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Well, it's not primary purpose is to be porn then.

62
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
What is it?

63
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,700
There's this really great anime called Kite, I think, and it's by some director who's really famous, who I forget.

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,700
And it's beautifully animated, and he's got a couple things like...

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Nezo Forte is another one that's like that, that has some of like just the best hentai fat material in the game.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,800
And yet, it's just in the context of this other story where there's just like...

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
It's like a detective sort of story where there's, you know, spies and it's adventure.

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
And yet, there's just these incredibly detailed sex scenes that are...

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
They're just super fappable.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
They're just incredibly fappable.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,800
And they're just in the context of this bigger piece of art.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
So I don't even know...

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
It feels kind of separate.

74
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,900
It's almost like in Fate Stay Night, like the sex scenes feel very like removable from the story.

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
In the same way, these scenes...

76
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Like, it's funny because most of them are just like dream sequences, at least in Mezo Forte.

77
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
So they're like completely removable.

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,900
But in Kite, the other one, they are actually kind of a characterization of this woman who like...

79
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,900
She's like a secret agent spy lady, and she is, you know, being controlled by this like evil policeman.

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
And you know, he has sex with her.

81
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
I feel like we're getting a little off topic here.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What exactly is it to you, Ben, about porn that makes it not valid?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not that it's not valid at all.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's just less valid.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because it all falls back on the same fucking...

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It all amounts to the same thing in the end.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It all comes down to the same exact emotional response being evoked in it basically the same way again and again.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And it's cheap and it's tawdry, and nobody learns anything.

89
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:32,100
But if you, in theory, if you want to make like an artistic porn and try to evoke like other emotions, why can't you?

90
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
And also, I disagree.

91
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
It all comes down to the same feeling.

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Like, sometimes I feel it more in my ass sometimes based on the context of the porn.

93
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
That's gross.

94
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
You feel it in your ass when you're watching the porn.

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
The idea of porn is to usually get your rocks off.

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
And if it's distraised from that, then it's not really porn.

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Yeah, if you take a porn and you fucking just...

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Well, that's like a no-true Scotsman for artistic mediums.

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Yeah, you know, I guess it is.

100
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:11,200
And yet, if you take, I don't know, fucking, I don't know, porn of the week number 77

101
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
and you slap fucking Catcher in the Rye in the middle of it.

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Like, have you made, have you then created a thoughtful and engaging work of pornography?

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
I would say no.

104
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,300
So you're saying that what you don't like about pornography is that it's just, you know, it doesn't matter how it gets there.

105
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,300
If it gives you an erection, then it's done its job and that's what it means to be a porn.

106
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Yes.

107
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Well, it just so happens.

108
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
That in itself is not artistic.

109
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,400
In order to be artistic, but to have something else would change it from porn into something that is not porn.

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Look, that's an important question because the question here is, are there art mediums you think are crap?

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,400
If porn serves one, if it is a tool with which to get off as opposed to learn anything, then it's just not art.

112
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,400
It's not art if all you're getting from it is this one function.

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
It's very simple, please.

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,500
There is an artistic quest in making something that you can enjoy and also fab to at the same time.

115
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I agree.

116
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Why did my game keep going up?

117
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
I don't know.

118
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:22,500
It is art and there is artistry involved in it and I have read porn that has impressed me artistically

119
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,500
and yet I just don't think that it can ever exist and be worthy on the same fucking level as, you know, other stuff.

120
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I'll tell you why.

121
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:40,600
It just so happens that there is a porn that was specifically made to confront this theme of whether or not porn should be considered art

122
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,600
or should be discussed in artistic circles and it's a comic called Lost Girls by Alan Moore, the creator of Watchmen.

123
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,600
And then the premise of the story is that all these public domain characters, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz,

124
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Alice from Alice in Wonderland and Wendy from Peter Pan, is during that era of like World War One,

125
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,700
they meet up together in a hostel somewhere in Europe and they get to talking and they talk about their sexual awakenings

126
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:11,700
and the whole story is about, you know, the stories of these characters retold through the lens of pornography of them

127
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
finding out about their sexuality and getting fucked and sucking cock and it's these underage girls sucking cock

128
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
and that's the porn aspect and it's hot and sexy.

129
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:27,700
But the whole reason that it was written is because Alan Moore felt like sex is underrepresented in literature

130
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
and he felt like it should be...

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Because sex is...

132
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
What is like...

133
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Even if it's just there to come, what's invalid about that?

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Like coming is the most important part of human existence.

135
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
It's just as human as any other emotion.

136
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,800
You know, I kind of agree and like I think that like a work of fiction or like a work of prose or literature

137
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
can have like explicit sex in it and be good.

138
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I don't think that makes it porn.

139
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
But it is porn.

140
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Jack off to run and it's cool.

141
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,900
If the purpose of it is to make you jack off...

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
The purpose of it was to have sex in it.

143
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Listen, if the purpose of that, of Lost Girls...

144
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
I've heard about Lost Girls, I haven't read it.

145
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
If the purpose of it is to get you off, then it's porn.

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,900
If the purpose of it is to confront themes of is porn art and it's not porn, it's art.

147
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Why can't the purpose be both?

148
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
I guess...

149
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
I guess it can be both.

150
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
I think it's just how you're defining porn.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I have a question for Ben.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is part of this resentment towards porn part of...

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is it your virgin rage?

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, no.

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Maybe.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No, is it part of like your disdain for artists who just make loads of money by just appealing to the lowest common denominator

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
slacking tits and making the tits bigger and then they get millions of pounds?

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is that the thing?

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes!

160
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Yes, that makes it mad and I think it's wrong and a sin.

161
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Making something that I find hot enough to want to download is like...

162
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Everyone should be in jail.

163
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Everyone should be in jail and in hell.

164
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Everyone should go to jail and then be put into hell jail.

165
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:09,100
You know, making something that I find hot enough to actually want to download is like always an exciting thing.

166
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Like, wow, this is a thing that really appeals to my interests and aesthetic sensibilities so much that I'm going to revisit it.

167
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,200
And it's like they have so many specific tastes and interests that are like so underrepresented

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,200
and I find that finding people who actually make that product to be really exciting

169
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,200
just as much as someone making a video game that does what I want a video game to be.

170
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I don't even disagree with any of that.

171
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
But it doesn't change how I feel.

172
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
What about for example...

173
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:46,300
For example, Playboy has always made it a sticking point of having tasteful nudity

174
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,300
as opposed to porn, like hardcore pornography, which is so prevalent.

175
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Like, Playboy always talks itself up as a little bit artistic

176
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
and it kind of is.

177
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,300
I don't believe anyone has jacked off to a Playboy since the internet was invented.

178
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
It's the most unarousing, like, tame.

179
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,300
It's basically like looking at a girl's ankle at this point.

180
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
But like you still...

181
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,400
You can rip out pages from a Playboy and you can plaster them all over your wall.

182
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
I have a wall of beautiful naked women.

183
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
What's wrong with that?

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,400
It's tastefully nude photography and it's artistic because I say it is.

185
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Well, this really all hinges on the definition of art.

186
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,400
What purpose does art serve and does porn meet the qualification?

187
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Enough!

188
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I've held my tongue for too long.

189
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Welcome back to Listen Buddy Episode 3!

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Sex Redux with your host, Munchy wears tiny hats.

191
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
As you all know, I hate sex with the passion.

192
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:52,500
And you will learn soon enough, sex is gross and I hate it with all my bean.

193
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
That's why I hate porn because it makes me think about sex.

194
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I hate it so much and you don't even know.

195
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Are you just being selfish and short-sighted, Munchy?

196
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Because other people might enjoy porn.

197
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
No, I hate sex.

198
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,600
No one can like sex because it looks gross and it feels gross.

199
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
It's not even good.

200
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
It doesn't have any artistic merit and it's not cool.

201
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I don't think people are cool who have sex.

202
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Anyone who's ever had sex isn't cool.

203
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Every time I go down in a woman and I get over zealous and I get way too toothy,

204
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,700
she goes, I hate sex with all my bean.

205
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
That's disgusting.

206
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Overall, I'm sort of on the same wavelength as Ben is.

207
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,700
In general, with thinking of certain mediums as superior to others.

208
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,700
The whole everything is art and it's all subjectivity and stuff.

209
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,800
That is really fascinating and really inspiring when you're 15 learning about art and shit.

210
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,800
By now, I'm totally bored of all that subjectivity.

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Everything is relative stuff.

212
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,800
At this point, I just have to come out and think that video games and animation

213
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
are two mediums that are cut above the rest.

214
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
And sequential art is a cut above the rest.

215
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,800
When Munchy is talking about how he's planning on making a comic or something,

216
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
I'm like, yeah, when you make a comic,

217
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
you will have produced a work that is of significantly more value

218
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,900
than any individual set of drawings that you could make.

219
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,900
And like me myself, I'm working on learning how to make video games

220
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,900
because I think video games as just the most powerful medium in existence.

221
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Why would I not want to do that?

222
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Why would I be stuck just making YouTube videos?

223
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
I agree, kind of.

224
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Well, I don't agree with all of your categorizations,

225
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
but I do believe that there should be a hierarchy.

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And you know what?

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I honestly think that sequential art is at the top

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and then animation is below it

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and then video games are way below that.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What a surprise.

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The comic boy thinks that comics are the only thing there.

232
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, I know it's obvious.

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Wait, no, no, no, pros.

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Pros is better than video games, but below animation.

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard.

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know.

237
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
We should get too much into the hierarchy

238
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
because I have a very well-defined tier list that I will bring up.

239
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Well, hang on. What was Hippo saying?

240
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Well, I mean, if we're going to just say,

241
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
well, I like this one more than that one

242
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
and then just have a list and then we're all going to disagree.

243
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
I mean, what's that going to do?

244
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Yeah, that's bullshit.

245
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
It's going to be fun and we're going to argue about it.

246
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
We're going to yell, we're going to scream,

247
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
we're going to cry about it for an hour and a half.

248
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
No, are we done?

249
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Are we done with porn?

250
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Because I wanted to talk about porn.

251
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I like really, really cool castles.

252
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I like architecture.

253
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
I like medieval architecture.

254
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
That's my favorite art form.

255
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Castles are way cooler than Homestuck.

256
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Architecture is the lowest.

257
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Castles are fucking gay. They're overused.

258
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
They aren't even cool.

259
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
They're always gray and dusty.

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
That's why I hate Dark Souls.

261
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Architecture is the best man and utilitarian.

262
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Yeah, that's the thing.

263
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Dark Souls is only one step above analysis.

264
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Really, architecture is just pornography for manual labor.

265
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Here's the fucking...

266
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
There we go.

267
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Animation, video games, movies, comics.

268
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Munchy, calm the fuck down from it.

269
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Let Hippo finish this goddamn thought.

270
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
The only reason Dark Souls is good is because it evokes

271
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
imagery of castles and medieval weaponry

272
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
and I really like all those things.

273
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
So people who make physical, real things,

274
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
3D sculptures, sculptures, architecture,

275
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
that's the best, that's the coolest stuff.

276
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Physical objects are the worst.

277
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Physical objects are the worst.

278
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Do you ever just go on the internet

279
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
and shut the fuck up

280
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
and never speak to me ever again?

281
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
There's no internet.

282
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Physical objects are inherently inferior

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
to digital and intellectual.

284
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
This infuriates me about

285
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
fucking art fags.

286
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
You're always thinking about if I just draw all these great pictures

287
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
think about all the great things I'll be able to do.

288
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
No, don't you understand that the entire purpose of art

289
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
is to make real life better

290
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
to improve our actual tangible lives?

291
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
That's the whole point.

292
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
The purpose of art is to be itself

293
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
and be cool.

294
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
We're gonna run up against a wall.

295
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
We're gonna reach the end of that journey one day

296
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
and then we're gonna say,

297
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
well, let's make some more pictures.

298
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't give a fuck about pictures anymore.

299
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
We're gonna reach the end of the journey.

300
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
We're gonna hit, we're gonna be Starfleet

301
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
and then everyone's gonna be like, there's nothing left to do.

302
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
There's nothing left.

303
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
There's no point.

304
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
So life, humanity is doomed.

305
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
There's no point to anything.

306
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Art is meaningless.

307
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
We're gonna get to the end.

308
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
We're gonna be Starfleet.

309
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
There's gonna be nothing left to do except fucking art

310
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
and it's just gonna exist for its own sake

311
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
because there's gonna be no other purpose

312
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
that it needs to fulfill.

313
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I like standing in a place

314
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
that's really cool.

315
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Looking at a mountain range is cool to be there

316
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
but it's not cool to look at a picture of.

317
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
It's cool because you know how cool it is to be

318
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
looking at a mountain range in real life.

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Feeling that wind on your face.

320
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Art replicates life, right?

321
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Art is just derivative.

322
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Art is all not real.

323
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Everything that's real is cool.

324
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
I like going outside, I like looking at mountains,

325
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
I like seeing bricks, I like looking at rocks.

326
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Literally nothing that is real is cool.

327
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Nope.

328
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I love everything that's real.

329
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Never before in the history of the PCP

330
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
have I felt more like I'm just in a room

331
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
with insane people yelling at me.

332
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Everything that's being said by everyone

333
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
is completely insane.

334
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Like you yourself consider the mediums

335
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
YouTube and critique to be inferior

336
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
to almost all the other ones

337
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
and you dislike having to work within those mediums.

338
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
You make the same value judgements.

339
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Yeah, obviously

340
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
it's all relative

341
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
there's no medium better than the other

342
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
but on a day by day basis

343
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
everyone has these preferences.

344
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I hate YouTube because everyone on it sucks.

345
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
It doesn't mean I don't think it can be great.

346
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
YouTube can be just as great as any other medium.

347
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Every medium has potential to be

348
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
astounding.

349
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
The medium of web video

350
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
is just as good as any other medium

351
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
but the format of

352
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
for example

353
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
video game analysis

354
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
or anime analysis

355
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
or any form of video criticism

356
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
is inherently low and piss porn.

357
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I believe that criticism is not art

358
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
and should never be considered art.

359
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Of course.

360
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
This is why I didn't give a fuck

361
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
about the whole discussion of porn really

362
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
because

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is like a bullshit

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
genre of film

365
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that we arbitrarily have decided

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
what defines a porn

367
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and as we just saw with our whole argument

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
people value those things differently

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and our definition can change

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but none of that matters

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
because the point is

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
it's communicating things

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and it's either going to do that or not

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and then each of those ideas can be weighed for their value

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
or if they don't fucking accomplish anything

376
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
then obviously it's not worth having it

377
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
saying that like

378
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
French 19th century film

379
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
about the Alps

380
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
are like

381
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
that's my favorite genre

382
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
that's the best art form right there

383
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
that's equally arbitrary to me

384
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
is saying porn is all

385
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
whatever

386
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
but we can fucking define

387
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
we can define what porn is

388
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
even though the lines can be blurred

389
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
we can say porn is art

390
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
whose purpose is to get you off

391
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
and like we can take that

392
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
and go from there

393
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
and let me talk for a second

394
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
you know how like movies

395
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
are like they do like shit

396
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
and you're like happy about it

397
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
and you're also sad sometimes

398
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
they can make you feel different emotions

399
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
porn only makes you feel one emotion

400
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
and if it doesn't then it's not porn

401
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
I've decided

402
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
you know what

403
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I don't know

404
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I feel like there's a lost art to porn

405
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,300
I feel like there are things

406
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
I feel like what I value in a porn

407
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
is a rare is rare

408
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
and might actually be art

409
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
is it blacks?

410
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
no

411
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
I just go to black.com dude

412
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
I think that like the ultimate porn

413
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
would probably involve

414
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
some like deeply personal

415
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
emotional arc

416
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
that led you through all these characters

417
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
like innermost feelings and like culminated

418
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
yeah but Ben

419
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
if they made that you would just say

420
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
well that's not porn then

421
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
you're right

422
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I think the ultimate porn

423
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
is the one that most speedily and most efficiently

424
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
gets you to orgasm as quickly as possible

425
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
that would be the ultimate porn

426
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
and whatever that requires

427
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
it's cheaper to have any merit cause it's gay

428
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
if there was porn

429
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
that made me like literally fall in love with people

430
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
and then like

431
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
just made me like cry tears of joy

432
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
seeing them have sex with each other

433
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I would be like this porn is art

434
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
even the greatest film ever made

435
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
has never achieved that

436
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
there are some that aspire to that

437
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
but dude even the greatest drama

438
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
that's not what porn is at its core

439
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
even the greatest film

440
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
has never achieved that for anyone ever

441
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
so how could like porn

442
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
a sub genre

443
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
a small niche thing within all the film

444
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
possibly accomplish that

445
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
like I think you're setting your expectations way too high

446
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
through the media

447
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
my point is what it aspires to

448
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
most porn at its core

449
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
doesn't try to do that

450
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
porn at its core really just tries to get you off

451
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
every single artistic medium

452
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
or format

453
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
is all just a set of guidelines and boundaries

454
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
of what we decide that that format can be

455
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
and sooner or later by the very nature of it

456
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
someone in that little

457
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
in that box of guidelines

458
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
is going to make something that pushes on those boundaries

459
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
and possibly even breaks them out

460
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
so you can't just sit there

461
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
and as soon as something breaks those boundaries

462
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
say that it's not that thing anymore

463
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
if it started as that thing and pushed on those boundaries

464
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
then that makes it totally

465
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
just as valid as anything outside those boundaries

466
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
you fucking clods

467
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
it can still be valid without being

468
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
the thing

469
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
it's like a similar thing

470
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
but it's not quite the thing

471
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
but it's so easy to say that I don't think that this medium

472
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
is as valid as that medium

473
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
but then when this medium impresses you

474
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
that's not this medium anymore

475
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
that's completely recocculus and cockamamie

476
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
I have a very narrow definition of porn

477
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
any sex ever

478
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
so that can be applied to any movie or comic

479
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
and I'll always be upset

480
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
and when they leave those peer views

481
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
then I'm happy about it

482
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
and then it's fine

483
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Game of Thrones literally shows you goose dicks

484
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
that's porn

485
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
yeah

486
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm just saying you see

487
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
no one hates a sex as much as me

488
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
they get known throughout the land

489
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
I am the ultimate anti-sex crusader

490
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
does that make you redpilled

491
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
or bluepilled

492
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
have we discussed before?

493
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I'm a green pill

494
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Munchy is the leader

495
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
ever since Count Graduon was defeated

496
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
Munchy is the new leader

497
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
of the private villa of corrupted citizens

498
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
preventing Christian West and Chandler from getting laid

499
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
of course

500
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
I've expanded the group's ambitions

501
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
to not only Christian West and Chandler

502
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
but the entire universe

503
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you're doing God's work

504
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I really feel like I can't relate to this whole

505
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
talking about the

506
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
artistic endeavors of porn

507
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
because most porn is about sex

508
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and sex is very normal

509
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it happens a lot

510
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
so it's really easy to justify a context for it

511
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I seek out porn where not normal things happen

512
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
so there's a lot of questions about how to make that

513
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
narratively occur

514
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and so I get really excited with

515
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
this is an incredible context

516
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
to make this, that and that

517
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
happen all in the same narrative

518
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
god damn

519
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
I completely get where you're coming from

520
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
but does that have to occur in porn then?

521
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
is that related to the act of having sex?

522
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
it sounds like

523
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
let me backpedal

524
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
and be like okay

525
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
there have been pornographic stories

526
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
and materials that have actually really impacted me

527
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
and left me with a lasting impression

528
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
and been like wow that was art

529
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
but

530
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
there have been way more

531
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
that has just been hot

532
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
and has gotten me off

533
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
and what I would consider

534
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
good porn

535
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
and yet I don't think it's art

536
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
so it's like porn was just

537
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
an extra layer that may as well

538
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
didn't have to be there for that story to be told

539
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
it was just there

540
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
exactly

541
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
there have been some that have done both

542
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
it has happened

543
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
would it be smarter of us to define porn

544
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
to use what the word porn

545
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
as sort of an attachment

546
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
to a piece of artwork that can exist independently

547
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
or with this extra label of porn

548
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
it's obviously not a medium

549
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
no I don't think so

550
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
we'll see where that's what we're arguing about here

551
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
it's much more genre

552
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I think it's a porn if it's purpose is to get you off

553
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
it can be anything

554
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
it can even be actual sex

555
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
and I will consider it porn

556
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
like medium I believe used to mean literally

557
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
are you using a paintbrush or a chisel

558
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
so obviously porn is not a medium

559
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
real life for example

560
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
is a totally crass

561
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
and commercial and artistically

562
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
worthless work of pornography

563
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
of course

564
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
you guys are overcomplicating it

565
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
it just has sex therefore it's shit

566
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
well none of us agree with you on that

567
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
you're all just weird puritans

568
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I can't believe I've been friends with you this long

569
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
now I mean

570
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
we're arguing about artistic merit

571
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
what is the

572
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I don't even know

573
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I don't know what art even means

574
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
what has more artistic merit than fucking

575
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
in life nothing

576
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
define art as you say it

577
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
artistic merit

578
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
what does that mean

579
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
art is stuff that's good and I like

580
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
sex

581
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
anyone if you want

582
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
if you have something that you want to create

583
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
and then you create it then you have made art

584
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
and if that art

585
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
if I watch that art

586
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
and I go wowee

587
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
you've made great art and there you go

588
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
holy shit Jesse thank you

589
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
that was a definition I've always come with

590
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
by that definition are fruit roll-ups also art

591
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
because they make me say wowee

592
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
made of fucking like melted shoe bottoms

593
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I know but I love that

594
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
that's my favorite thing

595
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
if two people come together to create human beings

596
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
is that art

597
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
that's building art

598
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
I would say yes

599
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
the fact of raising a child could be interpreted

600
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
raising a child

601
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
we're getting off top

602
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
we're not supposed to be talking about what is art

603
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
because that's a nebulous fucking means nothing

604
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
we're talking about like the hierarchy

605
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
if one exists

606
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
let's talk about other things

607
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
like we've touched upon

608
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
the medium of web video

609
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
and whether it's valuable

610
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
and we've touched upon

611
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
oh god what was that other thing

612
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
there were some other things that was brought up

613
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I don't know

614
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I guess I've been arguing

615
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
analysis and critique

616
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
it is analysis and critique art

617
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
yes it is

618
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
it's definitely art

619
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
you know what it's exactly like porn

620
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
you can have an analysis

621
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
or a critique

622
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
that has elements

623
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
that are artistically valid and valuable

624
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
but the critique itself is not art

625
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
well okay I guess if critique

626
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
literally just means placing judgment on a thing

627
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
like if you do it with no creativity

628
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
whatsoever

629
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
then it's not artistic

630
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
but any review is going to be artistic

631
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
on some level so that's why it's called a medium

632
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
well any pornography is artistic

633
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
on some level you kind of like where do you put the camera

634
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
what music do you put over it etc

635
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
there's this general sense of

636
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
if a medium is largely bullshit

637
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
then it's lower on the hierarchy

638
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
because like porn

639
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
a lot of porn is shit a lot of reviews

640
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
are complete garbage

641
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
that are good so like the medium itself

642
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
is fine all the mediums are fine

643
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
no it's not what I'm saying

644
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I think that it's not about the

645
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
it's not just that most of it is bad

646
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
I think that it is inherently less valuable

647
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
yeah I agree

648
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
when I watch a really great anime

649
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
porn and criticism this is true of both of these things

650
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
okay you know what we should frame this

651
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
the idea of them isn't good

652
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I think we should frame this

653
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
I think it makes a lot more sense

654
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
we're going deep but it makes a lot of sense

655
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
to do it from the way that Ben was initially talking about it

656
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
like there are people out there

657
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
who make tons of money drawing porn

658
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
and then there are people who make

659
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
you know like much more

660
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I just like there's much more

661
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
thought put into like your average

662
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
comic of you know X amount of like

663
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
they're just like a picture

664
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
of a porn that is drawn with great technical skill

665
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
like I drew a monster girl she has big tits and a big dick

666
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
give me a hundred thousand dollars

667
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
that person is rewarded more by society

668
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
in the form of they get more money

669
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
to make an impact of porn

670
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
as opposed to just porn itself

671
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
well that's the whole thing the artistic mediums

672
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
that we think are crap is the question

673
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
so it's about our perception of

674
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
I just think that

675
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
medium is

676
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
it's just a way of expressing yourself

677
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
and you have preferences

678
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
depending on who you are and what you like

679
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
here's what I think about

680
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
well here's what I think about

681
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
criticism

682
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
aside from any other like artistic

683
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
considerations or additions

684
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
to a work of criticism the criticism

685
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
itself derives

686
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
all of its value from an existing

687
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
work of art being criticized

688
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
therefore it can't

689
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
the criticism itself yes

690
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
therefore it can't ever be

691
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
as valuable as the work of art from which

692
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
it derives its value it has to

693
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
be inferior

694
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
listen Ben listen to this great example

695
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
right here I forget what but there was some

696
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
movie you'll probably know the name of this

697
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
there's some movie that was made

698
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
it was like a Hollywood movie it was a complete

699
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
bust everyone working on it got fucked over

700
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
and nobody liked it

701
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
maybe you've heard of it its name was Star Wars

702
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
there was a

703
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
there was a documentary made about

704
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
this film that I can't remember the name of

705
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
that is like

706
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
much more celebrated

707
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
of a piece of

708
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
of art that was about

709
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
the making of this film

710
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
that details like the crazy experiences

711
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
that were had by the people trying to make

712
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
it was a troll too

713
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
it's very similar to that I think it's a

714
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
different movie but it's

715
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
talking about the making of

716
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
it's like the artistic value

717
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
of this no no no

718
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
yeah that is right that is not

719
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
a criticism of the movie

720
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
it is in part that is one of the things

721
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
that's when it started out as

722
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
now we're talking about all the other stuff

723
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
that's ancillary to the actual criticism

724
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
here's a here's how I think

725
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
I can't add anything to a criticism

726
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
other than just the criticism of the piece

727
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
which is obviously not true

728
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
that's not true

729
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
specifically in the case of Sonic the Hedgehog

730
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
a series where

731
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
god damn it Tavu we're not talking about Sonic the Hedgehog

732
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
we're talking about this other example

733
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
about uh

734
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
you know

735
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
has resulted in lots and lots of amazing reviews

736
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
and analysis from which I derive

737
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
so much enjoyment and indeed

738
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
all of the criticism that that franchise has seen

739
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
it all comes from details present

740
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
in the games themselves

741
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
if you want to use a metaphor you could say it's like

742
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
um cooking raw ingredients

743
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
that have these like flavors

744
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
that are trapped inside of them that you couldn't just

745
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
eat right off the shrub

746
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
it wouldn't be able to get the enjoyment but when processed

747
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
correctly by a critique

748
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
it draws out those uh those ingredients

749
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
and that's

750
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
that's something that was in the original piece

751
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
similar stuff like

752
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
the huge uh analysis

753
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
of the enchanted series

754
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
is much more entertaining than playing any of the

755
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
uncharted games

756
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
at least the first one

757
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
and also the game grumps let's play of Sonic 06

758
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
is obviously much more entertaining

759
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
than playing the game

760
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
so derivative things can be better

761
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
than the original

762
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I think there's something misguided

763
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
about trying to argue this on the basis of

764
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
you can make a good criticism

765
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
of a bad game

766
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
that doesn't really seem to be answering the question

767
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
I have solved this

768
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
dilemma about critique and criticism

769
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
and everyone needs to not say a single

770
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
goddamn word until I finish making this

771
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
point

772
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
we're all talking about critique and

773
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
criticism as though it has

774
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
lower value as art than other art

775
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
but the fact is critique and

776
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
criticism should not be considered art

777
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
and therefore it's worth

778
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
is irrelevant to this conversation and also

779
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
fucking

780
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
ugh

781
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
the way I see it

782
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I agree that it's not art

783
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
you can't disagree

784
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
because the point is not finished being made

785
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I thought you finished

786
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
rather than

787
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
seeing critique and criticism

788
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
as

789
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
artistic mediums we should see them

790
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
as what they are which is artistic

791
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
tools they are not art they are tools

792
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
to make art with

793
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
every work of art has some element of criticism

794
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
or critique or satire already in it

795
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
as part of its creation

796
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
so talking about criticism as though

797
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
it's a medium of art unto itself

798
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
is misguided and flawed and stupid because

799
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
critique and criticism

800
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
is essentially a paintbrush or a pencil

801
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
it's just another tool to make art with

802
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
okay yeah

803
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
okay with that

804
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
would you say that

805
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
wrestling isn't wrestling

806
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
that's a youtube video

807
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
that's a man making art

808
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
with the tool of critique

809
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
yeah so

810
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
would the medium be a film or a youtube video

811
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
or something what would you call that

812
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
any

813
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
great analysis video that you've seen

814
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
like a matthew matosis he's just making

815
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
he's making art

816
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
with the tool of critique

817
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
nice

818
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
if I make

819
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
if you make a parody of something

820
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
or a satire or something you're making

821
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
your own work of art with

822
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
your critique of another thing

823
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I agree with this

824
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
so the art itself is the video

825
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
that's being made

826
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
the critique is just

827
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
something you're using to make the video

828
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I agree with this but

829
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
and I guess the way to differentiate

830
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
videos from one another is to use genres

831
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
so analysis would also be

832
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
a genre of video

833
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
my point is I just don't think that it's relevant

834
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
or fair to

835
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I mean I don't think the hierarchy idea is fair

836
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
in general but to put like critique

837
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
and criticism like at the bottom of the hierarchy

838
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
is not fair because it shouldn't be even

839
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
in the hierarchy at all it's a tool

840
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
well it's funny is that

841
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
to devils advocate this

842
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
as I said a little bit ago that

843
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
originally like medium meant

844
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
what tools you used

845
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
like the medium of a painting

846
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
versus a sculpture

847
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
so like you know

848
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
anyway I actually agree entirely

849
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
with your point based on the current definition

850
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
of medium but I just figure some people

851
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
are going to be pedantic about this

852
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
that's fair so it's like

853
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
saying that like if I am a

854
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
landscape painter

855
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
and I make the best landscape

856
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
paintings I can and you know people like them

857
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
or they don't that's one thing but then

858
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
if fucking Ben St

859
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
landscape painting critic

860
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Waltz is by my booth

861
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
at the local art

862
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
landscape convention

863
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
yeah the landscape convention

864
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
is a youtuber who makes videos

865
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
in which he analyzes landscape paintings

866
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
that is like a whole different medium

867
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
that should obviously not be

868
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
directly compared to me

869
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
as a landscape painting creator

870
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
those are two very different types of art

871
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
they are very different

872
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
well yeah they're completely different

873
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
no they're yeah but they're not different

874
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
in the same way like a painting

875
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
and a work of prose are both

876
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
you know they're both aspiring to create

877
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
can you compare a sculpture to a video game

878
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I think you can

879
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I think you can

880
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I think you can more than you can compare

881
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
a criticism to

882
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
a book

883
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
it's just gonna be hard it's just gonna be really

884
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
like like state your case that

885
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
like the Venus de Milo

886
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
is a better piece of art than

887
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Undertale you know whatever

888
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
like you know you can you can

889
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I think you can argue that

890
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
the thing that we just just you know

891
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
discussed is that critique is not

892
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
an art form it's the medium

893
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
in which you're explaining

894
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
your critique is the art

895
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
so if you're making a YouTube video

896
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
you can compare a YouTube video critiquing

897
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
something else because it's a video

898
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
it's a thing in itself it's part of a

899
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
right right well anyway obviously

900
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
and I think it would and I think it would

901
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
come up short because

902
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
what it amounts to

903
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
is criticism

904
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
which is not artistically

905
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
on the same fucking wavelength

906
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
it's a video which means it can have more

907
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
than criticism in it it can have visuals and stuff

908
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
and it's gonna be really good it's gonna be the best video

909
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
you've ever seen so like there's no

910
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
you're right you're right and therefore it's not the

911
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
criticism that you like or that you

912
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
this is why and going back

913
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
criticism itself that's the art

914
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
right and going back to it like

915
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
a porn as in

916
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
a film with you know

917
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
sex for the viewer's sexual

918
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
gratification can in fact be

919
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
the best art piece in it because that porn

920
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
element is one element of it

921
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
and therefore as we've just discussed

922
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
it can have other elements as well

923
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
that may elevate it may synchronize with the porn

924
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
elements I actually think that

925
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
I would say that the porn

926
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
part is art whereas the criticism isn't

927
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
like I think that I think that

928
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
I think that like the sex part is like it's

929
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
more it's more comparable to other art

930
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
criticism is we need to

931
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
to make sure we understand

932
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
the difference between a tool used

933
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
to create art

934
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
you know a medium of art

935
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
if everything is a tool

936
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
to use to make a video like

937
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
the camera, the lighting, the people

938
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
having sex

939
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
the size of the penis, is that a tool

940
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
in the porn

941
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
it is

942
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
if those all go into a video

943
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
are we

944
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
arguing what tools

945
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
are better than others or what

946
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
whether videos are better than music

947
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
or whatever

948
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
like the current definition of medium

949
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
is the delivery method like if you were

950
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
to print out all of the assembly

951
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
code for Super Mario World on the paper

952
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
it would no longer be a video game though

953
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
it would technically be the same work

954
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
made with the same tools plus a printer

955
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm lost

956
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
well anyway the argument is over

957
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
because video games are the best medium

958
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
because they have all the other mediums

959
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
but also interactivity argument over

960
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
that's dumb there's no the best medium

961
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
totally disagree

962
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm lucky of mediums where I very clearly

963
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
well define

964
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
it's time for me to bust out

965
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
my fucking fallacy

966
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
I'm gonna bust out the fallacy of

967
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
saying that Davoo is wrong because he agrees

968
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
with someone who is bad

969
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
you know who else thinks that same exact thing

970
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
fucking Phil Fish, Davoo

971
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
therefore you're wrong because I've

972
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
associated you with a bad person

973
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
guilty by association

974
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I've done it, I've succeeded

975
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
every single time I've heard people talk

976
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
about these terrible Phil Fish quotes

977
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
I'm like this guy is hilarious, this guy kicks ass

978
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
yeah

979
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Phil Fish literally says in Indie Game the movie

980
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
that video games are the ultimate medium

981
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
because it's all the other mediums plus interactivity

982
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
yeah

983
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I mean it doesn't like some they have the same

984
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
stupid facial hair

985
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
me too

986
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
I don't agree with that sentiment logically

987
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
it just like

988
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
emotionally it makes perfect sense to me

989
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
because that's why I like video games the most

990
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
it's like you know when I

991
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I don't agree because interactivity can come between

992
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
an artistic message

993
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
as easily as it can

994
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
things will come between things in porn too

995
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
some games can use the interactivity

996
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
to make it better, some games have

997
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
an interactivity because it's a game

998
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
which makes the experience worse than if you're just watching it

999
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
yeah

1000
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
it's true

1001
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
I disagree

1002
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I want someone to program

1003
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
the godfather with cut scenes where

1004
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
you push like quick time events to make the scene

1005
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
continue

1006
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
interactivity is another tool

1007
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
you can't like mathematically say

1008
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
that a medium is better than others

1009
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
because it comprises elements

1010
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
of those other mediums

1011
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
the best work of art

1012
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
in any medium

1013
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
is better than all the mediocre works

1014
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
of art in every other medium

1015
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
yeah

1016
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
I know

1017
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
I know you're right Jesse I just don't want to

1018
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
quit being mad

1019
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
well okay we've been talking about this a lot

1020
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
I think that's the theme of this entire episode actually

1021
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
starting from the

1022
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
topic

1023
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
it's animation, video games, movies,

1024
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
comics, lists

1025
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
wait much you start over please

1026
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
start from the top and then going down

1027
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
animation, video games

1028
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
movies, comics, music

1029
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
books

1030
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
and then I would put

1031
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
our books even above

1032
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
zero or they under the zero level

1033
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
I would say they're

1034
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
they do more damage than good

1035
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
oh oh oh sculpture is below book

1036
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I'm going to go with

1037
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
so is individual paintings and drawings

1038
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
okay

1039
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
video games, then animation

1040
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
then sequential art, then live action

1041
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
film, then music

1042
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
then books actually probably put music

1043
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
above live action film

1044
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
and I sort of think of youtube videos

1045
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
as sort of like it's own like zero

1046
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
place it's like I don't care about it

1047
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
as much as any of the others and yet I care

1048
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
about it more than any of the others it's like it's own

1049
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
dimension

1050
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
okay cool well I don't actually want to hear everybody

1051
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I want to say mine I want to say that

1052
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
sequential art and pros are at the top

1053
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I would say that I would say animation

1054
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
is underneath both

1055
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
pros why the fuck would you put animation

1056
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
below comics how can you defend that

1057
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
I have my reason because it's gay

1058
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
music is at the very bottom

1059
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
music is at the very bottom

1060
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
yeah for some that I just feel that

1061
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I just feel that in my heart and so I'm going

1062
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
to go with it uncritically

1063
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
I would like to say that when I say sculpture

1064
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
it's not just like things in museums

1065
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
and whatever it's just like

1066
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
the feeling of being in the presence of

1067
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
something physical and real which no other

1068
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
thing has

1069
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
yeah Ben's talking about those 2D bullshit

1070
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
that isn't even real

1071
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
you know what

1072
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
actually that's not sculpture and individual

1073
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
paintings and drawings are the worst

1074
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
yeah I agree with that

1075
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
I just want to say that

1076
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
I can't upload those to my soundcloud account

1077
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
you know what true art

1078
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
the highest form of art has an emotional

1079
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
arc to it and a static

1080
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
image I mean I guess it can

1081
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
have an emotional arc to it but it usually

1082
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
doesn't it doesn't lend

1083
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
it doesn't lend itself to the having

1084
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
of an emotional arc same with the sculpture

1085
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
this whole conversation

1086
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
music can have an emotional arc to it

1087
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
and therefore it's better

1088
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
this whole conversation is completely insane

1089
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
there's no hierarchy

1090
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
every artistic medium has the same

1091
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
amount of prestige and value

1092
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
which is no prestige and value

1093
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
the mediums themselves have no goddamn value

1094
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
the works of art within said mediums

1095
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
are what have the goddamn value

1096
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
this whole conversation is goofy

1097
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
well the reason why I like to

1098
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
hierarchy things like this is because it helps me

1099
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
in making decisions as to what media

1100
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I want to consume and also create

1101
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
and also promote it just makes it

1102
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
like easy shorthand it makes it very

1103
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
convenient for me I don't agree with that

1104
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
because I don't actually want to consume

1105
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
any works of art even in the mediums that I

1106
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
purport to like so

1107
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
well it's all fucking shit

1108
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
there you go

1109
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
good then you're a reasonable person

1110
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
I just wanted to explain that I like

1111
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
being in physically around stuff

1112
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
rather than looking at a screen

1113
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
that's just generally my preference

1114
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
I think most of the art I consume

1115
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
is manga

1116
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,200
that's good that's high tier

1117
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
that's high tier you're doing it right

1118
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,200
hooray for me I'm glad I'm on your

1119
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,200
that's around mid tier

1120
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
you know what you know what it is you know what it is

1121
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
you know why I put animation below sequential art

1122
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,200
is because it commu

1123
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
okay okay

1124
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
you can communicate like

1125
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
a little more through

1126
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
animation you can communicate

1127
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
stuff in a moving picture

1128
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
than you can in a static one but not

1129
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
enough more to justify

1130
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
like the fucking like the amount

1131
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
of extra work that it takes

1132
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
oh so now it's an equation you have to do

1133
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
of effort input versus what you're able to get

1134
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,200
the work it takes to do something

1135
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
and how much money it costs it doesn't matter to the art

1136
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
whatsoever

1137
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
okay that's true

1138
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
fuck shit dammit

1139
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
there goes your

1140
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
I would say that like yeah animation

1141
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
is like it has to like

1142
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
it's sense of time has to be more realistic

1143
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
which can be good but you know

1144
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
when something is sequential art it can like

1145
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
tell stories with a specific kind of

1146
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
pace that doesn't have to make complete

1147
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
considerations for the sense of time

1148
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
digi actually has an old video about this

1149
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,200
called the problem with adapting

1150
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,200
shown in fight manga where it's like

1151
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
the problem with pacing and so much anime

1152
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,200
is that manga isn't written to like

1153
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
make sense with time and that's a power

1154
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
that sequential art has it can just sort of exist

1155
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
in this nether realm of time

1156
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
yeah that's an advantage I

1157
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
acknowledge that that's true though I think you probably

1158
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
could animate it

1159
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
I don't know you have control

1160
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
it wouldn't take too much to just make a brand new

1161
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
medium by just changing a few of the rules

1162
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
of any given thing that already exists

1163
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
well like there's only so many senses

1164
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
that you can appeal to at once

1165
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
I mean we could add smellovision you know

1166
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
suppositories

1167
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
like animation and film

1168
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
let's not smell them they all have like rules

1169
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
they have like things they need money they need to be

1170
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
on tv they need to be made for certain

1171
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
things

1172
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
and you can just take a medium

1173
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
and fuck it up like that book that's like

1174
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
all fucked up you know that one the house

1175
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
leaves or whatever house leaves yep that's a

1176
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
book that's not really a book

1177
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
you just make it it's a book well guys

1178
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
I know your point though

1179
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
to I have actually

1180
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
been lying this entire time

1181
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
oh yes because

1182
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
is that the kayfabe commander because

1183
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
you there is

1184
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
a specific medium of art

1185
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,200
that I detest so much

1186
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,200
that I view it as having inherently

1187
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
less value than

1188
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
any other artistic medium

1189
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,200
is it and that medium

1190
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
is slam poetry

1191
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
yep yep yep

1192
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,200
yep

1193
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
now I've never

1194
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200
defined slam poetry I'll define it

1195
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
for you and I'll clarify that I think

1196
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,200
that poetry

1197
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,200
itself is invaluable as art poetry

1198
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200
is

1199
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
demonstrably valuable

1200
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
but as a raps man I thought you would be

1201
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,200
sort of in tune with your

1202
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
poetic side slam poetry is not rap

1203
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
slam poetry is a perversion of poetry

1204
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
and rap it's like you took the worst aspects

1205
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
of rap and poetry and combined them

1206
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
into one and the one

1207
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,200
depressing stew with a disgusting

1208
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
the toxic brew that turns you

1209
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
into a that video

1210
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
I hate religion but I

1211
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,200
love Jesus that's I'm gonna get to that

1212
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,200
yeah that's what slam poetry

1213
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
is poetry

1214
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,200
which is fine which is which is beautiful

1215
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,200
it's art there's plenty of room to

1216
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,200
you can make a man cry with a good poem

1217
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
someone writes a poem

1218
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
but that's not good enough for them

1219
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
they have to they have to get up

1220
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,200
and they have to speak this poem

1221
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
with all the all the bad acting power

1222
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
they can possibly muster to try to

1223
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
to try to force an emotion into you

1224
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
by way of their voice yelling

1225
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,200
it at you and they put

1226
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
they put it on YouTube they put some cheesy

1227
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
like some public domain music behind

1228
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
to make it seem more inspirational

1229
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,200
and they just recite their bad poetry

1230
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
but they recite it in this arrogant

1231
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,200
aggressive pseudo-intellectual

1232
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
pompous pretentious way

1233
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
that's just this is my poetry

1234
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
and you will love my poetry

1235
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,200
and you have to feel something because

1236
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
I'm smart there's this one motherfucker on

1237
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200

00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,200
character from the Assassin's Creed games

and he stands in front of like some

1253
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
government building

1254
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,200
in like a hoodie with like the color saturation

1255
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
way down so it looks like it's like a gray

1256
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
a sad day

1257
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
and he starts talking about Jesus people don't

1260
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,200
believe in God anymore

1261
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,200
well I don't believe in people who don't

1262
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,200
believe in God because

1263
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Jesus came to take my sins

1264
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,200
and make me and it's like shut up

1265
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,200
you're ruining poetry you're ruining

1266
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200

1270
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
I I hate to be

1271
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
nitpicky but is this

1272
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
it sounds a little bit like it's criticizing

1273
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,200
you know like I don't know like

1274
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
like new metal

1275
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,200
for being like a shitty version of a

1276
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
particular genre of music

1277
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
is that wrong is that wrong

1278
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
hey hey I don't know about slam

1279
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
poetry on YouTube I don't know about that but I will

1280
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
say that I have been severely annoyed by poetry

1281
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
that I have heard like at parties

1282
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
that I have been to where like someone

1283
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
there is a poet and like they've like

1284
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
read their poetry out in a fucking

1285
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
thing yeah I have been severely

1286
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
annoyed by the way in which

1287
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
all so much poetry that people

1288
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
write and that read and that they take so much

1289
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
pride in just sounds like it was written

1290
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,200
for the purpose of sounding like poetry

1291
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
and it's all delivered in this very

1292
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
like this very like quote-unquote

1293
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,200
poetic way yeah and it's just like a

1294
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
series of lofty and evocative

1295
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,200
images like you know with some kind of emotional

1296
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,200
just add water

1297
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
poetic cadence that's like

1298
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
it's like it's like it's like yeah

1299
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
it's yeah it's like they're doing it

1300
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
just because they think it's supposed to be

1301
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
that way it's like it's like bag serial

1302
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
depth yeah can there be

1303
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
no good slam poet though

1304
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
I listen to a poet I listen to

1305
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
someone reading their poetry like that and I think

1306
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,200
doesn't this fucker know that

1307
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
art is meant to engage

1308
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
the audience and like I'm sitting

1309
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
here being bored out of my mind by this

1310
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,200
cookie cutter bullshit you've written and I

1311
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,200
feel like no effort has been made to engage

1312
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
me the audience which is what it's supposed

1313
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,200
to do and it's never even like clever like it's

1314
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,200
never cleverly put together there's no clever

1315
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
like structure or rhythm or wordplay

1316
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
to it it has it's always right and it's not

1317
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,200
even like clever like topics it's always like

1318
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,200
my dad beat me or I'm a feminist and here's

1319
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
why or I love Jesus and here's

1320
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,200
why there's there's no attempt at just

1321
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,200
the corny is shaken up and like surprise

1322
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,200
the corny's mother fuckers there's no surprise to it

1323
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
you know what I hate it there has to be

1324
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,200
there has to be something in there that will like

1325
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
surprise me or else why do I bother listening to

1326
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,200
you know what this sounds to me like it sounds like

1327
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,200
these people have been doing this and they

1328
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,200
they have been told that their performance is

1329
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,200
sufficient for the effect they're trying to

1330
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
achieve of connecting to the audience when

1331
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
actually that was people just telling them that

1332
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
it was sufficient when actually it's clearly not

1333
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,200
complete like people that write this kind of

1334
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,200
cookie cutter poetry that you hear at any

1335
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,200
fucking bullshit party of some assholes

1336
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,200
getting together and reading their shit it's

1337
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,200
they're just complacent here's what it is

1338
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
they're not they're not they're just not trying

1339
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,200
hard enough here's what it is to me it's

1340
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,200
a good poem does

1341
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,200
not ever need to be

1342
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,200
spoken to someone

1343
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
you read a poem and you feel something if

1344
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,200
it's fucking well if it's a good poem if it's

1345
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,200
a good point or it's well put together

1346
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,200
you can just read it if you

1347
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
have to like force if you

1348
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,200
have to audibly force an emotion into

1349
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,200
the audience then you have not written a good

1350
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,200
poem you've written a bad poem and you

1351
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,200

1357
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200

1364
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
there you go that's that's the important

1365
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
part that's my favorite part

1366
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,200
making fun of it

1367
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
it's the best I don't get it

1368
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
this listen buddy

1369
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,200
episode with your fucking

1370
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
with your crass

1371
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,200
derivative artwork

1372
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
that doesn't have any value

1373
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,200
outside of just referencing

1374
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,200
another video

1375
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
it's like this piece down

1376
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
and I'm not saying that like

1377
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,200
I'm not saying that like reading a poem

1378
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,200
invalidates the poem

1379
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,200
I'm saying that if a poem has to be read

1380
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
to have value then it's not a good

1381
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
poem like no one would read that

1382
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
ever like read that Jesus guys poems

1383
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
and think they were deep unless you were like already

1384
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,200
your religious moron so never mind

1385
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,200
but like for example

1386
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,200
I've I've done like open

1387
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,200
Mike and I've read poems that I've written

1388
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
on most of my you know the poems

1389
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
that I that I there's a video of me doing it

1390
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
but like the poems that I had written to recite

1391
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
there were like meant to make people laugh

1392
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,200
and like each line was a little punchline and like

1393
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,200
you know like who invented the fart

1394
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
he must have been awfully smart as hard to define what a glorious

1395
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
time we have in the flatulence starts that's just like

1396
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,200
it's just people just hear that and they chuckle

1397
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,200
it's just like a little belly laugh like a little belly

1398
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,200
laugh lyric and that's fine or like the poem

1399
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,200
that I wrote about the newlyweds and there they're both

1400
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,200
gross and I'm just like describing

1401
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,200
like gross people fucking and each line

1402
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
makes people laugh that's not what I'm talking about

1403
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,200
I'm just talking about like the pseudo

1404
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,200
deep pretentious fucking

1405
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,200
my my father beat me and I'm a feminist

1406
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
who believes in Jesus too much

1407
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,200
kind of like yeah with the with the

1408
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,200
inspirational music the inspirational

1409
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
music is what gets me the most it's so fucking

1410
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
transparent

1411
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
I hate all inspirational music all the time

1412
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
but you use it

1413
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
all the time in your videos

1414
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
I make it inspirational

1415
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
by the way I use it

1416
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
it's me with the I'm the one

1417
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
who supplies the inspiration not the music

1418
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
but anyway

1419
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
in fact I'm the one making the music

1420
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
inspirational when I put music

1421
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
in my videos

1422
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
books are not sharing great books are high tier

1423
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
books are the lowest tier

1424
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
God damn it that's ridiculous

1425
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,200
books are fucking how can you

1426
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,200
books are pure books are artistically pure

1427
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
how can you not place value

1428
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,200
on like the the inherent

1429
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
unique intonation and rhythm of the

1430
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
written word by various different authors

1431
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
it's obvious

1432
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
because mum because fucking

1433
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200

1438
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
we've been talking about mediums as the modern

1439
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,200
definition of them is the you know partly it comes

1440
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
down to like the the means by which

1441
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
the information is delivered

1442
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,200
to the to the consumer and

1443
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
Jesse himself has a video

1444
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
criticizing heavily the medium with

1445
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
which prose is usually

1446
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,200
delivered to the consumer in the form of a book that you can't

1447
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,200
really hold in any one position

1448
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
that will be comfortable for that video is retarded

1449
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
it should never be taken seriously

1450
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,200
by anyone who's gonna make

1451
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
that video yeah obviously physical

1452
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
media is terrible but like what

1453
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
that what a book is is getting

1454
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
to you like the pros contained within

1455
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
a book is artistically pure

1456
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
and pros and the written word is like it's the

1457
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
most efficient way

1458
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
of fucking taking some intellectual

1459
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
idea or concept or opinion you have

1460
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
and fucking communicating it to an audience

1461
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
and it's beautiful yeah I can

1462
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
pick in moment minute that's right

1463
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
it's no no it's not pros is

1464
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
not pros a tool then

1465
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
because you can use pros to write scripts

1466
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,200
for videos exactly

1467
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
that's what I'm trying to say

1468
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
what the fuck off what are you talking about

1469
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
the way you consume a book is different

1470
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
the way you consume a book is different is worthless

1471
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
pros is a medium

1472
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
critique is not a medium

1473
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
yeah we know critique is not a medium

1474
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
but however like if you put a critique in a word

1475
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
visual is good Ben if you put a critique

1476
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
as a like a book

1477
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
a book a physical book or a digital book

1478
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
or whatever and it is a critique of something else

1479
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
yeah yeah the tool is critique

1480
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
yeah that's yeah you know Ben

1481
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
the tool of critique in your fucking

1482
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
the medium is a book it's not pros

1483
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
because pros you can fucking

1484
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,200
you mean it's not pros Ben if you love

1485
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,200
pros so much why don't you go start

1486
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
the pros crastinators

1487
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
got em

1488
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,200
oh boy

1489
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
the reason why that whole how

1490
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,200
video games encapsulate all the other

1491
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
mediums and that's why it's the best it's because

1492
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
when you're reading a book it's like I'm only

1493
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
the reading part and like there's only

1494
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
certain parts of my brain that are being in your

1495
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
dry side when you're playing a video game

1496
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
all your senses are being done

1497
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
every that's gay

1498
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,200
I have a problem

1499
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,200
I have a problem reading books

1500
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,200
I know it's probably stupid

1501
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
to say this out loud

1502
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,200
but I just I can't pick up a book and read it

1503
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
it's too hard

1504
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
here's why I'm retarded and Jesse's been

1505
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
here's why I'm retarded

1506
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
and Jesse's been right all along

1507
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
wait let me get it real quick

1508
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
no I need to hear this it's important

1509
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
alright alright like

1510
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
sure yeah like maybe

1511
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
there's more tools

1512
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
to use in a video game

1513
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
comics have art in addition

1514
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,200
to pros so they're better

1515
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,200
but what it really comes down to is that

1516
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
great art is made

1517
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
for its medium and if you

1518
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
make a work that just

1519
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
takes the medium you're using

1520
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,200
and rings every

1521
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
bit of meaning and feeling and value

1522
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
out of it then you've got

1523
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
a great work of art and it doesn't matter

1524
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
that like pros is a more limited

1525
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
work or a medium than

1526
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
sequential art like if you have

1527
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
fucking used it to its fullest extents

1528
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
then you've made a great work of art

1529
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
and in that and so obviously all mediums

1530
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
are fucking Jesse was right

1531
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Ben admitted it Jesse was right everybody

1532
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,200
the day is finally come

1533
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
when fucking everyone admits that I'm

1534
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
right and always have been about everything the fucking

1535
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
confetti the balloons are coming down from the

1536
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,200
ceiling I was right twice in this podcast

1537
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
I was right about everything that I said about

1538
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
every artistic medium they're all having

1539
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,200
the same value and I was also right about

1540
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
slam poetry having even less value

1541
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
somehow I was right about both of those

1542
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
I was right about both things somehow

1543
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,200
even though they contradicted each other it doesn't matter

1544
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
that's why I didn't get into the whole hierarchy

1545
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
I didn't have a hierarchy I didn't give

1546
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
anything there's no

1547
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
smart boys there's no hierarchy

1548
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,200
but slam poetry is

1549
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
still at the bottom of it

1550
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
yeah and that's what I call

1551
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,200
a slam dunk of an argument

1552
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
that no one can fucking topple

1553
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
it's uh I just noticed that

1554
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,200
after I asked for questions on

1555
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Twitter at TP Crasinators

1556
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
one of the first ones was our friend

1557
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
mumke at mumke away

1558
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,200
who asked the question is analysis

1559
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
an art form so he's still on this topic

1560
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
and it has been a drag

1561
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
I was obviously not one

1562
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
well he can

1563
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
just listen back I don't care

1564
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
to repeat all that shit again

1565
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,200
okay I think we're done let's go to questions

1566
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,200
we've only been going for like 45 minutes

1567
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
I just said let's go to questions

1568
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
thoroughly analyzed analysis as well

1569
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,200
as Jesse's

1570
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
inspirational rightness about all

1571
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,200
things I think we can move on to questions

1572
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
now I know I still watch

1573
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
how much I hate books I have

1574
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
we get it dude I hate books

1575
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
I want to hear it I want to hear it

1576
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
because I like looking at like

1577
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
colors books usually aren't in colors

1578
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
like black and white and they're

1579
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
hard to look at and they're like

1580
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
they're like gay ones

1581
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,200
what about coloring books

1582
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
nooooo

1583
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,200
nooo

1584
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
that's three

1585
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,200
that's a hat trick

1586
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
I kind of agree that books are hard to look at

1587
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
I like books to have

1588
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
at the beginning of the chapter they have a nice little image

1589
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
and I'm like aha that's nice

1590
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
then I continue reading

1591
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
that's because drawings are better than words that's true

1592
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
It's nice to have a mixture. It's nice to have a mixture of books.

1593
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Nope, nope. You were at the first time.

1594
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Yeah, you did it.

1595
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
I love Killers books. I love color books.

1596
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
They're so good. I love adding red and green.

1597
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
I love coloring books. They make me feel smart because I'm three years old.

1598
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Yeah, dude.

1599
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,200
Woo!

1600
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
Alright, let's go to some questions here.

1601
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Hopefully, we'll find some that aren't retarded.

1602
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
Now remember, everybody,

1603
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
Santa's questions all the time.

1604
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,200
Did you mean to say art retarded or did you mean to say art related?

1605
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
Who? Me?

1606
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Yeah, you.

1607
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
You said art retarded.

1608
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,200
You said art retarded.

1609
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
Well, whatever I said, make it the good one.

1610
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
That's what I intended to say.

1611
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Right.

1612
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
Yeah, everybody, make sure you ask us questions

1613
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,200
at tpcrastinators on Twitter.

1614
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
Everybody, remember, don't be retarded.

1615
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Before we do that,

1616
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
we should mention that this podcast,

1617
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
this PCP is now on patreon.com.

1618
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
Oh, you're going to say that at the end.

1619
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,200
This week,

1620
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
we're putting up the patreon.

1621
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
No, you're underplaying this, guys.

1622
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Huge announcement, everybody.

1623
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
There is in the description

1624
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
a link to the

1625
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
procrastinators podcast

1626
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
patreon link.

1627
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
We're doing a thing.

1628
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
We're all of our main weekly episodes like this,

1629
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
or perhaps the drawcasts when we do them,

1630
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,200
or the races, any of our main PCP content

1631
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
is going to be added to that patreon.

1632
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
We've got to stretch that.

1633
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
We're definitely not putting the podcast on there.

1634
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Do not worry.

1635
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
It's only going to be

1636
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
major PCP

1637
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
group things

1638
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
like this main podcast.

1639
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
The drawcast and races.

1640
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Basically, if you like hearing us talk,

1641
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
but you hate all of us individually

1642
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,200
and all of our individual creative endeavors,

1643
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
you don't have to pay for that bullshit.

1644
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
I've seen people.

1645
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
I've seen quite a few people wanting to give money

1646
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
directly to you.

1647
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,200
Word on the street is...

1648
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
Look at this little fucking bird.

1649
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
It's dead now, but look, it had a message.

1650
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
What? Okay.

1651
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
If you donate amount of money

1652
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
that I forgot, you're going to get in your

1653
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
fucking little inbox. You're going to open it.

1654
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,200
What's in here? Any more procrastinators?

1655
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
It's a fucking bonus episode.

1656
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
It's a bonus episode.

1657
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
Oh, that's right.

1658
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,200
Bonus episode.

1659
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
$5 at the $5 Patreon amount.

1660
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,200
You get access to extra

1661
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
episode of PCP.

1662
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
More content that you can literally even

1663
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
suck.

1664
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Is it one a month?

1665
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
Is it one extra per month?

1666
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
We're going to do one a month.

1667
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
This is just an

1668
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
extra thing that we're going to do

1669
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,200
to get people to give us money.

1670
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,200
There's a hugely

1671
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
important factor that needs to be said.

1672
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
This is not

1673
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
replacing any of our own Patreons.

1674
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
If I hear of one goddamn one of two motherfuckers

1675
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
who unpledged to any of us to pledge to the

1676
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,200
PCP, then we'll shut it all down.

1677
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
We'll shut the whole thing down.

1678
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,200
We might.

1679
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,200
No one unpledged

1680
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,200
from anyone.

1681
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
We would really prefer that this be

1682
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
a secondary concern, I think,

1683
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
for our individual ones.

1684
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,200
I would just like to say that

1685
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,200
the money from the Patreon

1686
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,200
is going to be divided amongst the members

1687
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,200
based on how many appearances

1688
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,200
they make in the podcast.

1689
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
On some level, it will also go

1690
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,200
to enhancing infrastructure.

1691
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200
For example, we're actually

1692
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,200
going to pay someone to edit

1693
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
so as to stick to a schedule.

1694
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,200
We're also in the near future.

1695
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,200
Behind the scenes is too much information.

1696
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
I think that's appropriate to say,

1697
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
but as soon enough, we'll be working on trying

1698
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
to get it up on iTunes and shit.

1699
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
I'm going to pocket all that money.

1700
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Everybody!

1701
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Skimming a little off the top.

1702
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Basically, all that matters.

1703
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,200
We're looking to expand and this money

1704
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
is the way that we can make some

1705
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
infrastructure enhancements that would

1706
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,200
have just come out of our pockets, but otherwise

1707
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
there will be ways to do it.

1708
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Listen guys.

1709
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
You fans, you all know

1710
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
that I'm God

1711
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,200
and that if you press one

1712
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
to me right now in the comments

1713
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,200
I get even more

1714
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,200
power.

1715
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
But here, if you donate one

1716
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
dollar,

1717
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
that's the equivalent of a thousand

1718
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,200
times.

1719
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,200
I can't believe I didn't think to make

1720
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,200
the one dollar pledge like a

1721
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
monthly related one thing.

1722
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,200
I got to do that as soon as we're done.

1723
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,200
That's the important thing to remember.

1724
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Everyone give us money,

1725
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
but also still give me money

1726
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
on top of that.

1727
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Patreon.com

1728
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Slash.

1729
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
The pro and fascinators part.

1730
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
There we go.

1731
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Thank you.

1732
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
There we go.

1733
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
I think is what it's called.

1734
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
It's patreon.com slash the

1735
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
procrastinators.

1736
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,200
If that doesn't work

1737
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,200
just click the link in the description.

1738
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
It might change, but I think that's what it's going to be.

1739
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,200
This is going to be the death of us.

1740
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
That's fucking all

1741
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,200
sorted and done with.

1742
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
We've done it everyone.

1743
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
It's been a long time coming.

1744
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
Let's go to some questions.

1745
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,200
Here is a one for Munchie

1746
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
to the group.

1747
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,200
What level of Christ consciousness

1748
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,200
are you all on?

1749
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
I'm at the highest level baby.

1750
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
I'm level 7 bro.

1751
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,200
By the way that's by

1752
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Chiaro333.

1753
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Munchie can you scan me?

1754
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
I don't know how to figure it out.

1755
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
Alright.

1756
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Let me see.

1757
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,200
You got that nice pale skin.

1758
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
You got those fucking

1759
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
oh yeah bro.

1760
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Alright.

1761
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,200
2.

1762
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
Are most people at 2?

1763
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
What are most people at?

1764
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
The default if you're like

1765
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
if you're like Ben St.

1766
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
you're at 1.

1767
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
Man I'm down with

1768
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
the Christ consciousness.

1769
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,200
Ben St. the default man.

1770
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,200
What the fuck?

1771
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,200
That's like the worst thing anyone's ever said to me.

1772
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,200
You open the character creation menu

1773
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
and just the default

1774
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,200
he's just the template

1775
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
from which you add shit.

1776
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,200
That's fucking hilarious.

1777
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,200
Here's a question from

1778
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
our old friend Onwe.

1779
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
What's our Christ consciousness?

1780
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
I mean how deep do you want to go?

1781
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,200
Give us all a first score.

1782
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
Alright Jesse

1783
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
you're at a 4.

1784
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,200
Yeah!

1785
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,200
That's pretty good.

1786
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,200
Your chocolates are moderately aligned.

1787
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
Nate

1788
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,200
You're

1789
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
you're at a 2.

1790
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
You have room for improvement.

1791
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,200
I agree. I hate Jesus.

1792
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Ben is at a 1 of course.

1793
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
I'm at a 7.

1794
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,200
Davoo is at an 8.

1795
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Oh shit.

1796
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,200
Oh my god.

1797
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Does that mean Jesus is his son?

1798
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
He just edited his own consciousness

1799
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
to be Christ low light.

1800
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,200
Yeah I know it's fucking cheating

1801
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
but you know I have to abide by the rules.

1802
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,200
It's not a game, not the player.

1803
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,200
I love this saying.

1804
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,200
I love the fucking Christ consciousness.

1805
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,200
That's how you know that

1806
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
Nate is a fucking zero.

1807
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
You're a fucking zero.

1808
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,200
I'm such a disgusting piece of cake.

1809
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,200
We'll have to ask the slam poetry Jesus guided

1810
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
to know what Christ consciousness truly means.

1811
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
Yeah.

1812
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Christ consciousness is how many dimensions

1813
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
you can travel basically.

1814
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,200
It's high how your consciousness

1815
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,200
and how

1816
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,200
so I'm a 4 dimensional being

1817
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
is what you're saying.

1818
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
And Hippo are you saying?

1819
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,200
No I was just

1820
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,200
remarking on the fact that Jesse is half the amount of God.

1821
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
That Davoo is.

1822
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,200
Ben's a 1 dimensional being.

1823
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
I'm a 1 dimensional character.

1824
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
I'm a flat character.

1825
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
He's just a line.

1826
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Yeah just a line.

1827
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Here's a silly question.

1828
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,200
Yes.

1829
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,200
Here's a silly question,

1830
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,200
but it might be interesting to hear.

1831
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,200
Anui on me asks,

1832
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,200
at what point did you realize you were internet famous?

1833
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,200
Right now.

1834
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,200
When you asked that question.

1835
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
I know exactly when I realized it.

1836
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,200
Her name was Caitlyn.

1837
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,200
None of us are.

1838
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,200
I don't think any of us really are.

1839
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
I realized I was internet famous

1840
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,200
when Jesse made cruising with Munchie.

1841
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,200
That's when I realized.

1842
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
Wait what was cruising with Munchie?

1843
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
It was all the Munchie isms

1844
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,200
from the memes that need to die podcast

1845
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
in its own video with Vaporwave in the background.

1846
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,200
I felt internet famous

1847
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,200
as soon as Gibb and Take featured

1848
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,200
Kagan Phantom in an analysis assemblage.

1849
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,200
I agree.

1850
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
I think generally being put in someone else's video

1851
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,200
or someone making a video about you

1852
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,200
makes you internet famous.

1853
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,200
But the moment

1854
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,200
I can definitely

1855
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,200
I also felt pretty famous

1856
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
in my current nonpony incarnation

1857
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
when

1858
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Joji's Magic Supplies made an analysis video

1859
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
fucking analyzing my comics.

1860
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,200
Go watch that.

1861
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,200
It's like comparing the Vapers

1862
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,200
to Watamote and

1863
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,200
one other thing that I forget.

1864
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Some wrestling guy recently made

1865
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,200
a top 5

1866
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,200
he made a top 5 AMVs of all time

1867
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
even though he's not really an anime guy.

1868
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,200
He put MyGurr and Login1 at number 2.

1869
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
He was weird.

1870
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
He started it off and was using mine

1871
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,200
of how you can make a genius one

1872
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,200
in this thing he was doing.

1873
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,200
Mine was only number 2

1874
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,200
and some Run of the Mill

1875
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood one

1876
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,200
was number 1.

1877
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,200
I don't understand why he set it up that way

1878
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,200
if I wasn't going to be number 1.

1879
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,200
That was cool. That was nice.

1880
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,200
Second best guy ever.

1881
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,200
I don't know about...

1882
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,200
I just thought that was a weird way to structure it.

1883
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,200
That's kind of harder to wrap my head around

1884
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,200
but having fans

1885
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,200
that actually appreciate me

1886
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,200
I remember that first happened as a moment

1887
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,200
when some comic was like

1888
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,200
I'd be sad if DeVoo stopped making videos

1889
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
and I'm like whoa

1890
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
someone would be sad if I didn't exist.

1891
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
That's way more meaningful than someone being happy

1892
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
that you do exist.

1893
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
I agree.

1894
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,200
I think of internet famous as something a bit bigger

1895
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
than just having fans that are in a group

1896
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
that can be...

1897
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,200
It's still thousands of people

1898
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,200
I think internet famous is when

1899
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,200
you haven't satisfied

1900
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,200
some incredibly specific standard

1901
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,200
that they think you are obligated to follow

1902
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,200
because of your level of fame.

1903
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Internet famous truly

1904
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,200
is when the first time you get laid

1905
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,200
from being a fan.

1906
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,200
That's exactly what I was going to say.

1907
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
I remember the moment where I truly felt

1908
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,200
like wow I've made it

1909
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,200
was in 2013

1910
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,200
when the first time that I fucked a fan

1911
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,200
when she got on a plane

1912
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
and came all the way here

1913
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,200
to my dingy little basement

1914
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,200
just to cuck her boyfriend

1915
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
and get the endless D

1916
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,200
for three days.

1917
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,200
I looked up at the stars

1918
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,200
the night that I dropped her off at the airport

1919
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,200
to send her back on her way home

1920
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,200
because I was done with her.

1921
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,200
I went out and I laid in the grass

1922
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
and I looked at the stars

1923
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
and I looked at the Big Dipper

1924
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
and I reminisced about my Big Dipper

1925
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
going into her.

1926
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
I said I truly made it

1927
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,200
part of the story as well.

1928
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,200
Everyone was there.

1929
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,200
Donatello was there

1930
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
and Commander Shepard won

1931
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,200
the whole gang.

1932
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,200
Did Donatello get a turn?

1933
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,200
No. None of my retarded characters

1934
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,200
are allowed to encroach on my fornication activities.

1935
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,200
I've seen your sex tape Jesse.

1936
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
I've seen Cole Corona's sex tape.

1937
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
I know the truth.

1938
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
He's uploaded it

1939
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
on every streaming site known to man.

1940
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,200
He's been blocked from

1941
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
every web hosting site ever.

1942
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,200
He's a monster.

1943
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,200
Here's one that's kind of relevant

1944
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,200
to our discussion today.

1945
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,200
Donovan at Donovan on Guts

1946
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
asks, what's the most

1947
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,200
out there or difficult to get into

1948
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,200
piece of media that you enjoy?

1949
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,200
We're just kind of relevant to our discussion about media.

1950
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,200
Homestuck, easy.

1951
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,200
Homestuck is super fucking easy.

1952
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,200
It's literally like this.

1953
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Homestuck is hard to get into

1954
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,200
because I hate it and I have no desire to get into it.

1955
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,200
Homestuck's fucking easy.

1956
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,200
Everyone who says it's long or hard to do is gay.

1957
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,200
That's like saying fucking and handling a hard media.

1958
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,200
It's not just that it's long though.

1959
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,200
It's that it's long and also queer as fuck.

1960
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Hold on. Very important difference here.

1961
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Hard to get into for you

1962
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,200
back when you first got into it

1963
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,200
or hard for people to get into in general.

1964
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,200
That's a very important distinction.

1965
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,200
That's pretty hard to get into.

1966
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,200
For you.

1967
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,200
Also, oh, you know what?

1968
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Fucking dwarf fortress.

1969
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,200
Yeah, you know what? Actually,

1970
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,200
I really enjoyed dwarf fortress.

1971
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,200
I know I would love it. Yeah, I have not yet

1972
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,200
succeeded in getting into it, so I'm going to go with that too.

1973
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,200
I have one.

1974
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,200
It's the hardest thing for me to get into

1975
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,200
was the Legend of Zelda franchise

1976
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,200
because I always hated Link from Plain Smash

1977
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
and everyone liking Link more than Samus.

1978
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,200
And that's why

1979
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,200
I didn't want to get into it. That's really hard.

1980
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,200
I think

1981
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,200
that any anime

1982
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,200
is just like chink shit going on.

1983
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,200
And it's like...

1984
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,200
You're right about that, dude.

1985
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,200
Okay, here's a juicy question.

1986
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,200
At

1987
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Varamir9 wants to know

1988
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
are there any new memes that need

1989
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,200
to die?

1990
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Any big ones that people

1991
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,200
have been burning to see

1992
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,200
executed? Well, the Undertaler needs to live.

1993
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,200
Yeah, he has to live.

1994
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,200
He must live. Yeah, he's got a bright future.

1995
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,200
Oh my gosh, it's been

1996
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,200
a freaking other day. Did I miss the

1997
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,200
PCP recording today?

1998
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

1999
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,200
Okay,

2000
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,200
I'm leaving now.

2001
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,200
Bye.

2002
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,200
He was banging his chest on the way out

2003
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
in case he didn't hear.

2004
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,200
What a good man.

2005
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,200
He was so polite.

2006
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,200
He just wanted to know.

2007
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
When he knew his service wasn't easy to do that.

2008
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,200
We're never mad at the

2009
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,200
people there.

2010
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,200
It's hard to be, because you're so oppressed

2011
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,200
in our, you know...

2012
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,200
Never mind, moving on.

2013
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,200
I mean the need to die.

2014
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,200
I didn't have the wherewithal to follow through

2015
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,200
with that statement. I think I'm the only one

2016
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,200
that this question is relevant to, but it's

2017
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,200
quick and I thought I'd answer it.

2018
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,200
At MichaelCera4 just asked,

2019
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,200
for those of you who have taken Nihongo,

2020
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,200
or that's Niponese, for those of you

2021
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,200
who don't speak the devil's tongue,

2022
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,200
who've taken Nihongo class,

2023
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,200
what was your experience like as Japanese?

2024
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,200
Talking about Japanese.

2025
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,200
I listened to some

2026
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
learn Japanese tapes on tape that I got

2027
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,200
from the library one summer, and it was kind of fun.

2028
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,200
I would say, I really enjoyed it.

2029
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,200
I enjoyed learning the alphabet.

2030
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
It was like a transforming experience

2031
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,200
once I was able to read the letters

2032
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,200
of the Japanese language, the hiragana and katakana,

2033
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,200
and I was never very good at the speaking,

2034
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,200
but I think it's really fun, so I encourage you to do it.

2035
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Nate,

2036
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,200
why do you think this doesn't apply to me?

2037
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,200
Fluent fucking Japanese.

2038
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,200
We don't all have that level

2039
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,200
of Christ consciousness.

2040
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,200
Yeah, when you hit Christ

2041
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,200
consciousness level 5 and above,

2042
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,200
you automatically unlock speaking Japanese

2043
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,200
as a bonus fee.

2044
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,200
I've been trying to get into Japanese for a long time.

2045
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
There's a great website,

2046
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,200
JapanesePod101.com

2047
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,200
who's just like so fucking,

2048
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
he's so goddamn enthusiastic.

2049
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,200
We're like, guys, now we're going to talk about grammar.

2050
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,200
I can't wait.

2051
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,200
And the Japanese people

2052
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,200
who we co-host with are like, yep,

2053
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,200
and it's cool, so that was my experience.

2054
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
It's cool, I just need to...

2055
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,200
It's simply a matter of prioritizing

2056
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
it over other things I can do,

2057
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,200
so once I'm out of other things to do,

2058
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,200
I'll get back to that.

2059
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,200
I'll prioritize you over other things I can do, you fuck.

2060
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,200
What's, do you know what that means?

2061
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,200
It means Naruto.

2062
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Yeah.

2063
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,200
Oh wait, I was thinking of a different word.

2064
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,200
Yeah, weird Narutoism.

2065
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,200
Itadakimasu.

2066
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,200
Itadakimasu.

2067
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,200
Oh wait, what are you talking about?

2068
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,200
I know perfect Japanese.

2069
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,200
Sakurakangikimasu.

2070
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,200
Sakurakangikimasu.

2071
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,200
Smile DK, that's the only Japanese word I know.

2072
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Smile DK for the camera.

2073
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,200
It's me.

2074
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,200
I'm back to smile for the camera.

2075
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,200
It's me, the Donkey Kong trailer.

2076
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:24,060
I'm a fucking

2077
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,200
You guys, should we open up the suggestions

2078
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,200
ideas for draw casts?

2079
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,200
We should, yes,

2080
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,200
actually we should, because I really want

2081
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,200
to do more of them.

2082
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,200
Tweet that right now and we'll think about it.

2083
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it, do it.

2084
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Don't tell me it'll live my life.

2085
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Draw casts, draw cast suggestions,

2086
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,200
because we're all just completely at a loss

2087
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,200
for what to draw.

2088
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,200
Who will draw favours YouTube?

2089
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,200
No.

2090
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,200
We'll draw cubes, we'll draw

2091
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,200
rectangles, we'll draw

2092
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,200
cones.

2093
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,200
I have no original character who is a box,

2094
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,200
so that would work out.

2095
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,200
Does the box have any distinguishing characteristics?

2096
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,200
Her name is Mrs. Box,

2097
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,200
and she's a dolled up gal.

2098
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,200
That sounds awesome.

2099
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,200
That sounds rad. Hey, Munchy, when's

2100
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,200
fucking Investigator coming out? Shut the fuck up, Ben.

2101
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,200
You fucking black sympathizer,

2102
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,200
it'll come out when you're around. I really want it.

2103
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,200
I want it right now.

2104
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,200
You're dead. I love you.

2105
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,200
Thank you, I love you too.

2106
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,200
I care about you, and I just want the best

2107
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,200
for you.

2108
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
I'll renounce my devilish ways

2109
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
and get back to work.

2110
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,200
Thank you.

2111
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,200
That's all I wanted.

2112
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,200
That's all I wanted to hear. You got to retake that

2113
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,200
Christ consciousness and put it to good work.

2114
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,200
Okay, I think we're done. All these questions are bullshit.

2115
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,200
Ask better questions next time, you idiots.

2116
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,200
You can't be coming on for anything.

2117
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,200
Okay, thanks for listening, everybody.

2118
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,200
www.picture.com.

2119
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,200
Yeah, make sure to go to

2120
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,200
$1 for Munchy, $1 for $1, $1, $1, $1.

2121
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,200
Click the link in the description.

2122
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,200
The patreon.com

2123
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,200
slash procrastinators meme is going to

2124
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,200
slowly push out the patreon.com

2125
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,200
slash ben saint meme.

2126
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,200
No!

2127
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
And make sure that you

2128
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,200
ask us more questions

2129
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,200
and give us topics at TPCrastinators

2130
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,200
so go follow us on Twitter and shit.

2131
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,200
And suggestions for drawcasts.

2132
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,200
And drawcast suggestions suggest everything.

2133
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,200
Whatever.

2134
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,200
Easily.

2135
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,200
That's the good one.

2136
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,200
It definitely has the least artistic value

2137
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,200
of any content.

2138
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,200
Oh, yeah.

2139
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,200
We need to discuss how much value podcasts have.

2140
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
Wow.

2141
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
Zero.

2142
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
You really are the least

2143
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,200
artistic value.

2144
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
That's what you say.

2145
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,200
No, but you know what?

2146
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,200
That makes this episode self-referential

2147
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,200
and we're going to be doing it high.

2148
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,200
This is the best podcast.

2149
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,200
Okay, yeah, all right.

2150
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,200
It's confirmed.

2151
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
All right, thanks for this everybody.

2152
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,200
We're going to see you next time.

2153
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,200
Go fuck yourself.

2154
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,200
Bye bye.

2155
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,200
$1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy, $1 for Munchy.

2156
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
I'm shit supposed to

2157
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,200
be working

2158
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,200
right now.

2159
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
I'm supposed

2160
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
to be working

2161
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,200
right now.

2162
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
But I'm not working.

2163
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
I'm doing nothing.

2164
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,200
My dick I'm

2165
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,200
jerking.

2166
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,200
Myself I'm sucking.

2167
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,200
I am an asshole.

2168
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,200
I am a stupid.

2169
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
I've got a

2170
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
deadline.

2171
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
Don't want to do it.

2172
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,200
What the hell is wrong with me?

2173
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,200
I'm supposed

2174
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,200
to be making

2175
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,200
money.

2176
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,200
I'm supposed

2177
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
to be creating

2178
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
funny.

2179
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Think that the people

2180
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,200
gladly will pay

2181
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,200
for artistic

2182
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,200
genius.

2183
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,200
That's what they came for.

2184
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,200
Instead I'm tweeting

2185
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,200
hashtag repeating

2186
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,200
That's why

2187
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
there's no heat

2188
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
and holes in the ceiling.

2189
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,200
Yeah.

2190
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,200
It's quite the burden.

2191
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,200
It's a hard knock life.

2192
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,200
Being

2193
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,200
a genius.
