1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, um, whatever.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, uh, uh, I'm back.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The PZP is back, um, uh, and better than ever.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know about that one.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm feeling, you know, you ever have one of those days where you're like, uh, don't bother me till I've had my coffee, but then you get your coffee and you still don't want to be bothered?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, that's, that's cold every day.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's me. I've been up for exactly half an hour.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I got, okay, my big, the big news for me is that I got new internet, which means, um, it's time for me to start, to try to start streaming soon.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm gonna stream.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hooray.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hooray, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to stream, I'm gonna stream, I wanna stream the whole, uh, Battle Network series.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This week, sometime this week, I'll try like a test stream.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And if it works with no problem, then I will announce that the Battle Network extravaganza will begin.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Uh, and then I'll be doing that for God knows how long.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll make sure to stream exactly the same time to pilfer viewers.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, we should divide and conquer, they say.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They mean it about yourself.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Um, I'm just looking, oh, and I'm just, and I'm just, and I'm just seething.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm just seething because this is my first time trying to discord call with my new internet, and it's working fine.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's working great, except that the little green ring that says I'm talking doesn't, isn't, isn't working.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I, I can't stand it.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I mean, I can see it, so I guess your discord's a little cringe at the moment.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Inexplicable, inexplicable.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, um, well, you know, uh, frickin, uh, the, let me, let me complain about other problems.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Um, the internet seems to be working good except for this, but this seems this is probably not even a real problem.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But there is another real problem, which is I had a, I had a torrents.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My torrents were downloading, and I had one torrent I was downloading, and it has stopped downloading since I switched networks.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I don't know if it has anything to do with the network itself, or if maybe there's just no seeds seething the torrent anymore.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It would just be a coincidence.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Uh, but I got this big torrent that I was downloading for weeks, and now it's stuck at like 70% done.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And it was only gonna be, it was gonna be maybe another week, and I just want it.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I just want it so bad.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And I, and I don't know what to do.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm lost.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you torrenting?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you stealing?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, I'll just say it.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Since I had thought that I might do a history of Digi or the history of the PCP sort of lecture,

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I was torrenting the DigiBro archive just to have everything.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh my god.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a lot.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's like, it's like, it's like, I think it's almost like a hundred, I think it's like almost a terabyte, all told.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like the entire archive in all five parts.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you gonna watch it?

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, god, no, I just, I'm just putting it in a folder to just have it for reference in case I need stuff.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But yeah, the first parts one, two, three, and five are done.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And part four is all, is 600 gigabytes.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it is, about 500 of it is done.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And now it's, it's just kind of stuck there.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And it's just, I just, maybe I'll ask Tarbuck, maybe I'll ask Tarbuck if he can seed again or something.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because I see zero seeds.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So might not have anything to do with my internet actually.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I kind of imagine that many people are seeding that specific thing.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, but there were, no, but I mean, it did get, it did get this far.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There were people seeding it up to, you know, to get me this 70% done.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, you know, it's, it's, it should work.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why would it stop now?

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't know.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, that's all, that's all.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The last week, sorry for not appearing.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, no problem.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No problem.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You got it.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You got a, nobody's perfect.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But the last, this whole last week I've been mostly, I have been mostly binging by binging

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
by a cool soul.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You ever heard of that?

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I watched the first, I think like three seasons of it.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I watched it up to when it was current, when I watched it like three or four years ago,

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, I never finished it.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Have you finished it?

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I mean, it's finished and I'm getting, I'm on season, the last season right now, just

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
beginning.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, we might, we might be pretty, I might have gotten to about the same place you have,

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
or something like that.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, it was a good show.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I did like it, but I never, yeah, it wasn't done back when I watched it.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I've had a meaning to finish it ever since, since I heard it finished and everyone says

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Kirk is such a genius.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And La-de-da.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Bob Odenkirk is such an actor.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I mean, I like Bob Odenkirk.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He's great.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's an actor.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's a good comedian too.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You ever see Mr. Show?

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,500
I didn't see Mr. Show, but I did see him on Tim and Eric's awesome show as like some of

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
the Cinco product stuff.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think, I think Bob Odenkirk might have been like one of the guys who sort of like, who

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
sort of like backed Tim and Eric in their early days.

99
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I think he sort of might have been there like patron.

100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Maybe.

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I don't know.

102
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I've heard that somewhere.

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
The lineage of these things.

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
That's just, that's just something I heard.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,500
But anyway, Bob, yeah, I better call Saul.

106
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Do you like it?

107
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I like it.

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I think Breaking Bad is a better show.

109
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Wow.

110
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
But I think, I, well, this is the thing.

111
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
People say-

112
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,300
I've heard people go both ways on that.

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,300
I mean, I was sold on Better Call Saul being like way better or not way better, but like,

114
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
it's better than Breaking Bad, bro.

115
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Yeah.

116
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Yeah.

117
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm like, hmm, well, it's the same show guys, same writers, you know, but probably good.

118
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
It is very good.

119
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Gilligan, right?

120
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Vince Gilligan.

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Vince Gilligan.

122
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Like showrunner?

123
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Yeah.

124
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,660
I have one major problem with it.

125
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,200
It's not like a deal breaker, but it is undeniable that this is not actually-

126
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
a Saul show.

127
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
It is two shows.

128
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:44,200
It is a lawyer show about the rise of Saul Goodman from his lowly status.

129
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,200
There's a little boy behind his nail salon.

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah.

131
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,200
And then it's also the story of Mike Ermentraut and his introduction into the criminal underworld.

132
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Mike is the old guy, right?

133
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Yeah.

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,200
And I like these shows, but I think they sort of take a little-

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Mike should have had his own show?

136
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I think they take a little too much away from each other because they don't really meet up

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
until like season five.

138
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:24,200
They sort of like have passing like interactions here and there early on and then, you know,

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
season three and stuff.

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:35,200
But like mostly it's like Kim Wexler, Jimmy McGill, Chuck and all that lawyer stuff.

141
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:43,200
And then separately, almost completely separate at points is Mike and Gus and the Salamancos.

142
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,200
And that's- I think it's just made for the show being like very slow paced.

143
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
And I was like, when are they gonna do something together?

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
And it's like right at the end of the show and it's like now it's ramping up.

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
And I do like all the seasons.

146
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I don't have like problems with the show, but I feel like it was overhyped in that sense.

147
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Because like if you watch Breaking Bad, seeing how Gus built his empire or like-

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Yeah.

149
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
It's interesting.

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
It's cool.

151
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
And Mike is cool.

152
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
And it's like cool.

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah.

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,200
But it's sort of like fan service in a good way, but like it's still fan service.

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
It doesn't like propel the story of Jimmy McGill.

156
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,200
It sort of like takes away from- it sort of pauses his story to talk about this thing for a bit.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
And then very slowly, both stories-

158
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
That's what- that's the pacing.

159
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
That's the pacing issue I have.

160
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
That's my major issue.

161
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
It causes a pacing issue.

162
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Do you think that like the Gus and Mike backstory, do you think it like doesn't really add to the characters

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
that were already established in Breaking Bad?

164
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I think in Breaking Bad, the characters are very well established.

165
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
And this is just sort of like, it's like ancillary material.

166
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:10,200
You know, if you want to know a little bit extra, it's like behind the scenes, not behind the scenes, but like extra content, DLC bonus episodes.

167
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
The Gus DLC, sure, I understand.

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Yeah.

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Because like everything, obviously Breaking Bad is made to be contained.

170
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:26,200
So like every character in there is explained just enough so that they are compelling and you care about them and you care about what they're doing.

171
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:37,200
And all the while, Walter White is a far more insane protagonist that drives the story forward a lot more quickly and everything is connected to him.

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,200
And I think Breaking Bad just makes for a better viewing experience overall.

173
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
But do like Better Call Saul, don't kill me, don't kill me everyone.

174
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
It's very good.

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I like all the cinematography, it's perfectly cinematographized, great acting.

176
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I love Kim Wexler, she's the best character ever.

177
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Which one's Kim Wexler?

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
The Ponytail Lady.

179
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
What does she do?

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I do remember her, I kind of am.

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
She's Jimmy's best friend, lawyer lady.

182
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Okay.

183
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
What does she do though?

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
She does lawyering.

185
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Okay, that's good.

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
And she's a friend and she's a strong character.

187
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:30,200
She has sometimes not more protagonism power than Jimmy, but like I feel like you could have a show about Kim.

188
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Probably.

189
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
She's got enough like gumption for that.

190
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
That's cool.

191
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Okay, okay, okay.

192
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Oh, I'm looking at a weird video of a Pokemon.

193
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
That is as usual.

194
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
And it's fucked up.

195
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Do you want to hear some great news?

196
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Some great news, yes.

197
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Some great, some incredibly, some incredibly, well you know Ben Hughes, right?

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
On Twitter.

199
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
No.

200
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You will.

201
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:16,200
He's the Team Eor stared at Idiolops, a prehistoric cesiosaur synapses that lived in southwestern

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
United States early Paramin period.

203
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Team Eor, which is Team Eor and his six girlfriends.

204
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
What is it?

205
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Ruth Powers, Laura Powers, Alith and Taylor, Ruth Powers Jr.

206
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Who's the other two girlfriends?

207
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
He's got six girlfriends.

208
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I believe it.

209
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I mean, I'm a big Eor fan and I've been a lifelong, lifelong Team Eor.

210
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
So, you know, I get it.

211
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I can't remember the names of these two even more obscure characters than Ruth Powers Jr.

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
if you can believe it.

213
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
They are Simpsons females.

214
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
They are Simpsons females.

215
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Yeah, Simpsons females stared in awe at the platyhysterics, a prehistoric Temnospondyl

216
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
amphibian with sailbag.

217
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Anyway, the great news is, turns out Team Eor got married on New Year's.

218
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:30,200
They got married on January 1st, 2023 and now the six girlfriends have become six wives.

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Hell yeah, Eor.

220
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I guess I'll get it, Eor, because I saw him posting about Eor and his wives, a.k.a. Team Eor.

221
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,200
And I said, I didn't know they were married and he told me, yeah, they got married on New Year's

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
and I said, congratulations.

223
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I almost said many happy returns because I know that in Winnie the Pooh, at least in the old Winnie the Pooh,

224
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,200
they say many happy returns to Eor.

225
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I think it's to Eor on his birthday, but it turns out many happy returns is specifically a birthday thing.

226
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
You don't just say that on like any happy occasion.

227
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,200
You say it on your birthday, so I didn't say that.

228
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Why is that?

229
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
What does it mean?

230
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I hope you'll return to the same date next year.

231
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Yes, I think it basically means I hope you'll have many more birthdays that are happening.

232
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Yeah, if you say that during a wedding.

233
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Yeah, it'd be weird.

234
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
So I dodged that bullet.

235
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I wouldn't want to embarrass myself in front of the venues, the Simpsons ninjas, no sexy for me and free guy.

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I should draw him some ninjas.

237
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Did you draw him some ninjas or did someone else?

238
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Someone else did.

239
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I can't remember if I, no, I don't think so.

240
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
A couple people have.

241
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I kind of would like to just for fun, but also I don't want to.

242
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,200
It would be difficult to not draw sexy, no sexy.

243
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I mean, I would not struggle with that part of it.

244
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm saying I would.

245
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I would just struggle with just motivating myself to do anything part of it.

246
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Bro.

247
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
That's so relate.

248
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
That's so relatable.

249
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Artist problems.

250
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Look at the blank page.

251
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Me and where SpongeBob looks at the blank page and it has the big fancy the written on it.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
At least he wrote a the.

253
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Yeah.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
At least he wrote a big.

255
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Well, what have I ever done?

256
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,200
But yeah, then it's like January, it's cold.

257
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I could have started the new year being like hitting the ground running and being like, okay, it's time to work.

258
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
But it's cold and it's, I don't want to.

259
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I'm just, I'm not going to do that.

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm going to binge medical soil till it's warm.

261
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah.

262
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Then I can come out of my cocoon.

263
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I said that I was going to have that stuff done by the end of the year and it's two weeks into the new year and it's not done.

264
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I, it's, you know, that's have no make no excuses.

265
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:29,200
But yesterday I did work on it some more and you know, it's it's coming along and it's just really, I think I've complained about this before.

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
So I won't go into it too long.

267
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,200
But you know, it's I'm just, I'm just literally like taking blocks of text and moving them around just trying to make them fit on as few pages as possible.

268
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
And it's just very tedious and it's very dull work and I don't like it.

269
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,200
And I've been procrastinating like the name of the podcast and I've been playing Noida again.

270
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I've fallen back into my old ways of playing Noida, which is a terrible thing.

271
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Noida is a bad game for me.

272
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
It's a good game for you, the listener, and you should try it and play it.

273
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,200
But for me, it's bad because I understand it too well and it's just like playing solitaire now.

274
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
It's just, it's just like playing anything.

275
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Yeah.

276
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,200
It's just, it's just going through emotions.

277
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
I mean, solitaire can be fun, even if you know how to do it.

278
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Well, I don't, well, I don't play it.

279
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I don't actually know how to do it.

280
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
But sure, it's fun.

281
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
It's fun, I guess, but it's ultimately a waste of time.

282
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
It's not that bad.

283
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I mean, most things are, if they're like a video game experience, it's just like whatever.

284
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
I mean, I've been doing that.

285
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
You're right.

286
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I play like Picross on like a random Picross generator and I've like, I fail over and over again.

287
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,200
I, it's just like, well, I mean, I'm spent, I'm sitting here.

288
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Like, what am I actually doing?

289
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm sitting here listening to something and clicking cubes, clicking squares.

290
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Clicking cubes, like an addict.

291
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,200
And I'm like, and I'm like, oh, really, I should be doing some other game, you know, a better game.

292
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,200
But then, like, every game is just clicking squares.

293
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,200
When you get right down to it, when you get right down to it, it's true.

294
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
It's true.

295
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
It doesn't really matter.

296
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Like if, like, there's this, I don't know, compulsion, this feeling of like worthiness,

297
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,200
like you need your time to be filled with the best shit, like the absolute best stuff ever.

298
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah.

299
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
And I have all of these games like, oh, I could, I could play that game again.

300
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I could be experiencing the classics, the canon, the masterpieces.

301
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I know.

302
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I could go to the, oh, criterion collection.

303
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Let's see what they got.

304
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I could be, why did I waste, man, in the time I've spent playing Noida, I could have played The Last of Us,

305
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,200
the only, the only video game to tell a story in ever.

306
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
That wasn't, I was an all right video game.

307
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I enjoyed that one.

308
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Yeah.

309
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I could have played it like 200 times.

310
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:12,200
But then, but then I go back to like, oh, I'm just going to hop on RuneScape and click some, some coal or get some coal for like an hour or three.

311
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,200
And I'm like, wow, I could have done it other games, but I don't know.

312
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Do I need to worry about that?

313
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,200
You could have been mining that coal in real life.

314
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
You could have, you could have that much real coal.

315
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Yeah.

316
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
We've got an energy crisis right now.

317
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,200
There's the fuel prices through the roof.

318
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I just need to go into like the mines and get some free coal.

319
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
What we have give is a crisis of democracy.

320
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Instead of playing video games, you could have gone to Ukraine and defended democracy against the East, against the insidious Orient.

321
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,200
What do you have to say for yourself?

322
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
They're transphobic.

323
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
They wouldn't give me a gun.

324
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
That's true.

325
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
That's true.

326
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
All right.

327
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
You know what?

328
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
You got a better excuse than I do.

329
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,200
There's, for me, I have no good reason to not go over there and join the Azov Battalion.

330
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Specifically them.

331
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
It's the only one I've heard of.

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,200
So yeah, I just signed, I just, I checked the box on that one on my sign up sheet.

333
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I mean, you are a grizzled veteran.

334
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You know, you have all the qualities.

335
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Yeah, I think so.

336
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I mean, I'm Slavic.

337
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I'll fit right in.

338
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I'll just, I'll just change the spelling of my name.

339
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Just change the I to a Y.

340
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,200
The PCP from the fucking trenches.

341
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Radcon 5, live from Keef.

342
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
We're being, we're being shelled.

343
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Oh yeah, it's Keef, all right.

344
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Keef's mostly all right.

345
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Oh good.

346
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
We should go to the front lines.

347
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
We should get the real action shots.

348
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Yeah, we should do it.

349
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
We should get shelled.

350
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
It'd be like Redcon arena.

351
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
We do get shelled.

352
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Redcon's real arena, but in real life with real guns.

353
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Oh God.

354
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Yes.

355
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
We get the GoPro's back.

356
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Finally, finally, these GoPro's are paying for themselves.

357
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Did you see, I have two, now I have two things.

358
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Did you see like the Miss Universe pageant?

359
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Did you see the Ukraine Miss Universe?

360
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I don't know.

361
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I've never watched Miss Anything.

362
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Okay.

363
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, the Miss Universe pageant, I guess, was this week.

364
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,200
And I saw some clips of some, there was one thing where they all just came out on stage

365
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,200
wearing this huge elaborate like costume that like represented their country

366
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
and America's was fucking stupid.

367
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Was it a burger?

368
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
No, it was the moon.

369
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Well, because they went to it.

370
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I don't know.

371
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I don't know if it's, is this supposed to be like a dig at Russia?

372
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Like how we beat you to the moon idiots?

373
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Because I don't like, what about America?

374
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Why would they be like, oh yeah, America, hmm, it's 2023.

375
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
What has America done?

376
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Well, we went to the moon.

377
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
That's pretty good.

378
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
It was a while ago, but yeah.

379
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
The flag's still there as far as I know.

380
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Probably.

381
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Has another like landing of a human person taken place on the moon since the first one?

382
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Well, a bunch of, I think America has been to the moon a bunch of times.

383
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But like, as like a landing expedition.

384
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Because that's more, that's more confusing than like a satellite or like a little robot collecting samples or whatever.

385
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I, I want to say I think so.

386
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
There's been a few.

387
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Hang on.

388
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:37,200
But anyway, I just bring it up because Miss Ukraine just looked so fucking awesome.

389
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm going to try to get pictures.

390
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Yeah.

391
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Here I find a freaking picture of this goddamn bullshit.

392
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Oh, it's contra points.

393
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
It kind of does look like contra points.

394
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
You know what?

395
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh, this is a contra points like, like costume in a video.

396
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah, exactly what she would wear.

397
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,200
The Odessa Journal reported on it.

398
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
She got a sword this school.

399
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,200
She's the Archangel Michael or she's dressed like the Archangel Michael.

400
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
She looks like some of those like.

401
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm sorry.

402
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Powerful Alliance priests in World of Warcraft.

403
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Yeah, it's a bit, it's a bit, it's a bit, it's a bit 40k.

404
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,200
It's a bit Warhammer 40k looking.

405
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,200
She looks, she looks like a sister of battle who would be leading like a space marine battalion or something.

406
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I mean, I'm sorry, but like it's, it rules.

407
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
It's awesome.

408
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
It's my aesthetic.

409
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I like it.

410
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Yeah.

411
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Now I'm just imagining Miss America, like just wearing like a sphere of the moon with her head popping out the top.

412
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Well, let me try.

413
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Is that what it looked like?

414
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
No.

415
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Because that should have been, that should have been it.

416
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
She should have rolled on to stage.

417
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,200
No, it looked like a freaking this for some reason is what they decided to go with.

418
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm sure that I'm sure.

419
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Oh, freaking Miss El Salvador look was a Bitcoin, which is like even worse.

420
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,200
So like in terms of like cringy costumes.

421
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Oh my God, it's she's mega mind.

422
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Yeah.

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Yeah, there's Miss USA.

424
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Here's Miss El Salvador on the left.

425
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
I don't know what country that is on the right.

426
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You know, kind of funny.

427
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,200
It's it's it's it's a it's a mega punks giant brain.

428
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
You mean the moon?

429
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
The moon.

430
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
It's just so it's a very funny bulbous thing on the top of the head.

431
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm I'm think it's got to be like a weird like fuck Russia thing.

432
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Why?

433
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Who fucking cares about the moon?

434
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Yeah.

435
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
The Ukraine one, the lady comes out and the announcers.

436
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Yeah, it's about like, you know, like the Archangel Michael is like aiding them in the in the fight, right?

437
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Like references to their fight their fight their battle.

438
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
So it's like Russia.

439
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,200
And I mean, frankly, just made me think that maybe the Russians were right.

440
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Maybe Ukraine's got to go if they're if they're going to if they're going to be a little pussy about it.

441
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
It's not true.

443
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
It's not what I actually thought.

444
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
I just like the costume.

445
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
All right.

446
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,200
She looks like she looks like the fucking alien from American dead.

447
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Yeah, looks so fucking silly.

448
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
It does.

449
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
This looks like a giant, especially from from the straight ahead angle.

450
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Yeah.

451
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
It looks like she's got a big gray head.

452
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Fucking fucking good.

453
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Good for her.

454
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Who gives the best head?

455
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
It's it's her.

456
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
The moon.

457
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
The moon does.

458
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Well, how did I even get on this subject of this moon lady?

459
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
You brought it up.

460
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh, we were talking about Redcon 5 and Redcon 5 live live from life from Donbass or whatever.

461
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah.

462
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah.

463
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
If we go if we get costumes like this, then it'll be good.

464
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
That'll be part of the stretch goal for the Kickstarter.

465
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I get the sword and wings and I fly over and go.

466
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I don't want to go into too much detail, but did you see what did you see what Nate said in the in the PCP all business chat?

467
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Is the the dojin almost finished?

468
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Is that what he said?

469
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Well, the dojin is is almost finished.

470
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
And also the OVA is like almost finished.

471
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh, yes, the OVA.

472
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,200
That's what I meant.

473
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Yeah.

474
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Yeah.

475
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Yeah.

476
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,200
It's like I'm not going to give like a hard date or anything, but it's like mostly done.

477
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
So like we might be releasing that in maybe the next couple weeks.

478
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Perhaps.

479
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Hell yeah.

480
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
I'll make you imagine.

481
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Watch it.

482
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Can you?

483
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Can you?

484
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Yeah, I don't I'm a little scared.

485
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I might not be actually able to watch it myself, but oh well.

486
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Cringe.

487
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Cringe.

488
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
It'll be cringe.

489
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
It'll be cringe.

490
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
It'll be cringe.

491
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
And you know what?

492
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
We deliver eventually.

493
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
We deliver eventually.

494
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,200
It's I it's it's and then we get our Radcon money finally.

495
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Yeah.

496
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Yeah.

497
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
So that'll be good.

498
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Oh, make sure to buy it like a business expense thing so I can take it off my taxes for this

499
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
year.

500
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Like what?

501
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,120
I don't know because if I'm going to get a big lump sum of Radcon money, I need like

502
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
something to offset it.

503
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I need to.

504
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
You do?

505
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Well, they're going to take me with taxes.

506
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
They're going to tax me.

507
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
I don't want to be taxed.

508
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Put it.

509
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
That's so scary.

510
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
My money is going to go away.

511
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:04,240
I need to buy like a like a cool thing that I'm going to buy a car.

512
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
You're absolutely right.

513
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,080
When you get whenever when you get paid, you go like, oh shit, I can't I can't let them

514
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
tax me.

515
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
I got to spend it.

516
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I got to spend it immediately.

517
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I got to get rid of it.

518
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
That's the thing.

519
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,240
When you get paid, you got to make sure you get rid of the money right away, lest you

520
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
be taxed on it.

521
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
I mean, it's true.

522
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I'm not going to get rid of all of it.

523
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,680
I just want to get under the threshold because then I'll have like things that I, you know,

524
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,920
if I need things, I should buy them.

525
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,600
I mean, yeah, if you need to buy things for no reason.

526
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
That's silly.

527
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,960
That's speaking of speaking of buying things for no reason.

528
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
I did.

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,520
Here, a Botster commission.

530
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,400
Oh, yeah.

531
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
It looked really good.

532
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,840
It's the Clarissa Gunsmoke 3D experience.

533
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,480
Let me get it.

534
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Yes.

535
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Yeah.

536
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Let's show that.

537
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,040
I wanted to get one of these, but they always sell out so quick.

538
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
Oh, does she have have limited slots?

539
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,000
She has limited slots like every month she takes on like four and I keep I kept missing

540
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
it over and over again.

541
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I would DM her.

542
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,520
She said, oh, just too late.

543
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,600
Finally, this time, yeah, I managed to get in.

544
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,760
Actually, she let me in because she was feeling pity on me.

545
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,680
Well, take what you can get.

546
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I guess.

547
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,520
Yeah, but it was it's great.

548
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,320
It does look it does look really good.

549
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,640
Do you I'm kind of curious.

550
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,240
Do you mind talking about like how much it costs?

551
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,120
I mean, her prices are public when she puts the thing.

552
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,560
It's like 500 bucks for this animation.

553
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Yeah.

554
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
You can get just the model, which is cheaper, but I wanted the I wanted the

555
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,720
shooty gun. I wanted the cool animation.

556
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,520
OK, I see.

557
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,320
You can pay even more to get like a more elaborate animation.

558
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,760
Yeah, like a simple one.

559
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
So this was the simple animation.

560
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,560
OK, yeah, still quite right.

561
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,760
Like really nice.

562
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,840
I mean, yeah, animating.

563
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Yeah.

564
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,600
I see you could like pay extra for like a game ready like source files.

565
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,440
What is that if you if you wanted to get the model with like

566
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,960
everything rigged because to animate it, you've got to rig it anyway.

567
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,160
Yeah. So I mean, I feel like she's got the model rigged, right?

568
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Like she had to have made it to make the animation.

569
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,040
Yeah. Yeah.

570
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,760
So like if I if I wanted to turn it into a game, I would need to.

571
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,720
I didn't pay for that extra bit just because I don't have like plans

572
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,640
or really the know how to make a video game.

573
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,920
All by myself, that model.

574
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,080
I do like the idea, though, it would be cool to have a little

575
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,640
Clarissa like shoot game.

576
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,760
I kind of assumed that like somewhere in your head, you were like

577
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,160
if it may be not necessarily going to be like, OK, this is for a game,

578
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,080
like I'm planning a game, but you must have thought like I could put this in a game.

579
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,200
I did think it for a while.

580
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,040
It's just a little it was like some how much extra was it for the game ready?

581
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,280
It's like it's like two hundred bucks or it's like two hundred ninety.

582
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
I think it's two hundred ninety.

583
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,080
And I was just wondering, I don't really know what goes into it,

584
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,120
but it made me wonder, like, is it is it like more work to like

585
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
make them quote unquote game ready?

586
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,160
Like this.

587
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,400
Do they does it have to do something to the or is it just like

588
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,480
for three hundred dollars, she'll she'll hand over the file.

589
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,520
She already has law.

590
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,560
I I'm not sure.

591
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,360
Yeah.

592
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,440
I'm hoping that in the future, I can say, hey, can I if I need to,

593
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,480
like I can say, could I pay for the the file if that's OK?

594
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,400
Because if she I assume it is some other work.

595
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,200
I wouldn't be maybe if I like inverse kinematics or like various other things.

596
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't even know whether that's necessary,

597
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,760
but like game ready means drag and drop and it's working.

598
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,000
So probably something.

599
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,280
I mean, I don't really know how to use 3D model data.

600
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:15,120
So I have no I really have no I have no idea what would what goes into like it.

601
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
I mean, I assume.

602
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,280
I mean, she has something.

603
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,440
She has some model and some rigging.

604
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,920
She must have it in order to have made this animation.

605
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
And maybe it might be like incomplete.

606
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Uh, uh, maybe I don't know.

607
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,840
I don't know what would be different about a quote unquote game ready version.

608
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah, I guess I'll have to ask.

609
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,000
I was I was just curious.

610
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,360
I was just curious about that because I saw that option and I was like, damn,

611
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,520
three hundred three hundred dollars just to like.

612
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I mean, I mean, I guess I don't know.

613
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,160
I thought the analogy I thought of was like,

614
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,480
what if you what if you commissioned like an artist to draw a art for you?

615
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,520
And then I don't know.

616
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,120
They were like, well, for some extra money, I'll give you the like

617
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,000
Photoshop, you know, layer files and stuff.

618
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,480
Like sometimes people do that.

619
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
I guess I guess I'm going to do that.

620
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,480
Um, yeah, I don't know.

621
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,160
I think I think a lot of it could be that if you have a game ready version.

622
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,000
Then that's more than just a cool animation and like an image

623
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,120
that has been made for you.

624
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,960
It is work that you can then go on to make money with if you build a game around it.

625
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,800
Yeah. So it's like more industry, like, oh, I've I've been commissioned

626
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,120
to make a product for like an asset for your game,

627
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,400
which is different from making a little video file.

628
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,960
I believe that there is probably more stuff that's involved.

629
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,400
In that, like I say, I don't really know how to do any of this stuff.

630
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,560
But the animation just looks really good.

631
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,240
Yes, exactly.

632
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,600
I wanted the little the little pixelated smoke cloud.

633
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,000
The most with the squares.

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,240
Yeah, yeah, I just I just.

635
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,680
Boss boss is pretty good at what she does.

636
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,080
She like she like got the.

637
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,880
Oh, she got like noticed or something.

638
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:36,200
Is she big because of the the the the the the bloodborne stuff, the PSX bloodborne?

639
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,280
I yes, I think she made PSX bloodborne as a joke.

640
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,880
Well, not as a joke, just as a little fun thing.

641
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,280
And then it turned into a big thing.

642
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah.

643
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,920
And she posted like dev updates on our Twitter.

644
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
That grew.

645
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,640
Just because, oh, my God, bloodborne, but like PS1.

646
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,520
That's I mean, it does it does look good.

647
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,040
It does look good.

648
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,400
And then more recently, she's started working on a race here.

649
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,120
Bloodborne cart, which is a little occasionally she'll drop a new like

650
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,200
racer and it'll be like, oh, it's it's the crow ladies.

651
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,480
I lean the crow.

652
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,080
The latest one.

653
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,600
I got Gerriman, you got the the guy with the.

654
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,640
It makes his face.

655
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,960
With the cage on his head, you know, that guy.

656
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,360
I mean, is it like blood wig?

657
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah, Nicolash, the scholar or something like that, the insane boy.

658
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,320
Yes, the guy who runs away.

659
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
Yeah.

660
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,560
I I was looking at I was looking at a video of bloodborne cart

661
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,160
and I was watching your little racer like turn right, turn left, whatever.

662
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:50,160
And I was thinking, you know, it has such it has such crunchy pixel, right?

663
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,840
Like these are these are polygonal models, but they are they are they are

664
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,200
displaying in such crisp pixelated.

665
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,600
You know what I'm talking about?

666
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,680
Well, you mean fidelity is too high for.

667
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,960
No, no, no, this is this.

668
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,400
I mean, well, I just mean, what do I mean?

669
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,960
It's the way you're looking at the carts and they're crunchy and crispy.

670
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,960
They're they're crunchy and crispy.

671
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,320
How do I even explain what what I'm seeing?

672
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,160
It's like, I don't know, man, you can just see the pixels, you can just see the pixels.

673
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,080
Yeah, you can.

674
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,680
That's the idea is I know, I know, I know.

675
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,760
But like, but the the poly the polygonal model is is built on math, right?

676
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,800
So like like the polygon is like theoretically perfect.

677
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,160
Yes, just a it's two points in between them.

678
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,680
What? Yeah, yeah, exactly.

679
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,880
So what I'm saying is like to achieve that kind of like pixel display, like that pixel.

680
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,240
Is it like, is that what's called a shader?

681
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,200
Is like, do you apply a shader to a model in order to render it in a way

682
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,680
that is like sort of crunched down into pixels

683
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,320
that match a certain a certain resolution or something like that?

684
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Do you know what I'm talking about?

685
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,200
I mean, I'm not I'm not sure because if you had an example image,

686
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,080
I could tell you exactly what it is.

687
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,080
But I think there are a few shaders going on with the footage.

688
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,480
Sometimes she has like a CRT like filter that makes it look like

689
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,920
it's on a CRT, I think the textures she uses are very low res anyway.

690
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,200
So they just have pixels in them because that's how big they are.

691
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,520
Yeah. And the you know, low polygon count means there'll be hard edges.

692
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,120
And I assume if you're talking about like how the edges look,

693
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,240
they would be aliased instead of anti aliased.

694
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,640
They would be you draw a diagonal line.

695
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,760
And yeah, I guess I guess you would use some shader to like

696
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,120
to have like the resolution, the resolution of the final image be like

697
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,320
two forty by four eighty or whatever, rather than ten eighty P.

698
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,560
I kept, you know, it then blown up when I was.

699
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,600
I guess what I'm saying is when I was making Phantom's Revenge,

700
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,640
now I'm a I'm a hack and I didn't know what I was doing.

701
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,600
And I know there must have been an easier way to do this.

702
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,520
I pretty much just fucked this up completely.

703
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,800
I could have simply I'm sure there would have been a way to just

704
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,680
have the window, have the game window itself

705
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
be displaying a pretty like lower resolution image

706
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,880
in what do you call it, a lower resolution image

707
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,720
just at a higher like the

708
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,280
size to just like kind of blow up a low resolution pixel image.

709
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,920
I didn't do that.

710
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,400
I just I pretty much just had everything.

711
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,640
I just multiple everything's pixel count.

712
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,520
I just multiplied by three.

713
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,200
You know what I mean?

714
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
So like every every pixel in the game is like is actually three pixels.

715
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,440
Oh, and I like manually like, yes, bigger.

716
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,600
Yes, I just manually drew everything bigger.

717
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,880
I multiplied the size of everything.

718
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,080
And I just tried to make sure that everything's positioning

719
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,000
at all times was a multiple of three so that there wouldn't be any like.

720
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,000
You know, you wouldn't see any single pixels,

721
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,800
like only half overlaid over each other, like like a pixel mismatch.

722
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,600
Yeah, I think there are ways to do that, but I don't know them.

723
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm just imagining that it must be a real technical challenge

724
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,000
to accomplish that with polygons.

725
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
Potentially, yeah, I think it's.

726
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,320
Relatively simple.

727
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,760
I mean, a lot of they're probably are just methods to do it.

728
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,200
I think in a lot of modern video game development things, tools,

729
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,600
they assume that you want to make Assassin's Creed.

730
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,560
So like every like, there's a lot of things that are just default.

731
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,280
Like, oh, easy drag and drop like lighting.

732
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,560
Oh, it's sunshine and shadows, dynamic shadows.

733
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,680
You want that, right?

734
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,600
Yeah, if you're trying to make a polygonal PS1 style game, you don't want that.

735
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,440
So, yeah, there's there's a lot of.

736
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Not a lot, but like a bit of finicky,

737
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,640
like programming around what the the the tools would

738
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,440
were expecting for Pumpkin Alley, because it's we wanted it to be like

739
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,760
lower fidelity PS2, you know, experience.

740
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,640
And they wanted to have like lens flares and they didn't put that in.

741
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,080
But you know what I mean?

742
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
Modern game stuff is just very easy to click.

743
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,360
Yeah, drag and drop, we call it.

744
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,520
Is it is it shaders?

745
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,240
Am I is shaders the word for like modules?

746
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,600
Just yeah, just stuff that you can just like put in the game

747
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,120
and it's already sort of pre made and has a certain behavior to it.

748
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,400
Pre fab or an asset. I don't know. Yeah, pre.

749
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,320
Oh, do you know, do you know, Tio?

750
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,240
Yeah. Did you see Tio's like the gif of his game?

751
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,400
And like the lighting system that he's got for his sort of for his sort of.

752
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,920
What's the word?

753
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,520
It's that like Maple Leaf, Metroidvania, anime girl.

754
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,640
He has he has a game that he's building that kind of looks like Momodora.

755
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,760
And he posts this was maybe two or three weeks ago.

756
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,920
Well, his personal kind of Tio the creator and then his work account is Tio devs here.

757
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,760
Look at this.

758
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,040
Look at this like lighting system that he built.

759
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,600
And it moves around and looks all crazy and shit.

760
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,000
Animated the light emulated day night cycle.

761
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,880
Yeah. So. Yeah, that's definitely would be a shader.

762
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,920
Yeah. How do they?

763
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,760
Yeah, how do they do that?

764
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,200
I guess these 2D things aren't as 2D or maybe it's like a value thing.

765
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Like it checks the value of the pixel and then decides whether there's like a finds the edge.

766
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,040
I don't know. I don't know. That's cool.

767
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,240
It's pretty pretty cool looking, I thought.

768
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Yeah.

769
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,400
Uh, that's a yeah, I don't know.

770
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,640
I don't know what a shader is, LaMau.

771
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,520
But I think I assume they're involved in getting a game to look the way you want it to look.

772
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,960
That's all. Yeah, like like you've got like models and like

773
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,880
stuff, got 3D stuff.

774
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,440
You got 2D plane stuff with images on it.

775
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,720
Shaders are like on top of something.

776
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,080
You can apply it to make it look certain ways.

777
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,600
That's that's my basic understanding of a shader.

778
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,960
Is that you're it's like a thing you add to something.

779
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,280
Yeah, I mean, I know I'm familiar with the concept of like a like

780
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,520
like what would you call it in like Photoshop, like a a correction layer.

781
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,040
I imagine a shader as like a correction layer that you apply over

782
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,880
an asset as it's being drawn on the screen that like adjusts the way that it's drawn.

783
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,280
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,520
But it can interact with game code.

785
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,760
So like when like you can have like a shader react to something based on a player input

786
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,560
or like a game state or whatever, you know, you can like animate a shader.

787
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,320
I think punk's fire breath is like it's a 3D model of a fire that wobbles

788
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,080
and grows and it's like a shader thing.

789
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,480
I didn't really understand it because it's too complex.

790
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,920
Charlie handled that.

791
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Yeah, all according with him.

792
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,520
So I'm stupid, you see.

793
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,360
I looked over his shoulder a lot and I'd be like, hmm, yeah, I think I get it.

794
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,560
And I really don't. But I think I get it now.

795
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,200
It's like it's like, hmm, a Boolean interesting.

796
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,560
A Boo, a Boolean.

797
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:38,600
Yeah, it's like nodding, nodding along like, yes, I I I understand shaders now.

798
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,640
It's like he's just like tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, and then and then bam,

799
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,080
look, the game works and you go, ah, yes, I see.

800
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,520
Yes, makes I could have I could have done that, I think.

801
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,320
Yes. Yeah.

802
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,720
I got you. I got you.

803
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
I don't know.

804
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,560
That's just what I noticed the most looking at a bloodborne cart

805
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,400
is just how crispy the pixels are and like, hmm, how they how they do that.

806
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,280
How do they do that?

807
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,280
They probably have like if you go through their dev threads,

808
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,720
they probably explain like early on how they approach

809
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,560
all those things because that's they they get into like some amount of detail.

810
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,520
Like, oh, this week I worked on this thing, blah, blah, blah, that.

811
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,400
Is it just Botster or is it like a team?

812
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,640
It's just so she she she was in like the the gaming industry

813
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,360
is like working on indie games and stuff, animated for other people.

814
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,280
And then she's like, fuck it.

815
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,480
I hate the industry.

816
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,040
I'm going to do my own thing. Interesting.

817
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
I didn't know that.

818
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,560
That's pretty cool. And she made bloodborne PSX.

819
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,640
Did she work on any games I would have heard of?

820
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,120
I don't know, actually.

821
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,960
She made a game that I haven't played yet.

822
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,400
It's it was in one of the bundles like for Palestinian relief or something.

823
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,720
And it's like I should get around to playing that.

824
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,120
She's it's like a first like indie project that was completed.

825
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,040
Arceus Arceus, but not the Pokemon.

826
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,560
I think it's something else.

827
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,800
The game starts with an A. OK.

828
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,360
All right, did I talk about the guy at the party

829
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,680
who told me I should pitch Clarissa Gunsmoke to Adult Swim?

830
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,560
Did I talk about this all the role already on the show?

831
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,880
That does not ring a bell.

832
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,280
So I'm going to say no, I don't think so.

833
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,360
OK, so the Christmas Eve party,

834
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,800
one of my dad's friends.

835
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,080
I mean, I know him, so I guess we're also friends.

836
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,120
He's seen my comic before.

837
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,280
I showed him before and he's like, you should really

838
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,720
like I can get you in contact with like some people.

839
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,040
We can work it out.

840
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,360
And I'm like, I don't I can I assume you know some stuff.

841
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,880
I mean, you definitely know more than me about the industry.

842
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,480
Who is this person?

843
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,480
It's just a guy.

844
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,280
He's in my dad's band.

845
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,520
Played. He was the bassist in the when I did that gig.

846
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,880
Yeah, OK.

847
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,520
So he's like he works in TV.

848
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,880
He does things that I not entirely show what he does.

849
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,560
But like that's cool.

850
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,120
You know, that's something. Sure.

851
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,760
Maybe I can utilize his his connections.

852
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,680
And he was talking about the Rick and Morty people.

853
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,400
It's like you could you could put this to Adult Swim.

854
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,720
Oh, Rick and Morty, there's a show that's doing well

855
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,000
and is not seeing any difficulties at the moment.

856
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,320
Yeah, but you know, whatever.

857
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,520
Sure, sure, sure, whatever.

858
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,440
So it's like it sounds silly.

859
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,880
But maybe maybe I could like make a pitch

860
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,800
for Clarissa Gunsmoke, the animated series.

861
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,920
Did you see I could go to fucking I could fucking fly to LA

862
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,520
and walk around and put it under someone's nose and say, look,

863
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,280
look, animated.

864
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,520
Did you see Cheezy's video about how to pitch your show to Adult Swim?

865
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,040
I did. I forgot what it what it said.

866
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,640
The I don't want to spoil it, but I will.

867
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,800
It's a funny video.

868
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,000
It's about. Well, it's about that they there was this.

869
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:35,520
There was this live stream that you could basically call into

870
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,280
and you could pitch your show to these two guys.

871
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,360
And I think one show one show eventually did sort of get picked up

872
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,800
and like, I don't know if it was has been produced yet,

873
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,680
but there was one show that seemed like it actually worked out somewhat.

874
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,120
But anyway, the long and short of it is they had this live stream show

875
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,840
where you could pitch your show to them and they would give you feedback on it.

876
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,480
And what's his name?

877
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,680
Rebel Taxi did it like once or twice.

878
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,680
And the Rebel Taxi's show is bad and his work is bad

879
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,320
and his characters and his concepts are bad.

880
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,440
So it didn't work.

881
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,680
Long and short of it is the show doesn't exist anymore.

882
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,000
The show has been canceled and you can no longer do this.

883
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,840
Lamal. Yeah, I mean, I imagine.

884
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,360
Like free and open access to anyone who wants to try

885
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,880
is always going to be a little harder to get like noticed.

886
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,920
Then then like going through like, oh, I know a guy who knows a guy.

887
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,240
Maybe this guy does know a guy. I don't know.

888
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,280
He just put it in my head like you should make Clarissa Gunsmoke animated series.

889
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,440
You know, you're working on this comic.

890
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,880
Looks great, but you should make it like you should put it to Adult Swim.

891
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,160
I'm like, what? Really?

892
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,520
I mean, it would be cool.

893
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,640
Sure, it would be cool.

894
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,760
Look, I don't want to be a hater.

895
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,880
I'm not trying to be a hater, but like, don't you work for that studio

896
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,680
that's like trying to get their animated series produced?

897
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,760
Like, oh, yeah, I'm going to talk to them for hard, right?

898
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,440
It is pretty hard.

899
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,120
Yeah, it's

900
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,680
but like, I don't know, I've got cool characters.

901
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,520
What if what if I was better than everyone?

902
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,240
What if I'm actually the best and I just didn't I just didn't believe in myself until now?

903
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,200
What if Clarissa Gunsmoke is exactly what they want?

904
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,480
Well, she shoots people they day.

905
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,160
You can't put that on like CBBC.

906
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Can't you?

907
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,040
I.

908
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
I mean.

909
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,600
I mean, yeah, hey, do it, hey, do it.

910
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,360
Oh, I'm going to I'm going to try and let me know what happens.

911
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,640
I guess I'm going to get a little pitch together.

912
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,120
I'm going to like, OK, figure out how to make it into like a appealing

913
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,960
little story with a synopsis and a characters.

914
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,720
I mean, I'm going to make a little thing and I'm going to I'm going to

915
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,120
go to LA, I guess.

916
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,280
I don't know who are you going to pitch it to?

917
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,680
Well, that's why I want to talk to this this guy again,

918
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,720
because he says we can we can workshop some ideas of how to like get it seen.

919
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,200
I'm like, all right, you know more than me on that.

920
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,560
So I'll meet up with him.

921
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,680
I mean, I wonder.

922
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,280
Yeah, I wonder who this who this guy knows and what.

923
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,200
Because he's done he's done very he talks about doing like all sorts

924
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:39,200
of little things and it's like it's it seems like really cool.

925
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,960
But I don't know how like connected he is.

926
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,720
But I can't like I can't know until I figure it out, I guess.

927
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,680
He doesn't seem like a liar.

928
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,440
He doesn't seem like a jokester.

929
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,200
I don't know. It's kind of.

930
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,320
But it's sort of like a natural thing to exaggerate.

931
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,360
It's kind of it's kind of a big claim to be like,

932
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,960
I know someone at Adult Swim, I can get you your pitch.

933
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,600
He didn't say that adult swim. OK, he didn't say that. OK.

934
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,120
He says he knows like people who could like help bring it into get seen

935
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,960
seen by somebody who would pick it up.

936
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,920
And he said I'll swim would like it because he likes Rick and Marty, I think.

937
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,760
I mean, who doesn't?

938
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,360
Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess I don't know.

939
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,200
I guess that could mean any number of things.

940
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,680
So I don't know. I'm curious.

941
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,040
It's it's something I'm going to I'm going to see what happens.

942
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,360
Oh, because of the moment, I've been like, oh, I got to draw

943
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,040
should have not been talking to my microphone.

944
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,680
Oh, wow, so loud.

945
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,440
I have not been like really drawing any more Clarissa gun smoke,

946
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,680
even though I said I should. Oh, no, one to two.

947
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,520
And I'm like, oh, come on.

948
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,320
One more panel.

949
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,160
Come on, come on.

950
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,080
I'll do it. I'll do it.

951
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,680
Come on.

952
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,280
I think once the once there's more sunshine,

953
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,680
once I can go outside and feel the sun blast onto my face,

954
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,760
and I'll like get all that photosynthesis.

955
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,080
Yeah, that's what I need.

956
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,760
I need sunshine and rainbows, and then I can feel OK.

957
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,160
And then I can draw.

958
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,800
But in the meantime,

959
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,880
why not follow up this this idea?

960
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,640
What if I what if what if I?

961
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,120
What if Clarissa guns go smoke becomes bigger than Rick and Morty?

962
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,840
Well, then, huh?

963
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,240
Well,

964
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,840
um, then I'll be I'll be fucking I'll be a I'll be eaten crow.

965
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,000
I'll be I'll have my you'll you'll rub it in my face and you'll say,

966
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,120
I told you, Ben, you said I could never do it.

967
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,800
And I said, no, I didn't.

968
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,560
I was careful not to say that.

969
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
And you'll say, yes, you did.

970
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,800
And then I'll just crush you.

971
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,840
But it's my boots.

972
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,120
Yeah.

973
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,680
Tired of the train tracks.

974
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,480
Well, somebody had to do it.

975
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,440
Yeah, let me know.

976
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,960
I'm curious to hear how curious to hear what happens with that.

977
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,120
That's interesting.

978
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,440
I'm watching a very interesting.

979
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,080
Look at this.

980
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,880
Look at look at this gift.

981
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,120
Look at this video.

982
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,760
Look at these shaders.

983
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,640
Talk about crunchy pixels.

984
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,560
Oh, I saw this.

985
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,360
Oh, this looks pretty.

986
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,440
I'm I'm transfixed by it.

987
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,320
This is like a first glance.

988
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,600
This is reminded me of like the town with no name, the old DOS game.

989
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,520
I'm not familiar.

990
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,720
It's like a a.

991
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,880
Choose your own adventure kind of where you walk into a Western town

992
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,400
and it's on DOS and it's like made by some guy.

993
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,240
Maybe as a project or just for fun, very odd obscure game.

994
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,720
But you go in there and you have to talk to the people in the right order.

995
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,120
And then there's a shootout and you got to do it real quick.

996
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,160
And it's very it's very easy to die.

997
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,960
That's what I remember from that.

998
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,800
OK, all right.

999
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,880
But it's not like a roam around.

1000
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,840
It's like a click and point move from screen to screen to screen.

1001
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,760
Yeah, but it looks similar to this this color palette and stuff.

1002
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah, I can.

1003
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm like, this is cool.

1004
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,760
I love the West.

1005
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,240
I love the Wild West.

1006
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,400
Whatever happened, I love the West.

1007
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,640
That's why I love Ukraine and I need to defend democracy.

1008
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,000
Whatever happened to the Wild West, they paved it over with grass seed.

1009
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,560
And now it's all nice and green.

1010
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,800
Where's all the desert gone?

1011
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,800
Huh?

1012
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,320
Filled it with cactuses and stuff.

1013
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,120
They filled the desert with disgusting solar panels.

1014
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,840
No, I'm farmland.

1015
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,080
They killed all the birds with wind turbines and solar panels.

1016
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,120
And they got those like gargantuan monolithic, like water sprinkler systems

1017
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,120
to like make a huge circle of crops grow in the middle of the desert.

1018
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,120
Know those?

1019
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,160
No.

1020
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,320
You know, from space, you can see like American

1021
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,280
crops grown in circular patterns because it's a very efficient way to water.

1022
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,080
They have like a huge.

1023
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,720
No, I didn't.

1024
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,200
There's a huge pipe from the middle and it rotates on.

1025
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,400
It's got a wheel on one end and then water sprinkles down in like a,

1026
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,400
I don't know how long it is, but it's very long and it goes around in a big circle.

1027
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,160
And that's the most efficient way to water.

1028
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,480
And so there's, let me just see if I can get.

1029
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,360
It's not crop circles, but it is a circle of crops.

1030
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,960
Right. I have.

1031
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,760
No, I have not seen the thing you're talking about.

1032
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,760
That's what the farms look like from the space, from from high up.

1033
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,080
Get a closer one.

1034
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,440
That's how they do it.

1035
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,760
Oh, so is it just like one big central like spigot

1036
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,880
that just shoots the water in a big circle?

1037
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,040
No, it's like it's like a it's like a tower in the middle.

1038
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,200
Yeah. And then there's a pipe that goes all the way along to the edge.

1039
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:22,480
And then there's a small like another pole with a wheel at the bottom and the wheel turns.

1040
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,640
And the pipe turns and the road and the water comes out of like holes

1041
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,160
along the pipe down. Yes. Yes.

1042
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,640
And so it goes around like that.

1043
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,680
And it's like, hmm, that's that's that's how they get you.

1044
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,720
That's how they get you.

1045
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,720
I see. OK.

1046
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,880
And what about all the corners?

1047
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,640
That's what I want to know. Wasting animals live there.

1048
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,400
Yeah, I can see.

1049
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,840
I can see they put buildings there.

1050
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,640
They could put buildings and like stuff.

1051
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,200
These are really wasted space.

1052
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,360
They're really big now.

1053
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,400
They're very funny.

1054
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,200
Interesting.

1055
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,600
What was I was I talking about or have even?

1056
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,480
How do you even get here?

1057
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,920
Talking about the Wild West, you were looking at a gif.

1058
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,120
I don't have anything else to say about the Wild West.

1059
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,320
Did you get to the part of medical soul where

1060
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,800
soul is in the desert and he gets thirsty?

1061
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,760
Oh, gosh, I don't think so.

1062
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,360
Right. Well, that's a spoiler, but it's not too big of a spoiler

1063
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,800
because they are in New Mexico.

1064
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:34,080
I don't think I've seen that part.

1065
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,520
But that's in season five.

1066
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,720
Yeah, I think I might not have made it that far.

1067
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,280
I would recommend watching the rest.

1068
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,920
I should watch the rest. It's good.

1069
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,000
Breaking Bad was pretty good, even though I didn't really love

1070
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,600
I don't like the final season as much as I like the rest of it.

1071
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,640
I like the final season on a rewatch.

1072
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,480
I think I feel like Breaking Bad.

1073
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,560
You get so hyped up with like everything working well.

1074
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,400
And Walter is like he's getting more and more money,

1075
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,600
more and more power, and he's getting away with more and more.

1076
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,880
And it's like he's gone from this little shitty van.

1077
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,680
Now he's working for Gus, but he's scared of Gus.

1078
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,320
And then he does the whole like, I got to kill Gus because I got to be

1079
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,640
the main character of this enterprise.

1080
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,040
And he fucks everything up.

1081
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,160
And because of his ego fucking everything up,

1082
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,200
everything is just fucked up for the entire rest of the show.

1083
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,840
And it's sort of like a tragic tale of like everything is depressing

1084
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,000
and it only gets worse until everyone's dead.

1085
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,960
Well, like, but like thematically, like on a second watch,

1086
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,440
I'm like, I can appreciate how that's that's all done.

1087
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,120
It's it's good.

1088
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,520
It's a tragic tale.

1089
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,880
It shouldn't end in a good thing.

1090
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,320
He's making math.

1091
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,160
Yeah, I mean, you're right.

1092
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,280
Math is good.

1093
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't know.

1094
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,200
He made Sonic the Hedgehog math.

1095
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,320
Um, it was blue and it looked nice.

1096
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,880
So, you know, that's cool.

1097
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,440
Yeah, you ever smoke math?

1098
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,320
Nope.

1099
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,040
You ever eat it, inject it, speedball it?

1100
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,160
Uh, sniff it, snort it.

1101
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,240
I looked at it. Don't abort it.

1102
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,800
I looked at it so hard that it went into my eye.

1103
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1104
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,160
Woo, I love math.

1105
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,360
You ever see you ever see a there's like a subreddit for math?

1106
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,840
It's like an r slash math.

1107
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,200
Do they like it?

1108
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah, they're just like, hey, guys, you know, did some math today.

1109
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,080
You know, I'm at work, you know, feeling good.

1110
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,880
Love math. I love math.

1111
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,880
Why don't they get in trouble for such things?

1112
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,320
Um, admitting to taking a drug, I guess.

1113
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,760
I don't know.

1114
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,120
I guess the law is like, you can't be, you can't have it.

1115
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,520
You can't sell it.

1116
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,200
But if you've already done it, the only thing that's going to stop you

1117
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,080
is like, you can't do a sports event.

1118
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,400
Is it illegal to be under the influence by itself?

1119
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,360
I don't really know.

1120
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,800
I don't really know the details of the math laws.

1121
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,200
Maybe maybe you could be like, oh, yeah, I did math.

1122
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,440
It's like, oh, so you bought math? No, I didn't buy it.

1123
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,720
Just found it.

1124
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,280
Just found it on the side of the road.

1125
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,720
No crime took place.

1126
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,080
I just immediately took it so I didn't I didn't have it.

1127
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,520
I inherited it.

1128
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,720
I inherited this math.

1129
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,920
It was passed down to me.

1130
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,200
Uh, it's non-taxable.

1131
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,640
Also, saw this go fund me.

1132
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:59,080
I saw this like memorial for this family that was murdered by their dad.

1133
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,560
Terrific. Yeah, I saw the obituary.

1134
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, I was I saw the obituary for the dad and it was like.

1135
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,080
Damn, people were commenting like in memorial of the dad

1136
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,000
saying like nice stuff about him, saying like he always spent

1137
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,320
he always like made time for his kids made time for his family and stuff.

1138
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,160
And it's like, damn, what? What the fuck?

1139
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,920
He literally murdered them.

1140
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,320
Hmm.

1141
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
Do they know him? Is that why?

1142
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,200
Yeah, I have the go fund me right here.

1143
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,120
And it's really it's kind of funny that like in their family memorial picture,

1144
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,920
like it was a picture with the dad.

1145
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,040
So they edited the dad out and they put Jesus in his place.

1146
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,200
They just put Jesus over the dad.

1147
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,040
And and then in the statement underneath,

1148
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,720
like they have like statements by the family members about like in memorial

1149
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,360
of all the not the dad, but of all the other the wife and all the kids

1150
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,480
about like memorials of them and stuff.

1151
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,960
But then they also make like a pro gun statement, like they're really like,

1152
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,800
hey, listen, don't don't use this incident to enact like gun laws.

1153
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,680
Like we need to protect guns.

1154
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,720
Yeah, so important, so important that we protect guns.

1155
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,800
And then the.

1156
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,000
There was there was there was a separate page for an obituary for the dad

1157
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,200
where I saw people people were apparently posting like about what a what a good

1158
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,960
what a good dad he was.

1159
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,960
So what happened?

1160
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,840
He killed them all and then himself.

1161
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,720
Yeah, yes. Yes. Yeah.

1162
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,320
And now I can't find about any of this.

1163
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,400
I just saw people were people were reposting the link on Twitter.

1164
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,920
Hang on.

1165
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,080
I'm going to follow my book, my guy, Jack, my guy,

1166
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,040
Wack Nicholson on Twitter was was posting about it.

1167
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,480
That's a little bit fucked.

1168
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,800
That's a little bit fucked.

1169
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,120
Oh, no, I've brought the mood down.

1170
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,560
I've ruined I've ruined another podcast

1171
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,240
with my morose bullshit.

1172
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,120
Damn it.

1173
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,200
All right, yeah, this this was the original tweet,

1174
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,720
like reporting on the fact that, like, the obituary exists and stuff.

1175
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,080
And I think some of it might have been deleted.

1176
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,040
I think some of the comments might have been removed now,

1177
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,920
but, like, I saw people posting.

1178
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,120
Yeah, posting comments from friends and family about, like,

1179
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,600
what a cool guy.

1180
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,720
Twitter is insane.

1181
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go. Here we go.

1182
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,440
Posts to screen screenshots of these posts, which I can't find any more.

1183
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,640
They OK, they locked the obituary.

1184
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah, the obituary has been locked, so, like,

1185
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,520
you visitors can no longer view it, but.

1186
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,760
We don't know the wise and house, but I do know it's not our right to judge.

1187
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,080
And the Lord loves Michael very much.

1188
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,600
It's not our right to judge.

1189
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,880
It's not our right to judge.

1190
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,560
God damn, that's a that's a fucked up thing to say.

1191
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,000
Genuinely, a fucked up thing to say.

1192
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,320
I mean, maybe had a good reason for killing his whole family.

1193
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,480
Maybe, maybe. I don't know.

1194
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,720
How do you know unless you've walked a mile in his shoes?

1195
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,040
God forbid you haven't had to walk a mile in his shoe.

1196
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,040
OK, I did. I saw this yesterday.

1197
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,920
You know what? I'll tell you the truth.

1198
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,640
I'll tell you the truth. I was a little bit.

1199
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,800
I was a little bit high.

1200
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,240
I was a little bit high on marijuana.

1201
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,880
Oh, my God, when I read this, when I read this, it's so much worse than math.

1202
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,840
It was worse than math.

1203
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,360
Being being a tiny little bit high on a small amount of weed

1204
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:00,560
and reading this article, it was like, oh, my God, the world is ending.

1205
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,960
It felt pretty bad.

1206
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,480
Is a really truly a dreadful experience.

1207
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:15,360
And I just wanted to share it with everyone.

1208
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,800
Yeah, good job. Share the love.

1209
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,520
OK, well, I'm glad.

1210
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,520
Oh, the wife had filed for divorce.

1211
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,760
The wife couldn't have that.

1212
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,120
Yeah, I'm looking at some of the comments.

1213
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,920
Here's here's here's a news article.

1214
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,520
Is there like about the incident like a like a police report on like what's

1215
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,480
been found out about the what's happened?

1216
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,920
Well, why do you do it?

1217
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,720
I just linked an article that is like,

1218
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,000
yeah, father killed his wife, five children and his and his mother-in-law

1219
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,480
before turning the gun on himself.

1220
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,920
Michael Hade, 42, shot his wife, Tasha, 40 weeks.

1221
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,840
After she filed for divorce, her wife of 40 years old,

1222
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,280
weeks after she filed for divorce.

1223
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,320
He is also thought to have killed their three daughters and two sons,

1224
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,080
aged seven, 12, 17, four and seven.

1225
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,480
Police have not confirmed that he was motivated by his wife's divorce.

1226
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,760
Well, how would how would police confirm that?

1227
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,000
Again, what are you going to ask?

1228
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Are you going to ask him?

1229
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,200
Get a say on this.

1230
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,760
Less than one month after remark ten years since the Sandy Hook tragedy,

1231
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,760
another mass shooting has claimed the lives of five more children in Enoch City.

1232
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,280
Enoch City, the morning with the Enoch City.

1233
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,360
You talk to me. I guess it's near Sandy Hook.

1234
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,960
Yeah, whatever.

1235
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,720
This is your brain on on Mormonism.

1236
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,200
Actually, they might not be Mormons.

1237
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,320
I mean, they put that Jesus.

1238
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,920
No, Mormons like Jesus.

1239
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,360
Mormons like Jesus, too, right?

1240
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,760
They're like, yeah, I think so.

1241
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,760
Aren't they like a sect of Christianity?

1242
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,480
Um, oh, wait, no, no, it was it was like one guy who said,

1243
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,600
I'm actually the coolest guy and I'll write a book about it.

1244
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,880
And everyone's like, cool.

1245
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,160
They're like sort of Chris.

1246
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,200
They're like a they're like a weird Christian offshoot sect.

1247
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:21,880
Because, yeah, like, I think they do believe that Christ was the the the redeemer and all that stuff.

1248
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,720
But then they have this other guy.

1249
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,800
What's his name?

1250
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,240
Jimmy Joe Bomson, the the Messiah,

1251
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:33,240
too, who supposedly was he was not he was just a prophet.

1252
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,120
He was just a prophet.

1253
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:39,640
Yes, said like all this weird shit that they believe like that Jesus lived in America and stuff.

1254
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,600
La Mal literally, literally epic.

1255
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,320
I remember learning about that in school and being like,

1256
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:52,040
I wonder how I could start a religion if I just write a book, would people believe it?

1257
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,400
Because that's what he did.

1258
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,120
Yeah, I wonder like what was what was the PR campaign?

1259
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,840
He can't he can't have just written a book and like that was it.

1260
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,480
There must have been no he was getting it out there.

1261
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,240
He knew he knew a guy.

1262
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,200
His dad's friend was a basis and he knew a guy.

1263
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,800
He put it in front of some people who like to talk to God, you know.

1264
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,760
Yeah, I know a guy.

1265
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,720
His name is God.

1266
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,920
Have you ever met him?

1267
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,320
I can introduce you.

1268
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,600
I got his number right here.

1269
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,960
Have you heard about his redeeming blood?

1270
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,240
It's good for you.

1271
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,440
It's good shit.

1272
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,960
It's good shit, man.

1273
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,760
Check it out.

1274
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,960
Don't sleep on this.

1275
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,360
Cracking my crack in my elbow.

1276
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,520
You should put Mormonism on adult swim.

1277
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:39,880
Food for thought.

1278
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,360
They should put Ukraine on adult swim.

1279
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,960
Why is nobody on the adult swim talking about the war in Ukraine?

1280
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:47,560
I don't know.

1281
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,400
Is there like a new Rick and Morty season coming out?

1282
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,520
Maybe Rick said something.

1283
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,720
We got to defend democracy, Morty.

1284
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,840
We got to defend those Ruskies.

1285
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,760
We can kill the Ruskies, Morty.

1286
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,880
The integrity of NATO is at stake, Morty.

1287
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,240
Yeah, that's exactly what he was saying.

1288
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,280
International trade.

1289
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,880
It's Europe's bread basket, Morty.

1290
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,040
It's driving up bread prices.

1291
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:25,560
They produce 10% of the world's wheat supply.

1292
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,480
I'm not talking about marijuana.

1293
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,080
I'm talking about wheat, Morty.

1294
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,280
I'm talking about wheat.

1295
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,160
You eat it every day.

1296
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,720
Have I talked about how much I love oats?

1297
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
Have I talked about how delicious oats are

1298
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,680
and how there's such a treat?

1299
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,400
Get that clip and then make it be phantom horror and saying it.

1300
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:45,960
I have become...

1301
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,320
No, I don't think you have.

1302
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,160
They're just so delicious.

1303
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,400
They're just so delicious.

1304
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:57,640
You talked about your cold brew oats with better stevia.

1305
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,400
Here's what you do.

1306
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,520
Go to Hanifords.

1307
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,840
Sugar-free maple syrup.

1308
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,920
You just dump a bunch of that into your oats

1309
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,520
and you add almond milk and you add some salt.

1310
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,440
And it's like ice cream.

1311
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,320
It's like ice cream.

1312
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:11,880
It's so good.

1313
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,520
It's decadent.

1314
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,000
And it's got macro nutrients.

1315
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,320
It's got macro nutrients, Morty.

1316
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,520
The macro nutrient profile is insane.

1317
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,320
Some basic rolled oats from Quaker.

1318
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,920
I recommend better than rolled oats, quick oats.

1319
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,000
Quick ones.

1320
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,560
Which are just rolled oats, but they roll them even harder.

1321
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,800
And I feel like I haven't seen them quick oats.

1322
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,120
They're so quick they fly off the shelves.

1323
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,280
They're like cryptids.

1324
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,360
They're like those insects that move so fast

1325
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,960
that the human eye can't see them.

1326
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,960
They're like, yeah, ghost insects.

1327
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,680
You know the ones.

1328
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,760
Ghost insects?

1329
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:53,880
Yeah, you know.

1330
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,880
That doesn't sound appetizing at all.

1331
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,400
You gotta eat the bugs.

1332
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,840
You gotta eat the bugs, Morty.

1333
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,280
You gotta get in the pod, Morty.

1334
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,560
You gotta eat the bugs, Morty.

1335
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,760
Eat this cricket flower.

1336
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,880
You put it in your smoothie.

1337
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,000
Hey, I've been playing Disco Elysium.

1338
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,640
You play that?

1339
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,120
Oh, I bought it on sale.

1340
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:12,360
I was gonna play it.

1341
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,560
I also bought it on sale.

1342
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,840
I've been playing it for a couple of days now.

1343
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,160
It's good.

1344
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,720
I was watching a friend play it on a little Discord stream,

1345
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,440
and I noticed that the main thing was that the guy,

1346
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,280
the narrator, has a big, booming voice, very deep.

1347
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:31,480
Is that?

1348
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,640
Yeah, I think that guy's in Hades, too.

1349
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,760
I've definitely heard that guy voice some other stuff.

1350
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,600
He probably does the Arby's commercials.

1351
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,320
He's probably like...

1352
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:47,320
Like a delicious food, and then he goes on to make a video game.

1353
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,920
Did you play at Hades?

1354
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,000
Nope.

1355
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,800
Hades nuts?

1356
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:52,840
No.

1357
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,200
Okay, I guess the guy's name is Lenval Brown.

1358
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,720
I'm like 90% sure that he's in Hades, too.

1359
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,880
Or maybe some other game.

1360
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:11,160
Astria ascending, Disco Elysium, and Black is Belza.

1361
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:11,880
What the fuck?

1362
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,600
Disco Elysium, narrator, who recorded 350,000 words of dialogue

1363
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,200
and has never acted before.

1364
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,400
What?

1365
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,360
What's going on?

1366
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,560
That's just how he speaks.

1367
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,640
That's just how he goes.

1368
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,960
I'm sure it may be so.

1369
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:33,000
I mean, yeah, his voice is great, but I was like a million percent sure.

1370
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,160
But I'd heard it somewhere before.

1371
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,680
Maybe it's a voice many people can do.

1372
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,480
You just got to have huge lines.

1373
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,600
I don't think so.

1374
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,400
I don't think...

1375
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,960
You got to have like a frog throat to fit that vocal chord in there.

1376
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,240
I don't know how that works.

1377
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,600
Yeah, okay, well, I guess I'm freaking stupid or something.

1378
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:11,560
But anyway, I was really struggling with the format, the genre of the game.

1379
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,520
I found it really annoying at first, because I don't really play games like that.

1380
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,040
It was a lot of reading, which is okay, because the writing's pretty good.

1381
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,240
I think the writing is good.

1382
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:32,200
But I was kind of annoyed by the fact that you never heard someone say it's like a book

1383
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,400
with its pages stuck together.

1384
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,680
The game is pretty much just there to make you work in between making you read stuff.

1385
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,560
What do you mean, work?

1386
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:48,280
I mean, okay, the game is basically writing.

1387
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,080
The majority of what you do in Disco Elysium is read and or listen to text.

1388
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:02,200
And that's fine, but you have to just walk between places and find stuff,

1389
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,680
and you have to bring things to certain places in order to get that text.

1390
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,880
Why is it not just a book?

1391
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,680
Why is it not just a freaking book if you just want me to read?

1392
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,920
Why do I have to walk back and forth across town just to read what happened?

1393
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,280
Your input has like changes in the story?

1394
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,320
Sometimes that's true.

1395
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,920
You know, I kind of got over it.

1396
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,760
I moved past that it stopped bothering me after a while.

1397
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,880
It was kind of just like the first day I was playing it.

1398
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:42,440
I was like, why is it making me work so hard just to let me advance the story, dog?

1399
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:49,880
It was not helped by the fact that I had a couple of deaths early on

1400
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,320
that made me like re...

1401
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,440
I didn't save for a while, and so I had to like redo a bunch of stuff, and it was really annoying.

1402
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:05,000
I'm not gonna say that was partly my fault for not saving enough, but you know, whatever.

1403
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,360
The game does autosave, so I kind of just assumed that the autosave function would

1404
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:17,000
prevent me from having to redo like large sections, but no, it didn't.

1405
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah, I feel like I would probably enjoy it.

1406
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:32,920
I don't mind a reading game, but I do, like if there's like mysteries to uncover and like

1407
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:38,520
deducing to do to like figure out what the hell is going on, that's stuff I like.

1408
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,200
I'm not saying I minded the reading.

1409
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:47,960
I'm just saying that I felt like if I'm here to read, just let me read, and all the stuff I had

1410
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,600
to do in between reading just felt like a lot of busy work.

1411
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,800
Are you able to like goof around?

1412
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,400
You mean in the game?

1413
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,920
Are you able to like bunny hop and throw things?

1414
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,160
No.

1415
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,120
Then there is no point.

1416
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,000
Why would they do that?

1417
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:05,480
There's no...

1418
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:12,280
I mean, if they allowed you to like fuck around in between like story bits, then that's okay.

1419
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,120
I like being able to fuck around a bit.

1420
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:14,840
Well, the only like...

1421
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,720
I've seen...

1422
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,640
I've sensed that it's a very serious game where every action is important.

1423
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,400
So I'm like, ah, I gotta have to role play.

1424
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,200
I'm gonna have to be like sensible, but I want to throw shit.

1425
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,520
I mean, you've seen the game.

1426
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,720
You know it's not the kind of game that you can bunny hop and throw shit.

1427
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,000
But I want to though.

1428
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,800
That's what I like.

1429
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:41,080
No, I mean, there basically is no gameplay other than moving, going to different places and

1430
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,480
selecting which thing to interact with, which just triggers text.

1431
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,920
Do you think it would be a better game if it was like

1432
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:54,360
points and click, like click your map to go to the new location rather than walking around?

1433
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,200
No.

1434
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,400
You know, it's not really that...

1435
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,080
No, it's not really that big a deal.

1436
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,600
It's not actually that hard to like get places.

1437
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,320
It's just maybe like a minute or two of walking.

1438
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:13,880
I'm trying to decide if this is an actual problem that I have,

1439
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,760
or if I don't actually care that much.

1440
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,080
I think you just had to reload and you're still frustrated.

1441
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,200
That really did annoy me.

1442
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,480
I'll be sure to save.

1443
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,120
Definitely save often.

1444
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,200
Yeah, that's my takeaway.

1445
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,240
Definitely save often.

1446
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:40,680
I get the feeling that you can get a lot of different...

1447
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,040
I don't know how many like actual different outcomes there are to things.

1448
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,000
I know that you can have...

1449
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,720
There's a bunch of sort of different paths in the game that you can sort of choose and

1450
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,520
sort of like how in like a Mass Effect, there's like, you know,

1451
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:59,240
you can do the Renegade option or the Paragon option and just go Elysium.

1452
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,200
It's like there's more of them, but there's still like clear cut.

1453
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,920
Like this is the Communist option.

1454
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,520
This is the Fascist option.

1455
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,320
This is the Libertarian option, et cetera, et cetera.

1456
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:15,240
This is the like, I don't care about anything and I'm a Nihilist and I hate myself option.

1457
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,840
Did you pick that one?

1458
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,120
I've kind of been waffling between that one and Communism.

1459
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,120
Just like real life.

1460
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,240
Just like in real life.

1461
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,200
I'll go Full Fascist.

1462
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,400
I'll do it.

1463
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:33,720
The Fascist one.

1464
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,680
Somebody's got to do it.

1465
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,840
You know, I don't want to really comment on it until I've gotten to the end.

1466
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,120
At the moment, I'm sort of like...

1467
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,560
I'm a little bit unsure.

1468
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,040
The game's politics are a little bit...

1469
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,560
I'm not really sure.

1470
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,280
Like, I don't know.

1471
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,160
I'm going to wait till the end.

1472
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,520
I feel like I shouldn't comment on like,

1473
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,240
what is it saying about any of these things until I've gotten to the end and I've sort of seen

1474
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,280
like what it actually says.

1475
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,560
Although, I will say that a lot of the responses are very cartoony.

1476
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,680
Like, a lot of the...

1477
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,040
Sometimes it is a bit...

1478
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,280
I think it's trying to be...

1479
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,320
It's funny on purpose.

1480
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:23,960
Like it's deliberately silly, but it's very much like when you do the Communist option,

1481
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,960
a lot of the choices are just like very bloodthirsty, just about like how many people you want to

1482
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,880
send to their deaths in the gulag and stuff.

1483
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,480
Which is fine.

1484
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,600
But it's not that compelling.

1485
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,880
Like, it's just a little ha-ha joke.

1486
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:42,920
Like, Communism, a 14 billion dead of Venezuela.

1487
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,440
Vuvuzela.

1488
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,160
Yeah.

1489
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,760
Yeah, a lot of very cartoony dialogue options.

1490
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,800
And the game tells you like, it's okay if you say weird stuff.

1491
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:52,520
There's...

1492
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,640
The framing device of the game is that you are a complete...

1493
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,960
You've woken up and you've lost all your memories and you have no idea who you are.

1494
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,880
So that's the reason why.

1495
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,480
You can pretty much just say anything and it's sort of justifiable.

1496
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,520
Because like, you are pretty much a blank slate.

1497
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,400
Do you have to start...

1498
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,520
Do your options lessen the more you learn about yourself?

1499
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,240
They have not lessened for me.

1500
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,960
I mean, you know, you learn very quickly that you are a cop.

1501
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,720
Like, you have a job as a cop.

1502
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,080
But you can decide like, well, yeah, my job is as a cop.

1503
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,160
But I've decided that I'm still going to be like a communist revolutionary,

1504
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,680
even as I do my cop jobs.

1505
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,400
Yeah, your memory, I guess your memory doesn't come back.

1506
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,880
You just learn new information.

1507
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,360
I think...

1508
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,560
Old information.

1509
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:53,560
Yes.

1510
01:21:54,440 --> 01:22:02,200
You can still act however you want when the guy's of like, I don't remember stuff.

1511
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,040
Like, you are an alcoholic.

1512
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,200
You are an alcoholic.

1513
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:11,080
You have drug problems and all that stuff.

1514
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:16,200
You can fall back into that if you want or you can try to not do that.

1515
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,200
I'm staying clean.

1516
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,040
I'm staying clean.

1517
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,800
Just like in Lisa.

1518
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,280
Hell yeah.

1519
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,000
Hell yeah.

1520
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,720
Drugs are bad.

1521
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,440
Meth is bad.

1522
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:27,720
Don't do weed.

1523
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,960
They have blue meth in that game as well.

1524
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,920
Oh, the joy.

1525
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,480
The joy.

1526
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,200
It's blue.

1527
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,560
Yeah, it is blue.

1528
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,120
Hell yeah.

1529
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,880
And they have a bald guy too.

1530
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,600
Just like Walter.

1531
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,080
And it's in the desert.

1532
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:45,720
Oh my god.

1533
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,280
It's just the sequel.

1534
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,240
There's a lot of funny racism in Disco Elysium.

1535
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:01,880
And by funny racism, I mean that you meet people who are racist, but they're very silly.

1536
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:07,080
They're like, there's a guy called Measurehead who is like,

1537
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:12,760
he sees himself as the perfect display of his ethnic identity.

1538
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,560
And he's got full body tattoos showing how perfect his skull is and stuff.

1539
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,840
He's just really into skull measuring and he loves it.

1540
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,160
Yeah.

1541
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,480
The writing's good.

1542
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,760
It is cartoony sometimes.

1543
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,000
That's egg behavior.

1544
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,440
Huh?

1545
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,960
That's egg behavior.

1546
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,320
Egg behavior?

1547
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,360
Get a tattoo of skull measurements on all of your body.

1548
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,880
How is that the term egg?

1549
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,720
I'm fucking joking.

1550
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:45,560
I mean that doesn't, I don't get the connection, but sure.

1551
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:54,600
Cause like shapes of skull between men and women differ slightly.

1552
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:00,280
And some trans people get a little obsessed about their skull not being the right shape.

1553
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,200
And so they have surgery to change it.

1554
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,080
Oh, I see.

1555
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:03,560
I see.

1556
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,920
No, this guy's got the perfect skull.

1557
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,240
No, he would never change his skull.

1558
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:09,880
He likes it.

1559
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,280
And that's it.

1560
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,840
That's all I have to say about him.

1561
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,600
He's a funny racist and I'm a big fan of him.

1562
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:26,600
You can choose to adopt his philosophies and befriend him in order to get him to do stuff for you.

1563
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,960
But I didn't do that because I'm nice.

1564
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,160
I'm a nice and I'm a communist and I don't like racism.

1565
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,840
I think racism's bad actually in real life.

1566
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,040
What do you think?

1567
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,080
What do you think about it?

1568
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:39,960
Very interesting.

1569
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,720
Sorry, I just happened to be yawning.

1570
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,160
Oh, boy.

1571
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,280
Good.

1572
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,640
I'm sorry.

1573
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,120
I'm tired.

1574
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,840
No, racism, that sucks.

1575
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,200
Do you denounce racism in the middle of the yawn?

1576
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,080
Why did you hesitate?

1577
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,520
Why did you hesitate?

1578
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,000
I was in taking oxygen.

1579
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,440
I'm sorry.

1580
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,320
We'll see about that.

1581
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,160
I don't know.

1582
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,760
People tell me to play Disco Elysium for a while and I'm finally playing it.

1583
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,800
And I'm bringing up gripes, but I do like it.

1584
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:19,480
At the end of the day, the game is mostly about reading stuff and the writing is pretty good.

1585
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,600
So that makes it like pretty good at what it's doing.

1586
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,080
I know my character's name now.

1587
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,120
You don't know your name when you wake up, but I know it now.

1588
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,000
So that's pretty cool.

1589
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,240
I know some stuff.

1590
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:34,680
Insane.

1591
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,400
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1592
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:38,760
That's right.

1593
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Anyway, that's another.

1594
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,040
Yeah, like I said, I haven't been working.

1595
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,560
I've only been working a little bit on that thing that I was supposed to do by the end of the year.

1596
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,720
Instead of that, I've been playing Noida, which is bad.

1597
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,000
But I've also, you know, I said you can play Noida and that's a waste of time,

1598
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,360
or you can play the classics.

1599
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,400
You can play something that's edifying and good for you.

1600
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,600
And I think Disco Elysium is more on that side of things.

1601
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,080
So I don't feel that bad about it.

1602
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:10,520
And also it's $9 and it's probably not on sale anymore.

1603
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,400
So sorry if you missed it.

1604
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,760
Oops.

1605
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,320
Oops, but it'll probably go on sale again.

1606
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,640
Yeah, yeah.

1607
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:29,960
Ben, I heard that there is a steam version of Dwarf Fortress out.

1608
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,280
Yeah.

1609
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,160
Like an updated new, it's like with graphics.

1610
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,040
Yeah.

1611
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,280
It's like the new version of Dwarf Fortress.

1612
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,000
Have you played it?

1613
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,680
I mean, I have not played the steam version.

1614
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,480
I did see people talking about the steam version.

1615
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,760
And I guess there was a big,

1616
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,160
a lot of people are giving Dwarf Fortress a try for the first time now,

1617
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,400
which is pretty cool.

1618
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,800
Have you played it before?

1619
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:03,960
No, I hear about your things and I had been meaning to get around to like giving it a go

1620
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,760
I mean, it's fun.

1621
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,600
And I do recommend giving it a shot to see what it's all about.

1622
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,840
I have not played it in a while.

1623
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:20,280
Although I do have some funny stories from old fortresses that me and some friends ran together.

1624
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:25,240
The the yeah, I haven't seen what the text.

1625
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,720
There already were like fan made texture packs that you could apply to the game to give it like

1626
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,920
sort of graphics.

1627
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,080
I'm not sure.

1628
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,800
I haven't seen what the new with the steam versions graphics look like.

1629
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,320
But I guess people like them because people seem to be responding positively to it.

1630
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:48,440
Do you know that like the guy who made Dwarf Fortress has like cancer and like the reason he

1631
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,400
put he did this is like to pay for his cancer treatment.

1632
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,760
Oh, yeah, I didn't know that he that's terrible.

1633
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:57,160
It is.

1634
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,800
Yeah, he's he's he's had cancer for a few years.

1635
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:06,360
And I think, well, what I mean is he I think the idea I don't think I don't think he would have

1636
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,040
cared to put it on steam.

1637
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:14,600
But I think part of the reason why he did is because he needs to make money largely for that.

1638
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:20,360
And so it's kind of good that like it's sold like millions of copies and he's made like millions

1639
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,240
of dollars off of the steam version like I'm like good.

1640
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,960
Yeah, that's that's great.

1641
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,760
I mean, it was it was free the whole time, wasn't it?

1642
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:29,640
Yeah.

1643
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:34,600
And I mean, it's still free the original version, but like the steam version with like the the

1644
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:39,800
pack and all that the graphics is I don't know how much it costs.

1645
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:44,760
But you know, a lot of people bought it.

1646
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,080
How much do you check how much it is?

1647
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,840
Yeah, I didn't think it was too expensive when I checked.

1648
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,440
I forget.

1649
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,920
I assume the original version is still free.

1650
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,120
It's all it's always been free.

1651
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,680
Okay, it's 30 it's $30.

1652
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,800
It's $30, which is you know, whatever.

1653
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,960
I have a dwarf fortress.

1654
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,920
I mean, I would say.

1655
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,520
As I've given you $30 worth of entertainment.

1656
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:09,240
It's definitely.

1657
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,240
Yeah, of course, definitely.

1658
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,200
You don't even need to play.

1659
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,120
You don't even need to play the game for to give you.

1660
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:17,560
You should buy the game even if you'll never play it just because it's it's

1661
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,040
the stories you'll hear from other people.

1662
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,080
Yeah.

1663
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:21,960
Are worth the 30.

1664
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:27,480
Do you know that there's a YouTuber called Krug Smash who makes these really?

1665
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,720
Yeah, you've mentioned him before.

1666
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,680
Yeah, yeah.

1667
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,960
I haven't caught up with his stuff in a while, but he's made some really

1668
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:43,160
some very cool and good like narrative like series about like the stories of his dwarves

1669
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:47,080
and the fortresses they build and tournament arcs and stuff like that.

1670
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,160
So cool rules.

1671
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,320
And yeah, did I?

1672
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,360
Oh, man, I don't want to repeat this.

1673
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,680
I feel like I might have.

1674
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,560
Did you did you listen to last week's episode?

1675
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,840
The one that was the Ben cast?

1676
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,160
I think I got halfway through.

1677
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:09,560
I feel like I might have talked about this on that the story of like

1678
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,560
or maybe I talked to you about it.

1679
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,840
The one about the cats poisoning themselves.

1680
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,960
Poisoning themselves.

1681
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,680
Gosh, I hope.

1682
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:19,960
Yeah.

1683
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:25,000
Okay, there's this interview with Tarn Adams, the guy that makes Dwarf Fortress,

1684
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,520
and they asked him and he's talking about the game and he's talking about like

1685
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,000
stuff that happens when he's when he's fixing bugs, right?

1686
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:41,080
And the story is basically that there are taverns that there was like he had just added

1687
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:46,680
taverns to the game and in the taverns, the dwarves would go to the bar and they would drink.

1688
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:51,960
And then if they wanted to stop drinking, they would just throw their mugs on the ground

1689
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,440
and the alcohol would just spill on the ground, which is fine.

1690
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,520
Like that's okay for Dwarf to do that.

1691
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,800
That's normal dwarf behavior.

1692
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:07,720
But the alcohol interacted with like a previously added module that accounted for like the effects

1693
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:15,080
of like poisoning and alcohol is considered a poison that causes, you know, a certain effect.

1694
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:21,960
And so what would happen was cats would walk through, pet cats would walk through the bar

1695
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:28,680
and just the way that like fluids work, cats would walk through these puddles of alcohol

1696
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,720
and they would get alcohol on their paws.

1697
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:39,080
And it would consider that like an entire mug of alcohol was like stuck to their paws

1698
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,280
when they walked through it.

1699
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,040
Okay, flashback.

1700
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,640
Flashback to another thing.

1701
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,240
Dwarves have to clean themselves.

1702
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:51,320
When dwarves get dirty, like every individual part of their body will get like the substance on them,

1703
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:51,800
right?

1704
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:57,160
And the dwarves have to clean themselves and they have to like take soap and they have to wash

1705
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,960
like their hand, they have to wash their arm, they have to wash their upper arm,

1706
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,080
they have to wash their face.

1707
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:06,120
And if they would get something in their eye, they would have to take like a bar of soap

1708
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,040
and like individually wash their eyeball to clean their eyes out.

1709
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,160
And it's like, that's weird.

1710
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,280
So they changed it.

1711
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:17,000
They changed the behavior so that the dwarf's eyelids interact with their eyeballs

1712
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,800
in such a way that if the eyelid blinks, the dwarf's eyeball is cleaned of any substances

1713
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,680
that are afflicting it.

1714
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,760
Okay, flashback.

1715
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:31,480
I didn't know individual dwarves had like variables for every single other part of their body.

1716
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:36,680
Well, I've told you that one of my favorite stories of a fortress I had is that is one guy

1717
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,760
in a fortress and the fortress was attacked by a wear giraffe.

1718
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:46,600
And a dwarf warrior was defending the fort and he got the wear giraffe like

1719
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,280
punched him so hard in the face that he died, right?

1720
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,640
And he got buried in the catacombs.

1721
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:59,640
And one of my other dwarves would go to, I kept seeing him going back and forth between the

1722
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:03,240
catacombs and the place where the guy got killed during the battle.

1723
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,240
And he kept going back and forth, back and forth.

1724
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,400
And when I looked into like who this dwarf was, why is he going back and forth, back and forth?

1725
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:15,480
He was a friend of the guy who was killed and he had buried the guy's body in the catacombs,

1726
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:19,480
but he kept going back to where he died because when the guy got punched,

1727
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,680
the punch had shattered his face and sent all of his teeth flying.

1728
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:28,360
And so he kept going back to the battleground and finding more of his teeth and bringing

1729
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,840
the teeth to the catacombs and putting them in the coffin.

1730
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,680
And then he'd go back and find more of the guy's teeth and bring them back to the catacombs

1731
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,520
and put the more teeth in the coffin.

1732
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,720
Why would he do this?

1733
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:41,480
Because he wanted to put all the pieces together in the coffin.

1734
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,480
He wanted to bury all of his friends' body parts.

1735
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:50,680
How do you even write code that would allow for this situation?

1736
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,440
But anyway, the ending of the cat story is that, okay,

1737
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:57,880
so there's this self-cleaning behavior is added to creatures.

1738
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,320
Creatures' body parts clean the other.

1739
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:07,000
And so the cats would walk through this alcohol on the floor of the bar and track it on their paws.

1740
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,120
And then the cat would do a cleaning behavior on the paw.

1741
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,960
They would use their tongue to clean the alcohol off of their paws.

1742
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:20,200
However, because of the way that it was considered to be drinking,

1743
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,360
then, this alcohol that was stuck to their paws.

1744
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:27,720
And it was considering that an entire mug's worth of alcohol was stuck to the cat's paw.

1745
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:30,120
And it was drinking it as it cleaned it with its tongue.

1746
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,880
And therefore, it was considering that the cat was drinking basically an entire

1747
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,560
dwarven mug's worth of alcohol whenever it would clean it off its paws.

1748
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,280
And this was like too much alcohol for a cat to drink.

1749
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,760
And therefore, it would interact with the poison module.

1750
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,600
And the poison module would consider that considering the cat's small body weight,

1751
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,120
drinking this much alcohol raises its blood alcohol level

1752
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:52,520
to a point that it enters the lethal area.

1753
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:57,080
And it triggers the lethal effects of alcohol, including respiratory failure.

1754
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,560
And so the cats would clean their paws and drink so much alcohol in doing so

1755
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:06,040
that they would respiratory fail and they would die like right on the on the bar floor.

1756
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,840
So cats would just get poisoned and die in the middle of the bar

1757
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,080
from cleaning the alcohol off their paws.

1758
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,160
Lamal. Oh, no.

1759
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:20,200
So. Hey, Dwarfs, just don't throw it on the ground.

1760
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:24,600
No, they come on. They gotta. They gotta, though.

1761
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,400
So that's the kind of game Dwarf Fortress is.

1762
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:38,440
Yeah, I feel like like if I play it, like, is it a difficult game?

1763
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:43,640
Well, it's like Tetris, right? You just go until you lose.

1764
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:50,920
OK, it's difficult. I mean, the difficulty of it is pretty much just like knowing

1765
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:58,520
how to do certain things. But like there you pretty much just it's about navigating menus,

1766
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:03,960
like telling your dwarves what to do is just about navigating menus to find like how to tell

1767
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:10,360
them to do X thing. And so it's useful to have like a wiki to tell you like, how do I tell

1768
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,960
my dwarves how to do this? How do I tell my dwarves how to do that? Like, what do I need to do?

1769
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:20,280
I mean, the basic what you basically have to do is first you have to you dig out.

1770
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:26,280
You dig out a fortress. Usually you'll you'll dig out like an initial settlement to live in.

1771
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,480
And then once everyone's all settled and has like beds to sleep in,

1772
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:35,320
you set up beds and then you'll start digging like a bigger fortress. And then in the you'll

1773
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:41,880
set up workshops where the dwarves will start making stuff. And yeah, making stuff in the

1774
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,520
making stuff in the workshops is like a big that's like where you get most of your stuff.

1775
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:52,280
Digging out the fortress and digging out like mine shafts to find materials

1776
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:56,680
to then make stuff in the workshops. And then you make stuff and then you trade anything you

1777
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:02,920
can't make you trade with like merchants that pass by. You know, you engage in trade to get

1778
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:09,400
stuff you need. And then setting up a military setting up a military is pretty complicated.

1779
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:15,960
You don't really I mean you you can get by for a little while without a military but like you

1780
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:24,760
will eventually need one or you'll die pretty quick because like threats will escalating threats will

1781
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,840
come to attack your fortress pretty much the bigger and more successful your fortress gets the more

1782
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:35,080
like dangerous and like legendary monsters will start coming to fucking get you. And so you'll

1783
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:41,320
need a stronger like a weird dress. Where yeah, where creatures will just wander by sometimes

1784
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:47,560
just randomly. I mean, there starts to be things like there are things called forgotten beasts

1785
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:54,520
that are like sort of randomly generated like timeless creatures from like before the world

1786
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:59,320
began. And some of them can be really some of them can be like pathetic and not even a threat.

1787
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:04,600
And some other ones can be like really, really dangerous. It sort of just depends on like what

1788
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:12,360
random attributes they're given. And I mean, you might have where where where creatures will

1789
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:19,880
wander by and yet if they if they bite of a dwarf in the course of the fight, they might infect

1790
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:26,360
a dwarf with lycanthropy and then you won't know until the next full moon. And then suddenly one

1791
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:31,320
some of your dwarfs that got bit will go crazy at the full moon and they'll start rampaging

1792
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:35,400
they'll start biting other dwarfs. And then you might have like a lycanthropy infection.

1793
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:41,960
And that's a problem. You can have the same thing with vampirism. Sometimes sometimes a vampire

1794
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:47,400
will join your fortress and you won't know who's a vampire. But your dwarfs will just sometimes

1795
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:51,800
find other dwarfs like drained of all their blood and dead in their beds one morning and they'll

1796
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:58,760
be like, Well, somebody's a vampire. And then you have to quarantine everybody and question them.

1797
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:05,400
You have to. Yeah, there are some tells that you there are some tricks you can know to like sort

1798
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:09,960
of figure out. Oh, it's garlic bread day, everybody ever ever get your garlic bread.

1799
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:14,520
I've heard that one thing that can be a big giveaway for a vampire is like,

1800
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:21,640
like you'll look at a dwarf and he'll look like you can't just see that he's a vampire until

1801
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:29,080
someone accuses him of being a vampire. And like they write like it doesn't share that information

1802
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:33,800
with the player. But a vampire will be really, really old most of the time. And so a vampire will

1803
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:39,800
often have like a huge list of like people that they know. And so if there's if there's like a

1804
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,520
dwarf that seems young and yet they know like tons of people, especially like from lots of faraway

1805
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,680
places, it might be a tell that like this guy's probably this guy's older than these seams. He's

1806
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:55,240
a vampire. Could just be a very so it could be a socialite. Yeah, you never know. You never really

1807
01:39:55,240 --> 01:40:02,680
know. But your dwarves will sometimes have like they might have like family and friends from like

1808
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:08,360
yeah, from like other fortresses or like other countries and stuff. And like they might have

1809
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:14,440
different gods they worship and like different different dwarves worship different gods and

1810
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:21,160
stuff and like different cities might have different gods that they like. It has a whole it has it

1811
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:26,520
simulates a whole like a whole like nation a whole like national history, which is really awesome.

1812
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:31,800
One of my favorite things to do is to have my dwarves mint coins and just see like what images

1813
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:37,720
they they they press into the coins that they mint. And they'll do like symbols of their nation or

1814
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:44,360
like symbols of of their city or like pictures of like the rulers of their of the dwarven empire and

1815
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:57,000
stuff. Yeah. Um, for just so freaking cool. But also it's kind of a hassle. It's kind of it's

1816
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,280
kind of a hassle to play. And like, yeah, if you don't know how to play it, you pretty much need to

1817
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:10,440
have a guide to like look up to tell you like how do I what menu do I go into to like build a

1818
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:17,640
like woodworking shop if I want to make like beds? Yeah, I mean, that's how Minecraft was. It

1819
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:23,160
doesn't explain anything. You have to have the wiki open. I mean, at least in Dwarf Fortress,

1820
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:27,400
like the menu is right there. You can just kind of like look around in the menu and see what's there

1821
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:34,280
on your own. Theoretically, yeah, you you can just

1822
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:41,560
it does tell you like everything is right there in the menu, you can just see it and it's like oh,

1823
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,880
this is the but like how to like actually do it is a little can be a little bit complex and a guide

1824
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:56,200
can be useful to sort of like talk you through it. Yeah, because there's a lot of options that are

1825
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:01,160
like, I mean, if you really want to when you're making a military, you can like get really down to

1826
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:06,120
the minutiae and tell you like your individual soldiers like what weapons you want them to

1827
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:12,680
wield and like what pieces of armor you want them to wear and stuff. Can you like create a rank and

1828
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:20,360
then assign bits of armor to that rank? Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can make like you can make

1829
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:26,840
different like squads that have like different like uniforms basically. And or you can I think

1830
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,240
you can even tell and you can tell an individual like soldier like okay you can like assign them

1831
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:35,640
as like captain or you can say like okay I want this guy to wear that I want this guy to wear that.

1832
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,720
You can you to give them like usually it's to give them like

1833
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:44,280
legendary or like artifact equipment that you have that you want them to wield.

1834
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:48,280
You know. You know.

1835
01:42:50,840 --> 01:43:00,120
I do like managing a system of individuals. Yeah, I've talked about Kenshi before. Kenshi is like

1836
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:05,960
not similar to Dwarf Force Triss but like you have your squad and they have their own individual

1837
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:12,680
inventory and you can build a town with resources that you can get from buying or like mining them

1838
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:18,120
from the wasteland. And it is it does get a little overwhelming if you get too many people.

1839
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:29,880
But I do like that that management stuff. Kenshi. Kenshi, yeah. It's like you have talked about

1840
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:35,480
it but I have not I have not played in. I would recommend that. That's a that's a real good

1841
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:45,640
post apocalypse management RPG where there's no goals at all. It's just don't die.

1842
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:55,240
Interesting. It's like an army kind of like simulator. It looks sort of like an RTS.

1843
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,360
No, it's it's action. It's like it all real time.

1844
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:08,760
Everyone has stats. They do things and they get better at their stats. Different races have

1845
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:16,120
bonuses to different things. Robots are immune to acid rain and stuff like that. You can you can

1846
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:23,080
if you get a leather crafter who can craft good leather stuff, you can get like acid

1847
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:29,400
protection gear and then you can go into like cursed like weird

1848
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:36,600
like it's post apocalypse. It's a very unique post apocalypse. Whereas like yeah,

1849
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,560
clearly thousands of years ago, there was like a super advanced robot technology. But then

1850
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:48,280
there's like these completely horribly irradiated ash filled like dead zones with giant beasts.

1851
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:54,840
I love giant beasts. And if you can go in there, you can go collect stuff and get secret knowledge.

1852
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:04,920
And you can bring it back and then you'll be so smart. But that's absolutely the game is like

1853
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,920
you're just somebody in the wasteland and to survive, you have to band together with people.

1854
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:16,280
And if you get strong enough, you get large enough bands, you can make your own base.

1855
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:23,400
You can defend it from attacks. Cool. And and and slavers and bandits.

1856
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,760
And gorillos, they have gorillos. Gorillos.

1857
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,600
They're different from gorillas. Like gorillos pickle.

1858
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:37,720
Yeah. Lol. He'll rip your limb from limb.

1859
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:45,400
Intriguing. What else can I say? I'm trying to think, I feel like I had more to say about

1860
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:50,280
Disco Elysium, but like maybe not because like I'm still like working through it. And like,

1861
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:56,760
I guess it's kind of long. And I sort of only am like partway through it. So I'm still,

1862
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:04,760
I'm still thinking about it. Your partner Kim is such a swell guy. He's just such a

1863
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:09,000
little sweetheart. Love him. That's it.

1864
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:17,160
Racism is bad. That's what I've learned from Disco Elysium.

1865
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:23,080
I'm glad you finally get it. I used to think that maybe it was a little bit

1866
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:26,680
based, but Disco Elysium taught me that it's cringe, actually.

1867
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:33,080
People will cringe at you if you are racist. And you don't want that.

1868
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:38,680
No. I wouldn't say so.

1869
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:47,640
I don't have any notes. I think we said this before we started recording, but there's no,

1870
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:51,720
there's been no new One Piece chapter in two weeks now. It seems like.

1871
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,840
No. That's maybe one's going to come out tomorrow.

1872
01:46:54,840 --> 01:47:02,280
Maybe. Yeah. I thought I was going to, I didn't look last week because I was like,

1873
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:06,920
no, no, I'll save. I'll save the One Piece discussion for when Gibbs back. But I guess

1874
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:13,800
there was there was none anyway. So Oda's getting lazy. He's getting sloppy in his old age. He's

1875
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:21,480
losing his touch. You know, maybe you should pitch maybe you should pitch Clarissa since they're

1876
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:27,160
like clearly One Piece has fallen off to show and jump. They need a new one. Oh, wait, I guess

1877
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:31,960
you already did that. I already did that. That's the Tezuka challenge. Right.

1878
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:37,880
I got a note from a curatorium. He said this fucking sucks. Get better at drawing. And I was

1879
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:42,280
like, right. But you know, but you know what? But you know what? If there if there wasn't any hope

1880
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:46,120
for you, they wouldn't, he wouldn't have even bothered to tell you that it sucks and you need

1881
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:51,160
to improve. So that's good. It's good, actually. It is good. Well, I'm just saying that One Piece

1882
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:55,880
is falling off because it's gone two weeks without an update. So I think Oda's probably finished.

1883
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,560
He's toast.

1884
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:09,000
This 2023. Did we even talk about the new year? This is the first one? No, I've been on for the

1885
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:15,400
new year. Yeah, I guess I guess I guess fuck the new year. It's just another year. But wait,

1886
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:20,600
no, you didn't we record one? No, you were on we recorded one on the second.

1887
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,560
Yeah, because there was two weeks ago.

1888
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:32,440
Did I? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know, yeah. Look at the calendar. Look at the calendar.

1889
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:38,200
I'm looking at it. Yeah. 2023, though. Huh. About that. Yeah, I know. Right. I saw you tweet

1890
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:44,840
that like the January is just like the start or it's just like this practice warm up. It's

1891
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,920
a warm up. That's it. Yeah. It doesn't it doesn't feel like like I'm ready to do anything yet.

1892
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:56,040
It's just sort of like, yeah, I mean, yeah, I get it. Yeah, I know, like we did the whole like

1893
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:02,520
2023, but like, come on, it's not actually the new year yet. That's how January always feels.

1894
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,560
You get to the end of January like, wow, that was yeah, I know. It was quick.

1895
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:12,040
Halfway through it already. Well, we almost two, two thirds of the way through it by the time

1896
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:14,440
this episode's out. Think about that.

1897
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:25,640
I hate it. I just don't care for it very much. I want to get back on the wagon, the drawing

1898
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:34,360
comics wagon. Oh, yeah. Well, that's what I need to get going. Just just make chapter four. Just

1899
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:38,120
make chapter four and then post it and then people be like Pog because at the moment, I don't know

1900
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:43,800
if anyone's Poggin. I don't know if he's Poggin and it's a big problem. Nobody's Poggin about

1901
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:49,960
Clarissa Gunsmoke. I mean, maybe now that the the 3D thing came out that the commission that did

1902
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:54,280
that did make him Pog a little bit. Yeah, makes me Pog a lot. And like,

1903
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:03,720
like I think partly it's just because it's been so long and also most people haven't even read it

1904
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:09,960
yet because I didn't I didn't push it as hard as Beldrape maybe because maybe it's just because it

1905
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:15,560
wasn't finished. Yeah, I guess it wasn't finished. And that was the thing. Chapter four is the next

1906
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:24,440
chapter. Yeah, it still won't be finished. I'll have to draw even more pages. But I should do that.

1907
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,720
I should I should do chapter four by the end of the month. I think I can do that much.

1908
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:33,080
I really should. I'm not going to I'm not going to say I'm not going to complain more

1909
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:39,560
about how I haven't finished the book yet. I really was yesterday. I was having a really good

1910
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:45,960
I made really good progress yesterday. I'm really I think I think I've got everything. I think I've

1911
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:53,000
actually collected everything now that I need to put into the final like index. And I don't think

1912
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,440
I need any more. Pretty much the index just needed everything to tell the complete story pretty much

1913
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:06,520
the complete story of Chris Chan's Chris Chan's interaction with Endless War to give the background

1914
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:13,800
for the rain and stuff and like how that happened. I just wanted to put in context for like why that

1915
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:19,000
happened. And I think I've got everything. What I had to do was I had to go through the the discord

1916
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,400
logs itself and find like when she joined the server, when she got killed, the various times she

1917
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:29,320
got killed, the things she said in response to being killed, which were very funny. Her like

1918
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:35,080
making up commands like Moxby dash and goddess protection and stuff. I forgot that was her.

1919
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:40,760
That the people made like the people were doing that. Yeah. No, it was funny. That was a funny meme.

1920
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:47,960
It's you're there's some you're in some of like the chat logs because like there was like you

1921
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:54,600
asked her like what her slime Sona would be and she replied with the the the card that was like

1922
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:59,720
her like goddess Sonichu form and it's like I am immune to the slime and I move at bullet speed

1923
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:07,080
so the slime can't catch me. Oh, there's a part there's a part after that where like what is it

1924
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:14,760
hang on it's like she said she said oh god.

1925
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:25,240
Yeah, you say like make a slime Sona and like and and and can he said if you if you die you can

1926
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:31,960
revive in the sewers and Chris is just like I'm just visiting for now but I protect and I protect

1927
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:39,480
myself and I dash as I am needed and you're just like nice and and Smirik says all ever

1928
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:46,440
and all right and everyone's just like okay cool very cool just just the way that she the

1929
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:53,080
literally the way that she's just like um actually uh I'm invincible actually like actually the rules

1930
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:58,840
of the game don't apply to me like actually I just win honestly um this is very it's pretty it's

1931
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:06,520
pretty funny uh and then she gets mad uh when she when she she she revived and then Dupati killed

1932
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:13,160
her immediately and then she and then she she revives again but that this time she revives

1933
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:21,320
and does goddess protection and goddess healing and says uh well I won't read the full text but

1934
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:27,080
she wrote this long thing about like um I'm not actually in the server like I'm not actually dead

1935
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:33,400
you didn't actually kill me uh you can't because I'm invincible uh by moxby dash

1936
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:41,720
you know that stuff and I think the point is I think it's so juvenile but it's it's very funny

1937
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:47,480
so I think I think I've I think I've fully collected all that and I'm like okay I'm done

1938
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:52,440
I'm done I have everything I need uh and now now it's literally just like

1939
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:57,240
fitted into the pages and I'm doing like a color coding thing where like different people's

1940
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:02,040
taxes and different colors to like make it look nice and make it improve readability so I just

1941
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:07,560
gotta do all that formatting and stuff and I won't I shouldn't complain I don't want to complain

1942
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:12,040
about this anymore I talk about this too much I too much I'm too much talking not enough action

1943
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:19,000
you know uh like that Elvis song just just like Elvis did I ever tell you did I mention that guy

1944
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:26,440
who like Elvis Presley yeah the guy the kid who like lived in my old house

1945
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:33,640
for a month or two and he like didn't know who Elvis was I I don't remember like he'd never hurt

1946
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:40,200
there was I think his name was Jerry and he was a Chinese kid like he had grown up like half

1947
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:46,200
he spoke perfectly good English because like he had spent much he had grown up somewhat in America

1948
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:53,240
but also somewhat in China like he'd sort of been back and forth and he we had there was a for

1949
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:58,680
summary our neighbors had an a party for like an older relative of theirs and they had an Elvis

1950
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:05,320
impersonator and we were out in the yard like just you know observing this and Jerry did not know

1951
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:11,560
who Elvis was and I just think that's remarkable

1952
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:19,960
it is kind of like I remember in cartoons and stuff there would be like oh it's the Elvis

1953
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:25,560
parody character Elvis is like a pop culture icon that Elvis Elvis is a people will know what it

1954
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:32,040
means Elvis is a pop culture I don't do that anymore the shows do that does it did adventure time do

1955
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:40,200
that um I can't remember if adventure time did it I mean adventure time is kind of old at this point

1956
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:48,120
like a little bit nowadays nowadays these kids getting like these like teen dramas these cartoons

1957
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:54,440
with okay serious stakes and they don't make Elvis jokes anymore not like the good old days not like

1958
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:59,640
the good old days of adventure time like I mean Elvis was already old by the by the time adventure

1959
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:07,320
time was out uh yeah of course he's he's my feeling my feeling is that Elvis is I mean Elvis was

1960
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:15,160
already old by the time like I was growing up and like I had there were no shortage of Elvis

1961
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:22,040
stuff I don't know I just I feel like he's a ubiquitous cultural icon who well pretty much

1962
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:28,440
never completely go away I mean I know I'm from growing up but like I don't see Elvis

1963
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:35,400
things so like I think it's quite possible you just don't come across it right now

1964
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:43,880
unless you like the music and you continue to listen to the music I I you know honestly I would

1965
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:51,160
have to be I can't really say because I don't like watch shows I don't really watch that much media

1966
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:58,760
anymore so like maybe maybe Elvis references have ceased to be a thing in the time that Jerry was

1967
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:04,840
growing up I feel like maybe maybe not just in shows but like a lot of entertainment is through

1968
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:15,880
YouTube and what YouTuber would drop an Elvis reference I mean perhaps perhaps perhaps maybe

1969
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:21,320
they'd reference memes Elvis doesn't have a meme that's the reason he doesn't have like a

1970
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:30,280
big text low bottom text meme we used we used to call memes jokes back in the day

1971
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:40,440
even Freddie Mercury had a meme yet that like hand like pose it turned into a rage comic thing

1972
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:46,520
hand pose it's like he's got his hand way up and it's like fuck yeah it's like

1973
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:56,680
I did it Freddie Mercury I saw that in rage comics maybe that that's definitely not used so much

1974
01:57:56,680 --> 01:58:04,520
anymore might have might have seen that if you if you want to live through post death if you want

1975
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:12,600
to become an icon you've got to become a meme yeah it's like you know unfortunately Elvis died

1976
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:18,920
before rage comics existed so there was never any hope that he would be memorialized unlike

1977
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:31,560
Freddie Mercury who who was just born just in time just in time uh man the the the the feeling

1978
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:38,040
I get I get a feeling uh from Disco Elysium whenever they talk about disco

1979
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:45,000
uh I I feel Elysium no

1980
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:54,360
no uh I just I feel the groove no just whenever the way they talk about disco as like basically

1981
01:58:54,360 --> 01:59:01,400
a trend that came and went uh I feel like I guess I've become old enough that like I understand

1982
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:05,560
I understand the feeling of like hey that thing that I used to like that is completely like

1983
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:13,880
everyone's over it and it's not a thing anymore really like I I now feel like I know what it's like

1984
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:22,520
uh and I don't know I can I can relate I can relate that feeling to something like um I don't know

1985
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:29,720
what's another what's another trend that came and went in my lifetime uh I emo scene kids I skateboarding

1986
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:36,600
yeah skateboarding was like the huge skateboard culture in the nineties but now it's like

1987
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:42,600
yeah I don't know sometimes you see somebody skating that's it yeah in real life that's all

1988
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:49,880
I think I think so I was watching I saw a clip of some freaking uh some freaking hippies

1989
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:58,600
some freaking hippies uh back in the day and I saw this clip of it they were being interviewed

1990
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:03,080
and they were asking them like hey what's all this hippie stuff about and there was these three

1991
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,400
white people that were they responded they were they were sitting in a big field

1992
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:15,480
you know just hanging out lots of people were there white people and they were just like yeah

1993
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:21,080
I just don't want to be like my parents you know like I just you know uh uh it's not all about

1994
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:24,520
money it's not all about working it's about money it's just about living it's just about being

1995
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:33,000
being in the vibe it's about vibing and like uh I agree I I get it and I agree with that but but

1996
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,760
this tweet was presented and the kind was like you know like a lot of these hippies all went

1997
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:43,160
on to become Reaganites right like these hippies that were all like a lot of them the white ones

1998
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:47,720
in particular I mean I guess hippies being they weren't really black hippies no they were no that's

1999
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:52,360
not true but like people like being a hippie pretty much meant nothing like politically like what do

2000
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:57,320
you stand for it pretty much meant nothing it was just a cultural thing it was like a a a

2001
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:03,080
a hedonism thing like someone like the black panthers would have had like a real like political

2002
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:09,400
agenda but like the hippies were just kind of there to do drugs and have sex

2003
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:16,120
and then they went on to vote for Reagan yeah and it and it's truly despicable

2004
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:27,480
hippies these days vote for yang it still sucks I nothing's changed yang spoke the language of

2005
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:38,120
the welfare state like yang made it sound like he wanted a more a a a an even velveteer glove

2006
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:47,640
on the um on the budgetary policy and I like that it but it was all smoke and mirrors he was

2007
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:54,600
just obfuscating his weird stupid tech bro thing I was I was fooled I was fooled but he deliberately

2008
02:01:54,600 --> 02:02:02,040
tried to fool me okay fool me once shame on him that's what I'm saying it's not my fault talk

2009
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:08,600
about the the tweet where like yang was like sucking up to elon musk on twitter was that recent

2010
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:13,880
I don't think it was recent but it was something that happened it was like okay yang whatever

2011
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:19,880
um I don't remember that we already knew you were a little little bitch but now this is embarrassing

2012
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:26,920
uh what do you say was it was it like post twitter takeover I think it must have been pre it was

2013
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:33,880
wasn't that recent honestly I've seen like I've seen people like being I mean I've seen people

2014
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:39,480
criticizing elon including people like mark cuban and stuff like even even fellow billionaires are

2015
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:47,880
like um which is funny but I've also seen people being like oh like Stephen king was like way too

2016
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:57,080
nice uh after like that after musk like Stephen Stephen hasn't had a brawl in his life he didn't

2017
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:03,000
have a brawl uh uh no that's what I mean he's like oh yeah just like oh the slightest confrontation

2018
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,480
no no no he's a lovely man I'm sure like yeah yeah didn't want to didn't want to start anything

2019
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:14,440
terrible elon was being such a little bitch and and then for Stephen king just be like oh it's fine

2020
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:18,680
oh he's just like no he's acting like a little pussy he's acting like an annoying little little

2021
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:25,960
bitch to you call him a little cunt it's still funny to me that like Stephen king's comment about

2022
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,240
it's too expensive and then elon was like what if I change it what if I lower it to eight and then

2023
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:37,640
that's the number yeah because Stephen king turned it into an eight dollar thing that is funny that

2024
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:45,640
it's just because Stephen king said it was too expensive that's pretty good um damn I can't believe

2025
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:50,840
it anytime I see I can't believe the kind of accounts that I see subscribe to fucking twitter

2026
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:55,240
blue I don't I genuinely don't understand I'll see some people with like with like 50 followers

2027
02:03:55,240 --> 02:04:00,120
that are subscribed to twitter blue it's like why what are you spending that eight dollars for

2028
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:08,440
they like the check mark I is that literally is that literally it I mean I don't know I think

2029
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:14,440
twitter blue has a bunch of like fluff that it says that you can get if you subscribe so like

2030
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:20,120
stuff that doesn't matter at all yeah on honestly I would kind of understand I don't like it but I

2031
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:25,720
kind of understand if someone is like like a business account like if someone is like livelihood

2032
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:29,080
is like some business that they run and they promote using their twitter account I could

2033
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:34,440
kind of understand that like you know if if twitter blue promises like greater reach or

2034
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:39,960
priority to your tweets or whatever I can understand who'd be like well if I don't get that it'll hurt

2035
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:45,160
my sales or whatever yeah but if you're just some guy with like a hundred followers

2036
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:56,040
why what what would you even get out of it it's either dick sucking or yeah it's like it's like

2037
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:01,320
virtue signal it's like a kind of virtue signaling yeah it's like I'm doing my part to make this website

2038
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:09,400
be the uh the uh starship troopers I'm doing my part um catching yeah

2039
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:20,200
I want to ah no no reason to bring this up I just I had a big nostalgia thing a few days ago

2040
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:25,720
about a bunch of British shows but of course you don't know any of them so is your point

2041
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:29,800
bring it up I probably don't I mean unless you want to just throw some names out and see if

2042
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:37,640
I've heard of any of them uh yeah I mean there's no way they're like well now I'm curious yeah uh

2043
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:43,720
Bernhard's watch no show about a kid who has a watch that stops time and he does things when

2044
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:49,240
the time is stopped and I remember the cinematography being like wow how do they pause it how do they

2045
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:57,320
pause real life it's very compelling uh no they things didn't have gravity when they were paused

2046
02:05:57,320 --> 02:06:04,920
it was like 90s or late 80s like visual effects I remember liking that just freeze just freeze frame

2047
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:11,000
just freeze frame and green screen yeah and then you can move around in them uh that was a fun one

2048
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:20,200
there was uh my parents are aliens my parents the aliens come to earth they disguise themselves as

2049
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:26,920
human adults and uh they get some kids from the orphanage and they have a wacky fun time it's a

2050
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:32,280
sitcom interesting and and the parents don't know what human life is and the orphans have to the

2051
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:36,920
the kids have to explain to them and they have to make sure no one finds out that their parents are

2052
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:43,080
I think the joke is that oh your parents are cool or your parents are like a little odd but nobody

2053
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:51,240
ever suspects alien I did read um my my teacher is an alien which was a series of books as a kid

2054
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:59,640
you know those nope you know they're a series of of you know young fairly young children's novels

2055
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:06,760
but you know they're they're like they're like animorphs but like aimed even younger uh and

2056
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:14,360
you know I actually follow the author of those books on on uh on twitter you know I realized

2057
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:19,640
thinking back I feel like I might have said this before but I'll say it again uh I saw that guy on

2058
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:24,520
twitter his name is Bruce Coville and I was like oh he's the guy who wrote those books that I read

2059
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:33,080
as a kid and I remembered I remembered that like uh those books kind of have a pretty like they sort

2060
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:42,360
of have a pretty like big business bad uh uh they have a pretty like leftist uh uh like politics

2061
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:47,000
sort of current under cutting them especially in like the the the last one it sort of gets like

2062
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:53,000
the it talks about like how the aliens like see the earth and like all the all the problems that

2063
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:59,160
are on earth and a lot of it is like yeah resources are being hoarded by like you know individuals

2064
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:03,160
when there's enough to go around but it's not being shared due to like economic reasons

2065
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:10,440
and I was like oh wow wait a minute Bruce Coville is based actually he told me that communism was

2066
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:19,800
good when I was a little child he groomed me and I appreciate it um so yeah oh and now he just

2067
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:25,480
tweets about how like you know republicans are bad I'm like yes thank you Bruce you're right

2068
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:33,160
good good man keep keep doing what you're doing what were you saying uh here's a show that I think

2069
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:37,640
did come to America but it's under a different name or maybe it came from America probably that

2070
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:45,160
way direction uh jungle run put a link uh jungle run is like they're in the jungle and it's a bunch

2071
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:51,160
of kids and they have to do obstacle courses to get the jewels in the crystal caves and the monkeys

2072
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:57,080
are gonna throw bananas at them and they have to like it's really cool is it like um did you ever

2073
02:08:57,080 --> 02:09:03,480
see a legend of the hidden temple yeah I think that's the I don't know if they're like directly like

2074
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:11,160
the same show but like ones from the UK and ones from the US like the same production company sold

2075
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:16,280
the rights or whatever yeah it but it's not the same name so maybe not I mean it's a it's a

2076
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:21,560
different uh different set and everything yeah it's all filmed in the UK or or somewhere

2077
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:29,640
and it's like this is from 2002 yeah oh this was I mean I think uh I don't I don't know if

2078
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:37,480
legend of the hidden temple was still running in 2002 yeah maybe is maybe it's a spiritual successor

2079
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:42,520
perhaps but I really love jungle oh that kid fell in the water ha ha ha lol he fell in the brown

2080
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:51,800
water gross you that water I really that they had a thing where at the very end of the thing they had

2081
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:57,800
like a big monkey head and based on your success in the trials proceeding it uh you had a certain

2082
02:09:57,800 --> 02:10:05,480
amount of seconds oh my to go in there and do a puzzle and collect uh one of three monkey statues

2083
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:10,680
there's a bronze a silver and a gold one and if you did really well on the puzzle and if you did

2084
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:14,360
if you had a lot of seconds in order to do you know really well you could get the gold one but

2085
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:20,440
then you had to grab it and you have to run out before the monkey mouth closes and when the monkey

2086
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:28,200
mouth closes um the show acts like the children are locked in there forever and they'll die because

2087
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:35,800
they they took too long they got like too greedy they got freaking uh uh Aladdin like giant jaguar head

2088
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:42,040
yeah uh the mouth closed the mouth closed and they're like and the presenter would be like

2089
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:49,960
ah looks like they're not coming back and I when I was a kid I was like no they're dead I was so

2090
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:54,680
scared I didn't want to apply to this show that's awesome I really wanted to do it but like what if

2091
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:59,480
I died that was my thought process I remember that very specifically but like what if I died though

2092
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:03,800
what if I die in the monkey head I don't want to risk that damn I really like this show but like

2093
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:10,200
all those kids freaking die on it all the time like that's a bummer Sid and Elvis the fucking

2094
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:16,280
orangutans those men and like those people in monkey costumes are so awkward looking

2095
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:20,840
yeah they're pretty cheap looking yeah just throwing shit

2096
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:31,720
oh and why are the kids why are the kids and the host all wearing these like weird costumes

2097
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:38,120
with weird rubber masks oh wait they're just British oh dear tragic um

2098
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:46,280
um jungle no I never heard of that I want to play this in real life I want an escape room

2099
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:54,520
that's like a real huge jungle that I can run through I think I think I would I think I would

2100
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:58,680
find that escape rooms annoying if I tried them in real life I don't know I don't think I would

2101
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:04,600
enjoy them I I don't think so either I think there's something about it being just a room

2102
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:09,800
and you're usually with a group of people but when I'm doing like a point and click escape room

2103
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:17,560
like like a game yeah it's like oh it's spooky and I'm not trying to figure out all of the stuff

2104
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:22,360
and I'm pondering to myself and I'm thinking and I'm finding clues but in an escape rooms that I've

2105
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:27,400
seen you got a group of friends and you're like oh what's this what's that and I would feel so annoyed

2106
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:32,920
if I wasn't the guy who found the clue I was just looking in the wrong place I was like okay well I

2107
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:38,760
guess we're moving on I think I would feel the same way the fact that you're doing it with the group

2108
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:43,560
all also the fact even if I was doing it by myself the fact that like I know that I'm being observed

2109
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:48,520
like like the people that like hosts but like the people that make the room would are like watching

2110
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:52,440
you and like they give you sure you're not jacking off and they give you hints if you need it and

2111
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:58,280
stuff and like I think that would just really unsettle me and like really take me out of it

2112
02:12:58,280 --> 02:13:03,160
just knowing that and then also yeah but you're doing it with a group is like even more so like

2113
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:09,320
I have to like I can't just like focus on the thing I have to like also be interacting with

2114
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:14,920
this group and I think it would take me out of it and I think I would just be like rolling my eyes

2115
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:19,880
I think I would I think I would find clues or whatever and I would just roll my eyes like oh

2116
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:27,000
okay they're doing a oh it's a murder mystery oh I found this the murder note uh they the the

2117
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:33,880
theme uh corny but then find it really corny I think my my my gamer brain and my socializing

2118
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:41,240
brain are so different like I feel like trying to do one or the other would like ruin something

2119
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:46,040
like if I tried to play the game I would be so anti-social yeah if I tried to be social I wouldn't

2120
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:55,160
be paying attention to what's around me yeah that makes sense I think I I definitely I think I would

2121
02:13:55,160 --> 02:14:03,960
feel pretty much the same about that um anyway British people in the comments comment shows

2122
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:11,080
that you remember and also if you remember the ones I said and say oh my god childhood unlocked

2123
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:19,960
click uh well I don't believe it I don't believe any of these are real they're this proof they're

2124
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:29,560
all too real unfortunately uh Bernard's watch give me a fucking oh that's that's like a fake show

2125
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:34,280
that I would make up if I was like writing about all right let me fucking type in Bernard's watch

2126
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:44,360
I see it I see it here um another one art attack and brom art attack art attack is legendary

2127
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:50,120
dick it oh I see dick and dom and de bungalow I type my parents are aliens I type my parents

2128
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:54,760
are aliens and it gave me a bunch of related searches and yeah I see yeah it's the same

2129
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:02,840
it's the same oh brum oh that's like baby childhood the story of Tracy beaker Tracy beaker

2130
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:10,920
that's another big one they roll on like it was like cbbc and c itv but like itv and bbc

2131
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:17,000
children's programming slots how many how many letters how many letters are you lgbtq people

2132
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:23,400
how do you how many letters do you need they're two different networks I see it i tv c itv

2133
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:29,880
is the children's version of itv which is usually channel three and then bbc was channel one and two

2134
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:36,600
mm-hmm and cbbc is a different channel the children's bbc and we switched between them

2135
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:41,480
because they had everything there was no ads well i think on c itv there were ads but

2136
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:48,920
it was just a bunch of cool shows all in a row very rarely was there like an american show

2137
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:55,480
maybe just keep your mind keep your mind pure arthur came in arthur was a big one

2138

pooh story was called when we were very young but the bear in it is called edward even though it's

2160
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:52,280

2161
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:57,320

2167
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:43,000

2168
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:49,320
no is it andrew jackson he was cantankerous i don't know anything about american presidents

2169
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:56,760
except that lincoln had a beard um the the the story and it's probably apocryphal but the story

2170
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:04,040
about calvin coolage is that like a woman he was he was famously a man of few words and at a party

2171
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:11,640
a woman said to him uh like my friend my friend bet like i bet my friend my friend bet me that i

2172
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:17,800
couldn't get you to say three words to me and he replied you lose uh

2173
02:20:20,440 --> 02:20:24,440
that's fun yeah it's a funny a funny anecdote who knows if it's true or not

2174
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:32,200
he could have said fuck off yeah fuck you better

2175
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:37,480
he said die and he pulled out a gun

2176
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:54,200
uh um um who's the tigger uh bill clinton um who's the who's the rue uh taft uh uh

2177
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:57,880
what about the kanga uh hillary clinton oh wait

2178
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:11,480
owl i forgot what the hell is like uh well i was gonna say smart but

2179
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:16,520
actually no he's just pompous he's pompous and he thinks he's smart but he's not

2180
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:26,280
and christopher robin is joe biden autobiography christopher yeah he's christopher robinette biden

2181
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:33,960
this is like this is the new um the new like instead of you never heard people say that like

2182
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:39,480
the winnie the pooh characters are all different like mental disorders uh yeah i think i heard that

2183
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:47,960
yeah like pooh is adhd uh eeyore's depression uh owl is like narcissism or maybe uh

2184
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:56,520
it's not a disorder it is narcissistic personality disorder is uh it's like a b cluster or whatever

2185
02:21:56,520 --> 02:22:04,120
you call it might yeah um i don't think of it as a disorder but i guess so it's a it's a personality

2186
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:10,600
disorder like uh like like bpd it's one of those big penis discharge what does that mean

2187
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:19,720
borderline borderline personality disorder not by not bipolar disorder that's not bpd

2188
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:28,120
borderline personality disorder and that they borderline have a personality borderline personality

2189
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:33,000
disorder i don't know it's just one of those it's just a particular kind of shitty personality

2190
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:39,000
that you might have i don't know i'm not exactly sure what what what's the line between like when

2191
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:44,520
are when do you have a personality disorder and when are you just have a shitty personality

2192
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:50,440
and i maybe there is no difference maybe there is no line yeah uh although i know that people

2193
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:56,120
with with like personality disorders like that i guess like they i've heard they's like they have

2194
02:22:56,120 --> 02:23:00,840
to manage their symptoms right like people like like apparently like you can have narcissistic

2195
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:05,640
personality disorder but you can have it but you like you just have to like keep in mind that

2196
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:11,640
you have it all the time and like adjust your natural adjust how you behave to like go against

2197
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:16,840
your natural inclinations just based on knowledge of like okay i know that i'm just my disorder

2198
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:21,560
thinking makes me feel like i should do this but i know that that's like a narcissistic thing to do

2199
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:31,080
and so i should do this other thing instead um so i mean i don't know sounds i don't know

2200
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:36,360
so you're you're just remember that you're depressed all the time and just try to be happy

2201
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:44,680
okay and just smile instead smile you're you're pretty when you smile okay i guess uh well he

2202
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:49,400
you know he he comes he goes up to the clouds he goes up to watch the clouds when he's happy

2203
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:56,120
yeah and now he's got six wives and now yes and they've cured his his depression

2204
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:04,840
i wonder um okay at least two at least two of his wives are like mother and daughter

2205
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:16,760
possibly more that's weird right that is weird but is it illegal is it fucked up i don't

2206
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:26,040
i don't know that it's illegal well well i mean hmm is it fucked up i mean they're not they're not

2207
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:31,000
married to each other they're married to you they're they're like well yeah i guess i don't

2208
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:39,160
know the terminology for like polygonal polygonal polygonal um polygamous marriages like what do you

2209
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:47,800
say to to the two wives what are they to do each other i mean sisters but not really in yeah in like

2210
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:54,200
Mormon polygamy i've heard them call each other sister wives and i mean i guess they are like

2211
02:24:54,840 --> 02:25:02,600
since they each parallel lives i mean your if your sibling married a woman they would be your

2212
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:13,400
sister-in-law so if your spouse marries a woman well okay if you're that'll be your lover-in-law

2213
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:23,960
are you are you also okay okay i think i think are you your own sibling uh if you are if you are

2214
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:30,600
your own sibling then i think i would say that you are also your spouses that you are also your

2215
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:39,080
spouse's in-law as well as their spouse and therefore your spouse's spouse is another of your

2216
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:47,160
in-law so you are sister-in-laws well i think as well as fellow wives with your spouse's spouse

2217
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:52,600
well i looked up the word sibling sibling is a relative that shares at least one parent with

2218
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:59,400
the subject so it's it's it's your your only a sibling in relation to someone else i mean sure

2219
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:08,520
you can't be your own i feel intuitively i feel like yeah i mean i guess technically you're not

2220
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:14,520
your own in-law and you're not your own sibling but like you have you have you other than the fact

2221
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:20,520
that you are yourself and not another person you meet all the criteria of being a sibling

2222
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:27,000
with your own siblings and all the criteria of being an in-law with your in-laws you know what i'm

2223
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:34,040
saying i guess to me it intuitively makes sense that you would that you are that if you are you

2224
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:41,400
and another woman are both married to the same guy you are sister in-laws even though a tech i guess

2225
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:50,760
an in-law is your sibling's spouse or your spouse's sibling and your spouse is not your sibling your

2226
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:58,360
spouse is not your sibling unless it's not de facto your sibling well okay but if your if

2227
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:07,960
your sibling if your sibling marries someone they become your in your sibling in-law so i feel like

2228
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:15,160
if you marry someone i guess you wouldn't become a sibling in-law because you are not your own sibling

2229
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:21,960
they just become yourself in-law because you are yourself i have no idea what you're getting at

2230
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:31,400
i'm saying it's like you're even i just feel like the relationship of an in-law is satisfied

2231
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:38,760
if you marry i feel like you you you you you are your spouse's in-law and therefore your spouse's

2232
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:48,520
spouse is another of your in-laws and therefore you are in a certain sense a sibling in-law

2233
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:55,800
of your fellow polygamous wives i don't think you ever thought about this hence the term sister

2234
02:27:55,800 --> 02:28:04,280
wives i think so so is so is it incest no is it incest if you marry a mother and daughter you are

2235
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:10,120
are you or are you merely rendering them are you rendering them siblings in-law of one another

2236
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:21,400
and is this is this evil or is this good it would be it would be like adjacent to evil but not

2237
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:29,880
literally evil can we arrest your why did he do it he's he's tearing the powers family apart

2238
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:36,200
with his with his with his pure riz he's so irresistible to these powers women that he's his

2239
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:41,240
charisma is destroying their family we've got to do something about it i keep i mean he is like a

2240
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:47,000
little stuffed animal it makes sense that they all want to hug him so cute what i maybe they have

2241
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:55,000
like a maybe they have like a uh uh uh what's the word a platonic marriage maybe they don't

2242
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:03,160
fuck uh yeah maybe hmm has your ever fucked in the show don't i don't think so uh not to my

2243
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:11,480
knowledge not to my knowledge did kangaroo make roux did she be pregnant are you asking if

2244
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:19,720
ira is roux's dad no i'm just saying to these animals is is uh conceit conception possible

2245
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:23,560
i know they're all plush toys and it's all in on christopher robin's head except it's not it's real

2246
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:30,200
it's real it's real um i mean i guess the implication is that rue is she gave birth to him

2247
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:35,080
even though that never actually happened who's the dad that's the that's the new show that's a new

2248
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:40,840
episode here here's here's what i'm confused about okay in the in the eor group one of the

2249
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:47,160
wives is laura powers and one of the wives is ruth powers and that is ruth is laura's mom but

2250
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:55,720
there's also someone called ruth jr ruth powers jr but like who the fuck is that it's probably like a

2251
02:29:55,720 --> 02:30:04,760
flashback episode younger version or i mean i can't find any um i can't find any reference to

2252
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:13,480

02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:40,680
to the other two because there were six he had six girlfriends but he only married four of them

2257
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:47,080
what did the other six do wrong where's this on the timeline i was this yesterday yeah this is

2258
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:52,280
he divorced two of them already i don't i think he just didn't marry them but didn't wasn't there a

2259
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:58,520
thing with his six wives like wasn't that i must have misread he no he had six girlfriends but

2260
02:30:58,520 --> 02:31:03,560
according to the suite he only has four wives and i just want to know the whole story okay i just

2261
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:08,520
want to i just want to understand laughed at captain caveman's battle cry and the director

2262
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:15,000
said hey that's funny maybe okay maybe he has six wives but only four of them were just included in

2263
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:21,800
this scene yeah maybe he has more wives i think i think he probably married he did marry all six

2264
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:28,760
i mean i i'm gonna i think i should assume that until proven maybe on january first okay i'm gonna

2277
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:21,320
b i died no idea maybe i should just ask him yeah it is okay that's that's incredible all right i'm

2278
02:33:21,640 --> 02:33:28,600
i'm probably gonna ask him like who who are these two other people are they like alternate

2279
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:35,080
timeline versions maybe it's like maybe it's like ruth as shown in like a flashback episode

2280
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:43,560
i can't get over his his filmmaking style of like playing a clip pausing moving to another

2281
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:50,680
tab where he's prepared the reaction shot in a different video yeah plays that pauses next one

2282
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:57,720
like does he know that he could put these clips into like a free program like vegas and he could

2283
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:03,880
just like he could cut i feel like he would enjoy it i think he would he would enjoy the the product

2284
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:12,120
of that more i i don't know i feel like that's a whole lot of steps it's easier just to set him

2285
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:18,600
all up and then get your phone out record him i guess i mean i think he could do it

2286
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:29,720
well see you know i see no reason he wouldn't be able to do it so well i is it maybe this is just

2287
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:37,800
yeah this method of record different tabs with my phone maybe that's that's good enough that

2288
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:44,680
that gets him where he needs to be he just made a tweet and he says elephant race period yeah it's

2289
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:50,200
a picture of elephant race yeah it's not like it's something he edited it's just a picture

2290
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:58,440
uh well didn't he put like um oh yeah it is just a picture there was one from my show

2291
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:03,880
there was one where he put yeah yeah uh team i like this one a lot team eor at the burrow race

2292
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:08,520
with ruth powers laura powers and arison taylor as racers and eor as the starter

2293
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:15,640
he's at uh he's at uh uh what's that cat's name

2294
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:29,000
uh hang on did you post that or yeah yeah i just posted it oh um oh yeah i know it from

2295
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:34,360
hannah barbarus stuff i don't remember what he's from he like edited a smile onto one of the

2296
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:36,440
is that ruth powers b

2297
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:44,680
is it because she's wearing a different outfit is this like a different time different episode

2298
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:52,600
okay it looks to me i just i just don't know

2299
02:35:52,920 --> 02:36:00,120
no one of his girlfriends is just the same as his other girlfriend but wearing a different shirt

2300
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:11,320
he just likes the fit he can't he can't decide he has to have both two people this guy's got a

2301
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:16,360
type this guy's got a type and it's this specific family lineage from the simpsons

2302
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:23,400
it looks like in the burrow race like cut off of the torso cut off at like the crotch area and then

2303
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:30,520
just standing yeah alison is just standing there she's got her full her full feet good for her

2304
02:36:31,880 --> 02:36:36,600
i like that they're on a blue background to sort of blend into the sky it's good it's a good effort

2305
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:42,760
it's that's attention to detail that i appreciate that is and you could do vegas stuff well so vegas

2306
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:49,880
isn't free it's not a free program no you have to pirate it uh you've had it for so long you forgot

2307
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:55,000
yeah i did okay i mean fine windows movie maker then if you're just gonna cut clips together

2308
02:36:56,120 --> 02:37:01,800
yeah that they're perfectly serviceable yeah i should go to the bathroom i'll be back in a second

2309
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:10,760
all right i guess i'll go as well okay i'm back you there mm yeah um what's up uh

2310
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,800
uh you know let's explore that

2311
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:20,200
oh i played um i played the madagascar ps2 video game

2312
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:27,320
yeah what was that like not too long ago it's good it's like a good little platformer is it

2313
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:34,440
like a collectathon yeah you collect some stuff uh you basically you got some levels where you got

2314
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:42,120
to do the events of the movie and you got like uh all the characters from the film and they're

2315
02:37:42,120 --> 02:37:47,160
not voice acted by their voice actors but the voice actors do a very good job of impersonating

2316
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:56,040
uh they got they got the old uh dan castellanetta impersonating robin williams uh syndrome

2317
02:37:56,200 --> 02:38:05,320
huh well you know in in um you know the genie was robin williams but then in all the non in all

2318
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:10,520
the like sequels and all the adaptations he's voiced by dan castellanetta doing his best robin

2319
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:18,360
williams impersonation yeah well it's not because robin williams is like fuck you pay me maybe it's

2320
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:26,920
not uh it's not really about that he didn't get paid it's that like he had a sort of weird kind

2321
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:33,960
of like uh thing where like he he really i don't know i don't know how if i should really believe

2322
02:38:33,960 --> 02:38:40,520
this but what i've heard is that he just really didn't want the movie to be like super like

2323
02:38:40,520 --> 02:38:46,360
commercialized and he didn't want to like make the movie about him and he didn't like want it to

2324
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:51,960
have any sequels and so when it had sequels he didn't want to like come back right like i think

2325
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:56,200
i think they did a commodity or whatever i think he liked the movie and he wanted to be part of it

2326
02:38:56,200 --> 02:39:05,000
but he didn't want it to um like be he didn't want to like sell the movie like on his as like a robin

2327
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:10,280
williams product or something or he he didn't like i don't know that's what i've heard and that sounds

2328
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:15,080
like it's honestly as i say it i'm like that sounds like some robin williams like apologia

2329
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:19,240
that sounds like some very like oh he's just such a he's just such a visionary he didn't

2330
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:25,880
like the commercialism of it like robin williams is not bill waterson maybe he is i don't know

2331
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:34,920
i heard he was cool but i don't know i i never met him that sounds very flattering it's probably

2332
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:41,560
more like there was beef it's probably there was beef for some reason and the and the the robin

2333
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:49,000
williams side the pro robin williams side of it is he didn't like the way that it was like marketed

2334
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:53,400
and and and he didn't like the idea of there being sequels and stuff so he just didn't come back for

2335
02:39:53,400 --> 02:40:03,400
them i think that's fair perhaps but uh the i looked up because i was the you know um chris

2336
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:09,400
rock does the zebra in madagascar martin zebra yeah um the voice actor in the game

2337
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:14,440
was exactly like chris rock i was like did they really get because this game was like

2338
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:24,360
it's sort of it's a ps2 a licensed game and it's pretty small scope like it's got a bunch of levels

2339
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:32,280
and then you play them and then you win and as one does and you know the animation's great and the

2340
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:37,720
graphics are quite good and it's like nice and the voice acting is like how do they really get

2341
02:40:37,720 --> 02:40:44,040
the voice actors and i looked it up and it's not chris rock it's actually a guy who does i need to

2342
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:55,320
find him um he did the voice of sam ray jack and like a like a billion other things uh i probably

2343
02:40:55,320 --> 02:41:07,320
would have heard his name uh phil lamar hmm okay sounds sort of familiar phil lamar did a trillion

2344
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:16,280
voices in video games and cartoons and it's it was so funny not funny it is cool uh being like wow

2345
02:41:16,280 --> 02:41:26,520
he's that and this and this i forget exactly what it was known for pulp fiction was he pulp fiction

2346
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:36,840
oh he's hermes and futurama oh that's like uh was it fry fry being voice was also voiced by

2347
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:44,280
he was voiced by ren stimpy was the name the name's like billy something i don't know voice of fry

2348
02:41:46,120 --> 02:41:53,960
billy west yeah billy west was also a ren stimpy oh he was he was the name the voice of kit fisto

2349
02:41:53,960 --> 02:42:01,880
and jar jar binks on the lego star wars game oh only in the game not in the movie no the lego

2350
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:07,320
star wars game yeah yeah yeah exactly they didn't have a lego star wars movie holy shit

2351
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:12,360
that would be cool no i mean playing with lego yes i know but i mean that he didn't voice those

2352
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:17,320
characters in the movie they got him for the lego version of the game yeah

2353
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:26,520
it's just so many oh kit fisto is that the the the boundary no he's a tentacle headed

2354
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:31,400
green lightsaber guy jedi oh yeah right okay sure

2355
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:40,440
i don't call him kit fisto because he's into chicks if you know what i mean

2356
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:50,360
i don't that's what this is a plinket said i remember okay yeah in the original samurai jack

2357
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:53,640
he did samurai jack and basically every other character on that show

2358
02:42:54,760 --> 02:43:02,680

2359
02:43:02,680 --> 02:43:12,120
back for like a final season yeah it's called samurai back really no oh uh yeah i saw someone

2360
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:22,600
talking about the last season of samurai jack and i think i had forgot but like i think i think

2361
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:28,280
like they brought it back like later and they did like a more like adult uh uh like sort of like

2362
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:35,000
final run of episodes kind of like how they brought future on back but i'm not sure i just

2363
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:41,320
saw people talking about it and i was like maybe i didn't catch that part i'm scrolling oh my god i'm

cc mentions poo's adventures you remember poo's adventures uh is that different from poo general

2427
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:36,120
poo's adventures of was like a sort of like trend among people that don't know how to make videos

2428
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:42,440
where they would like crudely cut together footage of winnie the pooh with like other cartoons

2429
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:49,080
in order to make like poo's adventures of the little mermaid which is just basically you

2430
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:54,840
like cut reaction shots of winnie the poo into the little mermaid to sort of pretend that like

2431
02:51:54,840 --> 02:52:00,920
the cast of winnie the poo is part of the plot of little mermaid for example i've never seen that it

2432
02:52:01,880 --> 02:52:10,600
i discovered this rabbit hole a while ago a long time ago years ago actually and

2433
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:17,160
you know i considered trying to make like a video about it or honestly i wonder if there's like a

2434
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:22,600
i wonder if there's a lecture in that you know what i'm gonna make a note i might look into this uh

2435
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:34,440
i'm gonna put it in my little uh uh uh uh word document uh all right next one is um

um yeah okay mage's dreams versus ben's i hate cheesies i mean it's just true

2448
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:20,840
yeah is this relating to something you said last episode or is it just no it was a couple

2449
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:27,080
episodes ago i just had i woke up from a random dream in which i just was on twitter uh no not

2450
02:54:27,080 --> 02:54:33,480
on twitter on discord just saying how much i hate cheesie manfredo and then i woke up and i

2451
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:39,400
thought why did i dream of that i said that um you looks like such a sack of potatoes yeah

2452
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:44,200
beard beard's coming like a fake purple onesie beard's coming in good though

2453
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:49,640
beard's coming in good this is nice this is a nice drawing it is a nice drawing is that is

2454
02:54:49,640 --> 02:54:56,840
that is that who's that goblin watching me i thought it was batman i think it's a goblin

2455
02:54:56,840 --> 02:55:05,560
in shadow batman doesn't have pupils when he's wearing his cowl oh yeah not in his animated form

2456
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:14,120
anyway um this is just funny what's with that maze it's like a distant like hedge maze on that hill

2457
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:22,840
yeah i don't know i thought it was just decorate they could be a maze volcano in theory in theory

2458
02:55:22,840 --> 02:55:26,840
amage's dream is more interesting it's more fantastical but i would argue that a hearing

2459
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:32,440
the minutiae of it is not great but you know what the different strokes for different folks i guess

2460
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:41,320
and streams are more psychologically damaging yes they're more about the human heart and

2461
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:48,440
conflict with itself which is the only thing worth writing about as they say um okay why don't

2462
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:55,240
we keep posting this one uh fuck in hell all right the next one is otjdern dot jpeg

2463
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:08,200
i mean what am i what am i supposed to say to this uh i mean are you pogging or are you cringing

2464
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:16,680

2465
02:56:16,680 --> 02:56:21,880
just be pogging too hard that like my face doesn't know what to do anymore i look terrible in this

2466

2467
02:56:28,840 --> 02:56:34,360
yeah you're right well i look bad there too you're wearing the worst there yeah what is this backdrop

2468
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:41,080
just a random it makes me think of breaking bad but it might just be a random desert shot i guess

2469
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:46,920
it's not even the desert because there's trees who won't somebody somebody please

2470
02:56:47,880 --> 02:56:52,920

2471
02:56:52,920 --> 02:57:02,200
comic is it is it called are they called jenny jenny and benny i might be thinking of i think

2472
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:12,040
they're called jenny does this is such a mystery and somebody knows because they keep

2473
02:57:13,240 --> 02:57:18,440
oh i think yeah yeah somebody knows oh god uh okay no i searched

2474
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:24,840
hmm yeah no i searched jenny boob's comic and i got some

2475
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:33,000
interaction results seems to be yeah different this is not what i this is unrelated this is

2476
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:43,240
not what i was looking for okay um you got to keep coming back to the pcp so eventually we'll

2477
02:57:43,240 --> 02:57:48,440
find out what this is that's the that's the long-running hook we got right the moment like what the

2478
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:56,760
fuck i just where are these people from i know that it's a thing that people have seen because

2479
02:57:56,760 --> 02:58:00,920
i've seen it and there were threads about it it was mentioned in threads on something awful

2480
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:14,360
and i just uh but i uh i can't remember one of these days one of these days um okay anyway

2481
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:27,480
next one is i like apple right three two one go favor fruit favor fruit aesthetically i

2482
02:58:28,520 --> 02:58:36,280
like the taste of apple yeah quite a lot um um i think raspberry probably is my favorite because

2483
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:42,760
of the sharpness i mean i like like raspberry like candy i kind of don't really like eating

2484
02:58:42,760 --> 02:58:47,000
raspberries on their own because they have they're so mushy they're like a mushy consistency

2485
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:56,040
okay they're good with like an ice cream thing yeah or just cream um i like um passion fruit

2486
02:58:57,720 --> 02:59:03,000
but i don't know i've never like eat just eaten one and i kind of think that it's like not great

2487
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:09,320
to just eat but like the flavor of it like put into other things is my favorite um

2488
02:59:09,960 --> 02:59:16,440
is rhubarb a fruit definitely not definitely not it's a rhubarb fleshy it's a stem

2489
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:27,640
it's a stem of of what of the rhubarb plant oh it's yeah it's very sweet i like rhubarb crumble so

2490
02:59:27,640 --> 02:59:32,680
oh sure that's where my mind went sure but i mean it's it's sweet because they add sugar to it but

2491
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:39,720
like the actual no the i mean i guess you've never just tried raw rhubarb but it's yeah i

2492
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:46,040
guess not but it's literally just the stem of of a plant and it's just like sour oh well i like

2493
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:52,120
the sour part sure it's good i like it too you know when you add something sweet to it it makes a

2494
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:58,840
nice a nice blend of flavor uh kind of like how lemons are really sour but it's really nice if to

2495
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:04,520
make lemonade out of when you add sugar to it um i guess i like sour but it's but it's definitely

2496
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:11,400
not a fruit because a fruit is like it contains the seeds uh and a stem is not stem is not a fruit

2497
03:00:12,760 --> 03:00:18,040
i don't think the rhubarb plant doesn't even have fruits or maybe it does maybe it has like

2498
03:00:18,680 --> 03:00:22,440
flower little flowers that make little seeds at some point just we don't eat them

2499
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:29,800
i like lemon flavor i'm trying to think of my favorite fruit to just eat is and i honestly

2500
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:36,280
oh grapefruits oh no definitely grapefruits i love grapefruits i should try grapefruit

2501
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:41,000
well you you never tried one no i just never got around to it i was just like my video games

2502
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:46,040
that's gonna be like a long list of fruits i haven't gotten around to yet you know you know that would

2503
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:51,800
that would disturb me greatly except that i have met other people who have just like never had

2504
03:00:51,800 --> 03:01:02,200
grapefruit and like i guess it's some people just don't i can't i like them a lot they're my favorite

2505
03:01:02,200 --> 03:01:08,360
uh they're juicy uh uh sometimes they're bad okay sometimes they're bad sometimes they can be a

2506
03:01:08,360 --> 03:01:12,760
little dry if you get a bad one that's like dry that sucks but if you get a nice juicy one

2507
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:18,920
uh it's perfect oh it's perfect some people put sugar on theirs i don't understand it i don't think

2508
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:25,720
they need additional sugar did i tell you did i mention what happened that guy who has like moved

2509
03:01:25,720 --> 03:01:32,040
in to my house uh who cooks in the kitchen and i made fun of them when i called him a famine

2510
03:01:34,200 --> 03:01:38,760
i remember you talking about that last week there there was i listened to that part yeah

2511
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:44,040
well there was a funny story uh that guy like i guess he was eating Cheerios and he was trying

2512
03:01:44,040 --> 03:01:49,160
to put sugar on his Cheerios deranged thing to do in my opinion but i know that but i know that some

2513
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:56,840
people do it um but apparently he he saw my like gummy ingredients on the on the shelf and he thought

2514
03:01:56,840 --> 03:02:03,320
he was putting sugar on his Cheerios but he had actually uh picked up my citric acid and he and

2515
03:02:03,320 --> 03:02:11,400
he sprinkled pure citric acid onto his Cheerios and ate them uh and i sour Cheerios yeah i imagine it

2516
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:20,120
was not what he hoped it would be uh that sucks as well because sour milk is spoiled oh that must

2517
03:02:20,120 --> 03:02:23,800
have been sour that must have been discussed oh yeah it must have curdled the milk probably

2518
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:29,000
maybe well it would it would make you think it's sour like spoiled yeah because of the sourness

2519
03:02:30,040 --> 03:02:36,920
must must have been gross um what was shit what was they even what was they talking about um

2520
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:42,280
sugar oh favorite fruit yeah that's my answer passion fruit or grapefruit grapefruit is

2521
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:49,000
whatever i answered already okay i like uh blueberries as well those i've been putting

2522
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:58,360
blueberries in my um in my my oats my overnight oats uh and they're okay i kind of have the same

2523
03:02:58,360 --> 03:03:03,480
problem as raspberries i sort of don't like i wouldn't just like eat them i wouldn't just like eat them

2524
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:12,120
straight yeah yeah um i don't think i eat any fruit straight because i'm gay a great

2525
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:23,160
a grapefruit i'll just eat raw okay people the like normal way to eat a grapefruit is you cut it

2526
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:28,840
in half and then you scoop out the sections with a spoon and that's fine and whatever i just like

2527
03:03:28,840 --> 03:03:34,680
tear it open and like pull the sections apart with my hands and just eat them like that like an orange

2528
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:41,800
what's one of the sections yes yes except they have a okay an orange you you sort of the sections

2529
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:47,160
sort of come apart because they have that like membrane in between you know what i mean yeah

2530
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:53,800
and you eat it you eat it with the membrane a grapefruit has like the membrane is like thicker

2531
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:59,880
but also it sort of separates more easily so you actually kind of i like pull open the membrane

2532
03:03:59,880 --> 03:04:05,480
and like ins and then i kind of scoop the like the pulp out as like a as like a section i pull your

2533
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:10,200
hand i pull it out of the memory i mean yeah it comes apart if you if you pull it apart um

2534
03:04:11,880 --> 03:04:17,160
yeah i pull i pull this i pull the fruit out of the membrane and i eat that and then i just kind of

2535
03:04:17,960 --> 03:04:27,160
tear it apart into pieces and it's great and it's delicious uh the next voicemail is called Gibb's name

2536
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:36,760
three two one go hey Gibb uh feel free to refuse an answer of course but what the what's your family

2537
03:04:36,760 --> 03:04:44,920
call you what's your at-home name uh they call me my birth name still because i haven't changed it

2538
03:04:44,920 --> 03:04:50,360
but i ain't i ain't telling you that i ain't giving that out for free i mean i know what it is

2539
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:55,320
yeah so i mean it's been out there okay um

2540
03:04:57,480 --> 03:05:04,200
all right uh that's what that's what i thought um yeah i have been dabbling i have been dabbling

2541
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:11,640
though with like with using Amy as a name hmm i don't know whether i truly want to commit to

2542
03:05:11,640 --> 03:05:16,600
using that so i've been using it as like when i play a video game and it says what's your name i put

2543
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:26,840
that in hmm well i mean at the moment that's my video game name okay uh i mean um yeah i mean i

2544
03:05:27,800 --> 03:05:35,080
i just call you gibb anyway so like uh yeah on the internet yeah gibb is fine and dandy yeah

2545
03:05:35,960 --> 03:05:43,640
all righty uh next one is called moo three two one go do you think it's theoretically possible

2546
03:05:43,640 --> 03:05:51,560
for an ai to perfectly imitate a human yeah sure whatever yeah i mean give it enough time i mean

2547
03:05:51,560 --> 03:05:58,360
you can have an ai create an image that does look like it was drawn by a human like it like you can

2548
03:05:58,360 --> 03:06:04,120
do it it does it can't do it all the time oh they didn't say drawing an image they just said

2549
03:06:04,120 --> 03:06:11,960
completely replicate a human like oh just like just the way humans do things it's called there's a

2550
03:06:11,960 --> 03:06:17,240
video game you should play it's called mega man x that asks this very same question um

2551
03:06:19,960 --> 03:06:27,000
because the artificial intelligence really that's smart i mean theoretically yeah because like

2552
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:34,760
i mean if a human brain exists therefore it would be theoretically possible to construct

2553
03:06:35,640 --> 03:06:43,400
one that would do the same thing right yeah the only way you could hypothetically get there is not

2554
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:49,480
by micromanaging everything about the brain but it's creating a machine that can learn which is

2555
03:06:49,560 --> 03:06:57,640
what ai generally is and so yeah given enough time yeah i think it might make sentient robot people

2556
03:06:57,640 --> 03:07:05,880
it might not be possible to do with like computer hardware as it exists like like it might not be

2557
03:07:05,880 --> 03:07:12,440
possible to do with like transistors the way that like a computer is is constructed um like you would

2558
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:18,600
need to like like some sort of nanotechnology needs to be invented yeah you would it might be that like

2559
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:25,320
just the the the technological substrate that a computer is built of just like can't uh like

2560
03:07:25,320 --> 03:07:31,880
functionally replicate like what a human brain does at like the microscopic level so yeah that

2561
03:07:31,880 --> 03:07:41,320
it might need to be a different method uh or or like silicon based yeah or like quantum computer

2562
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:48,360
run with like a superconducting material or something like that or rubber bands inside

2563
03:07:48,360 --> 03:07:53,720
so i would say theoretically yes but that doesn't really mean much in terms of like

2564
03:07:54,520 --> 03:08:06,760
will will we do it um next one is called happy new year three two one go hey i'm the man who had

2565
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:13,160
gay sex i told you guys about it and uh i had no gay sex and it only gets better that's crazy

2566
03:08:13,160 --> 03:08:21,240
dude i love you guys and i love everyone and i hope you guys have a great 2020 being this

2567
03:08:21,240 --> 03:08:28,680
distinct and give it it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes yeah i couldn't make out some of that

2568
03:08:29,560 --> 03:08:37,400
no they're having a good time that's good that's nice okay yeah true uh next one is called ben's

2569
03:08:37,400 --> 03:08:46,760
periodic reminder to look in the mirror and call himself at a handsome devil calm uh okay uh have

2570
03:08:46,760 --> 03:08:53,080
you ever done that nope ah you got to get on that that's part of your list of things yeah all right

2571
03:08:53,080 --> 03:09:03,000
i'll put it on my put it on my whiteboard uh next one is an image it's an image it's peter parker

2572
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:12,200
uh people who defend human art with an ai ai art people who enjoy speed runs people who

2573
03:09:12,200 --> 03:09:18,920
enjoy tasks for some reason the first two constantly fight each other well well a task

2574
03:09:18,920 --> 03:09:25,640
is made by a human i don't i don't really see the connection between these two things the first

2575
03:09:25,640 --> 03:09:30,360
two constantly fight yeah they're not really equitable a task is still like an impressive

2576
03:09:30,360 --> 03:09:37,960
feat for someone to to derive i mean uh like a strategy for how to do it and then seeing it

2577
03:09:37,960 --> 03:09:44,280
play out it's just like pressing play on like a video like it it it's not like um like if you

2578
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:51,320
record your drawing and then you play back the recording that's not ai yeah a speed draw like a

2579
03:09:51,320 --> 03:09:58,280
human when you see a program running do you think oh a human didn't make this program like a computer

2580
03:09:58,280 --> 03:10:03,640
is running it a human a human didn't write it because a computer is running it like that's

2581
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:10,280
what a task is a human wrote the instructions the computer is just executing them so this is a stupid

2582
03:10:10,280 --> 03:10:20,760
stupid example um next one is okay well there's a an image and a minute 30 long voicemail so let's

2583
03:10:20,760 --> 03:10:27,480
look at the image first does mid journeys license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by

2584
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:33,560
the platform yes but if you're working for a bigger company than a million dollars in annual

2585
03:10:33,560 --> 03:10:38,680
revenue we ask that you buy a corporate license did you see consent from living artists or work

2586
03:10:38,680 --> 03:10:43,000
still under copyright no there isn't really a way to get 100 million images and know where

2587
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:46,280
they're coming from it would be cool if images of metadata embedding them a copyright owner

2588
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:49,320
something but that's not a thing there's not a registry there's no way to find a picture on the

2589
03:10:49,320 --> 03:10:54,600
internet then automatically trace it to an owner and then have anyway okay so this is just mid-journey

2590
03:10:54,600 --> 03:11:01,160
admitting that like no we don't have any method in place to prevent the use of

2591
03:11:02,200 --> 03:11:07,800
like someone else's intellectual property in order to generate the images we make cool

2592
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:14,200
at least they're honest about it this this this pretty much renders anything that it makes like

2593
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:23,400
suspect okay okay what's the audio then yeah uh three two one go

2594
03:11:24,520 --> 03:11:32,600
hey uh just checking in once more about the like AI art uh debate thing uh just because

2595
03:11:32,600 --> 03:11:41,960
ben mentioned something like he um assumed quite reasonably honestly that creators of art making

2596
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:50,280
quote unquote AI would always insist basically that their models were ethically sourced

2597
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:55,720
I did not I did not I did not assume that they would insist on that are like in the in public

2598
03:11:55,720 --> 03:12:03,400
domain or like whatever right like that are fair to use even for monetary gain or something

2599
03:12:03,960 --> 03:12:09,160
I would insist on that but in fact for commercial purposes and I'll link the tweet but there is an

2600
03:12:09,160 --> 03:12:16,360
actual interview with David Holtz the creator of mid-journey or the founder who just says like

2601
03:12:16,360 --> 03:12:23,080
well we know we literally don't know like yeah where we're getting our fucking images from he

2602
03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:28,280
just says like no there is really not a way to get a hundred million images and know where they're

2603
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:35,560
coming from so like he's he's literally admitting to theft practically speaking like and the funniest

2604
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:43,720
these same model makers too they have a very different approach to like AI for making music

2605
03:12:43,720 --> 03:12:49,240
because the laws are more stringent and more like actively pursued so they're afraid of

2606
03:12:49,240 --> 03:12:56,520
getting sued for that one but not for art because artists are like weaker yeah yeah

2607
03:12:56,840 --> 03:13:05,960
yeah all right what if you put like like you couldn't easily get like stock photos without

2608
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:13,480
paying for a license to remove the thing um and stock photo companies they make a lot of that

2609
03:13:13,480 --> 03:13:19,480
and they're very they're sensible about protecting it as much as they can they probably don't put

2610
03:13:19,480 --> 03:13:23,800
that in the mid-journey thing they just go for whatever is as easiest to get so just things

2611
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:31,080
are online i mean yeah i have apps i have no idea what like what method mid-journey uses to like

2612
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:38,360
accumulate it's it's a image library it could be as simple as google image search that's that's

2613
03:13:38,360 --> 03:13:45,880
like my naive assumption is that like do you just google image search and it puts stuff together uh

2614
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:57,080
maybe i just i just don't know but like yeah i definitely did not assume that AI generators

2615
03:13:57,720 --> 03:14:03,480
creators or people that use it would insist on that i that's what i said that would be my criteria

2616
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:10,120
for like is this is this good actually at least like in terms of like commercial use

2617
03:14:10,840 --> 03:14:16,440
like with like without that assurance it's it's like it's a it's a hard no and like okay i just

2618
03:14:16,440 --> 03:14:20,040
yeah we definitely don't have that assurance maybe i don't know maybe there are other ones that do

2619
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:29,160
a more um a more ethical job of it uh just to be clear though like for non-commercial purposes

2620
03:14:29,160 --> 03:14:34,600
i kind of think anything's fair game like fuck it steal other people's art and mash them up

2621
03:14:35,560 --> 03:14:38,760
if you're if like as long as you're not like selling it like who cares

2622
03:14:39,640 --> 03:14:48,920
yep um okay next one is just one more at gmail.law so a picture of a guy

2623
03:14:49,880 --> 03:14:53,320
let's see let's see this guy just looks like a guy

2624
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:58,120
there he is okay i'll play the voicemail three two one go

2625
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:07,400
no also i'm sorry but like i just looked at um the Forbes article that this excerpt comes from

2626
03:15:08,120 --> 03:15:18,200
and it has a picture in it of what mr. Holtz looks like and i gotta say i was expecting a

2627
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:24,840
little bit more of a brad garling house looking type but instead first of all he looks like a

2628
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:32,360
fucking hobbit he looks he looks like he's about to go oh oh mr. Frodo

2629
03:15:33,960 --> 03:15:39,000
mr. Frodo i have a beautiful new image it looks very creepy

2630
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:49,080
it looks it looks very odd a machine created it oh my god and also am i crazy does this his

2631
03:15:49,160 --> 03:15:55,240
fucking face look ai generated it's fucking weird i mean i know we're like Mark Zuckerberg

2632
03:15:55,240 --> 03:16:01,960
unreal like artificial human vibes jesus christ i think he looks what a fucking goon i think he

2633
03:16:01,960 --> 03:16:07,400
looks pretty normal i think he looks pretty normal i i assumed when you posted the image that this was

2634
03:16:07,400 --> 03:16:14,760
like an ai generated face or something and i was looking for things and i think his his right eye or

2635
03:16:14,760 --> 03:16:20,440
his left eye that's looking a little sus but then it's a photo of a person so i don't think it

2636
03:16:21,800 --> 03:16:25,880
i think people are just asymmetrical sometimes yeah i think it's just a shadow or something

2637
03:16:26,760 --> 03:16:32,680
no you know i found that i'm asymmetrical in a way that i wasn't real i didn't realize before

2638
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:37,720
it fucked me up i looked in the mirror i was like wait what's wrong with my face what's wrong

2639
03:16:37,720 --> 03:16:46,360
with my eyes i look like this oh my god i'm i'm definitely a little asymmetrical in like a little

2640
03:16:46,360 --> 03:16:54,280
bit in like my jaw in my my ear my my like hairline uh it's like a little bit yeah i'm

2641
03:16:54,280 --> 03:16:58,680
i'm asymmetrical in a bunch of different my my glasses actually kind of rest like a little

2642
03:16:58,680 --> 03:17:05,240
bit crooked because like my ears are a little asymmetrical i'm fucked up i'm fucked up that

2643
03:17:05,240 --> 03:17:11,720
also you know what else is fucking me up is uh still discord is not is not showing me like a

2644
03:17:11,720 --> 03:17:19,960
properly timed green circle it like still is not capable of of like just displaying when the sound

2645
03:17:19,960 --> 03:17:25,480
is being produced like it's it's been it's been like three hours now what the what and i'm and

2646
03:17:25,480 --> 03:17:31,880
i'm getting angry about it all over again just don't worry about it right now discord after this

2647
03:17:32,200 --> 03:17:41,240
okay next next one is uh okay it's another one wait did i just download that one we just listened

2648
03:17:41,240 --> 03:17:47,080
to no but i will okay the next one is unrelated from prince isolation okay three two one go

2649
03:17:49,320 --> 03:17:57,560
completely unrelated um i just wanted to clear up one small thing about um tom the tin can man

2650
03:17:57,960 --> 03:18:05,960
uh i don't know if i brought it across completely accurately in the voicemail that i was talking

2651
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:13,080
about him but i just want to make clear that i like him in fact i love him and i want him to keep

2652
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:20,840
calling into the pcp just to make sure tom mr tin can man whatever your name is i love you

2653
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:29,080
and genuinely keep calling into the pcp we got great in fact get a tinnier microphone please

2654
03:18:29,080 --> 03:18:36,440
get him get a tinnier one the smoke more weed before you call in well please already okay

2655
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:41,080
we already had him ask us so what our favorite fruit is so you know wish granted

2656
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:47,000
uh next one is called by definition three two one go

2657
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:57,000
uh there he is so the man himself older movies classics that i needed to watch and

2658
03:18:58,520 --> 03:19:07,400
basically is jesse literally bitter juice no jesse literally bitter juice what are you what

2659
03:19:07,400 --> 03:19:12,200
am i supposed to say that the answer is no okay if you say his name jesse jesse jesse

2660
03:19:13,160 --> 03:19:19,880
uh something happens something something happens okay next one is from mage of light

2661
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:25,960
regard okay it's in two parts regarding ai art part one okay three two one go

2662
03:19:27,320 --> 03:19:34,440
so regarding the ai art thing i think it's i i said this on the bank court

2663
03:19:34,600 --> 03:19:43,560
or like a lot of time ago i think it's interesting to like you said to see what what it can do like

2664
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:52,200
the machine learning i think it's the name of it yeah like to put words and see what it speeds out

2665
03:19:52,200 --> 03:20:00,040
like how does it think how does it connect concepts or shit like that i think that's

2666
03:20:00,040 --> 03:20:07,400
that's funny that's interesting but also like the problem with with it is that i have yet to see

2667
03:20:07,400 --> 03:20:19,880
a single ai art app that is not monetizing some way like they always heard like buy premium and

2668
03:20:19,880 --> 03:20:24,600
do more things or shit like that and it's like that is the fucking problem if it was just free

2669
03:20:24,600 --> 03:20:28,840
for everyone it would be like okay you know what do whatever the fuck you want you can already do it

2670
03:20:29,720 --> 03:20:35,240
it would take you a lot of time you know image editing and all that but whatever you know it's

2671
03:20:35,240 --> 03:20:44,200
the internet you know that it's like that but the problem is that it is just why why do they have to

2672
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:51,720
charge for it it's the problem that's the that's the main problem to me like that shouldn't be like

2673
03:20:51,720 --> 03:20:54,440
yeah like that

2674
03:20:55,960 --> 03:21:01,800
i mean it's a guy with headphones who looks like a hobbit who's like oh what if i do this then i

2675
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:16,200
can make money i mean i can i can pay for my my um uh what do i have apartment uh the fact the fact

2676
03:21:16,280 --> 03:21:25,720
that um the fact that he the guys made a program and he's charging for use of the program is not

2677
03:21:25,720 --> 03:21:33,880
really like the problematic part of it because like that's normal when you i mean i don't like if

2678
03:21:33,880 --> 03:21:37,800
it's like subscription based but like that's a separate problem if he had the program and he had

2679
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:43,960
a website and you could go to the website and generate something for free but maybe he gets

2680
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:52,920
paid through traffic like is that better i mean yeah i mean yeah yeah it's better it's better

2681
03:21:56,200 --> 03:22:02,280
but i don't i don't begrudge someone for monetizing their work

2682
03:22:03,720 --> 03:22:10,120
quote unquote there well well yeah i mean they made the program i know i know but that's the whole

2683
03:22:10,120 --> 03:22:17,400
problem is that the the the resource is mining is the problem with the work is that what it produces

2684
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:23,880
is a a theft machine uh he built this machine and that's cool but like what the machine does

2685
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:32,920
it's what the machine does that is like the the the ai problem not that like he's selling the machine

2686
03:22:33,560 --> 03:22:39,240
you know yeah i guess i guess if if it was free if it was a free thing that you could

2687
03:22:39,320 --> 03:22:44,440
generate an image based off of stolen work you could still then use that image to make your own

2688
03:22:44,440 --> 03:22:53,640
money so it would not solve the problem of art being taken without consent yeah it's it's i yeah i

2689
03:22:53,640 --> 03:23:00,760
think it you you said it you said it um there was um well okay let's listen to part two because

2690
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:07,480
there's two parts of this one uh three two one go also if you think that you can just input something

2691
03:23:07,480 --> 03:23:15,160
into an a art machine and then that is you doing something other than just stealing shit i want

2692
03:23:15,160 --> 03:23:20,520
you to know that you are worse than fucking mary weather who actually pays people for the work

2693
03:23:21,640 --> 03:23:29,320
or even fucking more logic the wonderbread guy you're worse than them okay okay uh there's um

2694
03:23:29,320 --> 03:23:34,360
all right there was a thread going around on twitter the other day of it showed these like

2695
03:23:35,320 --> 03:23:43,080
shoes that were uh they were these like baroque sort of like like like oh yeah i saw those they

2696
03:23:43,080 --> 03:23:50,280
look so cool they looked really cool i'm trying to find them i can't find the they're in my likes

2697
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:57,080
yeah if you could find those for me i would appreciate it because i'm i'm coming up blank

2698
03:23:57,080 --> 03:24:04,200
on a search um and yeah someone pointed out that they were they were ai generated they are they were

2699
03:24:04,200 --> 03:24:10,600
nice looking designs there they are there they are nike ex balman rikoko i mean beautiful who's

2700
03:24:10,600 --> 03:24:17,320
balmain i have no idea is that the name of the guy who's saying i invented this by typing it into the

2701
03:24:17,320 --> 03:24:24,520
ai generator is it like some other thing because i assumed i assumed it was like oh a fancy designer

2702
03:24:24,520 --> 03:24:29,800
had a collaboration with nike products to make yeah a series of like extremely expensive

2703
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:39,400
designer shoes that are you know fashionable like that time xbox made a gucci like combo thing

2704
03:24:39,400 --> 03:24:47,240
there was like gucci and xbox made a gucci xbox controller or something with a weird like lavish

2705
03:24:47,240 --> 03:24:56,520
like controller case it's like that sort of thing these are pretty gorgeous shoes i just um

2706
03:24:58,040 --> 03:25:04,360
i think you know i think a human could have come up with this i i guess it's nice that

2707
03:25:04,360 --> 03:25:09,960
like the computer did such a good job you know putting the pieces together to design these

2708
03:25:09,960 --> 03:25:15,800
shoes like i guess that's something that it did pretty well but i think a human could have come

2709
03:25:15,800 --> 03:25:22,280
up with these ideas i guess maybe it's saved on like design work but like i mean the fact that

2710
03:25:22,280 --> 03:25:30,120
somebody a human came up with the prompts implies that you could come up with this right right yeah

2711
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:36,200
true and and also just like you know these images are fine but they're just images like if someone

2712
03:25:36,200 --> 03:25:42,360
if someone wanted to make these shoes like you would still have to make them uh like i said i

2713
03:25:42,360 --> 03:25:50,760
don't i don't have any problem with someone using an ai to mash images together and in the and maybe

2714
03:25:50,760 --> 03:25:55,480
if it comes up with something if it puts things together that like looks cool like use that

2715
03:25:56,680 --> 03:26:01,800
like it's a it's a cool idea but you would you would then have to actually make these shoes

2716
03:26:02,520 --> 03:26:07,960
and like you know because these shoes don't exist and an an AI can't do that and i think that he i

2717
03:26:07,960 --> 03:26:14,360
think that a human could have uh could have conceptualized them i guess i guess it would

2718
03:26:14,360 --> 03:26:22,840
have been very work intensive to like produce images like this of a theoretical shoe with these

2719
03:26:22,840 --> 03:26:32,920
designs yeah i want i wonder how much like work had to go into like refining refining the prompts

2720
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:39,240
and stuff and training the ai in a particular way to get it to produce such uh such high quality

2721
03:26:40,520 --> 03:26:47,160
you know renders i want to buy them somebody should somebody should just take the designs

2722
03:26:47,160 --> 03:26:51,800
steal them from the ai because you know i don't want to buy them because i know these are going

2723
03:26:51,800 --> 03:26:57,800
to cost like nine hundred dollars yeah but then somebody should make them and then i should be

2724
03:26:57,800 --> 03:27:03,400
like ah cool i wish i could have that uh i can't i'm glad somebody else will buy those so that i

2725
03:27:03,400 --> 03:27:12,200
don't have to yeah the the the creation of such a thing the the world happiness gone up perhaps

2726
03:27:12,200 --> 03:27:19,320
what's the bike thing perhaps yeah the shen uh the total happiness in the world increase total

2727
03:27:19,320 --> 03:27:26,040
happiness the world increased but like not in a stupid way um i don't know why i brought these

2728
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:31,960
i think just mage of light mentioned like it's interesting to see like what the computer comes

2729
03:27:31,960 --> 03:27:38,520
up with and like yeah here's an example yeah i mean i wouldn't say that it's ai generation is

2730
03:27:39,240 --> 03:27:44,760
like inherently gross it's just the practice around it yeah yeah the the practice the practice

2731
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:49,560
are okay in in particular what's really irksome is when i see someone saying like i'm an artist

2732
03:27:49,560 --> 03:27:55,000
because i put the right prompts in like that that pisses me off no you're not the computer

2733
03:27:55,000 --> 03:28:01,960
the computer the program made this image you you merely stumbled upon maybe you had to iterate

2734
03:28:02,840 --> 03:28:08,200
but like i don't i don't care like that's not it's not art to like refine a series of image

2735
03:28:08,200 --> 03:28:16,120
searches to produce a result that you're happy with like i mean no matter what if you do a prompt in

2736
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:22,600
these things and you get a series of images and you don't like any of them you can use the exact

2737
03:28:22,600 --> 03:28:28,840
same prompt and do it again and get different images so it's not like the prompt is exactly

2738
03:28:28,840 --> 03:28:35,080
tied to whatever image ends up so it's like you have less creative control than you even you think

2739
03:28:35,080 --> 03:28:43,080
you do there's like there's a guy who made like a children's book uh oh the soulless man with no

2740
03:28:43,080 --> 03:28:51,000
soul i don't know maybe i think that well maybe i saw there was a guy who's just like ai generated

2741
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:55,960
an entire book and tried to sell it as his own work and he looked like the sort of person who

2742
03:28:55,960 --> 03:29:02,920
has never thought anything nice in his whole life i don't know if it's the same guy but there was a

2743
03:29:02,920 --> 03:29:08,760
guy who made an ai generated children's book and okay even though i think that was the book was

2744
03:29:08,760 --> 03:29:17,240
probably bad i do think that i do think that it is art in the sense that like the the images are

2745
03:29:17,240 --> 03:29:21,640
not like he is not an artist he did not produce the images the computer produced the images

2746
03:29:21,640 --> 03:29:27,560
but he did select them and curate them and put them together into a book and i do think that is

2747
03:29:28,440 --> 03:29:33,560
art i don't think it's necessarily good but i do think curation and like selecting and like

2748
03:29:33,560 --> 03:29:41,320
putting things together into a into a coherent work is art of a sort so i do think that like a

2749
03:29:41,480 --> 03:29:47,080
book made of images that were ai generated is art just like i think you know harry partridge

2750
03:29:47,080 --> 03:29:53,000
said that he used ai to like generate some backgrounds for an animation and like the

2751
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:58,200
animation that he made using those ai generated images is still art the the background itself

2752
03:29:58,760 --> 03:30:03,400
is not really because the computer made it well the only difference would be is that he

2753
03:30:03,400 --> 03:30:08,280
doesn't ai generate the entirety of the animation just an aspect of it with this children's book

2754
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:14,680
it's an entire like did he animate did he ai generate the story as well i don't disagree with

2755
03:30:14,680 --> 03:30:21,320
the curation i don't i don't know i think i yeah no i think ai might have been used in like in

2756
03:30:21,320 --> 03:30:29,400
writing i think i think he said that like yeah ai wrote the text as well it's it's kind of like

2757
03:30:29,400 --> 03:30:34,120
a collage if you if you take a bunch of artist work and you cut out bits that you like and stick

2758
03:30:34,120 --> 03:30:42,280
them together um you've made a collage uh using yeah other people's work yeah so it's creative in

2759
03:30:42,280 --> 03:30:52,120
that sense but like yes you didn't really the individual pieces no i i i i i i i i i i i i i

2760
03:30:52,120 --> 03:30:57,320
i'll put my foot down a hard line stance is that like if a computer if a computer generates the

2761
03:30:57,320 --> 03:31:03,640
image if you you are not the artist you you might do something with it you might curate it you might

2762
03:31:03,640 --> 03:31:07,960
arrange it you might edit it into something and then you could maybe say that you have some ownership

2763
03:31:07,960 --> 03:31:18,760
over that thing uh yeah um okay next one is a dream i had last night three two one go

2764
03:31:19,560 --> 03:31:27,560
hey ben saint and uh i assume there's other people on the podcast this week true i had a dream last

2765
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:33,960
and you were in it so i thought i would tell you so i was in the jungle right because i was on

2766
03:31:33,960 --> 03:31:39,480
vacation on this tropical island and i had already gotten a pretty good tan the other day but there

2767
03:31:39,480 --> 03:31:46,040
was a monkey in the house but that's not important we were in the jungle and um there was this big

2768
03:31:46,040 --> 03:31:52,120
snake and you spotted it slithering in the grass and it had like cat ears like it was like a cat

2769
03:31:52,200 --> 03:31:57,320
snake and you were like see the trick to this is and then you like went to try to grab it

2770
03:31:57,960 --> 03:32:04,200
and you grabbed it and then it like went around and bit you and um yeah it seems like something

2771
03:32:04,200 --> 03:32:13,960
you would do fucking idiot i'm sorry god yeah you see the the trick with these cat snakes is

2772
03:32:13,960 --> 03:32:17,320
ah stabbed yeah i can see it

2773
03:32:20,280 --> 03:32:28,200
i like the idea of a cat ear snake it's like i can't even even like mistakes that i didn't

2774
03:32:28,760 --> 03:32:34,280
even actually make it's like nah ben would do that so let's hold him let's hold him accountable

2775
03:32:35,880 --> 03:32:43,560
man there's just no winning yeah the trick to this cat snake i think i would avoid such a creature

2776
03:32:43,960 --> 03:32:48,200
it wasn't true but the fact that i thought it could be says a lot about society there's a lot

2777
03:32:48,200 --> 03:32:52,040
about society there's a lot about the podcast there's a lot about the state of the podcast

2778
03:32:53,240 --> 03:33:01,960
uh next one is an image let's see what do we got it's a cartoon honey could you get the meat out

2779
03:33:01,960 --> 03:33:08,920
of the fridge while i'm chopping these potatoes sure thing dear hmm but who is the cuck and who is the

2780
03:33:09,880 --> 03:33:21,400
in this scenario yeah yeah it it did seem a little funny i like the idea of a cooking person

2781
03:33:21,400 --> 03:33:25,400
that i'm watching two people cooking and i'm thinking like one of these people is getting

2782
03:33:25,400 --> 03:33:31,480
played like one of these people one of these people is the winner and one of these people is the loser

2783
03:33:32,120 --> 03:33:41,240
the scenario cooking is nice i like the smell maybe feels good sometimes to get some good food made

2784
03:33:41,240 --> 03:33:47,560
i'm not i'm not gonna disagree i i think it it's true that it says more about me than it says about

2785
03:33:47,560 --> 03:33:53,240
anything else that i saw a couple like cooking and i thought and my assumption is like this guy is

2786
03:33:53,240 --> 03:34:00,040
just doing this to impress that girl this guy is just doing this to like yeah as like a a move

2787
03:34:01,560 --> 03:34:10,520
okay uh i mean even if that was the the reason like ultimately it's like what's the problem

2788
03:34:10,520 --> 03:34:16,600
i i guess i well i'm gonna learn how to cook in order to make myself okay or more attractive

2789
03:34:16,600 --> 03:34:21,640
when i would shake my head and i would say no i should be unattractive yeah he yeah he made yeah

2790
03:34:21,640 --> 03:34:27,880
he made a delicious meal but like did it did it cost him his soul did it cost him his soul

2791
03:34:27,880 --> 03:34:41,480
no no um lamal all right next one i like this i like this one this one's really funny um i should

2792
03:34:41,480 --> 03:34:48,680
honestly i should tweet this this is about me i feel like this represents me honestly the next

2793
03:34:48,680 --> 03:34:56,040
one is called five skin head three two one go ben you should absolutely give a shit about your

2794
03:34:56,040 --> 03:35:03,720
foreskin this thing is super important let me tell you as a kid i was the only peeled person

2795
03:35:03,720 --> 03:35:10,280
in my whole family and whenever we would like pee i'd look over what and see that their penises

2796
03:35:10,280 --> 03:35:14,680
look different than mine why i feel left out why would you all pee together my mind looks so weird

2797
03:35:14,680 --> 03:35:20,200
compared to them you know yeah i mean we feel bad definitely but also that's rough having this

2798
03:35:20,200 --> 03:35:26,040
foreskin is just better for sexual acts from like masturbation how would you know to insertion

2799
03:35:26,840 --> 03:35:33,720
and everything in between like there's no benefit to circumcision aside from the fact

2800
03:35:34,360 --> 03:35:42,120
that it's marginally easier to paint to clean your penis but you know that's such a minor benefit

2801
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:48,360
compared to everything else how do you know and also it is maybe there seems to be possible

2802
03:35:48,360 --> 03:35:54,280
to regrow your foreskin oh my god you just have to like train it with tools or whatever what the

2803
03:35:54,280 --> 03:36:01,000

2811
03:36:50,200 --> 03:36:58,520
joking i mean i don't know maybe he feels very sad about not having a foreskin but he can't

2812
03:36:58,520 --> 03:37:04,280
actually think maybe he's hoping that you can regrow your foreskin by training it with tools

2813
03:37:04,280 --> 03:37:14,680
right like that's a completely deranged thing to say what kind of tools okay so like a vice

2814

2819
03:37:52,760 --> 03:37:57,960

2821
03:38:03,400 --> 03:38:11,640
to the right and the p is straight but like really like the bottom of the t should be stretched out

2822
03:38:12,440 --> 03:38:20,760
as like to follow the bottom curve of the oval you know yep okay no i was sorry i was yawning

03:40:41,080 --> 03:40:45,560
he would find like a completely random image and he would just post it and be like this is just like

2843
03:40:45,560 --> 03:40:51,480
when ben does x or this is when ben does y and it would be like just some random shit and i was

2844
03:40:51,480 --> 03:40:57,000
viny what are you talking about why do you pose this picture of like a cat and it's like ha ha

2845
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:03,960
this is just like when ben sees a girl and is in and embarrasses himself so yeah okay i think

2846
03:41:03,960 --> 03:41:11,000
that's what he's talking about um i really like this meteor yeah i like the teeth they're very like

03:41:11,080 --> 03:41:21,800
yeah these are cool i feel like i feel like viny uh this i'm this is the this is like

yeah the the bright teeth on the black meteor that looks awesome genuinely looks really cool

2851
03:41:41,720 --> 03:41:48,280
so it's like a cycle natural ben saint to cop killer to murder meteor oh the little arrows natural

2852
03:41:48,280 --> 03:41:59,560
ben saint oh i see i see this is your evolution this is your pokemon evolution yeah the apotheosis

of dark ben becomes murder meteor cop killington okay i'm just i'm just looking i'm just i'm just

2854
03:42:08,440 --> 03:42:14,280
admiring my teeth that is what my teeth look like i gotta go to the dentist the bright green and

2855
03:42:14,280 --> 03:42:25,960
glowing bright green and glowing um one of these days one of these days uh maybe after i finish the

2856
03:42:25,960 --> 03:42:30,600
book i gotta finish the book so i can maybe that's why i haven't finished the book because i know that

2857
03:42:30,600 --> 03:42:37,480
after i finish the book i gotta go to the dentist you can do with a dentist at any time wrong you

2858
03:42:37,480 --> 03:42:45,800
can say to the dentist please make a appointment and they say okay uh you would think so you would

2859
03:42:45,800 --> 03:42:50,920
think so but uh it's just not it's just not how it works unfortunately it's more complicated

2860
03:42:51,480 --> 03:42:56,440
they want to see the book first you wouldn't understand yeah they said don't they said

2861
03:42:56,440 --> 03:43:01,800
ben saint why are you don't even show your face around don't call that book don't call us again

2862
03:43:01,800 --> 03:43:06,440
until until the book is out you're not allowed to have teeth

2863
03:43:09,960 --> 03:43:15,720
what a thing to say to someone you're not allowed to have teeth you will not we will not serve you

2864
03:43:16,440 --> 03:43:23,880
you do not deserve this form of medical care uh oh that's the last voicemail

2865
03:43:23,880 --> 03:43:28,200
um we did it yeah yeah

2866
03:43:30,200 --> 03:43:31,880
hooray um

2867
03:43:36,440 --> 03:43:41,080
well that's the end that is the end um any final do you have any final

2868
03:43:42,520 --> 03:43:50,360
shit to say uh well ben's gonna be streaming we're gonna be streaming at some some time this week

2869
03:43:50,360 --> 03:43:54,840
i will do well by the time this episode is out i will have already done at least one stream

2870
03:43:54,840 --> 03:44:00,440
to i might also yeah i might also do a few streams i've been thinking about it i just

2871
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:06,920
like art stress i don't know about art streams maybe art streams that's the thing i can't decide

2872
03:44:06,920 --> 03:44:15,160
whether i want to play video games or draw because like drawing would be would be saving on like a

2873
03:44:15,160 --> 03:44:21,000
time i could be doing two things at once but i don't know kind of true kind of true

2874
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:28,920
uh i mean since yeah i'm gonna do gaming because my plan is to play those games on

2875
03:44:28,920 --> 03:44:36,200
just kind of the whole point so yeah i don't know i never really i always found drawing on stream

2876
03:44:36,200 --> 03:44:42,680
very distracting i always found chat like really distracting from like me trying to actually do

2877
03:44:42,680 --> 03:44:52,360
the work you know yeah i guess my streams were quite quiet because i stood them at like weird

2878
03:44:52,360 --> 03:44:58,520
hours and for a long time so people would jump in and then leave yeah when i did those well i mean

2879
03:44:58,520 --> 03:45:04,120
it's like if the if there's if the chat is not active then it's like why am i even streaming this

2880
03:45:04,120 --> 03:45:09,560
but if the chat is active then it's like it's distracting me from drawing i guess i guess that

2881
03:45:10,040 --> 03:45:16,200
i i think i think i managed to do more work just because it's easier to work with an audience

2882
03:45:17,160 --> 03:45:22,440
it is it kind of like then it is like it like the distractions are outweighed by

2883
03:45:23,160 --> 03:45:28,120
the compulsion to not fuck around yeah it's like because people are people are watching you don't

2884
03:45:28,120 --> 03:45:37,080
want to like seem like you're just wasting time yeah yeah i i understand that oh you know what i

2885
03:45:37,160 --> 03:45:45,800
could do yeah my dark cloud video i could play dark cloud on stream oh i could use that footage

2886
03:45:45,800 --> 03:45:52,520
for the video that could be fun oh you mean the one oh i didn't realize you were actually working on

2887
03:45:52,520 --> 03:45:58,920
that well the prerequisite is that i need to play the games all the way through and then yeah

2888
03:45:59,720 --> 03:46:06,120
tabs on like various things because not everything is in the wiki and so i need to i need to delve

2889
03:46:06,120 --> 03:46:12,360
deep and find all the text boxes and stuff and if i have like i play a 100 play through of both of

2890
03:46:12,360 --> 03:46:17,720
them then i'll have all the footage i'll see everything i mean i don't know how it'll go

2891
03:46:17,720 --> 03:46:25,480
but like yeah when i eventually make the battle network lecture uh i might yeah i could definitely

2892
03:46:25,480 --> 03:46:32,840
see myself using some like clips of me streaming it if i have like any like reactions to any like

2893
03:46:32,840 --> 03:46:38,040
really bizarre stuff in there like i might use some footage from the streams to like highlight

2894
03:46:38,840 --> 03:46:46,040
some shit uh definitely that's the cool you know you gotta do you do you do work you spend your

2895
03:46:46,040 --> 03:46:50,680
time doing things that all feed into each other it all it's all part of the it's all part of the

2896
03:46:50,680 --> 03:46:59,960
workflow funnel you funnel it all into content you gotta make content yeah yeah oh i love content

2897
03:46:59,960 --> 03:47:06,120
i do love content i'm i'm such a little piggy i just want to roll around in my content slop

2898
03:47:08,120 --> 03:47:14,120
yeah true it's want to roll and i'm tired of pretending that i care about quality

2899
03:47:14,120 --> 03:47:21,400
i'm just want to eat my little content i always want to eat my my content from my content trough

2900
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:26,280
i just want to go up to that trough and just stick my face in there and just slurp up all the

2901
03:47:26,280 --> 03:47:34,280
content this just comes down the pipe oh i'm just i'm just a plant in a big crop circle

2902
03:47:35,000 --> 03:47:41,160
waiting for the big bar to rotate over me and drip some content on me so i can grow

2903
03:47:43,080 --> 03:47:46,280
uh yeah all the plants in the world they see water's content

2904
03:47:46,920 --> 03:47:56,920
consume to be yeah to you know if you're a plant imagine you're a plant well to you water would

2905
03:47:56,920 --> 03:48:02,360
be like a new red letter media video like you need it to live and if you don't get it you'll

2906
03:48:02,360 --> 03:48:12,040
wither and die um oh did you see this did you see uh the news reporting about the new key video

2907
03:48:12,040 --> 03:48:17,560
do you know they're they did the one where they finally watch new key yeah i saw a twitter video

2908
03:48:17,560 --> 03:48:23,320
of like somebody recording the news where it's like talking about the new key tape

2909
03:48:24,920 --> 03:48:32,440
and yeah it's it's got a lot of money oh yeah but okay but what i'm talking about is like there was

2910
03:48:32,440 --> 03:48:38,760
at least one news outlet that reported on it and they pretty much like chain they reported it like

2911
03:48:38,840 --> 03:48:42,600
like it was a scam like as though red letter media were like scamming people

2912
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:47,720
oh i didn't see that i saw like they said it was going to charity and it was all fine that's an

2913
03:48:47,720 --> 03:48:54,600
interesting story moving on the one i saw was like oh youtubers like destroy youtubers destroy

2914
03:48:54,600 --> 03:49:00,440
like copies of like a rare vhs tape in order to drive up the price of like their one copy

2915
03:49:01,000 --> 03:49:06,840
and it's like god like the video is literally like a parody of that it's literally like a like a

2916
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:15,160
commentary on that like people do that and it's bad and uh yeah fucking but they just reported on

2917
03:49:15,160 --> 03:49:22,520
it as though it were being done just like sincerely uh very frustrating i don't feel bad i don't feel

2918
03:49:22,520 --> 03:49:29,400
bad for red letter media because like they're fine but it is but it is annoying to see uh the facts

2919
03:49:29,480 --> 03:49:37,720
mis misrepresented in such a way you understand it's a soda yeah i mean it's this with regards to

2920
03:49:37,720 --> 03:49:44,920
red letter media especially there's no chance of that like false narrative sticking anywhere no

2921
03:49:46,920 --> 03:49:50,680
because some some old person who's like i've never heard of this new key before

2922
03:49:52,280 --> 03:49:55,880
i thought you were gonna say i've never heard of red letter media before but they probably

2923
03:49:56,200 --> 03:50:08,520
knew either yeah yeah yeah yeah um right it's like uh damn uh you know just uh i saw j j was

2924
03:50:08,520 --> 03:50:14,120
tweeting about that like this was the way that this particular outlet chose to report on it

2925
03:50:16,040 --> 03:50:22,120
it reminded me of reminded me of taylor lorenz reporting on the um the freaking chili neighbor

2926
03:50:22,200 --> 03:50:27,160
situation choosing to both sides the chili neighbor thing

2927
03:50:28,280 --> 03:50:37,560
oh no yeah yeah no not the chili thing yes the chili thing it will never go away

2928
03:50:37,560 --> 03:50:41,880
it will never leave the discourse it'll never leave my personal discourse it dealt me irreparable

2929
03:50:41,960 --> 03:50:56,040
psychic damage imagine both sides in somebody giving chili to someone else yeah hmm a person gave

2930
03:50:56,040 --> 03:51:01,800
their neighbor chili and some other people got really angry at them about it but like we need
