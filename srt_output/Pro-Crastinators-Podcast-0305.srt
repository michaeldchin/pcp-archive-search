1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, without further ado, hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, episode 305.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ben Saint, Gibbontake, and Oblivionfall is here.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome back, been a little while.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Uh, I get it, alright, everyone shut up, everyone shut up.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, thanks, I just gotta start with the announcement.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This week, Phantom's Revenge, Phantom's Revenge is out, by the time you're listening to this,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Slime and Punishment is done, Phantom's Revenge is out, link in the description to the comic and the game if you just want to play the game.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm hitting my head, stayed up all night last night.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The last three days, let me just tell you what I've been doing this last week.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finished drawing the ending, and I was like, it's done.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then I was like, okay, I just gotta end it.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And then I'm like, I don't know how to end it.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't know what do I want the actual last panel to be.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And I've just kind of been sort of like, sitting around and like staring at it and trying to think of like, the story's done.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Just like, what do I want to put right before I have a big thing that says the end?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And I've just been like, uh...

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You have Phantom Horn transports back in time and it's episode one of T-Bap.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You spoiled it, again.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, sorry, I'm just so media literate.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I couldn't help it.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've just been trying to decide on something because I don't want to do a thing, right?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The story's over. It's time to end it.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I've just been thinking like, what do I do that's not that hard?

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't want to go on a thing, but what would be appropriate?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What would wrap things up?

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was like, I don't know.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nothing fancy.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A thematic.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Doesn't have to be too fancy.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
An icon.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just like, there it is.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's like, oh, that's the Phantom Horn's favorite Beyblade.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Remember all those times?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Like laying on the ground, like a close-up of it.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Like laying on the table and you think about like, yeah, I remember the whole Beyblade

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
like subplot that he had around like chapter six or seven.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like, that was my favorite.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, I should just go back.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I should just make the ending panel just the end with like a picture of a Beyblade.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you don't listen to this episode of the podcast, you won't get it.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And you still won't get it, even if you do.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Anyway, I've settled on something that I think is like fine.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I'm just, I'm like mostly done with it.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And like, I'll probably finish it like tonight.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, so this week, it's over.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The nightmare is over.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's it.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And maybe next week, maybe next week, we can talk about it since it will have been out

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and hopefully maybe you'll have played it or something.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will definitely stream it when it comes out.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hell yeah.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh, that'll be fun.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, that'll be really fun.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I'll be like, what do I do?

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And people will be in chat, like patrons of yours, they'll be like, I know.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I really want to, let me know when you're doing that because I would like to observe some of it.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think that would be really funny.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Probably like, probably only like a dozen or so people have played it so far.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Maybe a dozen in my Patreon Discord server that's had access to it.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I actually made some, I might have mentioned this, I made some minor changes to the final version.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The final version has the damage numbers like have like a visual shake effect on them when like,

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
when you do lots of damage, the number gets really big and it like jostles around.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And like, that's it.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But other than that, it's the same game.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Looks pretty cool.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, man.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So it's literally done and like, there couldn't be like a complication that would mean that this is incorrect what you're saying right now.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I would have to fail to draw like one small image for like an entire week.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And like, I don't think I'm going to fail to do that.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's still not literally technically complete.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, well.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What if it's too hard to say goodbye and you don't want to finish it?

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's how I feel.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That is how I feel.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But I'm going to do it anyway.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's actually going to, I was thinking about the index that I want to put in the book, like the end of the book.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think I mentioned this before.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to have like a, an infinite jest style like index section with like footnotes so that like every time there's a reference in the in the comic.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have a little footnote and then you can, if you want, you can flip back to the index section and read and it'll I'll be like, oh yeah, this character is this guy or like the reason this shot looks like this is because it's a parody of this or whatever.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I'm just thinking about that.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And like, that's going to be huge.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's actually going to be like really extensive.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I could see that being like maybe a quarter of the whole book will just be like notes about like, why is it like this?

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The more I think about it, the more I realize that being like hard to understand and inscrutable and perplexing is sort of the whole mission statement of it.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And so it's like fine.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's not, it's not a, it's not a problem.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's not a flaw.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's, it's the, it's the work functioning as intended.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you don't understand it, but if, but if you want the, the joy of discovery to understand it, the index in the book will hopefully be a fun read for people.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm looking, I'm looking forward.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm really looking forward to putting that together.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's going to be fun.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's nice.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean, that I have felt like it's usually in regards to like YouTube as like a platform.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think of like how it, it didn't always used to be like a career path.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And now it is almost entirely a career path.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you're not making a popular video, why would you make anything?

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And, and that's like a mindset lots of people have.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I certainly have felt it where it's like, yeah, but I know that I could be making bank if I just did something different.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, what the fuck?

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why, like all art has to be extremely successful.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It doesn't actually need to be that way, but like there's a lot of pressure.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There's not, there's a lot of pressure to like make it appealing and to a large audience and all that.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And it's, it's cool that you have, you've stuck it out to make the most obscure thing possible.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think, yeah, like, I don't know, I'm just, it's just, it's just what I was going to do anyway.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I'm just like, well, it is what it is.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And I just got to lean as far into it, whatever it is as possible.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And I don't know, maybe hopefully the people that like it will really appreciate it and all buy books and all have some money.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Maybe my next thing will be a little more, a little more universal.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't know.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know what I'm going to do after this.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe I'll go back and finish Beast Capades.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Beast Capades.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Beast Capades had that twist ending that I had in mind since the very beginning and that I would really like to show people at some point.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So maybe that's what I'll do.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I like Beast Capades.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I remember reading it the first time through and it's like how he goes on his little Beast Capade.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's a beast and it's like, oh, the stuff happened.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Whoa.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then he spoiler.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Whoops.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Bleep that.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Eliza.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, that's okay.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But it's sort of like, it doesn't go much into what happens next.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I'm like, oh, there's like hints at cool lore.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And I just don't really have enough.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't have enough yet to even ask questions.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There was, I mean, I had some, I won't say what they were, but like some, some of the stuff in there.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Was, um, I kind of just, well, there's a, there's a mix.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Some things I put in Beast Capades.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I, like, I know exactly where they're going and I know what they mean.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And I'm just not going to say it yet.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Some of it was just like stuff that I threw in randomly.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And maybe sometimes I would sort of, uh, sort of suggest that it is important without really

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
any idea of that it would ever be important.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So it's kind of like a mix of the two things and, uh, I don't know.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I thought, uh, that was a fun way to, to go about it.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like I've said, I know, I know where it ends and I know some of the steps along the way.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think the, I think the most, uh, uh, or a problem or an annoyance that I might face getting back into

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Beast Capades that I would have to, I would have to reread all of it just to like figure out,

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
okay, where was I and like what, what was the like micro step of the adventure that we were on

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and how was I intending to resolve it?

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Cause I kind of forget.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I forget exactly what was happening, uh, at the end and like what the immediate goal was.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I, I, I only had the broad strokes, like really, like really, really fleshed out in my head.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sure there will be beasts and escapades.

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Probably.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Most likely.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Uh, now you know, God, this is a scary thought.

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But Beast Capades is the kind of story that I could, one could really imagine someone going ahead

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and making like a tie-in video game for.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Uh-oh.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I hope I don't, I hope that doesn't happen.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Uh, yeah.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's like the opposite of Pokemon.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Right.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're making the manga first.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mmm.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Um, it's kind of embarrassing how many of my projects are like heavily homestuck based.

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, I mean, mine are as well.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Bailjack is, is just that thing.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's more like problem sleuth, I guess, cause there's no like dialogue, but it's that thing.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's that like just fuck around and, uh, cool shit happens.

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, that's homestuck.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you fuck around and cool shit happens, it's probably homestuck.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's just homestuck.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Uh, I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of homestuck in, uh, in slime and punishment.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I just, I took, took the, the mask just fell off when I named the video S-Rivert.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was just like, ah, fuck it.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't care.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It doesn't even make sense that it's called that.

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I mean, I did that for, I feel like there's just sort of a lot of homestuck stuff in,

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
uh, Endless War.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean, I made that, uh, what was it?

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
S-Descend or like Negus Slime Descend?

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You know what that, you know what that is probably why, I don't know if I like consciously

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
was like, I have to keep the, the naming conventions consistent between those two videos, but I think

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
maybe on like a semi-conscious level, that is why I called it S-Rivert.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And we could always say the S stands for slime.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Absolutely.

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Of course.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What else?

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Uh, Oblivion.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yo.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Since you're here, I wanted to ask how your project is coming.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My project is going pretty good.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I finished another shot, which, uh, I guess I can share it with you, but I don't know if

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can show the audience because it's Patreon exclusive still.

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Right.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Sure.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I've been changing up, I've been changing up my animation process.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Um, cause, oh man, it was, it was slow before.

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Um, I guess to summarize how I started the project, I would do a sketch and then in flash

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Adobe anime, I would like trace over it with the line tool and I would just use my mouse

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to very carefully move vector lines around.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Um, and that was my method of animating.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And it's really, really fucking slow.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But it looks.

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Drawing with vectors sounds like a very special sort of hell.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I know.

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But, but it does give me like a lot of like really, really, really fine control over the

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
movement.

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like I can get the easing and everything exactly right.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
From what I've seen, they, they, uh, it's just like incredibly smooth.

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You don't, do you not like have a rough sketch of like the keyframes before?

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Um, I sort of, yeah, I do have a rough sketch of the keyframes first.

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Um, and that's what I did for the first loop of my character, uh, dancing around.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh, okay.

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And then the new method I tried was like, I'm going to try doing puppet animation where

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I just draw a bunch of pieces and I move them around with tweens.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I did that for an animation of my character shaking her butt around.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And that looked all right.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Um, but it was kind of robotic.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And for this next shot, I kind of did half and half.

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And I was able to get it done in one week, which is pretty good.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And it looks really good.

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I will send it to you both if I can remember how to DM people on discord.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay.

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Clarify this for me.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Uh, cause I'm dumb.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You draw with, you were drawing with vectors.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Were you doing frame by frame animation that was drawn with vectors?

243
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Or were you like tweening the vectors to create the motion?

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Uh, now that's one of the things that changed.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So before it was frame by frame, I drew the first frame, I drew the last frame.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And then I kind of like, cause that seems like the advantage of drawing with vectors is

247
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
that you could just transform the vectors directly.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And silly me, I didn't do that the first time.

250
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ah, I see.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Um, I would like manually like find the halfway point and then I would like break it down

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and increments to more and more like halfway points until, you know, it moves smoothly

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
from one to the other.

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Um, what I did this time is I used a lot of shape tweens, which are usually the fucking

255
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
devil in flash.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Um, if you try to shape tween something, it'll look just fucking awful.

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Um, I wonder if I have.

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I wonder if I can find it a good example.

259
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If I just Google shape tween, give flash and see if there's like, we can see how fucked

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
up these things look.

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I mean, a shape tween is a, is a transformation of one shape into another.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, it's like, it's sort of.

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Does it take individual points on the shape and then map them to the other shape?

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, sort of.

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The problem is the way it does that is completely like fucked up.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It doesn't know which points should be mapped to which points.

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So like part of your character's ear will turn into the foot.

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Um, and like part of like their left finger will become like the fucking belly button

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
or some shit.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And so like the, like between the first and last frame, like the, like you'll have a,

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the first frame is like a normal character and then you just have a whole bunch of fucking

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
gobbledygook and then it turns into the same character again at a very similar pose.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Just everything got fucked up in the meantime.

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Um, but.

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, it's weird.

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I remember like in flesh doing that and being like, why, and how does it choose what points

277
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
of the vector like go in a straight line to the net to the end point?

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It just sort of flips over itself and like just becomes a mush of like weird lines and

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
shape all connected.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And then it just sort of flattens out and becomes the, the final key frame.

281
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know how it chooses that.

282
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Um, yeah, I don't know.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You were just like, pick a random point.

284
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You have to, you have to ask a, you'd have to ask crack or someone who knows like how

285
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
computers calculate stuff.

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Like you would think it would be like, oh, the, the closest point would go to the, you

287
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
know, the straightest line, shortest distance or whatever, but they just seem to go all

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
over the place.

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Trying to, to interpolate something and they don't know where to go.

291
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let me export a GIF.

293
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I just like made one right now.

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hell yeah.

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's do it.

296
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We don't need, we don't need a lot of colors in here.

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Transparency required.

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No transparency required.

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I, I say, uh, as a HR, HR director of Amazon corporation.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
All right.

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm going to drop Ben saint.gif into the, uh, the chat right now.

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I hope it doesn't look extra fucked up because of how discord handles gifts.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah.

304
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like why do that?

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Where do they decide these things come from?

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Um, I guess.

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Why are points from the, the right side of the screen going all the way down to the left

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
side?

309
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
All right.

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So I know a little bit about this just from fucking around a bit a lot.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So what I'm doing when I do this stuff is I'm not using like solid vectors.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm actually using the line tool, which is like a single vector that, that doesn't have

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
a fill and you just give it a width.

314
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Um, and those have very few vector points.

315
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Um, and I think what it is, is some kind of vector point hierarchy.

316
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Um, it looks at the order that the vector points were drawn and like numbers them and

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it tries to match like the same number to the numbers in the next shot.

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So if I draw the leg first and then I draw the head first in the next shot, it'll probably

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
like put parts of a leg, leg to the head or something.

320
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Maybe.

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's just how I assume it works on a small scale.

322
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Cause when I'm doing this, um, one of the things that I did to make the shape tweens

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
behave is I did everything in pieces.

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Like the arm is a separate layer.

325
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Um, the hand is a separate layer of the, um, you know, the shoulders, the eyes, the hair,

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
everything is like different layers, um, that are all tweened individually.

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Um, and, and then the gift that I sent you, um, you know, in DMs, like one example, you

328
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
know, cause I have my character lift up her arm.

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Um, what I actually did is I shaped tween to her arm in place.

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Um, from like, I drew the beginning frame, I drew the ending frame and then I moved

331
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the ending frame on top of where the beginning frame was.

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I shaped tween it in place and then I put that animation in a symbol and then had it rotate

333
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that way the rotation wasn't part of the shape tween.

334
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That was like me just moving the object afterwards.

335
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Uh, cause shape tweens also don't handle rotation as well.

336
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Um, instead of, instead of a thing spinning around, it'll just kind of like stretch, uh,

337
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
weirdly.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Um, and I can probably show an easy example of how that works.

339
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to draw a fucking funny looking axe.

340
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You mean her, her, her front, her front forearm and her hand, that was shaped tween?

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Um, yeah, her, the front, like the front part of her forearm was shaped tween.

342
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Also, her hand was also like, so I, yeah, the hand was also shaped tween.

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Um, and each finger was actually shaped tween individually.

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Um, so I know it was, it was painful.

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It took, it took a couple hours, but it resulted in, it ended up behaving a lot better.

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I mean, it looks, I mean, it looks pretty good.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's a, it's a, it's a pretty natural looking motion.

348
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah.

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Um, and it's not to say that like it was all tweens, like, uh, I think the pinky finger

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
on the right side, uh, it curls and shaped tweens don't know how to fucking handle rotation.

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So, um, I actually had the break that down into like steps, uh, and then like shaped tween,

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
like for steps.

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Um, and even then, like, I just kind of, a lot of the time.

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
For the curling of one pinky finger.

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Um, oh my gosh.

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's not even worse than I imagined.

357
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Sorry.

358
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I just shaped tweened an axe.

359
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's rotating.

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
An axe?

361
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah.

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't know.

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I just wanted like some kind of recognizable shape.

364
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Um, I don't know.

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let me say this as a gift and put that in chat as well.

366
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So many gifts for Eleazar to put in the episode.

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah.

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is how it handles and objects like rotating.

369
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Perfect.

370
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Swing, swing.

371
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I like, this is so unusual.

372
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's such a very specific, like vector based, uh, like issue that I would actually kind

373
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of like to see like an animation that uses that.

374
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's, uh, like deliberately.

375
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
As it's like a stylistic choice, there is, there fucking is.

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Um, let me grab an animation by Junie.

377
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This guy, um, uses like flash fuckery for like stylistic effect and it's really fucking,

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
really fucking cool stuff.

379
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I just need to remember what the video is called.

380
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Just squishes into a puddle.

381
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I must remember, he didn't, he, he didn't use shape tweens.

382
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He used the, uh, straighten slash some move effect and flash, which is famous for slash.

383
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah.

384
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There's a, well, these two effects in flash, like that'll, there's the smooth effect and

385
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
there's the straighten effect and both of them just make your drawings look completely fucked up.

386
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, you're talking about when it's all like black and white.

387
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah.

388
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
During the black and white section, every frame he just hits a smooth button and it fucks

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
up, but it actually stylistically looks cool.

390
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This, look at, look at this, uh, yeah, this, this frame.

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It looks really good in motion, uh, but, uh, freeze frame.

392
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's like, why does it look like that?

393
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Neat.

394
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Neat.

395
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Cause you said right click shape, smooth.

396
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Actually, I think it's a modified shape.

397
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Smooth.

398
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It looked at its head and he was like, yeah, that's a square.

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, I was going to approximate that to a square for you.

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You're welcome.

401
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

402
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I just, I just, uh, put the effect on the axe, for example, in the first frame and it

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
looks like that.

404
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It like, uh, looks very, um, uh, what's the word?

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Maybe like, uh, just sort of removing data, like, like, uh, curved lines become straight

406
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
lines, like trying to think where the points would be.

407
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Cause you can, you can kind of see like where the vector points are.

408
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Like it kind of, basically what both of those effects do is they just delete vector points,

410
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
um, because that actually makes the file less laggy and run faster.

411
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Um, the less vector points for our, for more cleanly, everything runs for less chances

412
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
of something glitching.

413
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Um, so it'll find that point vector points that are very close together and it will delete

414
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
some of them and try to approximate the shape afterwards.

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Um, which is basically how it works.

416
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There's also how the brush smoothing algorithm that's built into flash used to work.

417
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Uh, it's a little bit more sophisticated these days because I've updated the brush a bunch

418
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
of times in the last few years.

419
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Um, but flash was famous for having a really terrible brush, um, because a lot of things,

420
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
you would draw like a good shape and then the second you let go of the mouse, the shape

421
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
goes and like straightens out.

422
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, it becomes like weird polygon.

423
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah.

424
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

425
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Uh, the flash brush has gotten a lot better, uh, at not doing that, but if you, but the,

426
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
the smooth, the shape smooth and the shape straighten effects basically work like the

427
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
old brush.

428
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So you can still get that look if you want.

429
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Um, uh, the way I work where I use the line tool specifically, so I don't use the brush,

430
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I use the line tool, um, results in very, very few vector points anyway.

431
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So my files tend not to be laggy at all.

432
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Um, and I guess, um, I'm going to, um, I'm going to put a cropped picture of my animation

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
in chat that Eleazar can use earlier in the episode for when I'm talking about the hands

434
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and shakes.

435
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I realize it's going to be really confusing for people who can't see.

436
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah.

437
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Perhaps.

438
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Just a little cropped version.

439
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If you want to see the uncropped, patreon.com slash oblivionfall, which, oh no.

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh no.

441
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What's this?

442
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm Richard and Ben Saint now.

443
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh, I better pledge to Ben Saint at patreon.com.

444
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How have, how have you, how has this happened?

445
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You haven't posted anything.

446
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Um, people just show up to my patreon, I guess.

447
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I guess there's people who just see the link in the description of the cum zone and they're

448
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
like, they just wander in.

449
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Um, yeah.

450
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I guess that makes sense.

451
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

452
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah.

453
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I haven't advertised it.

454
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Booby is very powerful, uh, like a, like a magnet.

455
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It jumped up because I opened my, uh, I, I finally like announced, oh yeah, I have like

456
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a patreon discord server now and there's like extra stuff in there that you can get

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
early and then a bunch of people up there pledged like instantly and I was like, oh

458
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
shit, I wasn't expecting that.

459
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And I jumped above 400 just this morning.

460
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm like, damn, time to fulfill my obligations to Ben Saint and give him money on patreon,

461
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
because now I'm the big creator.

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Oh, uh, did you, did you say you were going to say that?

463
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Did you say you were going to do that?

464
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You, you suggested it, Ben.

466
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Uh, well good.

467
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm glad I did.

468
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You were like, oh, um, yeah.

469
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Like giving each other money on patreon at the same time is dumb because then we're both

470
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
just losing money and fees.

471
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll pledge, like the bigger person should pledge to a smaller person and that was the,

472
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
that was the plan.

473
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Uh, okay.

474
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But did I actually pledge to you?

475
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm not sure that I did.

476
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Actually, I don't know if you did.

477
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't see what you did.

478
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't, I don't think, I don't think I actually did.

479
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Darren, you get nothing then.

480
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, I fucked up.

481
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I fucked up really bad.

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Uh, damn.

483
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No.

484
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay.

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Well, I would have if I knew, if I knew that, uh, you, that you believed my lie.

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Uh, oh well.

487
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I believed it.

488
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I believed in Ben Saint.

489
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What a tragic mistake.

490
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You're first, you're first in your last mistake.

491
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah.

492
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Actually, it works out for me because my tier at the time was free dollars and your lowest

493
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
tier is five.

494
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So actually I would have been, um, I would have lost in that transaction.

495
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So it works out.

496
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Absolutely.

497
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Absolutely.

498
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Wait.

499
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Now I gotta check.

500
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Let me go check if I'm, let me make absolutely sure.

501
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

502
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Do check.

503
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah.

504
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, now you know Ben Saint, that if you want to win this war, uh, you're going to

505
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
have to turn bescapades into sexcapades.

506
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yes.

507
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes.

508
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah.

509
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I always knew deep down.

510
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I think, uh, uh, who are posts from my creators?

511
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
No, I'm not subscribed.

512
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm not pledged to oblivion fall.

513
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Damn.

514
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Uh, shit.

515
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You could, you could have had it all.

516
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You could have, you could have made back two dollars extra from whatever you were,

517
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
who would have been giving me.

518
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah.

519
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, I didn't just like Bitcoin.

520
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I didn't get in on the ground floor.

521
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Uh, I'm pledged to cheesy Manfredo, Gibb and take and Shaddock.

522
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Uh, I'm also pledged to Gabriel the star man, but I think his, his Patreon is inactive.

523
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So that doesn't count.

524
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Uh, yeah.

525
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's, that's me.

526
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's all I have to say about that.

527
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Uh, Patreon.

528
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Patreon.

529
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Patreon.

530
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Uh, maybe some people will like the video game that I made and pledge me some money for

531
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that.

532
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Uh, or maybe not.

533
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Uh, if anyone, if anyone were to pledge right now, they would get their name in the, in

534
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the credits for the game.

535
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Anyone who pledges up until I post it gets, I've had to add a couple of last minute additions.

536
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, when they listen to this, will it be too late?

537
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It will be too late.

538
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes.

539
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Fuck.

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Fuck them.

541
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah.

542
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta fucking, uh, I gotta fucking put the, no, I said, I said the

543
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
game will be out.

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I said the game will be out by now and it's true.

545
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Uh, it'll probably, I'm not sure if I should wait till Friday to post it or just go ahead

546
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and post it whenever it's done.

547
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No, just post it.

548
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

549
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Just post it.

550
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Probably like middle of this week sometime.

551
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Uh, that's what I'll do.

552
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Uh, that's all I can, uh, even think about.

553
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Uh, I got nothing else to say.

554
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Wow.

555
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, um.

556
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Good thing I have a podcast.

557
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I have, um, been dealing with, uh, the lore of ghosts, uh, Kickstarter, Becker, rewards,

558
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
mailing, delivery stuff.

559
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah.

560
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And, uh, it really got me down.

561
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Um, but I'm okay now.

562
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You seemed agitated.

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You seemed agitated about it.

564
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I did.

565
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I did.

566
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Um, I think there's a couple of problems.

567
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
One of them is that it's too hard.

568
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Uh, the other one.

569
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's a big one.

570
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The other one is that I had too high of expectations of my own abilities and because I didn't meet

571
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
like that high bar, um, I felt like I was worthless and I got me all depressed.

572
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Do you mean your ability to do it in a certain time period?

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah.

574
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

575
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It was like last week, um, like, uh, I don't know, Monday I had something happening, but

576
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
like it was going to be this week, I'm going to start buying the rest of the, uh, postage

577
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and packaging and that's what I'm going to do.

578
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm going to be packaging this week.

579
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Right.

580
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Um, because the demo is out and I have the time to do it and work on it, focus on it.

581
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And then I immediately ran into like confusing things, uh, customs things that I needed to,

582
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I didn't have data, um, on enough of like the, the money that I was going to spend.

583
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And there was a lot of like questions of, do I have the money to, to pay for all of this

584
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
custom stuff?

585
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
How do I do it?

586
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And I, I, I couldn't pack anything.

587
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I, I had to like do like some more research.

588
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But because I had said it to myself, I'm going to be packing today.

589
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And the fact that by the end of the day, I was still like struggling to understand a

590
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
bunch of like numbers stuff.

591
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Um, I felt like I had failed utterly and that I was pathetic and terrible and worthless.

592
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And that was like the main problem was not that it was too difficult.

593
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It was that I thought I could do it and, um, I beat myself up for not being able to do

594
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
it.

595
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And so that's, that's more of like an ongoing problem, which I have now identified correctly

596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
that I beat myself up, I treat myself like shit.

597
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Like I am my own boss and I treat myself like a shit.

598
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Like I treat myself badly.

599
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm a bad, uh, employer and I don't give myself a break.

600
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And, uh, that's not good.

601
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's a cause of a lot of problems.

602
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Uh, well, we got it.

603
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We got to, uh, just, we got to destroy the business owners.

604
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So you're going, you're going down.

605
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm going down.

606
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm going to, I'm going to be scared to see me in the alleyway at night.

607
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Um, because I'm going to kill myself, but not like that.

608
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm going to kill, I'm going to kill the bad part of myself.

609
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Right, right, right.

610
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But yeah, that, that, that was just like, that was my, my saga.

611
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I've, I've, I've since calmed down and then realized that I, I'm giving myself too much shit.

612
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I got to like allow myself to be not perfect and be kind of dumb or like just accept that

613
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
things are difficult and that it's okay that I didn't figure it out so quickly.

614
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Um, and, uh, now I, uh, I've bought some label stuff and I've figured out where,

615
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
where money is going, which, uh, things I'm, I'm sending it through and mostly through

616
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Royal Mail for like most of the world.

617
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And then Transglobal Express is good for the US cause they have like a connection to USPS,

618
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
which makes it very cheap and good.

619
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So it should be good.

620
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It should be fine and not a problem.

621
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I checked all of the numbers and I have enough from the Kickstarter to reimburse anyone

622
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
who will have to pay customs.

623
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
That's just the easiest way to deal with it is to have the person receive the item,

624
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
pay customs to receive it, and then I will reimburse them, uh, the full amount of whatever it is.

625
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It won't be more than like 10 pounds or something.

626
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Is that, um, to like for, is that for all like international mail?

627
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah, most, I mean, especially with Brexit now that like you have to do it just to send to Europe,

628
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
which is, uh, didn't used to be the case.

629
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh, jeez.

630
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
All right.

631
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I remember I have to like make a little customs sheet declaring what it is and print that on a label,

632
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
stick that on along with the, the mailing address label.

633
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And then they receive it and they have to pay like customs to receive it like a customs tax thing,

634
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
VAT, handling whatever it is, just a bunch of little fees that add up to like maybe 10 pounds,

635
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
sometimes like six pounds.

636
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And then I'm just going to like message everyone say I can reimburse you whatever it was.

637
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah, I remember sending packet, it was the, uh, the, the RFCK pins.

638
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
When I had to send a package of them to the UK, they would, uh, it was only the UK that ever did this.

639
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It was like, Oh, the, the person receiving the package has to pay some like customs fee for it or some nonsense.

640
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Which is weird because I had to pay for postage and then it arrives and then they also have to pay more.

641
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's like, just charge me it.

642
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I was looking into it and there's like, if you have, at least for the UK and sending to Europe or most international places,

643
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
if you have a business or you can declare yourself a business and get like an iOSS number,

644
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
which is like a one stop shop, like, um, export number thingy,

645
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
then I can do a special thing where it's like delivered taxes paid or duty paid.

646
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So that I pay the fee ahead of time and then the customer just receives the thing,

647
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
which is I think what most businesses do, I hope.

648
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I mean, it feels like that because like a lot of, you know, I order stuff.

649
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't have to pay customs.

650
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I also didn't have to pay customs when I received the vapors.

651
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Any of those or like the Cato anthology or any of that stuff.

652
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah.

653
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So I don't really know what the, the deal is.

654
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I think it was just when I sent places versus others.

655
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I think it was just when I sent like a box, when I sent the, like the, the box of pins.

656
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That was when, that was when it was laid over as a custom.

657
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It was, it was a package instead of an envelope.

658
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That might have been the, that might have been it.

659
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So yeah, I feel like I've learned a lot.

660
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm glad you didn't go into the red.

661
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes, I'm not going into the red.

662
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I actually like when I made the Kickstarter, I was very scared about all this stuff

663
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and I made sure the goals were a little higher than was like absolutely necessary,

664
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
at least what I understood at the time.

665
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah.

666
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And then I ended up like undercharging for the delivery cost for everything.

667
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah.

668
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Cause like sending something to Canada is like 18 pounds.

669
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Jesus.

670
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And, and that's like,

671
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's like 25 bucks or 30 bucks or something.

672
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Something like that.

673
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And it's like the, the, the delivery costs I was asking for, for Canada,

674
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I think was like five pounds.

675
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh yeah.

676
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
No.

677
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Almost four times as expensive for most of the places.

678
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah.

679
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Europe.

680
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Europe is all right.

681
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Cause it's close by.

682
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah.

683
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But like it's big delivery cost, but I had accounted for it and I think I will have enough.

684
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I may even make a profit at the end.

685
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Very nice.

686
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Very nice.

687
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So it's all, it's all sorted out and it will just take a little time and then it will be done.

688
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah.

689
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So I'm glad that that's over and I'm glad also that I recognize.

690
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Is it over?

691
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You finished it?

692
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Well, I got to draw the doodles.

693
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's the next thing.

694
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That's the next like big, big scary thing is like, oh no, what if I deface this comic and

695
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
it's, this is a doodle sucks.

696
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I've ruined it for them.

697
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

698
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't have that many extra copies.

699
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh shit.

700
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And that, you know, that'll be a thing, but like whatever.

701
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I can, I dealt with like a fucking doodle anxiety or like commission anxiety before.

702
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Uh-huh.

703
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Where people pay for a thing and I'm like, oh God, my art style varies in quality like

704
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
wildly from day to day and hour to hour.

705
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I don't know if they're going to be happy with this one, but they usually are.

706
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So no problem.

707
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
No, I don't think, nobody's going to be like, what, but that guy's was better.

708
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You put a better doodle in that guy's book.

709
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What the fuck?

710
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That one had more lines.

711
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That one had 50% more lines.

712
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That one took up 25% more page space than mine.

713
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It required 30% more ink and I demand satisfaction.

714
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Everyone's got to meet up together.

715
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Everyone who had a book is going to meet up and like compare pages and make a new book.

716
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Make a new book with just those pages.

717
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Take it out.

718
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay, they're all going to tear the covers off and then I'm going to put the drawings in

719
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and then they're going to tear them all into a number of equal pieces and then distribute

720
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
the pieces among each other.

721
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So they all have equal quality distributed socialism.

722
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And when they come together, they can put them together like a secret map that's being

723
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
reforged.

724
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yes.

725
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And then they'd be like, oh, I always remember you, person who also pledged to the pluge to

726
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the Lord of Ghost kicks out.

727
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm going to next time I do a Kickstarter, I'm using that pluge again.

728
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We're going to be pluging from the very start.

729
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's an evergreen.

730
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm glad.

731
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm glad I said that.

732
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You did it.

733
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You invented it for some reason.

734
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't remember what the context was.

735
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Was it during a stream or something?

736
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah.

737
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It was right at the end.

738
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You were playing a video game.

739
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Call of night.

740
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Call of night, I think, yeah.

741
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I beat Call of night, steal, solo run.

742
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That was great.

743
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You beat it with like 45 minutes before the Kickstarter ended or some shit, right?

744
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No, it was like within like five minutes or something.

745
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, yeah.

746
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It was very close.

747
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It was super close.

748
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I thought you weren't going to make it.

749
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah.

750
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I thought I was going to die.

751
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That was the most epic type.

752
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah, I saw you make like a couple of errors against the Hollow Knight and I'm like, oh,

753
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
God, she's going to, she's, nah, she's fucked.

754
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Nah, she can't do it.

755
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
There's no way.

756
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah, rule.

757
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
My favorite gaming moment of all time, probably.

758
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah.

759
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah.

760
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Shit, was I going to say?

761
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah, Pluging.

762
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, Pluging is coming back in a big way.

763
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I was looking into, I mentioned that my printer, my local printer was giving me like some bullshit.

764
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They were giving me bullshit quotes on their books.

765
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I was looking at Mixam, which I think is a UK based printer.

766
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And I think I can get the price down to under 20 a copy through them, which is okay.

767
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Like it's manageable.

768
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's, that's for 100 copies.

769
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
If I were to sell more than 100, I could get the price down even lower.

770
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Under 20 is like fine.

771
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I have a couple more options I want to look at to maybe save even more or something.

772
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But we'll see.

773
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I could bring it down even lower if I went, if I made the book small.

774
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Like if I made the book like six by nine, I could get it down to like, like under like, like 12.

775
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But that's like six by nine inches.

776
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
But that's, yeah, but that's, that's a bit, that's a little smaller than I think I am willing to accept it being.

777
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's not sad.

778
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't know.

779
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'll have to like look at it in real life.

780
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Maybe I'll just use a ruler.

781
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Print out on a piece of paper and cut it to the size it would be.

782
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah.

783
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Just to have a look at how legible everything is.

784
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I was envisioning something that's like eight by 12, but that might be too big.

785
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That might be like unwieldily large.

786
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Maybe not.

787
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't know.

788
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Eight by 12.

789
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's a little bit bigger than a.

790
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
That's like, that's bigger than like a peanuts anthology.

791
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
That's bigger than, than a fucking.

792
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
What is, I think that's larger than a Homestuck book, actually.

793
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I think, I think it might be because that's what it's like nine by nine.

794
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
The Homestuck books are almost square.

795
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yes.

796
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Mine, my book would need to be, I think I want it to be about like, like three to two ratio.

797
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You know, like longer than it or wider than it is tall.

798
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because, you know, it's, it was Twitter images and that's the roughly like the Twitter image ratio size.

799
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah.

800
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know.

801
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I don't know.

802
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm shopping around, but I was glad to see that like, no, these, these prices that fucking Fleming

803
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
printing is quoting me are not reasonable.

804
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It is unacceptable.

805
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
They will pay for, for what they've done.

806
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
They lost themselves like customers.

807
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
They have lost themselves a damn customer.

808
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Those mutants.

809
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I thought we had something Renee.

810
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I thought we had, I thought we had rapport.

811
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But no, but instead you thought I was poor.

812
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

813
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah.

814
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Okay.

815
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Here's, here's something funny that happened this, this week.

816
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Okay.

817
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So I recorded a podcast.

818
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I was on a podcast, a cheesy Manfredo invited me onto a podcast.

819
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
His new podcast, which is called, uh, main character syndrome is what it's called.

820
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yes.

821
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And he invited me onto an episode with, maybe you've heard of this guy, uh, uh, the Yolo swag studios.

822
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Uh,

823
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They might be unbelievable.

824
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Are they an animator?

825
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
They are a cartoonist.

826
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They draw funny little comics on Twitter.

827
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Okay.

828
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Maybe I'm not sure.

829
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I feel like I may have seen him before.

830
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Um, they're, you know, moderately big on Twitter.

831
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Uh, so that was cool.

832
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Got to talk to that guy.

833
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Um, but then after that we recorded, that's, I think he said that's going to come out like

834
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
end of the month or something.

835
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Uh, but then after we recorded that, I was talking to him and, and, uh, he mentioned that he

836
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
had a comic idea that he was not planning to draw, but he wanted to, um, he wanted to

837
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
have this other artist to draw it.

838
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
This other artist called, uh, Mimi Yori, who, uh, went kind of viral on Twitter a few weeks

839
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
ago or maybe longer than that.

840
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I don't know because she made, uh, Among Us Girl, which is like, people loved Among Us

841
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Girl.

842
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I love Among Us Girl.

843
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
She's very specific.

844
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Among Us Girl.

845
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yes.

846
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Um, yes.

847
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It is very specific.

848
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Let me, uh, I like Fall Guys Girl too.

849
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Fall Guys Girl.

850
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah.

851
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Her, her, her bitter rival, Fall Guys Girl.

852
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Uh, she looks like she had commie names and that's good.

853
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Uh, I bet Gib would like, I bet Gib would like, uh, uh, Fall Guys Girl actually.

854
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
This could be the type.

855
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Here.

856
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This is, this is, this is, this is Among Us Girl.

857
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, I have not seen this.

858
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Everybody loves Among Us Girl.

859
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Uh, I don't know.

860
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
She says, Sus.

861
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Sus.

862
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Sus.

863
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Ah, crewmate.

864
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I love you crewmate.

865
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Um, anyway.

866
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So, so, uh, anyway, Cheesy wanted, uh, Mimi Yori to draw this, uh, comic idea that he

867
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
had.

868
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Uh, but it was like, they were trying to, uh, they were trying to work out like who, uh,

869
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,500
they wanted to like pay her an artist fee, but they were going to do like, okay, when

870
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,000
you draw it, then I'll try to sell it and I'm not going to pay you upfront, but like,

871
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'll pay you out of the sales and like, you'll get the first cut of like the fee and that'll

872
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
be it.

873
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But it was like, okay, but because it's like not a guaranteed, uh, uh, return, it's like,

874
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
okay, she's like, she couldn't like do it.

875
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
She had like prioritized other things.

876
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Uh, so I, uh, a genius that I am.

877
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh, yes.

878
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
There's, there's, there's Fall Guys girl.

879
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Uh, I was just like, here, well, why don't I, why don't I just pay for it?

880
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'll just give you, I'll just give you money.

881
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'll just give you some money.

882
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh, I definitely like Fall Guys girl.

883
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

884
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I knew it.

885
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah.

886
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
She's a bully.

887
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
She'll bully you just like you are.

888
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Is she a bully or does she just look like that?

889
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
She just, she's got that, uh, that, um, uh, well, it's like Rose Lalonde and Mandy from

890
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Billy and Mandy and Pacific Northwest sort of vibe.

891
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah.

892
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Very, very Pacifica.

893
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Um, I like her little tote bag with the Fall Guys face on it.

894
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It's great.

895
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Uh, but anyway, I said, uh, here, I'll just, I'll just pay for it.

896
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Here's some money.

897
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Anyway, the point is now I have, now I'm executive producer of, uh, of this thing.

898
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Cause I paid for it.

899
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And I think that's pretty funny.

900
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Your producer of Among Us girl comic?

901
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Not of Among Us girl.

902
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's Cheezy's specific, uh, uh, story, which is called Extra Souls.

903
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Uh, I won't say anything more about it cause it would be a spoiler, but, uh, so she's,

904
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
she's drawing it.

905
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
He, he wrote the script.

906
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
He wrote it and came up with the idea.

907
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
She's drawing it and I'm executive producer.

908
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Cool.

909
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah.

910
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I think that's pretty cool.

911
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Uh, and maybe, and maybe I'll get my money back if, uh, people buy it.

912
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Lemau.

913
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I just realized what this, this comic is.

914
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Maybe I'll buy chicken for dinner.

915
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They both grab for chicken.

916
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Among Us girl, full guys girl.

917
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
What are they going to do?

918
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What are they going to do?

919
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
There's more than one thing of chicken there.

920
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So there's not even like, they have to fight over it.

921
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's true.

922
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's true.

923
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Uh, but no, they want.

924
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They're just going to kill each other.

925
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They just, uh, I think the problem is not that there's not enough chicken to go around.

926
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's that now they've seen each other and that's.

927
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It's time to throw down.

928
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's time to throw down.

929
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'm not even sure what happens.

930
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Full guys girl is going to fall onto her and Among Us girl is going to try and vent to get away.

931
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Um, yeah.

932
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You should get stuck in the vent because it's a real fucking vent and it's like, oh no, it's not meant for humans to go through.

933
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So anyway, I'm a page, I'm a patron of the arts.

934
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm a, I'm a, I'm an executive producer now.

935
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm moving on up in the world and I just wanted it to let everyone know that I would have,

936
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
what a, what a cool, what a big shot I am.

937
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah.

938
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's funny.

939
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
No, cause it's like, it is kind of cool, but it's also like.

940
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It, it's, it's like, uh, it's executive producers, the sort of thing you see when you're young and it's like, wow, I wonder what that means.

941
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yeah.

942
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Um, must be important cause they're always like right at the end, but it's really, it's really literally just, they paid for it.

943
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yes.

944
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
That's right.

945
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And they get to put their name important.

946
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Like, well, I paid, so can I have like my big name, big, right?

947
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Really big in the credits and like, yeah, okay.

948
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Can you put me in the video description?

949
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Just my name.

950
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
What?

951
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Cause it's just paying for that.

952
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You know, I always thought it was like super lame when patrons were like, oh, if you pledge this amount of money, we'll put your name at the end.

953
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Um, but no, that's what people pay, people pay millions of dollars for that in movies.

954
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So.

955
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah.

956
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You know, it's executively produced by all my patrons.

957
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Uh, well, you know, uh, being an executive producer, the challenge, the challenge is, uh, is you got to recognize the talent.

958
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You got to have an eye for talent.

959
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The, the, the, the hard part is not, uh, giving someone some money.

960
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
The hard part is, uh, is scouting out like who is worthy of your investment.

961
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And I think cheesy is a, is a real go getter.

962
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Cheesy's a moxie.

963
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And, uh, I think Mimi Ori is pretty good at, uh, drawing stuff.

964
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So it's like, yeah, I think, I think this is, I think we're doing this.

965
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I think, I think, I think it's time to throw down, uh, it's time to invest, to take all my money out of Bitcoin and put it into, uh, comic executive producer credits.

966
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Uh, getting in on the ground floor.

967
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Uh, it's going to the moon.

968
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Uh, yeah.

969
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Anyway, that's what I did.

970
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Left the call.

971
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I didn't, I didn't leave the call.

972
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I was delivered food that I didn't know was happening.

973
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Uh, I have a steak here.

974
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Um, well, I can't eat a steak in the middle of a podcast.

975
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I mean, can I?

976
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Well, here, how, how about this?

977
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You won't have to, because I'll kill your appetite by telling you about the other thing that happened to me this week.

978
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I think.

979
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Did you diarrhea?

980
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Well, that goes, that goes without saying.

981
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But, um, the, no, I think I had a tonsil stone.

982
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think I got one.

983
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Do you know what those are?

984
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Uh, I, I know the tonsils are the back of your mouth.

985
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah.

986
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I don't know what a stone of that would be.

987
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's like a buildup.

988
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oblivion, yes.

989
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Oblivion, do you know what a tonsil stone is?

990
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's like, it's like a weird growth sort of thing.

991
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I don't know.

992
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's not a growth.

993
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's like in the, okay.

994
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm not sure if it's what it is, but like, I think so.

995
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Uh, in the tonsil, in like the crevices of the tonsil, uh, fucking, I don't know, stuff just gets caught in there.

996
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And, um, sometimes it just accumulates.

997
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Yeah, sure.

998
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Pissed crystals.

999
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It accumulates into like a, a lump, a white lump.

1000
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And, uh, you know, it just lives there in your tonsil until it eventually, if you're lucky, falls out.

1001
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Or maybe it is extracted if it's like, whatever.

1002
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Uh, anyway, all, all I know is I was eating something.

1003
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Or I had just eaten something and then like, I like spat something out and there was like just a white sort of like ball.

1004
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And I was like, what is this?

1005
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Like this does not look like what I was eating.

1006
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And I was like, I get, maybe it was a tonsil stone.

1007
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I've never had one before.

1008
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Although they say the tonsil stones smell really bad.

1009
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And this, this thing did not smell that bad.

1010
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It didn't smell like much of anything.

1011
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So I don't know.

1012
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Maybe that's not what it was.

1013
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Maybe it was just some food.

1014
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I don't know.

1015
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It was like smooth and sort of roundish sort of pea size, small pea size.

1016
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I don't know.

1017
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I hadn't noticed any like white blobs in my tonsil.

1018
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
If you go on YouTube and you look up tonsil stone extraction, you can see inside the mouth.

1019
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
You can see people's tonsils just, uh, just absolutely laden with a big white lumps of stuff.

1020
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And then they go in with like a hook and they like jostle them around and they squeeze them out and they just fall out.

1021
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's disgusting.

1022
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Anyway, I hope that's killed Gibbs appetite.

1023
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So she won't have to eat that steak on.

1024
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, I'll make sure to talk about piss crystals some more.

1025
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah.

1026
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm going to go to rant about a kitty litter and why it's, why it's bad.

1027
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Let me hear it.

1028
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So they used to be a really good brand.

1029
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It was like this, um, it was like this paper litter that flushes.

1030
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You can flush it, which is handy.

1031
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Wait, like you line the, like you line like the box with.

1032
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It's like, you know, it's like these little blue pellets that are apparently made out of paper, but the, the like little blue pellets that are like squishy, like foam almost.

1033
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh, but you can.

1034
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So it's flush, but it's flushable.

1035
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah, it's flushable.

1036
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So like, um, interesting.

1037
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's very good at like sticking to all the, the trash that your, your cats are dropping.

1038
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's really good at solidifying and clumping as well.

1039
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And you can just flush it down the toilet, which is really handy because we had the litter box in the toilet.

1040
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And then they stopped making it for some reason or at least I stopped selling it here around the time COVID started.

1041
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So like, you know, mid early 2020, we couldn't get it anymore.

1042
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So then we had to try other types of litter and there are so many just terrible, terrible types of kitty litter, but I don't know why anyone would ever use them.

1043
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Um, the first one we found was like these like hard, like brown pellets that didn't clump.

1044
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
They didn't do anything.

1045
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Um, and it would just turn to mush at the bottom where all that pee is and that's no good.

1046
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Um, and so that, that show was terrible.

1047
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And also it's like really sharp.

1048
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
If it like, if the cats kick it out of the box and you stop on it, it'll like hurt your foot.

1049
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Um, and then we tried because we kept seeing like, oh, crystal kitty litter.

1050
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Like, and I'm like, huh, um, that seems weird.

1051
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But you know, like, we might as well try it since like, we've been trying a bunch of different things because and none of them are really that good.

1052
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So we tried, I'll get a, I'll show you a picture of us.

1053
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,000
You know, it's like these hard, like, um, delicious transparent crystals.

1054
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And we thought maybe this will be okay.

1055
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm gonna crush that up and snort it.

1056
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
If you know what I'm saying, all I have to say is the smell minty.

1057
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It smells minty.

1058
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It does.

1059
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Nice.

1060
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Nice.

1061
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is the worst imaginable though.

1062
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
This is actually the worst.

1063
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Like having this is the worst experience I've ever had.

1064
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Uh, this is like everything bad.

1065
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Like a good litter.

1066
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
You know, we'll cancel out the odor.

1067
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It'll clump.

1068
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You know, the liquids will cause it to clumps.

1069
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You can easily scoop out those parts.

1070
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's not too heavy, which means that like, you know, like it, when you put it in a bag,

1071
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
doesn't make the trash bag weigh a ton.

1072
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Um, and it also like clings to poop and stuff correctly and all that.

1073
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So that way like that, that, that those are the things you want.

1074
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
This checks none of those boxes.

1075
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Um, and also it's fucking sharp.

1076
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Um, like walking into the bathroom is cut yourself on it.

1077
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Never cut myself, but like it is painful as stepping on glass could be without

1078
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
bleeding is what it felt like.

1079
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Oh, like on your months.

1080
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Um, and the worst fucking stuff is that, you know, cause you're just like kind of,

1081
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
you mostly like scoop stuff off the top.

1082
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Uh, what I didn't realize is that the bottom of the litter box, like every,

1083
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
all the crystals had turned.

1084
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
No, I hope, I hope Kim's not listening while she's eating.

1085
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
This is the worst part.

1086
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I hope she is.

1087
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
No, no.

1088
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Guys, this takes so good.

1089
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Fuck you.

1090
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Fuck you.

1091
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's so good.

1092
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Even the most grossest things could not dissuade me from eating.

1093
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
All right.

1094
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So what kind of steak?

1095
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
What cut?

1096
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I want to know what, I want to know what cut you're eating.

1097
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Um, it's, uh, from a cow.

1098
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Damn it.

1099
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
What?

1100
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I don't know.

1101
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It's a, it's like a steak the size of a, well, I don't know where it came from.

1102
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's good.

1103
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It's got like, uh, there's like, there's like sauteed little potatoes and like a tomato

1104
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
sauce thing.

1105
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's good.

1106
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Damn.

1107
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Fine.

1108
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I hope you enjoy it.

1109
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I'm going to get to the gross part of the story now.

1110
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Yeah.

1111
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So, um, yeah, so they don't really, these, the shit doesn't really absorb liquid.

1112
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It just changes color.

1113
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Um, so at the bottom of the litter box, well, like after a while, I'm like, I've been cleaning

1114
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
stuff up at the top.

1115
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I should probably like do a full on clean scrub the box out as you, you know, should do it

1116
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
every couple months at least.

1117
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Um, because instead of just emptying it, um, the bottom of the thing was the most disgusting

1118
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
looking and smelly thing I'd ever seen.

1119
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
The crystals had absorbed so much pee, but they weren't just yellow.

1120
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
They were like dark orange, almost brown with pee.

1121
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's how you know you're getting your money's worth.

1122
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But they were like, but like when I, when I scraped it with the scraper thing, like,

1123
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
you know, a little, little shovel, like liquid would still like leak from the crystal, like

1124
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
pile at the bottom.

1125
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And amazing.

1126
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The weirdest shit is I could look, I, it somehow was like, was getting into the air.

1127
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I was breathing in piss crystals.

1128
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I could feel them coating my lungs.

1129
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Um, just being near it.

1130
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Um, very nice.

1131
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It was the worst experience ever.

1132
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Um, and after that, I just, me and, me and Kai were just like, fuck this, never buying

1133
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
this shit again.

1134
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
This is like the worst litter imaginable.

1135
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Um, and then we found, um, then we switched because we couldn't get the, we couldn't get

1136
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
the fucking blue paper pallet stuff anymore.

1137
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Cause again, they didn't sell it.

1138
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
We eventually found, uh, it's like, it's like powdered like wood shavings or something.

1139
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Um, that's like scented and it's pretty good.

1140
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's the next best thing.

1141
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Um, because it's still pretty lightweight.

1142
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You can't flush it, but aside from that, it's just as good as the blue paper litter

1143
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
pallets.

1144
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So there's no, there's no alternative.

1145
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
There's no like similar off brand alternative to the blue paper pallets.

1146
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
There's no like similar off brand alternative to the old kinds you used to get.

1147
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Um, you can't like order it online or something.

1148
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Um, you really, we tried, we tried it.

1149
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
We just couldn't find it.

1150
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Um, blows, but yeah, the, the, the wood, it's like, it's like sawdust sort of like litter

1151
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
or whatever.

1152
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Um, and like it's scented like tree or some shit.

1153
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I don't know.

1154
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That stuff's all right.

1155
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Uh, it's a lot better than everything else we were trying at the time.

1156
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We couldn't.

1157
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah.

1158
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Sounds, sounds pretty bad.

1159
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Uh, I don't, I'm not a cat owner.

1160
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You know, I could, I could, I could care less about animal husbandry.

1161
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Uh, our cats are wonderful and their best friends.

1162
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Is it possible for the cats to like learn how to go outside?

1163
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Um, like where you live?

1164
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
No, it's not a good.

1165
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
It's not how, that's just not how cats.

1166
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I mean, uh, we don't, we don't, uh, we keep our cats as indoor cats.

1167
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah.

1168
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
There's indoor cats and there's outdoor cats.

1169
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah.

1170
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I mean, I guess so, but like, man, no, that's, that is true.

1171
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Some cats are very want to stay inside all the time.

1172
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
My cat, um, regularly goes out on little expeditions.

1173
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We never needed a, a little trade for her.

1174
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That's awesome.

1175
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Yeah, rules.

1176
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Our cat, Labris, and I, I will put a picture of her in chat.

1177
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
She.

1178
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Labris?

1179
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Labris, named after the character from persona free.

1180
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And our character, I guess, is also named after character from persona free.

1181
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Oh, I, I know who I guess is.

1182
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah.

1183
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Um, that's Labris.

1184
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
She's our, when we got her, she was apparently six months old, but she looked like she was

1185
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
free months old.

1186
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
She's tiny.

1187
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
She's a ball of fluff and we've had her for two years and she's still tiny.

1188
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I worry that if, uh, she ever went outside, she would just never come back.

1189
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
She would just wander off.

1190
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah.

1191
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Um, she, she's very, she's very silly.

1192
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I don't think she knows where she is ever.

1193
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I used to live, I used to live with a cat, a horrible cat, a disgusting little creature

1194
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
who, uh, who would scratch you, who would like swipe at anyone who came near all the time.

1195
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And, uh, if you let it out, it could, it would always, it would attempt to, it would attempt

1196
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
to bolt out of any door that was opened.

1197
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You had to like watch your back and make sure the cat was not around.

1198
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And if it was around, you had to like really carefully block its way from getting out the

1199
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
door because it would try as hard as it could to get out.

1200
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And once it was out, you had to chase it around in order to get it to come back in.

1201
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
No G's.

1202
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, a nasty little goblin thing that should have been put down.

1203
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Uh, but it was allowed to live, unfortunately.

1204
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Uh, unfortunately.

1205
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Okay.

1206
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
You know, the weird thing is when we, um, got, when we got, uh, labris, it was actually

1207
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm not talking about Digi, uh, uh, Trixie's old cat, uh, not, not talking about, uh, what's

1208
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
my lala by that?

1209
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Lala was a good cat.

1210
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
All right.

1211
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So anyway.

1212
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Anyway.

1213
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah.

1214
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
So we, we, we got labris because our overcat we had, I guess I'll put a picture of her in

1215
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
chat.

1216
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
She, um, uh, so it's I guess she's holding a little yellow fluffy ball in her mouth.

1217
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Um, she,

1218
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Whoa.

1219
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Umbreon.

1220
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Whoa.

1221
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Did she kill Umbreon?

1222
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah.

1223
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
She pulled off.

1224
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's, it's yellow.

1225
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Exactly.

1226
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Um, she was, so, so we had two cats we had, um,

1227
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Well, but how did her attack stat, her stats must be insane.

1228
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Umbreon is such an incredible wall.

1229
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like it's got such bulk.

1230
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Like how did she do that?

1231
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

1232
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I'm so sorry.

1233
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
She used, uh, she used a track.

1234
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
She's cute.

1235
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Look what a, what a cute Pokemon moves.

1236
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
She, she toxic stalled it.

1237
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Well, with her horrible poisonous, uh, poisonous kitty litter crystals, P crystals.

1238
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
It's true.

1239
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So, um, we had, we got I guess, and we had a cat called Artemis living with us that we

1240
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
gave to my mother-in-law after a while.

1241
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:00,000
But, um, I guess was very, was, was very much trying to like acting in motherly ways towards

1242
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
our other cat who was older.

1243
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
She was always trying to clean her.

1244
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Um, the other cat didn't like it.

1245
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
She didn't like being cleaned.

1246
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Uh, and she would try to fight her.

1247
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah.

1248
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Artemis didn't like being clean.

1249
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
She would fight off.

1250
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
A lot.

1251
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And I guess would just end up like sitting on blankets and just licking the blankets

1252
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
and licking towels and just licking things all the time.

1253
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And we thought she, we need to get her a friend.

1254
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Um, that she can, she can, we need to get a kitten so that she can dot upon them.

1255
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Um, and so we got, we went to a shelter and we thought, well, let's get a boy cat this

1256
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
time.

1257
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And we, we, there was a little black kitten and we were going to call it Mona, uh, named

1258
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
after the fucking cat from persona five.

1259
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I guess.

1260
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
After Lisa.

1261
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I didn't know you were such a persona head.

1262
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Um, I like, I like the persona games.

1263
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I've never played them, but I watched my husband play them and I think they're good.

1264
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Um, I've also, I've never played a, I've never played a persona.

1265
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
They're pretty good.

1266
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Um, but yeah, so we got this black cat called Mona.

1267
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Um, and they're really cute.

1268
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And we grabbed them because when we're at the, at the shelter, it just, it just liked

1269
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
me.

1270
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It was just hugging my leg.

1271
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It was just wrapping its paws around my leg and wouldn't let go.

1272
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And we were like, we'll take this one.

1273
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And it was a mistake.

1274
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It was a big mistake.

1275
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,360
Mona was, we got, we got Mona home and Mona had the sharpest claws of any cat I've ever

1276
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,800
fucking encountered.

1277
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,560
Its claws were out pretty much 24 seven.

1278
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,920
It would just constantly like scratch and scratch like, and it, it wasn't like aggressive.

1279
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,360
It just did it because it just felt like it.

1280
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,760
It would just scratch everything.

1281
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,680
And the other cats were terrified of him and we had to like shut him in the, oh, he would

1282
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,160
even scratch the other cats.

1283
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,160
Yeah.

1284
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,160
He would, he would scratch the cats.

1285
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,160
He would scratch us.

1286
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,160
He would scratch everything.

1287
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,760
And he, he's just playing.

1288
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,760
He's just doing it cause he thinks it's funny.

1289
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,760
Um, he's not even mad.

1290
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,760
That sucks.

1291
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,760
That's the toxic cat behavior.

1292
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,760
Yeah.

1293
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,760
Toxic cat behavior.

1294
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,600
And so we had to shut them like in the bathroom, like in the master like bathroom by our bedroom.

1295
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Cause we couldn't let him out at night cause he would cause too much trouble.

1296
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,600
And we were like, this sucks.

1297
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,160
We hate, we hate that we have to keep him separated from them.

1298
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,840
And every time we'd go in there, he would just be like asleep in the sink.

1299
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,840
He'd be filling up the sink and he was really cute.

1300
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,760
But then like, if we went to the pen and he would just reach out his paw and just fucking

1301
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,560
slice our skin open, like nothing, never had a cat that would do that to that extent.

1302
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,400
Um, after like two weeks, we were just like, I think we have to try and take him back.

1303
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,960
And it was a really hard decision.

1304
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,400
We were like, we really didn't want to, we really tried sticking it out.

1305
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,200
And then like, even after having that fault, we kept him for like another week and then

1306
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,200
it was just so bad and we were like, we just have to, um, and the, the original shelter

1307
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
wouldn't take him back.

1308
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,560
Um, we had to, we had to fucking drive around to like four different shelters and eventually

1309
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,560
we found one that, that took him in cause we're not going to fucking abandon him on

1310
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,200
the side of a road or some shit.

1311
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,000
Um, and then when we got home, we're like, okay, I guess we'll try to find another cat

1312
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,240
because that one just did not mesh.

1313
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,240
It was not good.

1314
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,160
Um, and then we saw a picture of the cat that was, you know, Labyrinth's who I put

1315
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,160
posted earlier.

1316
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:10,640
Um, we saw a picture of her on the shelter website, um, and we're like, she's beautiful.

1317
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,960
She's beautiful, fluffy, fluffy thing.

1318
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,320
She basically looks like our cat, I guess, just way fluffier.

1319
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:23,760
Um, but another family had already like, um, said we're picking her up.

1320
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,800
Um, so like we called the place, we're like, we want to get this cat and they're like,

1321
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,240
oh, well, there's actually another family, um, who's already like said that they want

1322
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,520
her and they're going to come around and pick her up.

1323
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,680
But if they don't show up, then you can have her and we're like, oh, shit, there's no way

1324
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,480
they're not going to show up.

1325
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:45,600
And then they didn't, um, that other family just never can, they just, for like, for

1326
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,400
like five, like five days after the, that they have a family was supposed to pick up

1327
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
the cat.

1328
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,400
Apparently they tried calling that family.

1329
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,400
They just couldn't get to them.

1330
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,120
They were like, okay, I guess you can have her.

1331
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,320
Um, and then we brought her home and immediately.

1332
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,160
The complete opposite of Mona, they, they became best friends.

1333
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,440
Um, like I guess we didn't need to clean the blanket anymore.

1334
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,640
I guess just like within like five minutes of them saying hello to each other.

1335
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,040
I guess was cleaning her and being all sweet and then they were cuddling.

1336
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,760
Um, it was wonderful and unlike fucking scratched up everything.

1337
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,160
Labris has never scratched me once.

1338
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,240
Every time I've interacted with her, she never, she always has her claws retracted.

1339
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,960
Every time she bats at me or swipes at me, it's just soft little whiffle things.

1340
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,240
There's, there's her claws are never out.

1341
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,560
Um, and we've had, it's been, we've had her for about two years now and she's

1342
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,560
been the nicest, uh, sweetest thing.

1343
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,920
She is just a little bit retarded.

1344
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:48,200
Um, and all cats are to be fair, but she's like, she, she has certain spots around

1345
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,160
the house where she'll just sit and look at the ceiling and scream.

1346
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,000
Um, and it's always the same free location.

1347
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,040
She'll just sit there and scream at the walls and I don't know why.

1348
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,760
Um, but aside from that, probably a problem with the walls.

1349
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,960
Yeah, you know, cat, cat's no.

1350
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,280
Yeah.

1351
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,520
She's always making crazy faces to, uh, putting a GIF in chat.

1352
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,520
You can see you in the background, her head's just spinning all over the place.

1353
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,240
That's what she does.

1354
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,280
Uh, she's very silly, um, but very sweet.

1355
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:21,920
I really like that when, when, when, when a cat is like play fighting with you,

1356
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:28,880
they're friends, the friends, like, uh, cause, uh, my cat Luna, uh, she sometimes

1357
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,360
gets the claws out, but not to like fight.

1358
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,840
She'll like have the claws out, but not like scrape them.

1359
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,880
She'd be like, Bap me when I'm like tickling her in an annoying way.

1360
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,880
And she's like, protect, she gets her mouth around my finger, but she doesn't bite

1361
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,160
down.

1362
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,120
She just sort of like, yeah, imitates like, this is what I would do if I were to bite

1363
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,400
you, but I love you actually.

1364
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,920
Yeah, she's like that.

1365
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,320
That's pretty nice.

1366
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,440
That's pretty nice cat behavior.

1367
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,720
It's too bad all cats aren't like that.

1368
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:57,720
Yeah.

1369
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,120
What a shame.

1370
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:12,640
Well, oh, well, well, oh, well, oh, well, like I always say, I don't know what I

1371
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,320
always say.

1372
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,280
Okay, nevermind, sorry.

1373
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,280
I always, I always find difficult to find the words and that's what I always say.

1374
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,720
Oh, speaking of, I'd better do that fucking wordle.

1375
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,760
I haven't done it today.

1376
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,080
Oh, I got it.

1377
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,880
I lost.

1378
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,480
Oh, yeah, I had my first I had my first lose on wordle.

1379
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,880
My streak of 100 percent success has been ruined.

1380
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,600
I lost one because I actually forgot to do wordle that day, but I saw your tweet

1381
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,040
about it.

1382
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,280
Do you do you guys do any any wordle alternatives?

1383
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:55,960
I do wordle, which is yeah, which is it shows the silhouette of a country or

1384
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,400
province or something.

1385
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:03,200
And and they you have to guess where on earth it is.

1386
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,600
And for the last few days, though, it's been very difficult.

1387
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:15,520
I think the last one I did was like a an island that has nothing on it, which is

1388
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,800
like a few kilometers like north of Antarctica, which is owned by Denmark.

1389
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,600
And it's like my first guess was a country near the bottom of Africa, which is

1390
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,640
the closest I got.

1391
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,800
And I'm like, it's the same shape as like Lesotho, which is like a little

1392
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,720
country, I think, within South Africa.

1393
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,800
Yeah, I'm like, that was my first guess.

1394
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,920
It was wrong.

1395
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,080
Go south.

1396
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,720
And I'm like, it's the south point of Africa.

1397
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,960
The hell is south of that?

1398
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,800
So sometimes it's just so obscure, you'd never get it.

1399
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,960
But it's so fun because like you can be like, I don't feel like stupid for not

1400
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,600
knowing that very obscure island that has nothing on it.

1401
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,960
I I tried to do I tried to do hurdle.

1402
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,080
You tried hurdle where you've heard sheep.

1403
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,000
I know I hate it.

1404
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,520
It's it's about identifying a song and it'll have like, oh, it'll have it'll

1405
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,200
play you like the first like second of a song.

1406
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,800
And then you try to get it has like a list.

1407
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,840
Like every time it generates a list of like some amount of songs that it could be.

1408
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,960
So it's not like you just you're just guessing from every song in existence.

1409
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,160
You're guessing from a list, but it's like a big list.

1410
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,480
Like you can't like look at the entire list, but there is like a limited

1411
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,760
list of things it could be.

1412
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,760
And you got to try to guess it.

1413
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,720
And then if you don't get which one, then it plays you a little more of the

1414
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,040
song and then you do it again.

1415
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,560
I it sucked.

1416
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,840
I didn't like it.

1417
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,280
And I was completely listen.

1418
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,520
I don't listen to music that other people listen to.

1419
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,360
So I would never know.

1420
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,800
Yeah, it was completely hopeless at it.

1421
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,120
So and I was like, this is not the kind of thing I'd be good at.

1422
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,720
No, my favorite might by far my favorite word alternative is Squirtle.

1423
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,280
You've played Squirtle.

1424
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,040
I haven't played that one.

1425
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,720
No, Squirtle.

1426
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,560
It's it's a guessing Pokemon.

1427
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,880
And oh, well, well, yeah.

1428
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:15,160
You guess you guess they're they're well, you guess a Pokemon and then it will

1429
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,280
tell you like their generation.

1430
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,320
Is it did you get the right generation or is it a higher generation, lower

1431
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,160
generation, their types?

1432
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,600
Did you get their types right and then and then their height, their height and

1433
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,760
weight, like is it is it taller or shorter and is it heavier or lighter?

1434
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,320
And you get eight guesses to get the correct mon.

1435
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,040
And I've done it a few times now.

1436
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,880
You start with nothing.

1437
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,800
Then you just put in a Pokemon and they'll tell you whether

1438
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,720
you're on the right track on some things or other.

1439
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,080
Yeah, yeah.

1440
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,280
Like, hold on.

1441
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,040
Today, I guess I guess.

1442
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,960
Well, what if I want to play it?

1443
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,600
Or no, no, no.

1444
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,280
OK, yesterday, yesterday, I guess I guess shinks and it was like.

1445
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,600
And it was like, no, that's not not the generation lower or whatever.

1446
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,440
And then, you know, it's like, no, neither of the types were right.

1447
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,760
OK, and it's bigger and it's heavier.

1448
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,440
And then you just go.

1449
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,360
It's a good it's a great one.

1450
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,360
I like it a lot.

1451
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,400
I want to try that one.

1452
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,120
That sounds fun.

1453
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:16,760
Yeah.

1454
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,320
But like the thing I don't like about Wordle

1455
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,640
is the reason I lost was like the nightmare scenario where

1456
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,320
I knew four of the five letters very early on.

1457
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:31,040
And then because I was playing hard mode, I can't narrow it down.

1458
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,440
OK, yeah. Subsequent guesses on hard one.

1459
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,440
You can get completely fucked like that.

1460
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,600
Yeah, like I my first guess was torch and it was like C.H.

1461
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:43,000
To the end was like, OK, how about hatch because there was a T.

1462
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,720
And it was like, OK, hatch is a T C H.

1463
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,440
So OK, hatch latch.

1464
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,680
No, batch catch match.

1465
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1466
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,800
It was watch and I lost.

1467
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,480
I was like, that's that was that blows.

1468
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,640
I wasn't stupid.

1469
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,240
The game's bad.

1470
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,840
And then I will never play it again ever.

1471
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,880
That's a that's a.

1472
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,080
That's like one of those mind sweeper situations, right?

1473
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,840
When it's like, OK, there's like an equal.

1474
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,520
You get down to the last couple of choices

1475
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,920
and there's like an equal chance that the mind is in like one or the other.

1476
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
Yeah. And you just you just got to guess.

1477
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,840
Like it could be any of those consonants.

1478
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,480
There's too many words that end like that.

1479
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:29,240
Yeah, there's there's one where I forget that happened like a few weeks ago.

1480
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,240
But I was lucky enough to get it.

1481
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,320
But like the word that I had four of the letters.

1482
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,880
Correct. I was just missing one letter and it turned out

1483
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:41,520
there were like seven words it could be just by changing the one letter.

1484
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,280
If you're if you're not on hard mode, you can you can just you can just guess

1485
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,480
like another word that has those letters in them to eliminate them.

1486
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,080
But if you are playing on hard mode, there's just nothing you can do.

1487
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,440
I'm not playing on hard mode, but I treat it like hard mode.

1488
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,480
I I always like everybody does that.

1489
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,840
And I don't know why.

1490
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
Just play on hard mode.

1491
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,560
If you're going to because I'm you might as well get that star.

1492
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,800
I feel like I'm oh, yeah, you're right.

1493
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,040
I should just play on hard mode.

1494
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,000
I don't know how to switch to hard mode.

1495
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,360
There's a little thing at the top.

1496
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,360
Let's say there you go.

1497
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,640
I turned it on.

1498
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,200
Hell, yeah.

1499
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:19,640
I just realized that I had lost like I hadn't lost before.

1500
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,320
And my my score was like 100 percent success rate.

1501
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,520
But I had missed my streak one or two days.

1502
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,080
So I really should have like once I realized that it was probably I was going to lose.

1503
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,840
I should just not done it for that day.

1504
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,520
And then my my my my my my my statistics would have been perfect forever.

1505
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,680
But what's the because now that it says it says 98 percent.

1506
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,240
And I'm like, there's no way I can get it back to 100.

1507
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,480
This game is permanently tarnished.

1508
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,520
You have you have to you have to play.

1509
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,520
You have to win a hundred and ninety nine times so that the ninety nine

1510
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,760
point five percent rounds up to a hundred.

1511
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,560
It's the only way.

1512
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,760
I wonder if that actually does work.

1513
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,760
I don't know.

1514
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,560
I don't know.

1515
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,280
I don't know. Nobody knows.

1516
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,000
Some there's some.

1517
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,320
Yeah, sometimes they don't round up to a hundred unless it's actually a hundred.

1518
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,480
They'll never give you that last percentage unless it's everything.

1519
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,560
That's how video.

1520
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,240
The New York completion is a New York Times is going to stiff you like that.

1521
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,200
I bet the New York Times is going to buy your game for a million dollars.

1522
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,080
I fucking hate New York.

1523
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,680
New York.

1524
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,480
Fuck New York.

1525
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:27,360
I wear a shirt that says I like like upside down heart New York.

1526
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,640
A spades of love spades.

1527
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,440
You got to go with spades.

1528
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,080
New York.

1529
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,160
Yeah, I'm Kaleigh Kalyganis.

1530
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,360
What was wrong with the old?

1531
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,320
What was wrong with the old York?

1532
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,040
Small, I guess.

1533
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,920
You're asking me this.

1534
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,320
It's town in the UK.

1535
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,120
It's just like this is nice.

1536
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,440
Yeah, good enough space for giant buildings, though.

1537
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,160
Kalyganis is like it's like you hate each other, but you also like respect

1538
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,480
one another as like rivals.

1539
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,200
So yeah, yeah, it's a bit it's a bit different, I guess.

1540
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,720
Oh, well, that's the best I got.

1541
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,760
Damn, I start New York.

1542
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,800
Let's see if I have anything else on my stupid topic list.

1543
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,960
Oh, I bought the Ukraine bundle for from itch.

1544
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,120
Honestly, honestly, just just because of the value, incredible value.

1545
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,080
I was I was I saw.

1546
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,640
Kingdom two, I saw that it had Kingdom two on it.

1547
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,520
Oh, yeah, I played Kingdom.

1548
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,640
I liked the original Kingdom and I didn't even know there was a sequel,

1549
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,960
but I saw oh, there's a Kingdom two.

1550
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,920
Oh, and it's on the Ukraine bundle.

1551
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,720
Oh, and it normally costs $15, but the entire Ukraine bundle costs 10.

1552
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,560
Well, what else am I going to do?

1553
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,640
So I was like, well, obviously, I have to buy the Ukraine bundle.

1554
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,920
So you're losing money by not doing it, basically.

1555
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,440
And, you know, obviously, and, you know, obviously,

1556
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,680
I support Russia's right to self-determination

1557
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:04,360
and I support their their action against the imperialist United States and NATO.

1558
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,480
But, you know, that bundle, though, but that bundle, though,

1559
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,800
I had to I had to sell out to sell out Putin, my man, Putin.

1560
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,240
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

1561
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,520
Yeah, did you see the the video?

1562
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,880
A guy was filming out his window at a tank and the tank, like,

1563
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,640
shot at the guy filming and it exploded right in front of his face.

1564
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,800
And oh, God, I I did see that.

1565
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,920
I did not. No, I didn't see it.

1566
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,000
It wasn't like right in front of his face, but like right below the window.

1567
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,320
You see the tank coming up, facing him.

1568
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,800
And then the thing, the barrel goes up a bit and it shoots.

1569
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,160
And I think in that, it's like it bounces off of the ground.

1570
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,960
So it wasn't shooting up at the guy in the window, but it bounces off the ground.

1571
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,360
People say it bounces off the ground.

1572
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,640
I think they're mis-free in the video.

1573
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,680
It's actually just clipping of the branch on a tree

1574
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,000
because you see the branch actually

1575
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,520
starting to fall when the bullet like slices through.

1576
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,600
Maybe it's a different one we're thinking of.

1577
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:07,040
I distinctly remember seeing like a thing where it like it it ricochets off

1578
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,440
and then hits the building in front of the guy in the window.

1579
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,640
And he keeps filming.

1580
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,200
He doesn't move out the way entirely.

1581
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,080
No, we're trying the same video because I saw Vosh were acting

1582
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,680
and he was saying, oh, look, you see it bounce.

1583
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,960
And I looked at it and I'm like, no, it's actually slicing through the tree.

1584
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,760
Oh, God.

1585
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,160
Oh, we just zoomed out casually.

1586
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,720
That would be so terrifying, you know, having seen an explosion happen

1587
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,560
and the dust is there and you don't know whether they're about to like fire

1588
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,760
right at you because you can't see anything.

1589
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,200
I'm going to come back for more.

1590
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:44,600
Oh, I guess you reminded me that I'm mad about I'm mad at Vosh.

1591
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,360
I really fucking hate Vosh this week.

1592
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,120
I really think his I really think his stupid J.K.

1593
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,280
Rowling thing was like really embarrassing.

1594
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,320
What was embarrassing?

1595
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,560
Why is it embarrassing?

1596
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,560
Because because he looked because J.K.

1597
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,080
Rowling is a devil and but he looks like a bad guy.

1598
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,040
He looks like the bad guy because he's like.

1599
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,080
He said women shut up.

1600
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,560
She she she retweeted the reason why she retweeted him was

1601
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,920
because he had already made himself look like the bad guy.

1602
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,800
And he was an easy dunk and it worked.

1603
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,800
And I just have I just like what is the point?

1604
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,360
What is the point of a debate, bro?

1605
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,280
Who makes our side look bad and embarrasses us?

1606
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,960
You know, like, like, is this that's not what we pay you for?

1607
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,840
That's not what you're supposed to do.

1608
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,760
You fucked up.

1609
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,360
I'm really really it actually really irritates me.

1610
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,920
I don't agree because it's just a tweet that like when you when you tweet out

1611
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,040
a dumb joke like that and people

1612
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,400
all over the left make those sorts of jokes all the time.

1613
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,920
You don't know that J.K.

1614
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,520
Rowling was going to retweet it ahead of time.

1615
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,000
Like if he'd known that was going to be the case, he probably wouldn't have done that.

1616
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:56,920
It's not like he.

1617
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,000
I am well, I guess and then made the joke.

1618
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,960
It just kind of I mean, and also I know he didn't.

1619
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,880
I know he didn't know she would retweet it, but.

1620
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,160
And also I don't know it's all the other things

1621
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,360
that people bring up with Vosh is like nothing compared to everything else,

1622
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,040
in my opinion.

1623
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,920
So I did.

1624
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,920
I did see his like response to the backlash of that.

1625
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,480
And he's he's he's he's just doubling down on it.

1626
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,320
Like, it's bad.

1627
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,720
Like, I think he's handling it wrong.

1628
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,040
He had a point in the like.

1629
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,600
Like, oh, God, trying to remember what he said, because it was like, it was like,

1630
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:43,480
yeah, I guess I can see where you're coming from that like.

1631
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,320
She.

1632
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,760
Fuck, God, it was a good point.

1633
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,640
And I kind of agreed with it.

1634
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,640
I can't remember what he said.

1635
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:57,240
I, you know, it's like he he he he made like a a sexist comment.

1636
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:03,040
And I think no, no, I can't remember it.

1637
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,720
I can't remember it.

1638
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,680
So it's not like a good idea for me to try and like paraphrase.

1639
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:15,320
I'm just like, fuck, you know, like, like, like my mom, my mom is a big Harry Potter fan,

1640
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:24,080
does not have certainly does not have like a nuanced take on like trans people or whatever,

1641
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,880
unlike, you know, gender ideology.

1642
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:32,080
I imagine someone like her seeing J.K. Rowling pointing at Vosh and being like,

1643
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,600
this this guy thinks women should shut up.

1644
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:42,920
And it's just like, it looks bad, you've failed, you fucking failed to do what you're supposed to do.

1645
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,360
And and it bugs me and I'm upset.

1646
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,920
I wish he hadn't done it.

1647
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,800
It's not like it's not like.

1648
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,960
I guess it's it's hard to know how how much it like.

1649
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:09,360
It actually hurts trans rights, I guess, like the the idea is like moderate people who like,

1650
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,600
they know who J.K. Rowling is and they don't really know what trends rights are.

1651
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,880
They wouldn't immediately understand that what she says is like transphobic or bigoted.

1652
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:28,720
No, but they will definitely see that what Vosh said is is is mean and like sexist.

1653
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,040
Right.

1654
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,200
It's like, I guess they would feel that way.

1655
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,800
I just don't know, God, why do I hate that I don't remember?

1656
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,640
I don't want to go watch his video right now to figure it out.

1657
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,560
Yeah, whatever.

1658
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,800
I noticed stupid.

1659
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:50,160
I noticed people on the left, like when and I got this reaction from Spork and then later

1660
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,000
saw other people memeing about it, that if if he had said white women shut up,

1661
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,720
then people on the left wouldn't be man.

1662
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,440
But I feel like people on the right would just be like, oh, well, now it's also racist, too.

1663
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,640
I guess, like, I don't know.

1664
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,240
I don't know.

1665
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:15,160
I guess the only the only solution is to just never make those kinds of jokes at all

1666
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,160
because you might get screen shot at, I suppose.

1667
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:24,600
No, I think it's I think it's like, I kind of I kind of I kind of don't think it was

1668
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,560
like a comment that was made in very good taste.

1669
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,840
Like, I don't think it was very funny.

1670
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
I don't think it's I don't think it's a good joke.

1671
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,240
Just be like women should shut up.

1672
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,080
Ha, isn't it funny that I said that?

1673
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,000
Like, not really.

1674
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,920
Well, you said shut up challenge.

1675
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,360
It sounds like a YouTube title.

1676
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:44,680
And no, oh, he said the joke was because it was International Women's Day

1677
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:48,200
and J.K. Rowling was making like transphobic tweets at the time.

1678
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,640
Like I said, you know, women like not trans people, that sort of stuff.

1679
01:25:53,240 --> 01:26:00,000
Um, and Vosh was like doing the opposite of like the the the phrase.

1680
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,320
It's like, listen to women.

1681
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:06,600
Um, it was like, it was like women speak up and he's like, how more like

1682
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,520
women, shut up.

1683
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,240
La Mal, women shut up.

1684
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:14,560
If, you know, and then he went on to be like, uh, you're crying about this

1685
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,920
when you're a billionaire trying to remove the rights of trans people.

1686
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:19,720
Yeah, I know.

1687
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,960
And and it's all like.

1688
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:22,280
Yeah.

1689
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,960
I can see, I can see there's two sides to it.

1690
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,240
And I forget what he said.

1691
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,640
I mean, obviously, I mean, obviously I agree with Vosh's position.

1692
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:35,520
I just think rhetorically he made a big error.

1693
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:40,080
He made a big, he made a big costly error and he isn't even sorry about it.

1694
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,080
And that makes me mad.

1695
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,720
Okay, I'm upset.

1696
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,480
And what are you going to do about it?

1697
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,560
No, you're trying to fight me about it and I'm going to fight you back.

1698
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,240
Ah, whatever.

1699
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,680
I'm only just throw down for Valhush.

1700
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:53,520
Yeah.

1701
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,160
I'll figure it out.

1702
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,800
I'll figure out what he said.

1703
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,000
And because it was something about like how optics, like if you, if you

1704
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:09,720
constantly care so much about optics, then something is bad.

1705
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,680
But I forget why.

1706
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,360
I don't really know exactly what he said.

1707
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:20,200
I'm mad at him because I, I see, I see people over the place making those sorts

1708
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,880
of jokes all the time and we laugh at them and we think they're funny when.

1709
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,280
I don't know if I do.

1710
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,200
I don't really think that his joke was very funny.

1711
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,040
So I don't, I don't know.

1712
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,360
I just, it doesn't get.

1713
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,960
I mean, do you think it's not funny because of the potential?

1714
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,920
I'm not, I'm not offended.

1715
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,280
I'm not offended about it and I'm not like, oh, if you say this, people are

1716
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,320
going to, people are going to, I don't know.

1717
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,560
It's just, it's just not, it's just not very compelling.

1718
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,840
Just be like, oh, well, you see, I said that.

1719
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,560
Yes, I did say women should shut up.

1720
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,720
But you see the joke was that I, I don't actually mean it.

1721
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,080
I mean, I don't, I just said it when I don't mean it.

1722
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,200
Oops.

1723
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,120
Well, it wasn't as simplistic.

1724
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,760
That's why I said it was like, I don't want to see, when I see the phrase

1725
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:16,400
for women, when I say a woman shut up challenge, that just immediately

1726
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:22,120
reads to me as like, it's obviously a joke, like directed at her specific.

1727
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:26,440
I know that because I know who Vosh is even not knowing who Vosh is.

1728
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,960
Like the word challenge being in there just makes it sound like some dumb,

1729
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,600
like free AM YouTube challenge, like title thing.

1730
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,600
Like it's, it's clearly.

1731
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,120
Just anyone who's, you know, my, my, my, my mom's not, my mom's not going to think that.

1732
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:42,600
I.

1733
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,920
I guess, would she, would she understand any of the other points Vosh made?

1734
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,800
No, regardless.

1735
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,400
No.

1736
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:57,360
And if Vosh hadn't said that, it wouldn't have been screen-shotted and

1737
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,040
never would have even happened anyway.

1738
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,200
And she would have found some random trans person.

1739
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,640
Well, it kind of just seems to me like.

1740
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,120
Well, it kind of seems to me like Vosh making, you know, he's, he's just

1741
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,280
making these deliberately inflammatory comments kind of being, you know, just,

1742
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:17,360
just a little bit shitty, just a, just a touch little shitty, just, just for fun,

1743
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,680
just for fun and profit.

1744
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,880
And then, you know, and then, you know, J.K.

1745
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,800
can see, can see him doing this and be like, aha, I'll make an example of him.

1746
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,680
I'll show how my enemies are so evil and cruel.

1747
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,360
I think part of his thing was like, she would have done that to anyone.

1748
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:40,840
Because she's looking for someone to like scapegoat as like, this is why

1749
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,320
trans people don't deserve rights.

1750
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,840
Look at this annoying mean person who was mean to me.

1751
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,000
They hate women.

1752
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,960
Because people say that to her all the time because they hate her, because of

1753
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,600
course they do.

1754
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:58,280
And I think his justification for that is that he can take, like, people getting

1755
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,600
mad at him because of this.

1756
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,160
And he's not a small creator that would be like bullied by J.K.

1757
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,360
But, but that's not a good example.

1758
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,800
That's not a good, like, I guess it's not a good argument for doing it in the

1759
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,440
first place.

1760
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,200
I don't care what happens to Vosch.

1761
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,720
I just think it was, I just think it's embarrassing.

1762
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,320
I feel, I feel embarrassed.

1763
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,120
That's, that's it.

1764
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,440
I, I don't.

1765
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:26,440
But then again, I've heard so many worse jokes on the PCP itself.

1766
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,400
Maybe not recently, but.

1767
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,440
Well, it's, it's.

1768
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:36,520
The point, the point is that it, the point is that it's, it's when J.K.

1769
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:41,280
Rowling says it, people listen, you know, that's, that's the difference that

1770
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,200
people will hear it and see it.

1771
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,120
Uh, this is a, she, like what she says is important as much as I wish that

1772
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,080
weren't the case.

1773
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,040
I mean, that's true.

1774
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,440
I just feel like I'm not sure how, like, this is like a tipping point for

1775
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,400
anything in particular.

1776
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,280
I feel people who follow J.K.

1777
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,000
Rowling on this topic, um, are already transphobic anyway, because they've

1778
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,080
already been listening to it.

1779
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,320
I don't, I don't know if that's true.

1780
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:15,760
I feel like there's a swath of people who just don't have a nuance take on

1781
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,360
this issue and they could, and they like J.K.

1782
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,880
because they don't understand.

1783
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:26,000
And maybe they could be persuaded and that's not what happened.

1784
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,840
The opposite of that occurred.

1785
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,240
This time.

1786
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:36,160
The people who, it's, it's, I really hate the concern trolling aspect of

1787
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:40,120
from like J.K., like, because it's the biggest annoyance is it's like, oh, no,

1788
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,800
I love trans people.

1789
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,920
I love them.

1790
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,240
I support them.

1791
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,680
I just think that don't do, I think it's a little bit.

1792
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,120
I support, I support that you want children to have healthcare.

1793
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,720
Isn't that groomer behavior?

1794
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:58,360
I support them as long as they don't get anything and, and, and they, and I

1795
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,720
would rather them kill themselves.

1796
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:04,280
I'd rather these men, these men stay out of our spaces.

1797
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:08,040
I'm going to call them men constantly and deny them healthcare.

1798
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:12,840
And, you know, maybe it's okay that in America, like, um, there are certain areas

1799
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,360
where like they're going to check your genitals if you're a kid to, to make sure

1800
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,160
that you're the right gender because we don't like pedophilia.

1801
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,680
That's where we're going to touch children.

1802
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:24,760
We don't like pedophiles, we definitely don't like pedophiles here.

1803
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,160
Uh, but, uh, yeah.

1804
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:31,560
We'll support legislation that allows adults to, to, we have, we have, we have to,

1805
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,200
we have to, we need, we need to have, we need to have teachers, uh, patting down

1806
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,440
our kids in schools before they use the restroom.

1807
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,880
We need to have them checking their genitals on the regular to stamp out pedophilia.

1808
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,240
Of course.

1809
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:51,000
Yeah, I think it's just my, my takeaway from that whole thing is that it's a net

1810
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,800
like neutral.

1811
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,000
I don't think the world has ended because of Vorsch.

1812
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,240
I didn't say the world has ended.

1813
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,320
I just think it was embarrassing.

1814
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:00,680
Sure.

1815
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,120
I don't, I don't, all right.

1816
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:06,680
I will not speak so exaggeratingly, but like, I feel like it's a net neutral.

1817
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,440
I feel like it's just sort of like, yeah, whatever.

1818
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,720
I think it was bad.

1819
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:13,480
It's kind of amusing that it happened to Vorsch and that he got on fucking,

1820
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,160
like news articles written about him.

1821
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:18,120
Well, I don't like it.

1822
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:22,840
I don't like it because I see it as, I see it as a, I see it as him acting out

1823
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,680
and being rewarded for bad behavior.

1824
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,520
That's what it, that's what it seems like to me.

1825
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,680
Ah, sure.

1826
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,080
I mean, it was, it was, it was a dumb tweet, I guess.

1827
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,000
I just don't, I don't care.

1828
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:37,640
Fine.

1829
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,080
All right.

1830
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,760
Well, that was what was grinding my gears this week.

1831
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,440
And that's the last thing on my stupid list of topics.

1832
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,840
My, my gears are neither grinded or they're just, they're just still.

1833
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,400
They're neither ground nor on ground.

1834
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,880
They're perfectly clean, unused.

1835
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:00,920
They're, they're unfunctioning.

1836
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,320
No one ever switched for power on.

1837
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,080
I, I have like only like one topic.

1838
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,120
I mean, I've been wanting to come on for like a couple of weeks to talk about something.

1839
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:14,520
Because things kept delaying me, I forgot what it was.

1840
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,280
So instead I'm going to ask, I'm going to, this was a meme like a few days ago.

1841
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,400
Maybe it's already died down.

1842
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,440
Maybe you've already had this conversation and if not, we'll just skip it.

1843
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:27,320
But are there more doors or wheels in the world, in your opinion?

1844
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,120
Are there more doors or wheels?

1845
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,240
Doors.

1846
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,680
Why do you say, I think it's wheels.

1847
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:44,680
I would say doors because a single building can have many doors inside.

1848
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,800
And I feel like there are more buildings than there are cars,

1849
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,440
even though there are a lot of cars.

1850
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:56,200
But it's not because some places don't have cars and like in a big city,

1851
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,680
like a skyscraper would have maybe even thousands of doors in it.

1852
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,560
And like how many cars take up that real estate on the ground?

1853
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,760
I mean, cars have cars have cars have cars have doors.

1854
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,520
But, but here's the thing.

1855
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,560
They do also have doors.

1856
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,560
Sometimes they have as many doors as they have wheels.

1857
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,000
Ah, but.

1858
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:14,760
Or maybe even more.

1859
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,000
They could have five because there's the boot.

1860
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,040
Yeah, but there's usually a spare tire in there too, though.

1861
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,680
So, yeah, you got it.

1862
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,840
You don't forget about the spare tire.

1863
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,680
I'm on team wheels because see, my argument was the same as yours at first

1864
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,640
until my husband, Kai, won me over.

1865
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,600
He explained, well, yes, but there's like wheels and a lot of things.

1866
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,640
You're sitting on a chair.

1867
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,080
How many wheels does your chair have?

1868
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,040
My chair has five wheels, for example.

1869
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,720
An office building, a big tall skyscraper probably has hundreds of office chairs

1870
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,920
that have five wheels each.

1871
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,440
So, that's that building might actually have more wheels.

1872
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,240
A grocery store, so many shopping carts, that's full of wheels.

1873
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:55,800
So, okay.

1874
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,160
A hospital, hospital beds.

1875
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:03,480
Yeah, a building can potentially contain like so many different things that have wheels.

1876
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,840
Yeah, a wheel has to be, you know, circular, spins around,

1877
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,040
and it can roll on the ground like transport something.

1878
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,120
Okay, does it have to roll on the ground because that makes a difference?

1879
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,560
See, that's an intention because like if it doesn't have to roll along the ground,

1880
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:25,640
then if you have like a chest of drawers, those have wheels in them as well.

1881
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,640
Yeah.

1882
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:33,640
So, like my dresser has five drawers and each drawer has four wheels.

1883
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:38,920
Me and my husband counted up my bedroom and we realized that there's like 50 wheels in that one

1884
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:39,000
room.

1885
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,680
A piece of machinery, like yeah, like that.

1886
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,680
It's not a wheel for rolling a thing around, but it is a wheel.

1887
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,800
Yeah, it really is.

1888
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,920
We're not interested to count those like influence the answer, but I think wheels went either way.

1889
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,200
Okay, but what is a door then?

1890
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,240
How would you define door?

1891
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,720
A thing with hinges that opens?

1892
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,680
It doesn't have to have hinges, sliding doors or a thing.

1893
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:11,480
I think it's like an archway that humans can pass through that can also close and like seal itself.

1894
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:17,160
Okay, so that's very much like more restrictive than the wheel definition, I feel like.

1895
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:22,440
Because if wheels can include like the things inside drawers, then I feel like doors should

1896
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:27,240
be able to include latches and hatches and little openable things.

1897
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,200
Oh yeah, that's right.

1898
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,800
I think it has to have a hinge.

1899
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,640
I think having a hinge is required.

1900
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,080
But then sliding doors on a hinge.

1901
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:36,200
But then sliding doors, those are definitely doors.

1902
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,000
So like this is more complicated than-

1903
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:43,480
A portal for which you can put human through and close.

1904
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,000
But why human?

1905
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,280
Is a doggy door a door?

1906
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,400
True, actually you're right.

1907
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,360
Doggy door should be a door.

1908
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,040
Why are the doors on a cupboard not a door, you know?

1909
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,320
I guess, I mean, some people do count cupboards.

1910
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:01,960
I feel like if you're counting like the wheels in a drawer, you should count cupboards as well.

1911
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:10,440
But then it's like, I don't know, like I try to like restrict wheels to be like things that

1912
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,800
have to like roll on the ground.

1913
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,960
Okay, so all right.

1914
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:21,720
But then you can count hot wheels and there's half a billion of O's made a year,

1915
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,640
that's two billion wheels every year.

1916
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:24,680
Yeah.

1917
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:29,800
All right, I'm team door for no other reason than to be an alternative on this podcast.

1918
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:35,720
I think the more I think about it, the more just like things that have wheels,

1919
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,000
there actually are when you really just get right down to it.

1920
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,080
I would posit this definition for door, all right?

1921
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:52,200
A flat plane which can be moved in order to access the other side of a thing.

1922
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,680
So like an open door way is not a door?

1923
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:03,400
No, it needs the flat plane like a doorway, like an arch that then you could like count

1924
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,360
the arches underneath a bridge, they're not doors, they're just arches.

1925
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,200
I think a door would be if you put a flat plane on the bottom of a bridge archway and then you

1926
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,440
could move it around to open it and close it.

1927
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,640
Is a gate the door?

1928
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:21,720
I think a door is a more architecturally like complicated object than a wheel,

1929
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,080
just that it's baseline.

1930
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,480
I feel like it's it's that they're harder to produce.

1931
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:32,680
And therefore, sociologically speaking, there must therefore be fewer of them.

1932
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:39,640
Although I think now that I'm saying that a lid is different from a door,

1933
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,000
but it's also a flat plane that you can move to access the inside of something.

1934
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:54,360
And our CD's wheels are our hard drive disc wheels.

1935
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:59,800
We go with no because while they do rotate, they don't roll.

1936
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,640
They rotate, but they don't roll.

1937
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,520
Oh my god, what's the difference between those two things?

1938
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:12,600
They have to roll as the function of the like you can put a circular thing around

1939
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,160
an axle.

1940
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:17,080
You're not going to call a coin a wheel because it rolls.

1941
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,240
It has to like roll on an axle.

1942
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:24,920
On an axle for the purpose of like bearing loads or transportation.

1943
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,200
I'd just say transportation.

1944
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,320
Okay, I see.

1945
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:35,160
So to to roll, okay, rolling is a rotation that causes motion with contact with a thing with

1946
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,320
friction to move something.

1947
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:44,440
Yeah, either a draw outwards along like a floor, which is like the inside little

1948
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,760
metal thing of the of the draw.

1949
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,760
That's the floor of that wheel.

1950
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,400
That's and that's rolling along that that track.

1951
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,400
A train has wheels.

1952
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,920
They roll along a track.

1953
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:55,640
That's obvious.

1954
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,840
A shopping trolley.

1955
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,960
The wheels on an office chair, they roll the chair back and forth.

1956
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:00,840
That counts, I think.

1957
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:05,000
But what about the door to the mind?

1958
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,880
What about the door to the mind?

1959
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:10,440
You know what?

1960
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,720
I've forgotten.

1961
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,360
What if something can like really open your eye?

1962
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:14,920
Open your.

1963
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:15,640
How fool is it?

1964
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,920
Wait, are eyelids doors?

1965
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,280
Are eyelids doors come on?

1966
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,080
Just think about this.

1967
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:19,800
Wait, no, no.

1968
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,760
Your eyes, they roll.

1969
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,800
They roll in their sockets.

1970
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,440
They're wheels.

1971
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,520
No, those are the eyeballs.

1972
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,360
The eyelids, those are different.

1973
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,720
You could have ball shaped wheels.

1974
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,200
It's happened.

1975
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,200
Some animals have two sets of eyelids.

1976
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,760
So that's four doors per iguana.

1977
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,320
Per.

1978
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,360
Is your mouth a door?

1979
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,520
Is your.

1980
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:37,320
Are you into four?

1981
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:47,160
When someone is gatekeeping, does that imply the existence of another gate and therefore a door?

1982
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,840
Yeah, it's to stop something going through.

1983
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:51,960
Wait.

1984
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,320
It's a barrier.

1985
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:58,040
So a door is a barrier that can be removed and replaced, usually a flat plane.

1986
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:00,840
Maybe a curved plane.

1987
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:04,040
It's a bread box, a door.

1988
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,000
Does that have a door?

1989
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,360
An oven has a door.

1990
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,000
A refrigerator has a door.

1991
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,640
It could be like a garage door is a door.

1992
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:12,680
Garage door, yeah.

1993
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,880
That's like it can bend.

1994
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:20,680
It can, it can, it can, it has like sheets that like bend at a, at a, what do you call it, a thingy.

1995
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:24,280
An aperture, a large sized aperture can function as a door,

1996
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:26,920
but you also have those in like your camera, you know?

1997
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:27,800
Yeah.

1998
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:29,000
Yeah.

1999
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,160
So, so, so a thing that is made to block, this is, this is fun.

2000
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:38,760
So like a wheel is defined as something that rolls along a surface

2001
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:44,360
for purposes of like bearing a load.

2002
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:48,040
It's, it's to move something, it's to move something other than itself.

2003
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:52,840
Because yeah, like a coin can roll, a rock can roll, but they just roll around.

2004
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,200
They don't, they're not a wheel.

2005
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:58,280
So I think the wheel has to move something else by rolling.

2006
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:03,560
And so a door is a barrier that can be removed and replaced

2007
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:09,640
in some fashion and it's to stop things getting through.

2008
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,280
Wait a minute.

2009
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,720
No, I'm so stupid.

2010
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,920
So an anus could be a door.

2011
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:16,760
I was going to say, wait a minute.

2012
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:17,880
No, the anus is a window.

2013
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:18,840
The anus is a window.

2014
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,880
What's the difference between those things?

2015
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:27,240
Look, I could, when God, when God closes one, he opens the other.

2016
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:29,960
That's the difference.

2017
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,800
I think windows could be doors.

2018
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,840
I think they really could.

2019
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,080
You can classify a window as a door.

2020
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,560
I almost said, wait a minute, bread rolls.

2021
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:42,760
Oh shit.

2022
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,680
So is bread a wheel?

2023
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:50,840
Well, it isn't, it isn't, it transports itself, but it doesn't transport other things.

2024
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,280
Unless you put something inside the bread roll.

2025
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:54,520
Unless you put butter.

2026
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:55,720
So it's transporting butter.

2027
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:59,160
Okay, now we're talking.

2028
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,800
Now we're getting somewhere.

2029
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:07,640
Even with this limitation, I still think the wheels on a Hot Wheels car count as wheels.

2030
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:08,840
They still do their job.

2031
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,200
They're just small.

2032
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,960
Wait, but a Hot Wheels car has doors.

2033
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,640
The doors don't open.

2034
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:13,880
Some of them.

2035
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,960
The doors are like painted on, but they don't actually open.

2036
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,640
Yeah, those aren't mazed to be removed and replaced.

2037
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,800
I think that, oh, what was it?

2038
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,320
I was going to say something.

2039
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,240
Bicycles, roller skates.

2040
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,400
Pockets, pockets of doors.

2041
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,000
When they have like a little thing you can close.

2042
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:33,560
We have a zip.

2043
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,480
A zip tie pocket.

2044
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:39,160
A pocket is a bag or bags doors, I don't know.

2045
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,760
Okay, hold on.

2046
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,000
If you have a school bag, you can zip that up.

2047
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:52,040
I feel like it's funny because you could have like a tarp with a zip for a tent.

2048
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:55,640
And that's a door to the tent, but it is a zip thing.

2049
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,560
So you're not in a bag that's sized for a human.

2050
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,000
You're in a tent and it has a door.

2051
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,720
All right, so I think bags could have doors to the inside of the bag.

2052
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:17,640
As you can see, according to Google Trends, interest over time in doors is consistently higher.

2053
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,200
There are more searches.

2054
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:26,920
Yeah, there's 93 searches a day for doors and only in the 60s for wheels.

2055
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:32,520
So Google Trends, they're both on the rise, by the way, as of recently.

2056
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:37,640
So I think this is a strong indicator in Dora's favor.

2057
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:39,080
They're just more popular.

2058
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,600
And that means there must be more of them.

2059
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,000
They're on people's minds.

2060
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:45,800
Counterargument.

2061
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:46,280
What is this?

2062
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:53,800
In the U.S., this person estimates that 700 million doors are produced per year versus

2063
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,600
like Hot Wheels alone, 2 billion wheels per year.

2064
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,480
That's a pretty big difference.

2065
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,040
Yeah, but I don't know his definition of door.

2066
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,400
He's probably thinking you have to have a human walk through it.

2067
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,160
True, they're probably thinking like doors for houses.

2068
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:09,800
Hold on.

2069
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:13,000
Where does he get his information on the U.S. door market?

2070
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,760
You know, this guy's got Rudolf in his name and that makes me not trust him.

2071
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,560
That sounds like someone who's a bad.

2072
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:25,080
Like Bernie Rudolf, uh, Madoff.

2073
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:27,400
Yeah.

2074
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:27,880
Yeah.

2075
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,200
Yeah.

2076
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:30,360
That's what they call them.

2077
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,400
Nathan Rudolf, Nathan Adolf.

2078
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:34,760
He just removed some letters.

2079
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:42,360
I was going to say Madoff, like Enron, 2008 market crash.

2080
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,160
But yeah, sure.

2081
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,200
What about virtual doors?

2082
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
What about doors in a video game in Zelda?

2083
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,720
You know, Minecraft has zero wheels, but it has no wheels at all.

2084
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:53,880
So many doors.

2085
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,520
But you can make an infinite amount of doors with that game.

2086
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,440
How many villages are in a Minecraft world?

2087
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,360
Does a mine cart not have wheels?

2088
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:01,960
Oh, it does.

2089
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,400
I mean, but that's four.

2090
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,120
There's a boat.

2091
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,960
There's a boat in a mine cart.

2092
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,320
Mine carts just float on the track.

2093
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,560
We don't actually have wheels that are like, you can see.

2094
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:10,920
No way.

2095
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,200
No way.

2096
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:12,680
Is that true?

2097
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:14,360
It's just a square.

2098
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,560
Like there are no wheels.

2099
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,160
I don't even think they're really painted on.

2100
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,400
I mean, is a square wheel still a wheel?

2101
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,600
I have to confirm this.

2102
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:24,520
If it rolls and it moves something, yeah, I would say.

2103
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:26,040
Oh, yeah.

2104
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:26,920
No, there's no wheel.

2105
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,120
There's no wheel on the mine cart.

2106
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:28,680
Holy shit.

2107
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,560
This changes everything.

2108
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:33,080
So there's definitely more doors than mine.

2109
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:39,480
There's sort of an implication of wheels in the sprite, but the 3D model.

2110
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:40,680
No.

2111
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:40,920
Yeah.

2112
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:48,360
If you count wheels, I mean, they appear in mine shafts, but there's like villages.

2113
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,480
Actually, okay.

2114
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:56,280
I actually, I mean, this is the one you can solve with math because let's just assume

2115
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,480
that a mine cart has four wheels.

2116
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:02,360
If I do naturally generate sometimes they're just rare, but they have more wheels per

2117
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:03,880
mine cart than a regular door.

2118
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:10,360
If someone booted up a Minecraft world scanned like, you know, like 10 million

2119
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:15,960
chunks out and counted all the doors and all the wheels and naturally generate,

2120
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,600
which would win.

2121
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,720
That's actually a good question.

2122
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,440
Someone could do that.

2123
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:21,880
I think definitely the doors would win just because of the fact that villages have

2124
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,040
more than one building and all the buildings have doors.

2125
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:25,400
Yeah.

2126
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,360
I feel like villages are about as rare as mine shafts.

2127
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:29,480
It's true.

2128
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,120
Mine shafts only have a couple of mine carts here and there.

2129
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,800
And this fits other wheels in Minecraft.

2130
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,600
I'm not thinking of.

2131
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,280
Sometimes there's a mine shaft that's huge.

2132
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,560
It doesn't have any mine carts.

2133
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:39,080
That's true.

2134
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:42,840
Oh, wait, no, they have mine carts inside chests, don't they?

2135
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:43,560
Oh, yeah.

2136
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:43,880
I mean.

2137
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,960
They never have them spawn randomly outside.

2138
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,280
At least I've never seen that.

2139
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,720
No, there are mine carts with chests that are just sitting around,

2140
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,360
like as entities that are just mine cart chests.

2141
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So it's a mine cart with a chest inside.

2142
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,040
You see those around.

2143
01:48:59,320 --> 01:48:59,960
Wow.

2144
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:03,960
I see on the wiki that you can make one of those.

2145
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:05,560
Fascinating.

2146
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,640
Oh, you can put a furnace in your mine cart?

2147
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,280
You can put a hopper?

2148
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,080
You never tried that?

2149
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:10,040
No.

2150
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:11,880
You can make a little train.

2151
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,800
You can have like a, this is something I used to do way back

2152
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:16,760
where I would have like my base and then I-

2153
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,040
What the hell is the word in?

2154
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,640
What the fuck?

2155
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,400
I think that's a new thing.

2156
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:25,560
It's a new, extremely scary mob that's coming in the game.

2157
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,920
I don't think it's in the game yet.

2158
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,200
It looks insane.

2159
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,720
It's in the game in the experimental snapshot

2160
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,080
that they released two weeks ago.

2161
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,840
I summoned one just on the overworld.

2162
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,320
It wasn't even in a cave and it was actually really scary.

2163
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:42,200
I was really scared because when he's around,

2164
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,640
your vision goes fucking down.

2165
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,760
You can barely see anything.

2166
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,840
That must be why it's a popular page right now because it's new.

2167
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,040
So freaky looking.

2168
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:52,760
Holy shit.

2169
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,000
Yeah.

2170
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,920
You can make like a little furnace mine cart.

2171
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,840
You can put like a bunch of mine carts ahead of it

2172
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:01,480
and fill it with the chest with the stuff.

2173
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,160
And then you put coal in the furnace

2174
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,960
and then it'll go choo-choo and it'll push the other mine carts

2175
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,600
along the track.

2176
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,280
Yeah.

2177
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,640
So you can like have a little train

2178
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,080
deliver your stuff to your base

2179
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,200
while you're doing the other things.

2180
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:13,240
Yeah.

2181
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:14,840
That's kind of cool.

2182
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,760
Powered rails are more reliable though.

2183
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,200
I've heard furnace mine carts are not.

2184
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:18,440
Sure.

2185
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:22,520
I mean this is like before powered rails were even a thing.

2186
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,560
That was the way to do it.

2187
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,400
What about high speed rail?

2188
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,280
What about China?

2189
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:33,400
High speed rail, trash.

2190
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,000
Clearly we need the hyperloop from Elon Musk.

2191
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,200
It's totally not a scam.

2192
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,280
He's totally not going to go to jail

2193
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:43,400
when his investors find out he's been selling vaporware

2194
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:44,520
for the past 10 years.

2195
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:49,960
I agree because car dependency is good

2196
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,680
because the price of gas is so reliable.

2197
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:56,040
It's so much clearly it's more economically efficient

2198
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,480
for instead of having a train like one engine

2199
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,640
that carries like a hundred people

2200
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:04,520
to have a hundred engines that carry one person each.

2201
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,200
Clearly that's more efficient.

2202
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,000
Economies have scaled bad wrong.

2203
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,520
Let's move in the opposite direction.

2204
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,000
Elon Musk is clearly correct.

2205
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:21,720
They just keep hiring new like brain trustees

2206
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:24,760
you know fresh out of Ivy Leagues or whatever

2207
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,200
to be like hey guys think of a new way.

2208
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:31,320
Think of a new way to transport people efficiently.

2209
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:35,560
And they just can't stop reinventing buses and trains.

2210
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,160
They just can't do it any better.

2211
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:41,400
They're desperate but they'll never stop.

2212
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,120
And they're just going to keep doing it and doing it

2213
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:45,720
because they've got to keep pulling in that salary.

2214
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,360
They've got to keep pretending they had a new idea.

2215
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:53,400
I thought of it a window right is a type of door

2216
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,400
that you can also see through.

2217
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:59,000
So not all doors are windows but all windows are doors.

2218
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,040
I feel like if you're not meant to go through the window

2219
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:03,720
then it's a window and not a door.

2220
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,560
What if it's fun to do that though.

2221
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,960
No fun is no there's no room for fun.

2222
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,600
We're here on a fact-finding mission.

2223
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,880
But you're not supposed to go into a cupboard when you open that.

2224
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:21,880
Would that be a window.

2225
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:28,600
If it's got if it's made of glass.

2226
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:31,800
What if you have a glass cupboard.

2227
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:36,600
Shit I do feel I feel like covered doors.

2228
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,560
I feel like I feel like wardrobes and cabinets have doors.

2229
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,800
Actually no not all windows are doors.

2230
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,800
If you can't open the window then it's not a door.

2231
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:51,720
Yes but many windows can be doors because you can open them.

2232
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
I think we.

2233
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:58,600
Game Fury. Game Fury needs to make a video about this clearly.

2234
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:02,120
Is a sandwich a door because it's like an open and close it.

2235
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:03,000
Yeah yeah.

2236
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,600
Do you just want to go to voicemails.

2237
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,680
I think we can all agree the sandwiches are not wheels.

2238
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:13,880
I think we can all.

2239
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,800
So very for they must be doors.

2240
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:16,120
Weak.

2241
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:18,680
They're either one or the other.

2242
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:21,400
It's either on the one I mean wheels and doors.

2243
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,640
They're all they're all in a spectrum right.

2244
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:27,080
And if you're not one you must be closer to being the other.

2245
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:29,320
Are humans doors or wheels.

2246
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:30,120
Wait a minute.

2247
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:35,480
Every door is on the hinges and a hinge rotates and is a wheel inside the door.

2248
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:38,040
Doors contain wheels within them.

2249
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,240
Wheels within wheels.

2250
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,960
I would disagree.

2251
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:44,840
I would say that it is not rolling along a surface.

2252
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:46,120
It is just rolling in place.

2253
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:47,160
It is rotating.

2254
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:56,760
If you take a single wheel and mathematically and you define every radius from its center

2255
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:02,760
geometrically speaking you can divide every wheel into an infinite number of wheels.

2256
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:09,080
Every wheel is composed of an infinite number of infinitely thin geometrically defined wheels.

2257
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:15,240
You know sliding doors are operated by wheels and you might be saying the wheel is rotating

2258
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:17,240
in place and it's moving the door.

2259
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:21,640
Well if you believe in the theory of relativity and you use the door as a reference frame

2260
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,920
the door is standing still.

2261
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:26,360
The wheel is rolling along the door carrying the universe with it.

2262
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:31,000
100% I'm on board with this idea.

2263
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,440
Yes but not all doors are sliding doors and also you could extrapolate

2264
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,720
every possible angle a door could be open at as a different door.

2265
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:43,080
I mean like a phantom door just like you could with a phantom wheels.

2266
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:47,080
All 360 degrees of rotation are possible wheel states.

2267
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:57,960
Does okay I forget whether or not relativity holds true between rotating frames of reference.

2268
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,760
So I'm just going to assume it does and therefore say that based on your frame of reference

2269
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:06,600
there's nothing in the universe that can be ruled out.

2270
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,200
Are orbits wheels.

2271
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:12,360
You can't say anything isn't rotating definitively therefore

2272
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,960
everything is a wheel in one.

2273
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:15,880
No I think at least one reference frame.

2274
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:19,320
I think you could say that no no no no no no.

2275
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:20,760
Orbits are not wheels.

2276
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,720
Planets could be wheels because they are rolling through space.

2277
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,480
Spacetime.

2278
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:31,880
Consider the planetary system is a wheel and in that case.

2279
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:41,720
Consider every molecule every atom with its orbiting electrons just you know in a solid

2280
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:47,640
crystal matrix obviously obviously the the atoms are not wheels because they're all fixed in place

2281
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:52,200
relative to one another but in a liquid or a gas the wheel they're all sloshing over one another

2282
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:55,240
they're rolling they're rolling around at the speed of sound.

2283
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:59,160
This conversation is literally wheel spinning right now.

2284
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,440
My fucking god.

2285
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:05,800
Liquid is door okay here's why.

2286
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:08,920
Yeah I'm listening I'm ready to hear you out on this.

2287
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:14,360
The door a door is is is too is it's a blockage it's it stops something going through but it

2288
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:21,480
can be removed and replaced every single particle you can't phase through a particle it'd be pushed

2289
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:27,240
out of the way so each particle going past another particle pushing it out of the way is a door

2290
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:32,440
opening and closing behind another particle so every single thing in the universe is a door.

2291
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:40,520
So we've decided that every every thing every discrete object every discrete

2292
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:43,400
particle in the universe is both a wheel and a door.

2293
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:52,680
Yeah yeah that's good I think that's that works I'm satisfied which if they're all if they're

2294
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:57,000
all doors and wheels when they cancel out and then the none of them are other than only one

2295
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:00,520
matters are like what like composites of objects.

2296
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:04,280
When everyone's a door no one will be.

2297
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,280
Oh god you're right.

2298
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:12,200
Post it post in the comments here your interesting arguments for what a door and what is a wheel.

2299
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:17,320
I want to see as many creative ideas as possible.

2300
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:21,960
I really think I really think Bosch was being a door with that comment of his and Rowling was

2301
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:29,800
being a real wheel by say having an opinion about wheelie bad optics in Ben's but I think

2302
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:36,440
this opens doors for his notoriety now we can do he can say.

2303
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:44,200
I don't want to talk about this anymore I shouldn't have said it like Bush adorable you know I hate

2304
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:52,200
you thank you finally somebody had to say it

2305
01:57:54,680 --> 01:58:00,360
voicemails yeah okay okay okay okay I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it right now

2306
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:12,680
let's see pulling them up we got the first one is called why image voicemails suck let me find

2307
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:21,480
it here we go this is why image 528 hertz didn't change my dna of the image lied that's why

2308
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:27,320
uh oh sorry about that okay here we go three two one go

2309
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:39,720
I get it I get it that's funny is it is it quiet is it silent is that the joke

2310
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:44,680
I mean usually when people send images I assume they like don't even actually like send a voicemail

2311
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:49,480
it's just like half a second of silence or whatever a lot of a time right it's yeah it's

2312
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:58,040
zero seconds that's probably the joke I don't know if I get it maybe image voicemails are good

2313
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:04,760
image voicemails suck because they don't contain audio voice I mean they they don't need it it's

2314
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:09,400
it's just another way of like just sending an image to react to like the voicemail

2315
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:13,400
like service provides multiple functions you can send a voicemail and you can send other

2316
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:21,960
shit too okay then the next one is is an audio an image voicemail and it's this this map of a

2317
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:27,880
u n generally assembly resolution on combating the glorification of nazism neo nazism contemporary

2318
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:34,600
forms of racism racial discrimination this is uh how how uh how this country's voted or something

2319
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:44,760
wait a combating combating the glorification okay that's weird against how come wait a minute

2320
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:49,800
I think I saw this before but I don't know wait is this saying that it was only the united states

2321
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:57,560
and and ukraine the voted against yeah I mean it wouldn't surprise me too much but I don't know

2322
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:08,120
what this is about more I saw I saw uh statistics that showed uh ukraine as being uh particularly

2323
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:15,880
accepting of jews among eastern european states yeah it's it's hard to know which things are what

2324
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:23,160
um yeah it was basically like what the question that was like do you think jews should be allowed

2325
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:28,200
or should they be kicked out or whatever oh yeah should they be would you accept them as citizens

2326
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:32,120
yeah like they should should they be allowed to be citizens and ukraine like five percent said no

2327
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:37,080
but in like russia 15 percent said no and it was like yeah ukraine was like the most accepting of

2328
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:42,920
all of the surrounding countries yeah um but the way this graph is kind of if this is true this is

2329
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:47,800
kind of weird though like even new zealand like abstained that's weird I feel like I've seen the

2330
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:53,560
same graph before and I I don't remember it looking like this I don't remember it being just

2331
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:59,800
ukraine yeah I remember Australia I thought Australia and New Zealand like where I wonder if I can find

2332
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:04,440
it I don't know and like if you think New Zealand would be green though they're pretty progressive I

2333
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:11,320
don't know uh I don't know maybe but also also I sure Africa is all green there's a guy I forget

2334
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:16,360
which country in Africa there's the guy there's a guy called Adolf Hitler who's like in charge

2335
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:21,480
somewhere in there yeah I don't know I don't know how much we can really glean from this graph

2336
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:31,800
I don't know seems fake I'm just gonna say it's fake nah nah it didn't happen uh did you go to

2337
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:38,200
find something I'm I'm just seeing if I can like google to find what the this is from if you if you

2338
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:45,080
change your name to get boob a take that's one extra wheel in your name that what where's the wheel

2339
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:52,840
it's just like circles the letter O is a wheel if you think about it no no we just decided that

2340
02:01:52,840 --> 02:02:00,920
it has to roll along the surface boo like a coin a coin isn't a wheel but all the atoms that make

2341
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:07,880
up but it could yeah the coin itself is definitely not yeah it's true okay oh you know what you're

2342
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:16,760
right actually I was getting I was getting ahead of myself um okay next next voicemail is uh what is

2343
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:30,680
this one 290 it is called uh at killer prints 930 uh three two one go have you guys read roof girl

2344
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:41,480
no read girl right now roof girl like on the ceiling like she's on the roof what's girl

2345
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:49,880
apparently apparently this is a location in Adelaide when I research it I get a it's a I think

2346
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:57,080
it's a business yeah it's a business in Adelaide where is that in Canada where is Adelaide is that

2347
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:02,840
Australia where the fuck is Ali I don't know okay I have found whatever the point is I can't

2348
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:07,560
like it yeah it's Australia it's Australia I was right okay I have found the United Nations thing

2349
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:12,360
this is talking about combating glorification of Nazism neo-Nazis and other practices that

2350
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:16,440
contribute to the fueling contemporary forms of racism racial discriminations and infobia and

2351
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:26,360
related intolerance and uh there's a bunch of the things and the two nos are indeed Ukraine and

2352
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:33,720
the United States well that's weird so that is weird I did not I have not had a moment to read

2353
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:39,960
like the full thing if I can that is pretty weird but I don't know what to make up to this I don't

2354
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:47,960
know what to make of that information yeah it's weird I mean I know that there are like neo-nazis

2355
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:54,280
in Ukraine but like the fact that the country you voted for it is odd because like the this was in

2356
02:03:54,280 --> 02:04:00,680
2020 I think Zelensky was already like the leader at that point well like surely the graph that was

2357
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:12,600
posted in the image says 2018 that's weird maybe they did it multiple times I feel like this is

2358
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:19,320
the one because it's like all the yes I don't know maybe my guy same maybe I should go and

2359
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:25,080
un-un-pledge my uh my support from that Ukraine bundle oh no I can't no I can't

2360
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:30,600
oh but the value though no the value oh kingdom two oh yeah five dollars off kingdom two I mean

2361
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:37,400
this has been brought up sometimes it's like uh how could you support x because there are bad

2362
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:43,640
people over there and it was the same with the Palestine relief like Hamas is benefiting from

2363
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:50,840
support of of the people with like aid to like civilians running from being killed

2364
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:58,520
and it's like true but like I think it's fine because people are being displaced by war and

2365
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:05,960
they need help so like whatever it's not like I it's not like the charity is give guns to Nazis

2366
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:13,480
the charity it's like food water shelter um relocation of of of like refugees it's like

2367
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:20,440
that's where the money's going I mean one hopes I mean one would expect one would hope one would

2368
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:27,640
hope even the majority of it would do that is like at it whatever yeah uh okay whatever I can't uh

2369
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,600
I can't draw any conclusions from this graph really conclusion I can draw reading that

2370
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:42,680
thing is it says n for no but also nuke crane uh these guys boy I hope they don't do that I hope

2371
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:51,960
they don't just saying uh don't do it don't no okay next one is called scrub quoting wordle

2372
02:05:52,520 --> 02:06:00,440
three two one go I'm here to bitch about the March 8th wordle sweet is the worst type of word

2373
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:06,760
that can be a wordle it has a double vowel so you're not going to get that set up just get good

2374
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:14,680
shut up I just get good maybe I got a quick um it has an interchangeable uh the Dark Souls is too

2375
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:20,520
hard because uh the boss attacks too fast you can't dodge it could be you know sweet like it is it

2376
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:24,520
could be sweet it could be sheet it could be ski it could probably be something else I'm not thinking

2377
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:31,000
yeah yeah and I'm just very fucking mad it ruined my like 30 days treat your wordle

2378
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:38,280
I'm this is the reason that mr wordle the person who made wordle sort so I've gotta hold on um I have

2379
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:43,480
to deal with the liability of this exact moment I gotta I gotta find the one that that was ruined

2380
02:06:43,480 --> 02:06:48,680
me that would be coming this way he's going to pay with blood I'm going to fucking kill mr wordle

2381
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:54,360
okay it was it's definitely just that wordle is a kind of a flawed game because of the moments

2382
02:06:54,360 --> 02:07:02,200
like that where it's like even if you are smart you'll just lose because of unlucky letter choices

2383
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:10,040
oh the one that I lost on was uh January 31st might might that's the one that uh I couldn't do

2384
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:15,080
oh did you get it and then it was like yeah well I got I got it on my fifth guess so

2385
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:21,640
yeah fifth guess was fight fourth guess or six guess was might wait and the actual one was

2386
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:28,360
uh it was light yeah it was light so it was it was kind of the sims yeah yeah that one almost

2387
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:33,320
got me yeah it got me oh yeah there's like four words I can do that yeah I turned over the one that

2388
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:40,600
was like six words I don't remember right now yeah what uh watch right watch match batch

2389
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:47,800
maybe yeah yeah latch latch catch that one's that one's super bad yeah

2390
02:07:49,240 --> 02:08:00,200
hatch latch what catch watch damn that's like five at least yeah patch uh patch yes no

2391
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:09,800
all right next one is all right here we go next one is kylan funny man episode six uh it's a

2392
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:18,360
vocaru and it's uh it's it's five minutes long so uh we're in for it uh here here we go

2393
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:26,600
oh jeez like the files are too powerful all right week me and I'll post it because I

2394
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:34,520
have discord nitro oh thank you thank you very much uh here you here you go I will use my

2395
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:42,200
nitro for good I know a bunch of people were um I saw some people on twitter who were mad at

2396
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:50,600
discord for twitter links not embedding properly and making it harder to post nsfw stuff and they were

2397
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:58,040
considering dropping their nitro but I use it too often to send files because my work is

2398
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:05,480
through discord a lot of the time I have seen uh I have seen had twitter image twitter post not

2399
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:12,040
embed correctly that's but I don't have nitro so no no nitro doesn't fix that issue it's just um

2400
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:17,080
yeah some of the do if on the one hand twitter doesn't want images embedding because they don't

2401
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:25,720
want people not using the platform um and discord simultaneously is also like being

2402
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:31,560
restricting nsfw stuff more like they can like they're trying to make it so you can't post it

2403
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:39,160
anywhere unless the channel is marked as nsfw which is a little annoying um but trying to send

2404
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:45,640
stuff to people in dms who you're friends with uh of artists and stuff but oh anyway so it's a file

2405
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:50,840
I see okay uh well here we go kyle and funny man episode six three

Yeah, that was a pretty fun time. Now it's this, I guess.

2443
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:12,640
Yeah, you know what they say, a wise person once said that if you don't know how to end

2444
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:18,640
an episode, just end it in a wall next to your random papa, you know?

2445
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:24,640
Every time you open your mouth, just pure gold. Just pure gold.

2446
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:29,640
You don't suck alcohol coming out of your sweet little bubble.

2447
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:36,640
Oh, thank you for your time. I'm glad we are friends and discuss things here on the station.

2448
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:39,640
I want to kill myself.

2449
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:40,640
Oh, no.

2450
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:41,640
Oh, don't.

2451
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,640
Well, if you do, I sure would be laughing.

2452
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:49,640
No, he meant like, if he met himself, he would kill himself, but not in like that way.

2453
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:52,640
Like, he would like shoot and kill the evil part of himself.

2454
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:55,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2455
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:58,640
That was great. It was a little musical.

2456
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:00,640
It didn't even feel like five minutes.

2457
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:05,640
No, that flew by and some part of that's got to be the theme song.

2458
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,640
Oh, of course.

2459
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:07,640
Oh, hell yeah.

2460
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:08,640
Some section.

2461
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,640
Play the whole.

2462
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:12,640
Honestly, yeah.

2463
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:17,640
Well, that was great.

2464
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:24,640
Should I put the link to the Vokaroo file in the descriptions?

2465
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:26,640
You can hear it if you want.

2466
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:29,640
Without us jabbering over it, I guess.

2467
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:31,640
Yeah, yeah.

2468
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:33,640
Lol.

2469
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:36,640
Okay, they should be in the voice gray elephant already.

2470
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:38,640
They should, yeah.

2471
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:40,640
Definitely after that.

2472
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:43,640
Who did they say we forgot to put in there?

2473
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:44,640
Doid gazers.

2474
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:45,640
Doid gazers.

2475
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,640
Yeah, yeah.

2476
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:47,640
Maybe someone else too.

2477
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:48,640
I'm not sure.

2478
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:50,640
They probably are other people.

2479
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:53,640
Okay.

2480
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:54,640
All right.

2481
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:55,640
That was great.

2482
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:57,640
Let's see who's next.

2483
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:01,640
The next voicemail is from...

2484
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:04,640
Well, it's called Jelly Beaner.

2485
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:06,640
Where's the...

2486
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:07,640
Oh, no.

2487
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:08,640
Yeah.

2488
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:10,640
Well, here we go.

2489
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:13,640
Three, two, one, go.

2490
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:17,640
Riddle me this PCP.

2491
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,640
I'm loud and obnoxious.

2492
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:21,640
I like music that rhymes.

2493
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:23,640
I'm a fraction of the population.

2494
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:25,640
But commit half the crime.

2495
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:26,640
Yeah.

2496
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:27,640
Who am I?

2497
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:28,640
Jelly Beaner.

2498
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:29,640
Jelly Beaner.

2499
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:30,640
You're Trixie.

2500
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:32,640
You wrote your name right on the voicemail.

2501
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:33,640
Yeah.

2502
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:34,640
What were you thinking?

2503
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:36,640
I can't believe you commit half the crime.

2504
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:37,640
That's insane.

2505
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:41,640
Yeah, congratulations.

2506
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:42,640
Okay.

2507
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:43,640
Next one is...

2508
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:45,640
It's called Woof.

2509
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:47,640
Next one's called Woof.

2510
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:50,640
Three, two, one, go.

2511
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,640
Do you think you got it rough?

2512
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,640
Just imagine being Ben St.

2513
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:59,640
Woof.

2514
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:01,640
True.

2515
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:05,640
You know, true words were never spoken.

2516
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:07,640
I think about that every time I'm in a bad place.

2517
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:10,640
I was like, well, imagine if I was Ben St.

2518
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:12,640
It could be so much worse.

2519
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:14,640
Oh, God.

2520
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:15,640
No.

2521
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:16,640
No, it's great.

2522
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:17,640
No.

2523
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:23,640
No, I got so much space for my bags of sparkling water bottles.

2524
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:25,640
It's luxurious in here.

2525
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:26,640
Oh, right.

2526
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:27,640
Yeah, I got so many...

2527
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:29,640
Did you just say bags filled with sparkling water?

2528
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:30,640
Well, yeah.

2529
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,640
Well, the bottles.

2530
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:33,640
Yeah, but yes.

2531
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:35,640
Sparkling water bottles are doors.

2532
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:36,640
I got space.

2533
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:39,640
I have a nice little parking lot outside.

2534
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:43,640
You know, this is not too many rats.

2535
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:44,640
It's good.

2536
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,640
Just enough rats.

2537
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:46,640
Just enough rats.

2538
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:47,640
The right amount.

2539
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,640
The amount you're looking for.

2540
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,640
Okay.

2541
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,640
Next one is an image thing.

2542
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,640
There it is.

2543
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:54,640
This guy.

2544
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:55,640
This guy.

2545
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:56,640
Oh, it's Destiny.

2546
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,640
There he is.

2547
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:58,640
Well, I guess...

2548
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:00,640
He's looking like a...

2549
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:02,640
He's looking like a Doctor Who.

2550
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:07,640
I guess we're gonna fuck because Destiny fucks and...

2551
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:08,640
for fucking...

2552
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:09,640
No.

2553
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:11,640
He does look pretty good here.

2554
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:14,640
But if anyone slapped my ass, I'd be like, what?

2555
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:15,640
Huh?

2556
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:16,640
Wait, is that him?

2557
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:18,640
Did they like Photoshop his face onto this guy?

2558
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:19,640
That's not his actual face, right?

2559
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:21,640
It was not his actual body.

2560
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:22,640
Probably.

2561
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:24,640
I mean, I guess it could be.

2562
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:26,640
I thought it was Photoshop.

2563
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:27,640
Okay, whatever.

2564
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:30,640
Nice, nice coat, asshole.

2565
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:33,640
Next one is Ben's weekly reminder.

2566
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:36,640
Play Deltarune Chapter 2.

2567
02:19:36,640 --> 02:19:37,640
Okay.

2568
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:39,640
There's no voicemail with that.

2569
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:42,640
The next one is, okay.

2570
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:43,640
There's a...

2571
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:45,640
There is a thing.

2572
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:46,640
Oh, okay.

2573
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:48,640
There's a link that goes along.

2574
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:51,640
It's the link to MangaHelk gets anime adaptation.

2575
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:54,640
Let's hear the thing.

2576
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:55,640
Hold on.

2577
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:56,640
Where is it?

2578
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:57,640
It's 2, 9, 7.

2579
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:58,640
Here we go.

2580
02:19:58,640 --> 02:19:59,640
Bam.

2581
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:00,640
Post it.

2582
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,640
Okay.

2583
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,640
3, 2, 1, go.

2584
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:05,640
I know you're about to finish Simon's punishment.

2585
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:08,640
What if you just stop and then make Beast Copains?

2586
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:09,640
What if you just quit?

2587
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:10,640
Excuse me.

2588
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:13,640
Just delete all of it.

2589
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:20,640
What if you remain Simon's punishment, but instead it was Beast Copains and Phantom

2590
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:23,640
Horn is a beast?

2591
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:28,640
Beast Copains and punishment.

2592
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,640
Intriguing.

2593
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:34,640
Beast Coslime.

2594
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:35,640
Man.

2595
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:36,640
Okay, man.

2596
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:37,640
Good voicemail.

2597
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:38,640
Okay.

2598
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:41,640
Next one is called Be the Bigger Man.

2599
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:42,640
There we go.

2600
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:43,640
3, 2, 1, go.

2601
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:55,640
In this society that we live in, you are forced to choose between being comfortable and being

2602
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:56,640
free.

2603
02:20:57,640 --> 02:21:00,640
Being comfortable and being free.

2604
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:04,640
And it's a tough choice.

2605
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:12,640
I could live in a shack like Ted Kaczynski and I could be happy and free or I could play

2606
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:15,640
Chapter 3 of Delta Rune when it comes out.

2607
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:18,640
And it's a really hard choice.

2608
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:25,640
And at the end of the day it's all about being a man or something.

2609
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:33,640
And being bigger because the bigger man wins.

2610
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:37,640
Always strive to be the hugest possible.

2611
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:38,640
Yeah.

2612
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:42,640
Be huge and gigantic and tower over everybody.

2613
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,640
You gotta be in like a fish.

2614
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,640
It's like the fish game.

2615
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:47,640
You gotta be the big fish that eats all the little fish.

2616
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:50,640
And then you just keep getting bigger.

2617
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:52,640
Just keep getting bigger.

2618
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:54,640
Or.

2619
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:55,640
Or.

2620
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:56,640
Nice.

2621
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:57,640
It's Spore.

2622
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:58,640
Oh yeah.

2623
02:21:58,640 --> 02:21:59,640
Spore.

2624
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:00,640
Yeah.

2625
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:01,640
Okay.

2626
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:03,640
Next one is called...

2627
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:04,640
Wait.

2628
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:05,640
I almost missed one.

2629
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:06,640
Okay.

2630
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:07,640
Next one is called Nathan.

2631
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:09,640
3, 2, 1, go.

2632
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:12,640
Bring back the no Nate, no watch guy.

2633
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:14,640
I miss you, bro.

2634
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,640
He's already here.

2635
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:18,640
He's been in the cold the whole time.

2636
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,640
Wait.

2637
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:20,640
He was.

2638
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,640
Was he not?

2639
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:23,640
Did he not show up in the comments?

2640
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:26,640
I feel like I saw him in the light.

2641
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:27,640
Yeah.

2642
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:29,640
I feel like I saw him very recently.

2643
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:30,640
Oh God.

2644
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:31,640
I always forget what it's like.

2645
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:33,640
S C H W.

2646
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:36,640
Video production, something like that.

2647
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,640
I think it's like S C H W videos.

2648
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:44,640
And I after all this time, I still, I still forget the order of the letters.

2649
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:46,640
But his contribution is invaluable.

2650
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:49,640
Next one is called...

2651
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:55,640
It's called the two's company, Ben Saints new living situation.

2652
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:58,640
3, 2, 1, go.

2653
02:22:58,640 --> 02:23:00,640
What?

2654
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:05,640
Hey, Ben St.

2655
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:09,640
It's me, your landlord.

2656
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:10,640
Oh.

2657
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:11,640
Uh oh.

2658
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:12,640
I've been listening to the podcast.

2659
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,640
You sound different.

2660
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:16,640
Quite frankly, I have to finding out what you do.

2661
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:20,640
I don't, I don't believe no more that you're going to be able to pay the rent.

2662
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:22,640
Take me to court over it.

2663
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:23,640
Reliably.

2664
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,640
Take me to court over it.

2665
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:25,640
I fucking dare you.

2666
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:26,640
And protection.

2667
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:31,640
I decided that you're going to have to rule together with another person.

2668
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:32,640
Now don't worry.

2669
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:34,640
I've already found a person.

2670
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:35,640
Oh, thank God.

2671
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:37,640
Uh, her name's Trixie.

2672
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:42,640
I hear she's a content creator as well.

2673
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,640
But she has, she's got a company.

2674
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,640
She's got a company.

2675
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:47,640
She probably makes a lot of money.

2676
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:50,640
She's got a studio.

2677
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:54,640
Well, she should get her own studio apartment.

2678
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:55,640
And you can split the rent.

2679
02:23:55,640 --> 02:24:00,640
And then I know that I'm going to get paid.

2680
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:04,640
Enjoy, darling.

2681
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:05,640
Thanks.

2682
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:11,640
Sorry, sorry to put you through so much trouble, Milady.

2683
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:14,640
This is the beginning of the sitcom arc.

2684
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,640
Praise, praise be.

2685
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:23,640
Due to a wacky set of circumstances, Ben and Trixie are living together once again.

2686
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:25,640
Somebody on episode one.

2687
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:33,640
Somebody on Kiwi Farms spotted Trixie and Bird in the wild and took their picture in a Costco.

2688
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,640
Just standing in line.

2689
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:39,640
Just standing.

2690
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:42,640
Hey, Ben, if you're serious about expanding your literary palette,

2691
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:45,640
you might want to pick up Hyperion by Dan Simmons.

2692
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:49,640
It set the stage for a lot of modern sci-fi and is really cool.

2693
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:50,640
Hmm.

2694
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,640
Let's see.

2695
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:56,640
Is it a book?

2696
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:59,640
Hyperion Simmons novel.

2697
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:01,640
No, I thought it was pretty funny.

2698
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:08,640
Uh, next one is called Hyperion 321 Go.

2699
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:11,640
It's a novel, not the Dan Simmons.

2700
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:17,640
The first book of his Hyperion canto is it won the Hugo Award for Best Novel.

2701
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:18,640
Oh, wow.

2702
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:20,640
The Hugo Award for Best Novel ever.

2703
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:21,640
Just the one.

2704
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:22,640
The one best novel.

2705
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:23,640
Hmm.

2706
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:25,640
Uh, that is neat.

2707
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:26,640
I don't know.

2708
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:27,640
I've never even heard of Dan Simmons before.

2709
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:28,640
Maybe I have.

2710
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:29,640
I don't know.

2711
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:30,640
Doesn't ring a bell.

2712
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:36,640
Uh, I'm going to go to the library soon and pick up some books.

2713
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:37,640
I think I want to read.

2714
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:38,640
I don't know what I mentioned this before.

2715
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:42,640
I think I want to read some, uh, I almost said Fauci.

2716
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:43,640
No, Foucault.

2717
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:47,640
I want to read some Foucault, uh, just because.

2718
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:49,640
And I'll pick up some other shit, too.

2719
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:53,640
Foucault is the inventor of Funko Pops.

2720
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:54,640
Yeah.

2721
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:56,640
Uh, all right.

2722
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:58,640
Next, uh, voicemail is called.

2723
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:01,640
Wait, all the gib is in the background.

2724
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:02,640
Oh, wait.

2725
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:03,640
Oh, she's back.

2726
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:04,640
Oh, I was fast.

2727
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:05,640
Um, okay.

2728
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:12,640
One is called, um, application three, two, one go.

2729
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:13,640
Hello.

2730
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:15,640
Can I get the press pass for P three?

2731
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:23,640
I want to demo all the sweets, new games, uh, interview the creators, um, do all that,

2732
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,640
uh, stuff, write articles.

2733
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:29,640
I need that press pass for P three, please.

2734
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:30,640
Hmm.

2735
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:31,640
Yes.

2736
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,640
Yes.

2737
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:39,640
And we should, we should look into, uh, hiring fucking the bronicon area, wherever that was

2738
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:40,640
in Baltimore.

2739
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,640
Baltimore.

2740
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:42,640
Baltimore.

2741
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:49,640
We get the big old thing, we hire out the whole place and it's P three and Tom still

2742
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:52,640
won't show up, but we'll have his game there.

2743
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:54,360
We'll take credit for it.

2744
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:55,360
If he won't.

2745
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,360
Yeah.

2746
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:57,360
P for pony.

2747
02:26:57,360 --> 02:26:58,360
Okay.

2748
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:00,360
Okay.

2749
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:05,360
Next one is called, uh, please wait.

2750
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,360
Here we go.

2751
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:07,360
Yes.

2752
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:08,360
It's called please.

2753
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:09,360
There it is.

2754
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,360
Three, two, one go.

2755
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:12,360
Ben, can you upload the episodes to Spotify?

2756
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:13,360
No.

2757
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:14,360
I've been waiting forever.

2758
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:15,360
I can't.

2759
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:16,360
Tom doesn't.

2760
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,360
I don't know how.

2761
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:21,360
Thanks for asking.

2762
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:27,360
Uh, next one is called, uh, uh, next one is called.

2763
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:29,360
The old Ben.

2764
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:31,360
Three, two, one go.

2765
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:33,360
Ben, you're starting to forgive Trixie now.

2766
02:27:33,360 --> 02:27:34,360
That's not like you.

2767
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:35,360
What the fuck, man?

2768
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:36,360
Come on.

2769
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:37,360
Go back to your old self.

2770
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:38,360
I missed old Ben.

2771
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:39,360
Come on.

2772
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:41,360
Wait, I'm starting to do what?

2773
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:42,360
Forgive Trixie.

2774
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:43,360
Forgive her.

2775
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:44,360
When did I say that?

2776
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:46,360
I never said that.

2777
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:49,360
And I never will.

2778
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:53,360
She was mean to me and now she's, now she's gotta die.

2779
02:27:54,360 --> 02:28:02,360
Um, next one is called, uh, uh, the long, the long, long enough.

2780
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:03,360
Okay.

2781
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,360
Three, two, one go.

2782
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:06,360
The episodes have been too short.

2783
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:11,360
We need at least a five hour show every single week.

2784
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:12,360
Sorry.

2785
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:18,360
Well, maybe we could if you gave better voicemails that we could riff on.

2786
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,360
Yeah, I can't.

2787
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:20,360
I can't.

2788
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,360
Have a think about that.

2789
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:22,360
Can't do anything.

2790
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:27,360
You know, you gotta, you know, it's like Papa John says, better ingredients, better pizza.

2791
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:30,360
And you're giving a shitty ingredients right now.

2792
02:28:30,360 --> 02:28:32,360
So this pizza is coming out rotten.

2793
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:33,360
Just like Midgar.

2794
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:35,360
If you know what I'm saying.

2795
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:36,360
Midgar?

2796
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:37,360
Yes.

2797
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:40,360
Barrett, Barrett, Barrett calls Midgar a rotten pizza.

2798
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:41,360
Yes.

2799
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:42,360
Old slices.

2800
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:48,360
I think it's, I think, I think Tim Rogers says in English, he just calls it a pizza.

2801
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:52,360
But I think in Japanese, he calls it like a rotten pizza.

2802
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:53,360
Lamal.

2803
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:55,360
So that's important.

2804
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:56,360
That's big.

2805
02:28:56,360 --> 02:29:01,360
There's a, there's like a, one of the, the audio tracks is like something rotten pizza.

2806
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:02,360
What?

2807
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:08,360
One of the audio tracks, the name of the audio track for Final Fantasy seven of like Midgar

2808
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:11,360
is like something pizza.

2809
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:14,360
What, like a song in the game?

2810
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:17,360
Like, like the OST, you know.

2811
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,360
Oh.

2812
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:19,360
It's funny.

2813
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:23,360
I didn't know that.

2814
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:24,360
Neat.

2815
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:25,360
Okay.

2816
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:30,360
Next one is called Ben's music career part two.

2817
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:31,360
Wait.

2818
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:32,360
Oh, I already posted it.

2819
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:33,360
Okay.

2820
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:36,360
Three, two, one, go.

2821
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:40,360
I think that Ben's music career is an amazing idea.

2822
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:41,360
Why?

2823
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:43,360
Well, think about it.

2824
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:48,360
Trixie had a music career and she set the bar really low.

2825
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:51,360
Her music was fucking dog shit.

2826
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:54,360
It wouldn't be that hard to make an album.

2827
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:55,360
Yes.

2828
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:57,360
And that would make me tons of money.

2829
02:29:57,360 --> 02:30:01,360
Just imagine the ego devastation it would do to her.

2830
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:04,360
It would be just another easy win.

2831
02:30:04,360 --> 02:30:07,360
Like, there's no reason for you not to do this.

2832
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:10,360
I think it's an amazing idea.

2833
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:11,360
You know what?

2834
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:14,360
It would be, I should be effortless.

2835
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:15,360
Just be effortless.

2836
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:21,360
Just start producing music when I don't know how to do that.

2837
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:22,360
Easy W.

2838
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:24,360
Just an easy W.

2839
02:30:24,360 --> 02:30:25,360
Just the other day.

2840
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:32,800
I've just been like, what if I just did a low stakes acoustic guitar album with maybe

2841
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,080
some songs I wrote?

2842
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:36,360
I thought you were going to say rap.

2843
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,360
No.

2844
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:38,360
I would never rap.

2845
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:40,360
I could never rap my head around it.

2846
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:41,360
Rap.

2847
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:42,360
Rap.

2848
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:43,360
Rap.

2849
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:44,360
That's a rap.

2850
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:45,360
Adrien Pines Rap.

2851
02:30:45,360 --> 02:30:47,360
It would be like Beatles Inspire.

2852
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:52,360
Just sort of like, here's a song about a wet towel or whatever.

2853
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:56,360
Do you have songs or would you have to make them?

2854
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:57,360
I'd make them.

2855
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:58,360
But like it's easy.

2856
02:30:58,360 --> 02:30:59,360
You just take some chords.

2857
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,360
You put them in some sort of order and you play them.

2858
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:03,360
Jesus Christ.

2859
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:06,360
Sounds scary to me.

2860
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:09,360
Make me uncomfortable.

2861
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:13,360
A low stakes low effort little album.

2862
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:15,360
I just feel like doing it.

2863
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:17,360
Well, I'd be impressed.

2864
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:18,360
Good.

2865
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:19,360
Thank you.

2866
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:28,360
I mean, I liked your old songs on your band camp.

2867
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:32,360
I'd really liked a bunch of the stuff you used to put out.

2868
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:34,360
I think that was pretty cool.

2869
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:36,360
I like the greatest shit.

2870
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:39,360
I listen to it every so often.

2871
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:40,360
The greatest ships?

2872
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:42,360
I don't think I remember that.

2873
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:43,360
Shits.

2874
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,360
Shits.

2875
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:45,360
With a T.

2876
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:47,360
It's like greatest hits.

2877
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:52,360
I compiled a bunch of the old songs into the greatest shits just because they were all.

2878
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,360
I see, I see.

2879
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:55,360
I think chicken and a basketball is in there.

2880
02:31:55,360 --> 02:31:56,360
Yeah, chicken and basketball.

2881
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,360
I like the song about the squid.

2882
02:31:59,360 --> 02:32:02,360
Everybody's talking about the squid because I'm gay.

2883
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:05,360
I love that song.

2884
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:06,360
Who's my egg?

2885
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:07,360
Who's my egg?

2886
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:09,360
Also a classic.

2887
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:11,360
It actually reminds me.

2888
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:14,360
Short short short little story short little Minecraft story.

2889
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:15,360
Yeah.

2890
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:17,360
So me and my friends have a Minecraft server.

2891
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:20,360
We've been running it for three and a half years.

2892
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:24,360
And about a year and a half in, you know, we'd been living in this town.

2893
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:26,360
We'd been working on it for a while.

2894
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:30,360
We dug out, there are two rivers nearby that we connected into like a canal that led out

2895
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:31,360
to the ocean.

2896
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:34,360
If you take it by boat, we'd built all this cool stuff.

2897
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:36,360
We'd built bridges across and everything.

2898
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:42,360
One day we're just fucking around by my friend's house and we see an egg, a Minecraft egg floating

2899
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:43,360
in the river.

2900
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:47,360
And we're just like, oh, oh, let's go pick it up.

2901
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:52,360
And we couldn't fucking pick up the egg.

2902
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:55,360
You know, the egg would not pick up.

2903
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:58,360
Like an egg, a chicken egg, like an item just floating.

2904
02:32:58,360 --> 02:32:59,360
Yeah.

2905
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:00,360
Yeah.

2906
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:03,360
Like that exactly.

2907
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:04,360
And we just, it was weird.

2908
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:09,360
And we were like, why can't we fucking, we have space in our inventory.

2909
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:13,360
We didn't know what was going on.

2910
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:17,360
Actually, I'll get a screenshot of the egg because we got a fucking video of it too.

2911
02:33:17,360 --> 02:33:18,360
Got to see this egg.

2912
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:19,360
Yeah.

2913
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:23,360
So I'm going to screenshot of the video real quick.

2914
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:30,360
So that's, oh, wow, that was back when I had my old skin.

2915
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:31,360
So yeah.

2916
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:36,360
And we're just staring at it and we built a platform and we managed to get the egg onto

2917
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:41,360
the platform and we realized that five minutes had passed and the egg hadn't despawned.

2918
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:45,360
All items on the ground despawn after five minutes, but the egg was still there after

2919
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:46,360
like eight minutes.

2920
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:48,360
The infinity egg.

2921
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,360
Yeah.

2922
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:53,360
And we were like trying to like bring the egg to safety.

2923
02:33:53,360 --> 02:33:55,360
We dug like a channel.

2924
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:58,360
Protect the egg.

2925
02:33:58,360 --> 02:33:59,360
Hold on.

2926
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:00,360
Another screenshot.

2927
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:02,360
We got it out of the river.

2928
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:04,360
There we go.

2929
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:06,360
And in the video, I was re-watching it recently.

2930
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:12,360
I started singing Who's My Egg just in the video and it was great.

2931
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:13,360
Is that a Gibbs song?

2932
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:14,360
It's a Gibbs song.

2933
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:15,360
Who's My Egg.

2934
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:16,360
I can't remember how it goes.

2935
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:17,360
You say, who's my egg?

2936
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:19,360
And it's like, who needs an egg?

2937
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:20,360
You.

2938
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:21,360
Me?

2939
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:22,360
Yeah.

2940
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:23,360
And I love that part.

2941
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:26,360
And I sing it to myself.

2942
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:30,360
Well, but what happened afterwards is we're like, if the egg doesn't despawn and you can't

2943
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:33,360
pick it up, is it also immune to lava?

2944
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:36,360
And this was a dangerous question.

2945
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,360
And so we, I grabbed the four elements.

2946
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:42,360
I threw a piece of string at it and I said air and then I dropped some dirt.

2947
02:34:42,360 --> 02:34:43,360
I said earth.

2948
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:47,360
I splashed some water and then I used my flint and steel for just a second.

2949
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:52,360
The egg burned for like a second and then it disappeared and made the guy who suggested

2950
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:53,360
it.

2951
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:55,360
He had to be executed.

2952
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,360
Yeah.

2953
02:34:56,360 --> 02:34:58,360
We had a public execution.

2954
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:00,360
We took him to.

2955
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:02,360
And it was really funny.

2956
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:09,360
I'd built a giant Enderman statue like in a hole in the ground and the Enderman is holding

2957
02:35:09,360 --> 02:35:10,360
his head.

2958
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:15,360
Oh, I got a screenshot of this too.

2959
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,360
Let me see.

2960
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:17,360
Let me see.

2961
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:18,360
Let me see.

2962
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:19,360
Yeah.

2963
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:21,360
And so me and Four Eyes who, you know, he's been on the PCP.

2964
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:22,360
He was on episode 25.

2965
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:23,360
Yeah.

2966
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:24,360
That's me and Four Eyes.

2967
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:28,360
We executed and we both fired by firing squad.

2968
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:33,360
We shot him off the egg and he fell off the egg, off the head.

2969
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:34,360
Off the egg.

2970
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:37,360
We shot him off of his own head and he fell to his death.

2971
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:38,360
And then I chased him.

2972
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:39,360
That's the Enderman.

2973
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:41,360
He's holding his big face.

2974
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:42,360
Oh, I see.

2975
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:43,360
Yeah.

2976
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:44,360
The floor looks like his face.

2977
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,360
Yeah.

2978
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:46,360
Yeah.

2979
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:50,360
This is a big drop because we built a full-sized Enderman like in a hole in the ground.

2980
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:51,360
It was this big project.

2981
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,360
I spent like weeks on it.

2982
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:55,360
And then afterwards, I wasn't satisfied.

2983
02:35:55,360 --> 02:36:00,360
I chased him down his mining tunnel that was, I think, 30,000 blocks long.

2984
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:05,360
And then like chased him through the air by a lighter and fucking murdered him a second

2985
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:06,360
time.

2986
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:07,360
It was really funny.

2987
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:08,360
Okay.

2988
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:11,360
One day this video will be out and it is really funny.

2989
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:15,360
That's what he gets for suggesting what to do with an egg.

2990
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:20,360
Dude, we were thinking about if the egg survived, we were going to put it in a glass case in

2991
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:23,360
the center of town where it could sit there for all eternity.

2992
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:25,360
It was going to be a monument.

2993
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:26,360
It would have been glorious.

2994
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:27,360
It's going to be a national treasure.

2995
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:30,360
And instead, it died because he's like, oh, let's just set it on fire.

2996
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:33,360
It'll see what happens.

2997
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:36,360
They've ever forgiven him.

2998
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:39,360
No, I wouldn't either.

2999
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:42,360
But yeah, I just reminded of that story.

3000
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:44,360
Anyway, Who's My Egg is a Good Song.

3001
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:45,360
That's great.

3002
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:46,360
That's great.

3003
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:47,360
I don't know.

3004
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:48,360
Shit.

3005
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:50,360
Yeah, I don't remember that one.

3006
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:51,360
Oops.

3007
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:52,360
Oops.

3008
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,360
Oops.

3009
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:54,360
Damn.

3010
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:59,360
I'm sure the egg's still out there somewhere.

3011
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:00,360
Yeah, maybe.

3012
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:02,360
It's in a better place.

3013
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:03,360
It's time.

3014
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:07,360
It's time on this earth could have been better spent elsewhere.

3015
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:08,360
And so it had to go.

3016
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:11,360
It had to return to its own planet.

3017
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:12,360
It's people needed it.

3018
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:13,360
It's people.

3019
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:15,360
You mean these people specifically?

3020
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:18,360
An egg guide to Minecraft.

3021
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:19,360
Oh, God.

3022
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:21,360
What the fuck?

3023
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:23,360
This brings back nightmares.

3024
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:25,360
He's not doing so well.

3025
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:27,360
And he's going to give me a guide to Minecraft.

3026
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:28,360
Do you know what this is?

3027
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:29,360
I don't.

3028
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:31,360
I don't know.

3029
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:33,360
It looks like.

3030
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:35,360
I actually, I do know what it is.

3031
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:37,360
I remember seeing this in like 2011.

3032
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:38,360
I suppressed it.

3033
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:41,360
I just showed up on Minecraft and I was looking for eggs.

3034
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:46,360
It was like this weird animation series by Almond Animation.

3035
02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:48,360
And I had like a voice actor.

3036
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:53,360
The guy, the guy I had who voiced Steve like died a few years ago.

3037
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:55,360
And it was like a thing.

3038
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:57,360
That's all I remember.

3039
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:58,360
Fummer.

3040
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,360
Well, that's weird.

3041
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:02,360
Okay.

3042
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:05,360
Well, the next voicemail, I posted it up above.

3043
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:08,360
It is called, what is it called?

3044
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:13,360
It's called Slime and Delainishment.

3045
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:14,360
All right.

3046
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:16,360
Three, two, one, go.

3047
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:19,360
Ben, please finish your game and publish it.

3048
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:23,360
You have started reading Flat Slime and Funny Strings and it's very funny.

3049
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,360
It will be done.

3050
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:26,360
Please release it in the fight finale.

3051
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:27,360
Please, please, please, please.

3052
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:29,360
By the time you're hearing this, it will be out.

3053
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:32,360
It will be out.

3054
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:43,360
Also, I will, when I post it, I'm going to record because I am several months behind on recording my Patreon Q&A.

3055
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:48,360
I'm going to record a new episode of that where I answer the last questions that were posted on the last one.

3056
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:50,360
And then I'm going to post that.

3057
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:58,360
And my hope then is that people will post replies to that Q&A if they want to ask me stuff about the game, right?

3058
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:03,360
Because when the game is out, maybe people will want to talk to me about that.

3059
02:39:03,360 --> 02:39:20,360
And so I'll post a new episode of the Q&A podcast and then I invite patrons to ask me about the game probably in the replies to that episode that will be out soon.

3060
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:24,360
It should probably be out by the time this is going live.

3061
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:27,360
I just had a realization.

3062
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:28,360
What's that?

3063
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:31,360
Is an egg a door?

3064
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:35,360
It's definitely a wheel.

3065
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,360
We need an alignment chart.

3066
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:42,360
We need an alignment chart of chaotic versus form versus function for doors and wheels.

3067
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:45,360
And both of them should have an egg on there somewhere.

3068
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:55,360
I think because it's hard because it's a barrier, the outer shell of the egg separating the inside and the outside.

3069
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,360
But it can't be closed.

3070
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:58,360
A door should open and close.

3071
02:39:58,360 --> 02:40:00,360
It can't be opened and closed.

3072
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:01,360
But it does open.

3073
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:07,360
It is designed to open via a little beak from the inside.

3074
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:10,360
Yeah.

3075
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:13,360
Gotta write a thesis paper on this.

3076
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:16,360
Ponder it in philosophy forever.

3077
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:20,360
I can't think of anything more important to be doing.

3078
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:24,360
Okay, next one is called Shit's Niche, bro.

3079
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:25,360
All right.

3080
02:40:25,360 --> 02:40:28,360
Three, two, one, go.

3081
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:36,360
Also, I will send Slamming Management to APERS, a few people that have never, ever, ever heard of you.

3082
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:42,360
I'm very curious as to the reaction and how much they even understand.

3083
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:44,360
Geez.

3084
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:46,360
I hope everybody does that.

3085
02:40:46,360 --> 02:40:49,360
I think he was laughing, perhaps at my expense.

3086
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:51,360
It sounded like he was blowing his nose as well.

3087
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:53,360
Well, I don't know, maybe.

3088
02:40:53,360 --> 02:40:57,360
Yeah, I think everyone should show Slamming Punishment to everyone they know.

3089
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:03,360
In my opinion, part of the appeal is that probably a lot of it won't make sense.

3090
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:09,360
Well, you know, I think you can read it and understand what's going on pretty easily.

3091
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,360
I don't think it's actually that hard to follow.

3092
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:14,360
There will be plenty of references that you don't get.

3093
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:16,360
But they're not important.

3094
02:41:16,360 --> 02:41:21,360
They're just details, things in the background, stuff.

3095
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:24,360
I feel like it's not actually that hard to read.

3096
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:27,360
Maybe to get 100% of, to understand everything.

3097
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:29,360
Yeah, super hard.

3098
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:34,360
I think the challenge is not whether it's literally comprehensible,

3099
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:41,360
but whether it presents itself in a way that people would want to read more.

3100
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:44,360
Oh, I don't know what this is.

3101
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:46,360
I guess I'll leave it.

3102
02:41:46,360 --> 02:41:48,360
People act like that.

3103
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:50,360
Sure.

3104
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:53,360
I mean, yeah.

3105
02:41:53,360 --> 02:41:57,360
That's what they say about the first sentence of a book is the most important,

3106
02:41:57,360 --> 02:42:00,360
because if it's not good, then why would the person continue reading?

3107
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:03,360
Oh, I mean, the first drawings of Slamming Punishment are just terrible.

3108
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:05,360
Oh, shit.

3109
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:07,360
Oh, well.

3110
02:42:07,360 --> 02:42:09,360
That had a great cover.

3111
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:10,360
Oh, it'll have a good cover.

3112
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:12,360
Oh, yeah, I gotta make a cover.

3113
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:17,360
I made that good promo image for Phantom's Adventure.

3114
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:19,360
Phantom's Adventure is really proud of how that came out.

3115
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:21,360
That looks pretty good.

3116
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:24,360
Anyway, next one is called

3117
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:27,360
saintcomics.com

3118
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:29,360
slash patreon.com

3119
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:31,360
slash bensaint.com

3120
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:34,360
three, two, one, go.

3121
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:35,360
Okay, last one.

3122
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:37,360
I want to let you know about

3123
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:39,360
saintcomics.com's mobile phone issue.

3124
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:42,360
When you try to read stuff on it,

3125
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:45,360
a.k.a. Slamming Punishment or whatever,

3126
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:49,360
it gets cut off on the left-hand side slightly.

3127
02:42:49,360 --> 02:42:50,360
Does it?

3128
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:51,360
Just enough to be annoying.

3129
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:52,360
Let me.

3130
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:54,360
And it's not centered.

3131
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:59,360
And I guess phone compatibility is kind of a big thing these days.

3132
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:01,360
You might want to try and get fixed out.

3133
02:43:01,360 --> 02:43:02,360
Yeah, let me.

3134
02:43:02,360 --> 02:43:04,360
I've been reading on PC though.

3135
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:05,360
It's cool.

3136
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:06,360
Bye-bye.

3137
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:07,360
Let me take a look at this.

3138
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:11,360
Saintcomics.com.

3139
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:13,360
I'm gone on my phone.

3140
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:14,360
Same.

3141
02:43:14,360 --> 02:43:15,360
Oh, it does.

3142
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:16,360
It's not.

3143
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,360
Yeah, it's not centered.

3144
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:19,360
Ugh.

3145
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:25,360
Yeah, what's up with that?

3146
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:26,360
Damn.

3147
02:43:26,360 --> 02:43:31,360
Oh, yeah, it is left-leaning.

3148
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:32,360
Hmm.

3149
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:34,360
Oh, it's not even like I can.

3150
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:38,360
I can't even like move it back into the center.

3151
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:40,360
It's actually just cut off.

3152
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:45,360
Who would have thought it would be left-leaning?

3153
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:46,360
Hmm.

3154
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:48,360
Like, I can look at...

3155
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:51,360
Okay, the other comics are...

3156
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:54,360
Okay, this is actually really weird.

3157
02:43:54,360 --> 02:44:03,360
Okay, when I go to the, like, the contents page, the background is...

3158
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:04,360
The page is centered.

3159
02:44:04,360 --> 02:44:09,360
But all the individual, like, pages are, yeah, like, they're not centered.

3160
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:11,360
They're left aligned.

3161
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:12,360
Ah, jeez.

3162
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:14,360
Ah, this sucks.

3163
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:19,360
It must be just some, like, like a alignment thing you can change.

3164
02:44:19,360 --> 02:44:22,360
If the main menu, because I don't know the main menu.

3165
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:23,360
It's like, that works.

3166
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:24,360
Perhaps.

3167
02:44:24,360 --> 02:44:26,360
If it's Chapter 2, it's all going to the left.

3168
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:27,360
I will...

3169
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:29,360
I will fuck around with it.

3170
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:33,360
This is actually going to be a nightmare to test, though, because I will have to, like,

3171
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:34,360
literally...

3172
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:38,360
I'll have to literally put it on the website, because I have to look it on my phone and

3173
02:44:38,360 --> 02:44:39,360
I can't...

3174
02:44:39,360 --> 02:44:40,360
Ugh.

3175
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:45,360
I'll have to upload, like, a test page that I can view on my phone and then, like, fuck

3176
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:47,360
around with it and see what happens.

3177
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:48,360
I'm curious.

3178
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:50,360
I was curious about giveandtake.site.

3179
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:55,360
I have seen my website before, and I always found it amusing, even though it's terrible,

3180
02:44:55,360 --> 02:45:02,360
that the top of it says giveandtake and then e is on, like, another line underneath.

3181
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:04,360
That seems on-brand, though.

3182
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:05,360
It seems on-brand.

3183
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:07,360
Site.

3184
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:09,360
Let me check this out.

3185
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:11,360
I click on load of ghosts.

3186
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:12,360
Yeah, giveandtake.

3187
02:45:12,360 --> 02:45:16,360
It cuts the e off.

3188
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:17,360
That rules.

3189
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:20,360
The images are centered, though, so that's pretty good.

3190
02:45:20,360 --> 02:45:23,360
Yeah, so you got that on me.

3191
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:30,360
I really got to redo a lot of my site.

3192
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:34,360
It's so, like, amateur looking.

3193
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:37,360
I want it to be good, but I'm stupid.

3194
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:40,360
It's a big problem.

3195
02:45:40,360 --> 02:45:42,360
Oh, did oblivion fall?

3196
02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:43,360
Did you just make this?

3197
02:45:43,360 --> 02:45:45,360
No, I found it.

3198
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:48,360
Damn.

3199
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:49,360
Doctrine purist.

3200
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:50,360
This is a small image.

3201
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:54,360
I'm trying to find a bigger image in Google.

3202
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:55,360
Doctrine purist.

3203
02:45:55,360 --> 02:45:56,360
A wheel has an axe.

3204
02:45:56,360 --> 02:45:59,360
A wheel is the connection between a vehicle and the ground.

3205
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:00,360
Doctrine neutral.

3206
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:03,360
A wheel propels something.

3207
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:06,360
Conveyor rolls and wheels.

3208
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:08,360
Doctrine radical wheel rotates.

3209
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:09,360
A structure purist.

3210
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:13,360
A wheel is cylindrical and has a rubber surface.

3211
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:15,360
But what about wooden wheels?

3212
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:16,360
That would still be a wheel.

3213
02:46:16,360 --> 02:46:18,360
What would be structure neutral?

3214
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:22,360
I feel like tank road wheels is a weird example to use for radical.

3215
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:24,360
Because, like, you could think of way more.

3216
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:28,360
Like, if all you care about is that it rotates.

3217
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:29,360
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3218
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:32,360
But then it's a structure purist.

3219
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,360
Okay, yeah.

3220
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:34,360
Cogs or wheels.

3221
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:35,360
Clock hands are wheels.

3222
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:36,360
Yeah, okay.

3223
02:46:36,360 --> 02:46:37,360
Got it, got it.

3224
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:41,360
Yeah, I feel like our definitions were more good.

3225
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:44,360
Yeah, yours are more like the ones in this image.

3226
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:46,360
A pizza is a wheel.

3227
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:50,360
Built to roll.

3228
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:54,360
I like the atoms are wheels and doors.

3229
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:56,360
That's the real shit.

3230
02:46:56,360 --> 02:46:57,360
Dude, revolving doors?

3231
02:46:57,360 --> 02:47:00,360
Like, what do we even make of that?

3232
02:47:00,360 --> 02:47:01,360
Well, it revolves.

3233
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:02,360
But it doesn't roll.

3234
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:04,360
A rolling hill is a wheel.

3235
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:06,360
A Rick Roll is a wheel.

3236
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:09,360
This was a really good, actually.

3237
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:13,360
Hell, yeah.

3238
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:14,360
Anything that rolls.

3239
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:15,360
Roll your own crypto.

3240
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:16,360
What does that mean?

3241
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:17,360
A joint.

3242
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:19,360
I don't know what that means.

3243
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:22,360
Maybe I like to keep it that way.

3244
02:47:22,360 --> 02:47:24,360
All right.

3245
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:30,360
Next voicemail is called, there it is, it's called, well, it's got an image.

3246
02:47:31,360 --> 02:47:34,360
Okay, the voicemail is just a little stupid thing.

3247
02:47:34,360 --> 02:47:36,360
Anyway, here's the image that goes with it.

3248
02:47:41,360 --> 02:47:43,360
Is that supposed to be not a penis?

3249
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:46,360
I believe it is not supposed to be a penis.

3250
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:49,360
It's just your beanie flopping over.

3251
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:54,360
The fact that you thought that's what it was, says more about you than it does about you.

3252
02:47:54,360 --> 02:48:00,360
Someone needs to redraw this even more detail, shinier.

3253
02:48:00,360 --> 02:48:02,360
Yeah, I agree.

3254
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:03,360
Make it shinier, please.

3255
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:05,360
I would disagree.

3256
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:12,360
Okay, next one is, we're almost done, there's like two more.

3257
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:17,360
Next one is, Slime times weekend update number four.

3258
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:19,360
There it is.

3259
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:21,360
Three, two, one, go.

3260
02:48:21,360 --> 02:48:23,360
Why hello, gangsters.

3261
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:26,360
Welcome back to the Slime times weekend update.

3262
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:31,360
This week, Liam, creator of among other things, the R-O-C-K comic Vile,

3263
02:48:31,360 --> 02:48:35,360
has after a long history of rowdyhood, decided to turn to the killers.

3264
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:37,360
Oh, shit.

3265
02:48:37,360 --> 02:48:41,360
But on the day of the gang swap, he expressed displeasure with the rowdy leadership

3266
02:48:41,360 --> 02:48:44,360
in the form of the rowdy ring leaders.

3267
02:48:44,360 --> 02:48:50,360
We're following the story as it develops to see whether Liam settles nicely into the edgy hymns and vape clouds

3268
02:48:50,360 --> 02:48:54,360
or finally decides to put on his anarchy pant and burn down the cathedral.

3269
02:48:54,360 --> 02:48:56,360
Liam's art is good.

3270
02:48:56,360 --> 02:48:57,360
He's welcome.

3271
02:48:57,360 --> 02:49:03,360
Tim Warner Core, a sentient carrot, has returned to active play and is down with the clown.

3272
02:49:03,360 --> 02:49:09,360
He immediately won Realist Rowdies for the month of February and has a snazzy new Wild West look.

3273
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:17,360
Finally, on the game development side, attention was turned to the many typos persisting in our text-based MMORPG.

3274
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:21,360
I wouldn't know or care, because rowdies can't read.

3275
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:25,360
But for those literate among us, the fixes to this should come as a nice surprise.

3276
02:49:25,360 --> 02:49:27,360
That's it for this week.

3277
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:30,360
And remember, the slime time is the best time.

3278
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:32,360
Uh, awesome.

3279
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:33,360
That reminds me.

3280
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:34,360
Oh, shit.

3281
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:35,360
Uh, I owe...

3282
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:39,360
Okay, I owed a couple people printsep items for winning a contest.

3283
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:43,360
Oh, someone just messaged me the other day.

3284
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:46,360
They finally fixed the create command.

3285
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:51,360
I was not able to make those printseps because the create command was bugged.

3286
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:54,360
But no, it got fixed, and now I gotta remember.

3287
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:56,360
I actually have to go and do it.

3288
02:49:56,360 --> 02:49:57,360
Okay.

3289
02:49:57,360 --> 02:49:59,360
Uh, and I will.

3290
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:00,360
I'm glad.

3291
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:01,360
This has reminded me.

3292
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:08,360
Uh, I've owed zombie paper a printsep for, like, months.

3293
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:11,360
Uh, we'll get assorted.

3294
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:13,360
Um, okay, that was fun.

3295
02:50:13,360 --> 02:50:15,360
Next, this is the last one.

3296
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:18,360
It's called Rip the Big N.

3297
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:20,360
Three, two, one, go.

3298
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:21,360
Hello, cameras.

3299
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:22,360
Nikolai here.

3300
02:50:22,360 --> 02:50:25,360
Nikolai, I have something important to tell you today.

3301
02:50:25,360 --> 02:50:28,360
But first, Nikolai, go and get some vodka.

3302
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:31,360
Nikolai, be right back.

3303
02:50:31,360 --> 02:50:32,360
Do-do-do-do-do.

3304
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:33,360
What's this?

3305
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:35,360
Nikolai, you have no vodka?

3306
02:50:35,360 --> 02:50:36,360
No!

3307
02:50:36,360 --> 02:50:39,360
Nikolai, you don't live without vodka.

3308
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:40,360
Uh-oh.

3309
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:44,360
Nikolai, are you feeling the effects of no vodka?

3310
02:50:44,360 --> 02:50:45,360
Ugh.

3311
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:46,360
Ugh.

3312
02:50:46,360 --> 02:50:48,360
It's so sick.

3313
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:49,360
Ugh.

3314
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:51,360
Nikolai, dying.

3315
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:53,360
This would happen to me also.

3316
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:57,360
Nikolai, I would like to tell you that he-

3317
02:50:57,360 --> 02:50:59,360
Oh, no!

3318
02:50:59,360 --> 02:51:00,360
No!

3319
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:03,360
Nikolai, you've been taken too soon.

3320
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:04,360
No!

3321
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:06,360
Just ever so slightly too soon.

3322
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:07,360
Just very slightly.

3323
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:09,360
It would have been fine if he died like 10 seconds later.

3324
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:10,360
Yeah.

3325
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:13,360
But he's taken exactly 10 seconds too soon, yeah.

3326
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:15,360
Hard to agree.

3327
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:23,360
Nikolai is, um, if, uh, if J.K. Rowling had written a Russian character, a Russian student

3328
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:27,360
at Hogwarts, he would be Nikolai.

3329
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:28,360
She did.

3330
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:29,360
She did.

3331
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:30,360
He was called Viktor Krum.

3332
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:31,360
No, he was Bulgarian.

3333
02:51:31,360 --> 02:51:32,360
Was he?

3334
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:33,360
Yeah.

3335
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:34,360
I'm almost-

3336
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:35,360
Well-

3337
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:36,360
Well, he was Romanian.

3338
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:39,360
Romanian, yeah, I think so.

3339
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:42,360
Romanian sounds right to me.

3340
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:46,360
He was the Paul-

3341
02:51:46,360 --> 02:51:47,360
No, the-

3342
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:49,360
No, he was Bulgarian.

3343
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:50,360
He was Bulgarian.

3344
02:51:50,360 --> 02:51:51,360
I was right.

3345
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:53,360
From Durham Strang.

3346
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:55,360
The Durham Strang Institute.

3347
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:56,360
Yes.

3348
02:51:56,360 --> 02:51:58,360
Seeker on the Bulgarian national-

3349
02:51:58,360 --> 02:51:59,360
Yep, yep, yep.

3350
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:00,360
Dab.

3351
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:01,360
Uh, alright.

3352
02:52:01,360 --> 02:52:02,360
The nightmare is over.

3353
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:03,360
No more voicemails.

3354
02:52:03,360 --> 02:52:07,360
Nikolai Vodkozinski, that would be the name she comes up with.

3355
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:08,360
Vodkozinski.

3356
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:11,360
Like Ted Kozinski.

3357
02:52:11,360 --> 02:52:13,360
I like it.

3358
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:16,360
Alright, what are we at?

3359
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:18,360
Did we hit three hours?

3360
02:52:18,360 --> 02:52:21,360
We're five minutes away from three hours.

3361
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:22,360
Damn.

3362
02:52:22,360 --> 02:52:25,360
If we wrap up, we can have glowing visuals.

3363
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:26,360
Hooray!

3364
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:28,360
Just what we always wanted.

3365
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:30,360
Um, well, I mean-

3366
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:32,360
I remember to play Pumpkin Alley.

3367
02:52:32,360 --> 02:52:34,360
That demo is-

3368
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:36,360
You play it and stuff.

3369
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:37,360
Absolutely.

3370
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:39,360
Yeah, I mean, I would hope that everyone has played it.

3371
02:52:39,360 --> 02:52:40,360
But if they haven't-

3372
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:41,360
If you haven't not.

3373
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:44,360
Yeah, definitely check out the Pumpkin Alley demo.

3374
02:52:44,360 --> 02:52:46,360
Uh,

3375
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:48,360
Obviously.

3376
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:49,360
Obviously.

3377
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:50,360
Play my game too.

3378
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:51,360
I made a game.

3379
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:52,360
It's out.

3380
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:53,360
It's called Phantom's Revenge.

3381
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:54,360
Uh, it's-

3382
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:55,360
It's hard.

3383
02:52:55,360 --> 02:52:56,360
I bet-

3384
02:52:56,360 --> 02:52:58,360
I bet the people listening right now

3385
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:59,360
can't even beat it.

3386
02:52:59,360 --> 02:53:01,360
Because they're stupid.

3387
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:02,360
Oh!

3388
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:03,360
Did I mention?

3389
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:04,360
Did I mention?

3390
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:06,360
I guess I'll mention it now.

3391
02:53:06,360 --> 02:53:09,360
The only way to read the end of Slime and Punishment

3392
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:10,360
is to beat it.

3393
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:12,360
If you can't beat the game,

3394
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:15,360
you don't get the link to the final-

3395
02:53:15,360 --> 02:53:16,360
to the final chapter,

3396
02:53:16,360 --> 02:53:18,360
and you'll never see the ending.

3397
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:19,360
Damn.

3398
02:53:19,360 --> 02:53:20,360
It's the only way to do it.

3399
02:53:20,360 --> 02:53:21,360
There's no way-

3400
02:53:21,360 --> 02:53:22,360
It cannot be cheated.

3401
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:23,360
There's no work around.

3402
02:53:23,360 --> 02:53:26,360
There's no way to-

3403
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:27,360
to do any-

3404
02:53:27,360 --> 02:53:28,360
It's impossible.

3405
02:53:28,360 --> 02:53:30,360
It simply can't be done.

3406
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:31,360
You gotta-

3407
02:53:31,360 --> 02:53:33,360
You gotta beat the game.

3408
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:36,360
To find out what happens to Phantomhorn.

3409
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:39,360
Will he get his revenge?

3410
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:41,360
Or will he be killed?

3411
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:42,360
I guess if you lose the game,

3412
02:53:42,360 --> 02:53:44,360
he will be killed.

3413
02:53:44,360 --> 02:53:45,360
Yes.

3414
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:47,360
Well, spoiler.

3415
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:49,360
Spoiler for when you lose the game,

3416
02:53:49,360 --> 02:53:50,360
that you die.

3417
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:51,360
Die.

3418
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:52,360
How dare you.

3419
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:53,360
Yeah.

3420
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:54,360
Uh-

3421
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:55,360
Ruin game.

3422
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:56,360
Alright.

3423
02:53:56,360 --> 02:53:58,360
Just letting everyone know that the stakes.

3424
02:53:58,360 --> 02:53:59,360
The stakes are high.

3425
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:01,360
You know, for the reader as well,

3426
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:02,360
as for the character.

3427
02:54:02,360 --> 02:54:04,360
That's called a narrative-

3428
02:54:04,360 --> 02:54:06,360
Ludo narrative-

3429
02:54:06,360 --> 02:54:08,360
Distinence.

3430
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:09,360
Consonance.

3431
02:54:09,360 --> 02:54:11,360
So they work together.

3432
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:13,360
It's good play conditioning.

3433
02:54:13,360 --> 02:54:15,360
That's good conveyance.

3434
02:54:15,360 --> 02:54:17,360
Uh, video games.

3435
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:19,360
Video games.

3436
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:22,360
Link in the description for that.

3437
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:25,360
Ludo narrative synergy is the word.

3438
02:54:25,360 --> 02:54:26,360
Syngism.

3439
02:54:26,360 --> 02:54:27,360
Syngism.

3440
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:28,360
Fine.

3441
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:29,360
Alright.

3442
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:33,360
That's all I have to say about that this week.

3443
02:54:33,360 --> 02:54:35,360
Uh, you guys-

3444
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:36,360
Oblivion fall.

3445
02:54:36,360 --> 02:54:37,360
What do you gotta say?

3446
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:40,360
Uh, I gotta say, uh,

3447
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:41,360
I don't know,

3448
02:54:41,360 --> 02:54:43,360
I'm not gonna be working on that animation for like two weeks

3449
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:45,360
because I have to do a DA games thing,

3450
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:46,360
and I'm sad.

3451
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:47,360
So I would say,

3452
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:49,360
it would be out this week,

3453
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:51,360
but it's gonna have to wait two weeks,

3454
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:52,360
and then it'll be out a week after that.

3455
02:54:52,360 --> 02:54:53,360
I cry.

3456
02:54:53,360 --> 02:54:54,360
But what can I do?

3457
02:54:54,360 --> 02:54:57,360
That's like pretty soon, though.

3458
02:54:57,360 --> 02:54:59,360
Yeah, it's three weeks that we've done.

3459
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:01,360
Been working on that for a long time.

3460
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:03,360
Um, not because it's a big project,

3461
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:05,360
just because I was really inefficient

3462
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:07,360
during the first part of it,

3463
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:10,360
and then got delayed for like a month in January.

3464
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:11,360
Mmm, okay.

3465
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:12,360
Makes sense.

3466
02:55:12,360 --> 02:55:13,360
Alright.

3467
02:55:13,360 --> 02:55:15,360
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

3468
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:18,360
Uh, it's pretty good to be pretty good.

3469
02:55:18,360 --> 02:55:21,360
It's probably gonna be so good.

3470
02:55:21,360 --> 02:55:22,360
Alright.

3471
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:24,360
I guess, uh, I guess that's it.

3472
02:55:24,360 --> 02:55:26,360
That's the end of the podcast.

3473
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:28,360
Thanks for coming on.

3474
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:30,360
Uh, thanks for listening, everybody.

3475
02:55:30,360 --> 02:55:32,360
I'll see you next week.

3476
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:34,360
Uh, next week, uh,

3477
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:36,360
send me a message telling me

3478
02:55:36,360 --> 02:55:38,360
how you couldn't beat an adventure

3479
02:55:38,360 --> 02:55:39,360
because it was too hard.

3480
02:55:39,360 --> 02:55:40,360
Hahaha.

3481
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:41,360
Okay, goodbye.

3482
02:55:41,360 --> 02:55:42,360
Bye.

3483
02:55:42,360 --> 02:55:43,360
Goodbye.
