00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,440
Hello everyone, and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,160
We are delighted to have you back once again with all my best friends, except for Ben,

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,680
because he's fucking farting up a storm over there.

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Gay.

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
What do you have to say for yourself, Ben?

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,000
I think that money is gay, and I hate you.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Understand.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Digi is here.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Yeah.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
As is Geoff.

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Yeah, that's me.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,300
In his mom's courthouse.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,960
Geoff returning for the first time in like months.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Oh man, true.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
That's right, actually.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
I've been busy.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,360
What a cloud has been cast over this lovely podcast of ours.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
What's the last time influences?

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Uh...

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Geez, really?

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Maybe.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
That was a long time ago.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,440
That was his first one, so that would mean he was only on one.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
No, no.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
I've been on a couple.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,880
I think the last one I was on was Selling Out, which is perfect for this.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
And our friend, Endless Jazz, is here.

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
That's right.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,240
Now I want to give a big shout out, a big thank you to me for that brilliant job I did

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,360
putting together The Plebe and the Weeb, the greatest two guys talking about shows

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,280
and drinking beer show in the history of YouTube.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,160
The definitive one, the only one that's ever existed.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I invented it.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
I made it.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,760
And I made it so goddamn good that I'm now a millionaire.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
So thank you.

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
And that's what we're here to talk about today.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Thank you, Endless Jazz.

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Thank you, and you're welcome.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
And you're welcome to Endless Jazz.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Yes.

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Thank you.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
We all are thankful.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,760
And the topic of today's podcast is crowdfunding.

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,600
And by the way, there just so happens to be an urban dictionary definition of crowdfunding

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
that I pulled up ahead of time.

47
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,600
All right, so here we go.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Crowdfunding.

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
The number one definition.

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I love that this show is urban.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
I love that we keep it straight in this podcast.

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Yeah, we really do.

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Yes.

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,640
All right, so our definition that we'll be using and not deviating from the slightest

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,040
is crowdfunding.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Hipster slash tech speak translated to quote, begging for money over the internet.

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
And that's exactly what it is.

58
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
That's what I would have said.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
Hashtag soliciting, hashtag begging.

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,560
A noble calling only for the bravest of champions.

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
And we've got a few of them.

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
In fact, every single one of us.

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,480
Every single person on this podcast is a crowdfunding millionaire.

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,560
In fact, one person on this podcast is a crowdfunding website, patreon.com slash bensane.

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
That's right.

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
That's right.

67
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I invented the market and then cornered it.

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
Turning every dream into a plan and then fulfilling it.

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,520
So I mean, everyone listening, everyone listening probably already knows what crowdfunding is.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,520
And if not, there's an easy way for you to learn is to go to patreon.com slash your best

71
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
guy ever.

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Or patreon.com slash a million dollars.

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,160
And it's already disgusting.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
This is already a disgusting podcast.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
I agree.

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
The people love it.

77
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
The people love it.

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
All right.

79
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
This is what money does to people.

80
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
This is what money does to people.

81
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,400
And that's why you can't be implicit in the system.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
You got to rage.

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Rage against the garbage.

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
This is coming from the wall.

85
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
I want to hear that from you, Ben.

86
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
From patreon.com slash bensane.

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,480
You ruined Corona's life with all that hot Nuzlocke money.

88
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,560
You ruined his life.

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
You made him a wreck of a man.

90
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
He's depressed.

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,080
He won't come out of the toilet.

92
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
I think it's a transitional phase he's in.

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
I think he's going to come out of it stronger.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, I hope so.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,720
I mean, I hope so too.

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
Did you, you were saying something of substance, I think?

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Yeah.

98
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Please continue.

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,280
This isn't the podcast for that.

100
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,520
Get the fuck out of here.

101
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,040
I want the biggest, greenest arrow with the biggest implying in all caps right next to

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
that statement.

103
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Yeah.

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,280
But, yeah, no, Ben, patreon.com slash bensane here, who's just coming off the heels of a

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
very successful Indiegogo campaign.

106
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,840
It was GoFundMe, but yeah, same thing.

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,760
To fund a computer that you built and as well as a 3DS with a capture card so that you

108
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,520
could do a Nuzlocke.

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
But yeah, Ben's computer is almost done.

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
His squat racks finally finished unrelated.

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
That was a crowdfung.

112
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Yeah, so I should just say about the GoFundMe that, like, I mean, I saw Monkey had done

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,920
a GoFundMe for a capture card and I was kind of inspired by him and I went and I did mine

114
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,600
for my computer that I really needed a new one, but I couldn't afford one.

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,160
I feel a little bit like Monkey has become the new drowning in footwear and that he's

116
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
the guy that everyone's like, oh, remember what that guy did?

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
He's so awesome.

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
He's so cool.

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,120
I want to do things like that guy.

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Well, no, maybe.

121
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I guess.

122
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I agree.

123
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Monkey is an inspiration.

124
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
I love you, though, Monkey.

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
A scholar.

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Well, yeah.

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,320
So we're also coming on, this is literally, we're at the very end of day one of a 30-day

128
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,880
Kickstarter that I've launched with Mr. Endless Jess in order to fund-

129
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,320
He says launched with me, but I had no idea this was happening.

130
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah.

131
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
No.

132
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
I just woke up a millionaire.

133
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,760
That's the end of the story.

134
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,600
You know, kids, if you follow your dreams, someday you'll wake up and one of your friends

135
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,400
will have made you a millionaire.

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,000
You knew before you went to bed that this was going to- that a Kickstarter was in the

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
worst.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, like, we had been talking about it.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,040
Yeah, we should do a Kickstarter and all this.

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
And I'm like, yeah, okay, sure, whatever.

142
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,360
Because like, my general philosophy with all things in life is that eventually someone

143
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,040
will do it for me.

144
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,360
And once again, I was proven right because I was like, yeah, sure, it's Kickstarter,

145
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
whatever, sounds great.

146
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
So then I wake up today.

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360
I wake up in my bed surrounded by all my women.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,160
I've got all these women here.

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,960
You know, it's like in the Feel Good, Inc. video when Murdoch wakes up and he's got

150
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,200
all those babes around him, all those, all those fine sluts.

151
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,080
You've got Asuka, you've got fucking-

152
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Yeah.

153
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
And I go over-

154
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,320
I was so turned on by that highly problematic scene.

155
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,560
And I go over and I look out the window and off in the clouds I see Digi on a windmill

156
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,720
playing guitar with a fucking kickstarter behind him bringing all this money into my castle.

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,840
Wait, no, this metaphor doesn't end well, that's when the windmill gets shot down.

158
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,720
And then I just picture off on the side, Colt Corona just walking and singing, Patreon,

159
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,920
Patreon, Patreon, kickstarter for me.

160
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,000
I can, whatever, things, things related to that song.

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,320
That's as creative as Colt Corona could probably have been about that.

163
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,960
Yes, I was in character.

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm sure there's some line in there about his giant dong or some shit.

165
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,920
He tends to shoehorn that in wherever he can.

166
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
He really does.

167
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,000
But don't be fooled, people.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's still such a void in Jesse's empty soul that could only be filled by more money.

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's true.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't give up.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,080
And if you toss in even more money, you'll be able to see even more cool people in videos

172
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
with Digi.

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
Yes, you'll get to see Hippo and Nate, cool people.

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,760
And also, Jeff might show up.

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Maybe.

176
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm not a cool person.

177
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm just advocating for the rest of them.

178
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,000
Do we have a, is there a numerical goal for that tier?

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,640
Yeah, it's a 5,000 for you and Hippo and then another 400 for Jeff.

180
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,960
All right, there you go, folks.

181
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,040
So yeah.

182
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,160
And after that, all the money will just go into Jesse's pocket, essentially, because

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,560
he's adding this thing and it's mostly his work.

184
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,080
And I can assure everyone it'll be spent wisely.

185
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,560
And we're talking about 26 episodes at this point, right?

186
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
That's correct.

187
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
20 episodes.

188
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,720
They're not going to be all filmed at once.

189
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,120
It's going to be like, you know, we're going to do season one and then like six months

190
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,880
later we'll just fly Jesse down again with the remainder of the money.

191
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,000
Because like, Jesse doesn't, I'm sure, does not want to have to edit 20 fucking episodes

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
of this at once.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or for his wife.

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Even three nearly killed the man.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't think he wants his life to be filmed.

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,240
You know what this reminds me of, actually?

199
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,760
I was watching the DVD commentary of Seinfeld of the early episodes, at least I think with

200
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
the DVD commentary.

201
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
It might have been an interview.

202
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,760
But they were talking about the process through which Larry David had to write the scripts

203
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,960
for the show and he was talking about at first there was a pilot and he immediately wanted

204
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,400
to kill himself, that he had to write a pilot.

205
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
It was already done.

206
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,600
But then the show got picked up and he had to make like a four episode season, season

207
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,240
like zero, season one.

208
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,720
And he also at that point he knew there was no, there was no saving him.

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,360
He had to die, but he somehow got it done.

210
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,160
And then it came time to write like a 26 episode season and at that point every shred of the

211
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
man had been eroded away.

212
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,240
There was only a husk where love and trust had once been.

213
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,040
And that's how we get the Larry David of today.

214
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
And that's how we get the movie.

215
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,920
And I just imagine the same thing happening to Jesse.

216
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,440
Yeah, that's right.

217
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,880
Jerry, Jerry by the way, was fine.

218
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,800
Jerry, he didn't really write as much as Larry, so let's see his personality that just let

219
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
things roll.

220
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Anyway, who cares about fucking Seinfeld?

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I don't know.

222
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I care about Seinfeld.

223
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
He's a bee.

224
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah, fuck him.

225
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Yeah, fuck that guy.

226
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Nice, he's cool.

227
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
He is a bee after all.

228
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:10,080
So, so in addition to these Kickstarter and other campaigns thing, we all, every single

229
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,840
one of us has a Patreon that run in slightly different ways, but in general they are sources

230
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,720
of funding that allow us to do the stuff we're doing.

231
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
And by the way, the rest of us all can entirely subsist off of our Patreon.

232
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
That's exactly what I was going to say.

233
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
And add money.

234
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
And add money.

235
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
That's true.

236
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Right, yeah.

237
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Oh, look at these guys with their add money.

238
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Well, actually, I mean, I make like, I'm making a substantial amount of cash this month

239
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
from just shelling for various companies.

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, right.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's true.

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Which is something we should all get into in a good way.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not crowdfunding.

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, that's true.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,720
That is not crowdfunding, it's not part of the conversation.

246
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,080
When I get my ad revenue checked from YouTube every six months or in the mail for a fucking

247
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,720
like $10, it feels like I got the golden ticket.

248
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
It's such a rare occurrence.

249
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,640
It's like when they had the jury in Clerk's The Animated Series and it's like, well, they

250
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
gave us $5 for breakfast today.

251
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
I hope this trial never ends.

252
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,160
That's how I feel when I get my fucking yearly $2 of ad revenue.

253
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
It gets lower every time I mention it.

254
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Yeah.

255
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,440
If we ever get paid for T-Batben, I don't know if we did.

256
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
We got like, I want to say $130 at one point.

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,040
Yeah, we got like slightly over $100 for like well over a million views.

258
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,480
We got well over a million views, like $100 and that was it.

259
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
So thanks, YouTube.

260
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
You're the best.

261
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,360
Yeah, no, ad revenue is so unreliable that like, I don't check it at all.

262
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,760
I never look at what I'm making, like maybe once a month, I'll take a glance just to see

263
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,000
if I'm like, you know, doing better or worse than the previous month, but I plan all of

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,600
my finances just around Patreon so that every time YouTube money does show up, it's a huge

265
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
surprise.

266
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
And it's like, oh my God, I'm rich.

267
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
I have all the sex money.

268
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,640
Let's talk about like the $10,000 or so that YouTube owes me for my fucking Bats video

269
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,480
that they siphoned all the aggregate wall that got like 10 billion views and I've never

270
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
seen a penny from it.

271
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Inexplicably.

272
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,040
Well, yeah, yeah, that's that's that shit Craig.

273
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,680
But you know, I was going to say, it's really interesting to me that shit Craig got.

274
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
That just about sums it up, guys.

275
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
It's really interesting to me.

276
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,840
You know how this thing happened recently where like videos were getting demonetized

277
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,760
and everyone was freaking out because like, oh, all the YouTube guys are going to go under.

278
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,800
But like, it's interesting that pretty much all of us are talking like our primary source

279
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,560
of income, at least for you, Digi, of the primary source of income is Patreon.

280
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,720
So like, you're not even really depending on the ad revenue that is sort of being pulled

281
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,200
from some people, whereas other creators are like freaking out because it is.

282
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
Patreon has definitely changed the model.

283
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
It's changed the game.

284
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,880
And for two reasons, and this will get into some of the deeper stuff, like on the one

285
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,800
hand, it's just that ad revenue is so, so unreliable.

286
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,320
And also, I think a business model that's dying.

287
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,360
I think it's going out because ads on it, I've seen, you know, a bunch of studies basically

288
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,080
saying that ads on the internet aren't actually making anybody money.

289
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,960
Like everyone's assuming they should be making money.

290
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,560
Everyone thinks that it's like, you know, it sounds like a good idea on paper, but it's

291
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,920
not like, it's not nearly making back what it's being, what's being spent on it, you

292
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,200
know, like the, the, the paying for ad space is not having enough returns for the advertisers

293
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
in the first place.

294
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,040
So eventually advertising has to either transform or die, you know, it's, it's going in that

295
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,680
direction where people just have to really consider what they're actually trying to advertise

296
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,840
on YouTube, make sure it's super relevant to what people are, you know, watching.

297
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,680
And then, you know, some of the paid endorsements are a better way of doing that, which is why

298
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,280
those are getting popular and why guys like Jeff are, you know, doing some of the endorsement

299
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,200
deals, but, um, but beyond that, I mean, the thing is like paid endorsements, they're

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
fun, they're fun for everybody.

301
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,880
If you do them right, if you do them wrong, it's like, oh, hey, Rob Schneider's on Game

302
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Grumps.

303
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
What? Yeah.

304
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,920
Was he, was that a, I mean, I don't think that was paid.

305
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,280
I don't think that was paid, but it like feels weird and uncomfortable.

306
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
It was a shitty episode.

307
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I watched it and I don't really watch Game Grumps, did not enjoy it.

308
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Yeah.

309
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,080
But like the point that I'm making is like, when you have, when you have fun with doing

310
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,120
a paid endorsement, it's like, it connects better with the audience because it's the

311
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,040
type of content that they're actually there for as opposed to something completely different

312
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
that's being tossed on.

313
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Yeah.

314
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,360
Yeah. I mean, the reason I'm comfortable doing crunchy roll ads is because I legitimately

315
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
use crunchy roll.

316
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,560
I watched most of my anime on there because it's fucking convenient, you know, for me

317
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,760
because I, you know, live in the United States and don't have half the shows blocked.

318
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,120
But like, you know, I'm endorsing something I actually believe in.

319
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,280
And even then half of the time I do it as like a fake mock, you know, ad, like I'm usually

320
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,560
shitting on whatever show.

321
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,480
And then I'm like, oh, by the way, it's on crunchy roll.

322
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,600
If for some reason you want cancer, you know, and that works.

323
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,240
People really respond well to that.

324
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,480
And that's going to get me into why I believe so strongly in crowdfunding because I really

325
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,360
think it's the most respectable way to get money.

326
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,520
And like it's it's funny because I feel like most people feel the opposite.

327
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,600
And I did too.

328
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,960
When I first started, like I really didn't want to ask people for money.

329
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,400
I wanted it to be all through, you know, through ad revenue, because I was like,

330
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,040
that's so corporate and, you know, disconnected.

331
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,400
And it's like, you know, I'm just I'm just doing a job.

332
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,720
I'm just getting paid by the machine.

333
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,160
You know, that's how money should flow.

334
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,240
It should all be structured and stuff.

335
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,560
But like that is actually the opposite of how it should be.

336
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,920
It should be organic.

337
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,400
It should be people choosing exactly where their dollar goes and why it's going there,

338
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,520
you know, and I have to earn every single fucking dollar that I make.

339
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,320
It has to like for me to get paid, I have to impress people.

340
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,560
My work has to be something people want to see.

341
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
It can't be something advertisers want.

342
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,720
It can't be something that the mainstream media did just died.

343
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,080
No, he died and he took my Kickstarter money with him.

344
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,040
That's now that's a tragedy right there.

345
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,880
I was just giving an impassioned speech about fuck the fuck the advertisers.

346
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,400
But like, you know, it's just that, yeah, every single time someone pledges to me,

347
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,480
it's because they personally felt a connection to my content and wanted to support it,

348
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,040
you know, and like, and that's how I spend a lot of my money as well.

349
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,880
Is like, I I spend my money to vote with the dollar.

350
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
I don't really buy art for the sake of owning it.

351
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,720
I buy it for the sake of giving money to the people so that they know,

352
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,160
hey, someone out there appreciated your work enough to think that you should be

353
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,760
able to live off of it, you know.

354
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah. Yeah. And you know, it's interesting, you know,

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,840
however your personal feelings are about, you know,

356
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,640
like people having a patron or not, like even some artists do,

357
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,880
like Gibba was telling us the other day that what's his name?

358
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,400
Happy Harry cartoons, like the guy who makes that, he hates Patreon.

359
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,640
He like makes fun of people with patrons or something.

360
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,920
He hates Patreon. It makes fun.

361
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,160
Demolition D. There you go.

362
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,720
But why is it more?

363
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,600
Well, that's the thing. You have to think about trash, idiots, scum.

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,440
Well, all right, that's that's the thing, though.

365
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,360
Like you have to consider what are the alternatives and like what are the

366
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,040
what are the reasons for your belief and what are the alternatives?

367
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,640
If you don't like crowdfunding, then like theoretically,

368
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,840
you would think that their motivation is probably that they think that it's in

369
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,760
some way taking advantage of the fans' goodwill or something along those lines.

370
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,560
But I mean, does that argument really hold up because no one's forcing them to do it?

371
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,680
And I think a lot of it is a matter of there's so many people who have

372
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,480
and I'm just going to call it pretentiousness about like what deserves

373
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,480
to be paid for and what deserves to be considered art, you know?

374
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,240
Like there's there's there's still even among lots of critics and stuff,

375
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,000
there's still this mentality that anything that's derivative of another work

376
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
is lesser and not deserving of, you know, making money.

377
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,920
Like I hold that belief.

378
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,200
I hold that belief personally.

379
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,520
I mean, do you think that like that someone who draws like the shittiest

380
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,200
comic in the world should be getting paid more on Patreon than me?

381
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,160
Do you have a new personally advocated for

382
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,320
I mean, I mean, I mean, did you qualify with the shittiest

383
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,160
comment in the world and no, did you did you?

384
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,560
We already we already know that Ben thinks he should be paid more than you.

385
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,960
Well, that's true. That's true. I do believe.

386
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,960
But hey, wait a minute, Jeff, you fucker.

387
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,200
Jeff, the full implications of what you've said have sunk in

388
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,960
and I'm prepared to kill you for that.

389
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,120
That was a slow burn.

390
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
That was nice. That's that was a five alarm.

391
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,360
That's all right.

392
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,160
Samurai walks.

393
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,440
That's when the samurai slashes walks five steps.

394
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,680
Oh, yeah. She's the sword.

395
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,480
The blood. That was that was Thor.

396
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,040
That was Thor taking his eight steps or whatever

397
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,520
after he was bit by the by the Mjolnir serpents.

398
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,840
And yes, that's the five finger death punch.

399
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,360
But by the way, people,

400
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,320
if you want to see me be killed live on camera by Ben St.

401
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,200
Right.

402
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,160
Then you should get money to the plea of the lead Kickstarter.

403
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Absolutely true.

404
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
Shilling Kickstarter that we are.

405
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,440
I my superpower is shilling literally just like

406
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
true. Get me to record myself for 20 minutes.

407
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,280
That can be a starter video.

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
I knew there was something special about you.

409
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
I knew there was that X factor that made you a winner.

410
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,960
I feel like you've done that.

411
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,200
To get back to what I was saying, like, right, you know,

412
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I think there are some people who like really think that

413
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,120
if it's if it's original, regardless of the quality of it,

414
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,560
if it's original, it's more deserving.

415
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,360
Like Demolition D, you know, makes high quality YouTube videos

416
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,760
that some would say.

417
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,840
Some would. I used to make high quality YouTube videos.

418
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,680
He used to make videos at all.

419
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,920
But he used to make videos that that, you know, would be deserving

420
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,240
of, you know, making money from them, but he doesn't see it that way.

421
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,600
Meanwhile, he has this novella that he has on Amazon and he's selling it,

422
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,520
you know, because he sees it as this novella is my original work

423
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
that is worthy of being paid for, whereas my videos are not

424
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,040
because they're derivative, even though, you know, I mean,

425
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,600
I haven't read the novella, so I'm not going to say it's shittier than the videos.

426
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,360
But, you know, I think that's the mindset a lot of people have.

427
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,800
But that's not what the market is.

428
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,840
The market is people pay for what they want.

429
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,360
They want, you know, if people want derivative work, then it's, you know,

430
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,560
you might consider it unfortunate if that's not to your taste or whatever.

431
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
But again, I think that's pretentious.

432
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,040
The value of art lies solely with the people who place value in it.

433
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,680
And if people decide that something is worth their money,

434
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,000
then there's no fucking argument.

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,240
It is with their money because they decided to give their money.

436
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,840
And if you're going to sit there, you have to be you have to be a seriously

437
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,480
like arrogant egotistical twat to think that you're the sole arbiter

438
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,200
who gets to decide that something that someone made is not worth being paid for.

439
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,280
You know, you know, it's interesting because I think you guys are all

440
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,320
basically in agreement on that.

441
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,680
But I kind of I actually disagree with the part of that argument

442
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,560
because I've really racked my brain about what the usefulness

443
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,360
or like what the point of art is.

444
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,280
And the only answer that I was able to find was that it has like

445
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,440
that if a piece of art has a real world practical implications

446
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,960
about making the world a better place, that's the only way at the end of the day

447
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,520
that it has any value at all because art has a value in let's say

448
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,280
I get home from work and I want to kill myself.

449
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,800
And then I watch an episode of anime and now I don't want to kill myself.

450
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,840
That's that. Well, then that means that anime has done the world a disservice.

451
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,920
Let's be real. Yeah, that's true.

452
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,160
If you that was like, oh, man, another seven.

453
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,600
Jeff is all Jesus Christ.

454
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,640
That's what I'm here for.

455
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
Apparently, I bought today.

456
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,080
Oh, God.

457
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,880
Oh, brain dump is so good, though.

458
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,440
I was I was just going to say that I completely lost my point

459
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,920
after that savage blow from Jesus Christ.

460
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
It's all I've been I've been working.

461
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,200
I've been working at a shill video for the last like 30 hours straight

462
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,520
and and reediting and reediting is built up in your veins.

463
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,840
All that's going on in Jeff's brain is like, money, money, burns, money, burns,

464
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,920
burned the money.

465
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,400
I was something crossfire.

466
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
All the money's gone.

467
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,000
Right. I think I was going to say something along the lines of if you can do

468
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,320
sort of like, I mean, to expand from my point, if you can do like a social

469
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,520
experiment and determine whether or not there are like the the market forces

470
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,560
or just like the the the the social forces of like a given piece of art,

471
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,560
if they are trending towards a positive thing, like, you know, more people

472
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,920
are, I don't know, helping humanity in whatever factor that you can calculate.

473
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,200
Then it's a good thing if it is like making more people kill themselves

474
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
and making people unhappy.

475
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,480
That is how I would quantify a bad piece of art because it is causing bad things.

476
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,440
People kill themselves as opposed to there's got to be some amount of the

477
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,600
like unfathomable quantity that of people who like message everyone

478
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,360
who makes art and tells them, you saved me from depression.

479
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,440
You saved my life.

480
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,760
Wow. Your art has helped me to, you know, come to grips with the torturous

481
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,600
reality that is living, you know, that's the kind of messages I get all the time.

482
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,680
You know, that's great.

483
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,960
I mean, if if art does that, then that's obviously a positive influence.

484
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,360
But I'm just saying that this is my criteria.

485
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,160
This podcast has changed career trajectories for many fans who've written

486
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,320
in who have completely changed the way that they, you know, organize their lives

487
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,520
because of the advice we didn't go.

488
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,000
I had just today I read a letter from someone who was like trying to become

489
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,400
a scientist and then like she realized that, you know, my whole rant about

490
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,680
like how there's a difference between enjoying, you know, the idea of the thing

491
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,840
versus actually doing the thing.

492
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,560
And she's like, I realize I fucking hate doing science.

493
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,720
So, uh, oh, yeah, the world is descending into nothing but artists.

494
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,280
No one's going to do anything anymore because I want other people to do the science for me.

495
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no.

496
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,480
OK, OK. So it's slightly unfortunate that it happened to be a scientist doing

497
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,560
doing what you like. That only applies to us. OK.

498
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,360
That only applies to the people that are broadcasting this podcast.

499
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,680
Everybody else fucking make my sandwiches for me.

500
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,000
Please. Yeah, I would definitely rather have the science be done by people

501
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,360
who fucking love science than the people who, you know, are miserable

502
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,480
and just want to fucking get their damn paycheck and go home.

503
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,440
Let's let's get all the all the intellectuals on the Reddit board.

504
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,360
I fucking love science to do all our science for us. Perfect.

505
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,880
Is that a Reddit board? I thought that's a.

506
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,440
That's a real it's probably Facebook or whatever.

507
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,680
I don't keep up with the hip things going on with the kids with the Facebooks

508
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,600
and the tweet bots and the pictograms.

509
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,480
So I want to talk a little bit about how we've all had such fucking

510
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,720
successful crowdfunding campaigns, because I think there's there's sort

511
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,440
of a unifying factor with all of us, especially.

512
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,200
And like it's it's not that any of us have tried to like be

513
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,480
the the personality that gets this to work.

514
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,120
But like if you read all the advice given by Kickstarter and Patreon about

515
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,520
like what to do, it just happens to fit what we already are like,

516
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,080
which is to just be extremely honest and open about what like what you're

517
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,960
doing, what you're trying to do, what the money is for and like, you know,

518
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,720
how you feel about it.

519
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,040
And I think that honesty goes so far with people because like it's kind of

520
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,200
this whole model is kind of, you know, rejecting what I was just describing

521
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,040
of like the corporate ad culture where everything is so fake that

522
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,920
you literally know that, you know, that like everyone knows that ads are

523
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,920
a fake dolled up, gussied up version of just on Friday, by the way.

524
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,000
I mean, since I'm in the corporate world myself still, the like just on Friday,

525
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,840
we were having a meeting me and some of my coworkers and they were saying

526
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,560
that like no names, but like they had just nothing to do for the whole week.

527
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,240
And they were still getting a paycheck, but like that's the exact sort of

528
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,360
thing that would not be tolerated in a crowdfunding thing, you know, not delivering

529
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,200
your fans would fucking revolt on you as has happened plenty of times.

530
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,520
You know, and like that and just the the idea of ads.

531
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,120
There was a great super bunny hop just did a video about this, how like,

532
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,320
you know, in games nowadays, like there's they're trying to debate the legality

533
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,360
of whether like showing a blatant gameplay trailer, but styling it like

534
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,480
bullshots, legal bullshots, and like it's currently being considered legal

535
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,000
just because all advertising is like that.

536
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,040
So it's like what makes this we're used to being lied to.

537
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
So there's no crime here.

538
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,880
That's actually what the judge said.

539
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Like people are used to being lied to.

540
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,320
So no reasonable consumer would assume that this was real.

541
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,200
You know, that means that you have to raise your children and teach them

542
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,760
you are going to be lied to all the time in life.

543
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,800
Like there's no avoiding it.

544
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,440
You have to do it according to the system.

545
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,000
And it's so when people see someone who's just like blatantly being honest,

546
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,640
then it's like it's such a refreshing thing to just be like, yeah,

547
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm I'm giving my money to that guy.

548
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,840
And like, I think for for for us, especially, and I know this is certainly

549
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,520
true of me and Jesse, like, I think a lot of it also has to do with how loose

550
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,680
we are, that we never make like promises we can't keep.

551
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,680
We never try to make it sound better than it is, you know, like me or Jesse

552
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,560
will put out an update that's like, hey, I'm going to charge you guys for a

553
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,920
vlog. I need money, you know, and like, yeah, yeah, because like, I don't ever

554
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,000
want anyone to expect something other than what's the best I like, honestly

555
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,400
think I can give, you know, I don't want anyone to think I don't go out there

556
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,240
and I'm like, oh, man, if you guys give this much money, it's going to be so

557
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,440
much better than ever before.

558
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,680
That's why like all the reward tiers on the Kickstarter for pleave and the

559
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,080
weave were like goofy shit, you know, it was like, we'll buy more posters and

560
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,520
t-shirts because you're not going to make a better product than what we

561
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,680
already planned, you know, like that's not going to happen by throwing more

562
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,600
money at it. So just be completely real with people like, hey, here's how much

563
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,440
money it takes to just fly Jesse down here. We're going to make the show.

564
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,680
It's going to be just like the pilot, but with better visuals and audio because

565
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,960
we have the equipment working now. And if you give us more money, we're going

566
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,120
to spend it on, you know, shit to put in the show.

567
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,400
And I saw in the comments, people were like, they really were positive about

568
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,160
like, it is so great Digi that you were just like, if we're get over this

569
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,760
money, we're just going to buy t-shirts, posters and booze.

570
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,600
So, you know, give it your own risk.

571
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,400
So that was great.

572
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,600
I mean, really responded that.

573
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,200
That's a good thing to keep in mind for crowdfunding, right?

574
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,560
Like, I mean, everybody's biggest concern when they go into crowdfunding is,

575
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,040
oh, what if we don't make our funding goal, but drastically

576
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,360
outseeding your fund or exceeding your funding goal, outseeding.

577
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,080
What the fuck am I talking about drastically exceeding your funding goal

578
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,960
can be like a huge detriment to your thing.

579
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,280
I used to be a game journalist.

580
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,400
So I looked at a lot of crowdfunding campaigns, you know, I'm a writer.

581
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,640
Yeah, exactly. And you look at you look at mighty number nine.

582
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,480
You look at broken age and you see examples of people who got too much

583
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,120
money and they didn't know what to do with it.

584
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,720
I don't want to raise the money that could live up to Jeff.

585
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Let's not put the idea in people's heads that it's bad for me to make too much

586
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,280
money. The thing is, that's why I I know all those things.

587
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,600
And that's why I styled the Kickstarter this way, because the one I saw

588
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,280
where like I learned all this from because we're from the My Little Pony

589
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,320
community was the Brony documentary that fucking what's the greatest community

590
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,480
of John DeLancey, John DeLancey put together.

591
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,800
So with the Brony documentary, they asked for like a pretty small amount of money

592
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,320
and they ended up making six times what they asked, but they kept like

593
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
like all the extended tiers were like, you know, oh, we'll add in this many

594
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,080
interviews, we'll go to this convention and stuff.

595
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,560
And what the thing is that they didn't account for like reshoots or having to

596
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,120
pay audio people to do all like, like having to move the whole crew between

597
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,680
each location, you know, they were just thinking like, yeah, we'll go,

598
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,000
we'll add more, you know, but then it ended up being you have to add way more

599
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,240
because every like every little thing you add is so much more.

600
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,720
It's kind of like how, um, as any of us can tell you, because we all edit

601
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,520
video, like if you make a five minute video versus a 10 minute video,

602
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,520
it's literally twice the work.

603
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,160
And for the audience, it's barely a difference.

604
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,160
You know, they just see it as like, yeah, the video is like five to 10 minutes

605
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,800
long, but you, you really do have to edit five whole more minutes.

606
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,280
And that means that all of the work that the first half took, you have to do twice.

607
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,120
So if you're adding twice as much on, you're doubling the work.

608
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,720
And so like, I mean, there's count for that, you know, there's, there's ways to

609
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,640
cheat, like for instance, if you just play CS go nonstop and talk over it.

610
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,360
Oh, well, that's true.

611
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,880
But the videos are easy to make in the first place with those.

612
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,280
Yeah.

613
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,680
But I, there are actually like ways to cheat with thinking video.

614
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,880
Like the more live action footage you can put into a video where you're talking

615
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,440
about anime, the less you have to think about what I'm not going to put in this

616
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:04,680
part.

617
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,440
There's ways around it.

618
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,560
And I'm, I'm also, I used to do a lot of that where I used to like, you know,

619
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,600
throw game footage in for a couple of minutes.

620
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,320
If like, I didn't know what to show there and I didn't want to edit that whole

621
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,680
section, the best example being your sword art online rant, which is literally

622
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,080
just an hour and a half of you playing terror online.

623
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,080
Well, that was cause I, I didn't think I'd be able to get past copyright

624
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520
if I tried to edit the show.

625
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,480
And I didn't want it to look at the show for the time it would take to edit

626
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,800
a fucking hour of whatever happened to that old brony community.

627
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Those swell guys, whatever.

628
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,200
They're embroiled in turmoil about how one of them may or may not have been

629
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,720
slightly mean to the others.

630
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,000
It's tearing them apart.

631
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's tearing them apart.

632
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,200
I, yeah.

633
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:56,560
I think the best Kickstarter that I've ever seen actually is from Internet

634
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,400
Comment Etiquette, which I don't know if you guys watch that channel.

635
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,840
But I, I suck his dick like every day.

636
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,920
I've almost watched it many times.

637
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,480
He's, he's really seen a bunch of them, but not recently.

638
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,320
So he did an episode about commenting on crowdfunding campaigns.

639
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,680
And then at the end of that, he made a Kickstarter called Eric drinks wine

640
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,520
and gets a haircut, which is to fund the documentary about him drinking

641
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,440
wine and getting a haircut.

642
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,680
And then he, because he is who he is, he decided to make a joke out of

643
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,800
taking for fucking ever to get a haircut and drink wine.

644
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,040
How much money did he raise out of curiosity on that?

645
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,560
Um, God, like 10,000 dollars.

646
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,840
It was something ridiculous.

647
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,760
Let me, let me, let me look at the people of the problem.

648
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,000
The people of the potato salad thing all over.

649
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,520
Yeah.

650
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

651
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,560
Yeah.

652
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,800
Yeah.

653
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,680
It's, it, it wasn't quite the potato salad thing, but the potato salad one

654
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,800
though is so indicative of how to do a Kickstarter right because only raised $4,000.

655
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,800
It's all about making your audience feel like they're a part of something

656
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,520
exactly they're contributing to something that's, that's fun.

657
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,800
You know, like the potato salad thing is like, you can give one dollar to this

658
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,600
thing and be able to, to be like, you know, forever be like, huh, I gave a

659
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,880
dollar to a fucking potato salad thing.

660
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,400
You know, from the, from the end of the potato salad guys, it's ridiculous

661
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,440
that they made so much money.

662
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,160
It was my favorite, the user experience is simple.

663
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,200
You just gave a dollar to be a part of my favorite Kickstarter of all time to

664
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,760
this day was one made by our own Ben St.

665
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
That was Ben St.

666
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,440
makes a page, a Kickstarter campaign.

667
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
No, no, it was.

668
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
It was a Patreon.

669
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
It was a Patreon, right?

670
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,000
Actually, my, my, what, what is currently my Ben St.

671
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,080
Patreon was originally a joke, a joke Patreon that I converted to a legit one.

672
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, I didn't know.

673
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,160
Yeah.

674
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
The original one was Ben St.

675
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:45,800
It was great.

676
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,400
It was better then.

677
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,080
Please go back.

678
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,200
Yeah.

679
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,080
It was Ben St.

680
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,160
is creating a Patreon and the joke of the Patreon was that the Patreon itself

681
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,960
was my Magnum Opus that I would be like continually building on and like nobody

682
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,960
I even bought a space for it a little bit.

683
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,280
Like I thought I thought it was funny.

684
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,360
Like I thought people might see it and pledge like a dollar just to be like,

685
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,760
yeah, I pledged to this joke patron, but nobody have had there been any pledges

686
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
already there.

687
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,200
Yeah.

688
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,360
Yeah.

689
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,120
That's some of us pledged a little on your request, didn't we?

690
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,480
That's another important thing with it didn't.

691
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,640
It didn't catch the way I was hoping it was.

692
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,040
Oh, sorry.

693
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,920
Did you brought up something that's that's another important thing with a

694
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,520
successful Patreon because like I or Kickstarter for that matter.

695
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,400
But like being honest is important and allowing the audience to interact is

696
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,680
important, but the other thing is creating a perception of value.

697
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,920
So like one of the biggest things that you can do to have a successful

698
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Kickstarter or Patreon is have a like make a bunch of your friends agree to put

699
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,960
in a couple of dollars for the first month or so.

700
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,120
Just just so that it looks like it's not dead, you know,

701
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,400
yeah, so make sure it doesn't sound too because like if you if you phrase it

702
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,360
that way, it can sound kind of like shady.

703
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,600
Like we're trying to make it look bigger than it is.

704
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,680
But it's just like if someone says zero, they think I can't save this.

705
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,320
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,480
It's it's it's the full tip jar effect.

707
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,880
Right.

708
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
Like if you see a tip jar that has no money in it, you're not going to put

709
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,520
money in it.

710
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,280
But if you see a tip jar that's got like five, 10 bucks in singles in it,

711
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
you're going to be like, Oh, I could put a dollar.

712
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,120
Yeah.

713
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,640
And like, do you call the better business bureau over that shit?

714
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,240
Like, no, it's it's not it's not a big deal.

715
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah.

716
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,080
And I mean, I think we've we've also we're also in a fortunate position

717
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,680
that we have an audience that's willing to be like

718
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,920
to immediately give us money so that we don't have to do the full tip jar thing.

719
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,200
But yeah, I think a huge part of why this Kickstarter has taken off

720
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,520
like so fast in such a big way to me, the one being Jesse you're doing

721
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,360
is because I offered a limit to reward that if you paid a hundred dollars,

722
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,640
you get to pick one of the shows.

723
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,760
And those two went instantaneously.

724
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,560
Of course, like even if this show, even if only like 20 people had cared about it,

725
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,840
two of those people immediately cared enough to give a hundred dollars.

726
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,760
And what I would like to see right now, wow, this Kickstarter is on the track

727
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
to success. You know, I want to see.

728
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,680
I want to see one of those guys make a Kickstarter campaign to choose which show

729
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,080
he gets to pick for Digi Bros. Believe in the Weeb.

730
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
I hope it just keeps going forever.

731
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,800
You know, and by the way, I just wanted to say again, how much I agree with

732
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,160
what I want that I just like, I want that Kickstarter to be like,

733
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,920
like the main goal is like one show, but then every stretch goal is a different show.

734
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,160
Like, oh, no.

735
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,680
A more controversial show.

736
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,520
So the more money he makes the more controversial the show is.

737
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,240
You've got to do tactical pledges and unpledges in various.

738
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,640
You can't do shit right.

739
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,960
I was just going to say that I really was I was thinking about this

740
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,120
as your as your thing was going off.

741
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,880
And I would just think like, let's say that this Patreon campaign had been

742
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,200
like a like a fifty thousand dollar project, just just for argument's sake.

743
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,920
And like if that happened and it met that and then even exceeded that,

744
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,560
that would be getting into some seriously like ridiculous money, you know,

745
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,440
being exchanged. And at that point, it just it worries me

746
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,680
when like guys like just like little people like us doing stuff like this.

747
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,640
And if it could damage the personal relationships between people,

748
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,160
this is something that I've been thinking about for a while, how like having

749
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,480
having a corporate wall in between like where money goes,

750
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,680
sometimes sometimes can be a really helpful thing for preventing

751
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,320
like accountability of where money goes.

752
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,080
And this is just because I am the most I don't know anyone in the world

753
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,720
who cares about money more than me.

754
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,560
I care. I think about it all the time.

755
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,080
Everything I do is motivated by making sure I have enough at the end of the day

756
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,120
to get the things I want to get.

757
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,480
And it's it's it's fucked me over in many ways,

758
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,040
but it's made me extremely keen to any issues involving like shadiness

759
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,320
or like other people trying to pull one over on me.

760
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,480
And also makes me want to pull things over on other people all the time.

761
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,360
And I will if I can ever do it.

762
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,640
So don't trust me, people.

763
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,160
I mean, I make me accountable.

764
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,480
It's funny because I I always fear that I'm going to fuck that up

765
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,640
because yeah, everything I do has been very loose.

766
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,880
Like the money situations that we deal with are exceedingly loose.

767
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,040
Like me and Jesse both.

768
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
And that can be dangerous.

769
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,600
Well, like because me and Jesse have done a lot of collaborations

770
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,840
in like, for instance, The Plebe and the Weeb.

771
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,360
Each episode, Jesse marked on Patreon, which is fine,

772
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
because he edited all of them.

773
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,560
So he definitely, you know, but I I didn't because I didn't see it as

774
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,440
like my mainline content.

775
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,360
You know, I didn't see it as like each one of these should be Patreon by me.

776
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,880
And Jesse did most of the work anyway.

777
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,520
So like, you know, who am I to to make twice what he would have made off of it?

778
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,480
You know, just because it's on my channel.

779
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,200
But like, but like, I kind of see it as this exchange

780
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,800
because we never know collaboration I've done with anybody.

781
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Have we agreed beforehand?

782
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,960
Like how much money would be paid out?

783
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,320
It's all been like, hey, I think you deserve to have money from this.

784
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,040
Or I think we should do another collab.

785
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,280
You know, like every time Jesse patrons, something that me and him worked on together,

786
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,240
I just think, well, that's another video that I'm going to get Jesse to do with me later,

787
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,480
you know, or, you know, I'm about to do a show with with Jeff in the near future

788
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,000
about Re Zero on his channel because I got I got him to do one on a race on my channel.

789
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,240
You know, I probably made like a hundred bucks off that video.

790
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
So if Jeff can make a hundred bucks off of me being on his show, then, you know,

791
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,680
it's even made twice as much money as we would have made if I just split the bill.

792
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,440
You know, yeah.

793
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,680
So like I do think that, you know, it's something you have to kind of tread carefully with

794
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,160
because I think everyone who's been working with me on these shows

795
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,760
understands that I am making a profit from this, you know, whether I offer them money or not.

796
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,160
I think if you go into it and like you don't say anything about wanting money

797
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,800
and then, you know, you come knocking later like, hey, where's the money?

798
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,480
Like I don't remember offering it to you, you know,

799
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,720
but I think I would probably give them something if they, you know, if they begged like, man,

800
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,280
this is this is a dangerous topic.

801
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,840
I just see pitfalls everywhere.

802
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,560
You know, I think I think that the fact that we're all friends

803
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,560
and the fact that we're all again, generally honest people has kept this fairly safe, you know,

804
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,160
and like, you know, that's true.

805
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,920
But I always just everything so far has been 100 percent great.

806
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,280
But yeah, I always think that somewhere down the line,

807
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,960
if we get involved financially with each other, that would be the one thing

808
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,640
that could cause theoretical problems.

809
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,920
And you know, I think about that for every business relationship of everyone in the world.

810
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,360
Like even if you room with someone, like that can get messy.

811
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,200
I've had difficulties with friends over the years, but that's why I live with them.

812
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,440
That's why you're like important to Analyst Inc, Nate,

813
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,800
because you're you're like you you're not a scumbag, but you think like a scumbag.

814
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,760
And that's what you think you piece of shit.

815
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,800
Yeah, but that means you can be our scumbag watchdog.

816
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,200
Yeah, that's true.

817
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,800
That is true.

818
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,360
My thought process though is just to be extremely cutthroat about it.

819
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,440
If any of you fucks me, I will never speak to you again.

820
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,320
Yeah, yeah, what if I fuck you just a little bit?

821
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,120
If you what if I give you a little reach around?

822
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,520
What if I give you a little reach around, you know?

823
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,920
That sounds like a positive thing.

824
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,520
You know, while I'm fucking you, what if I fuck you?

825
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,880
But I give you a little reach around.

826
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,480
Maybe that's just the courteous thing to do.

827
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,040
Luckily, I don't have the patience to fuck any of you.

828
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,320
I might have the desire.

829
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,840
I might have the desire to steal from you and betray you in the most

830
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,000
heinous ways possible, but I just don't care.

831
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,720
Oh, but see, but see, this is exactly why crowdfunding is so

832
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,960
such like an interesting topic socially, because like even just

833
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,480
bringing it up at all has made us get into this thing about like,

834
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,720
can we trust each other?

835
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,160
Like, where do our boundaries lie?

836
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,920
Like, what's the responsibility of us to like manage each other?

837
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,640
That's kind of what all money and interaction is.

838
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,200
Like, it's all a system of trust.

839
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,400
It's all based on the idea that if I give you something,

840
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,600
you will give me something in return, you know, and that's entirely

841
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,120
a trust based thing.

842
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,440
And that's why, again, I think that's part of why we all

843
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,800
feel so lied to when every day I go to some fucking fast food

844
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,560
place and I buy something and they half cook it and they

845
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,720
sloppily throw it together.

846
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,000
And I'm like, why can't I just fucking get an honest transaction

847
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,360
that I get my money's worth out of what I fucking bought.

848
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,040
And so when you can actually make the same argument with the ads

849
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,160
that you should know by now that fast food is going to be shit.

850
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
So it's your own fault.

851
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,640
Yeah.

852
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,280
And and and so again, when like when people, you know, donate to

853
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,160
my channel and they actually see videos that they, you know,

854
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,720
care about, then they're like, finally, a transaction that I feel

855
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
good about in my life, you know, and I'm sure there's some people

856
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,760
who don't feel good about every single one.

857
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,680
And I'm always telling, like, you know, my patrons, there's no

858
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,280
guilt if you leave, you know, like, if you don't like what I'm doing

859
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,840
not to pay for, like, you know, you can set a cap for the month.

860
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,640
Or, you know, that's the great thing about it's really on you

861
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,520
as a as a payer, what you want to pay for and what you don't want

862
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,080
to pay. Exactly.

863
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,600
They're both all the all the crowdfunding sites are very like

864
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,960
you know, in favor of the buyer and that's I also that's why I

865
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,320
favor Kickstarter over like Indiegogo or GoFundMe because in

866
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,840
Kickstarter, you have to make the full amount before you get

867
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,960
paid, you know, if it if on the other sites, if you don't make

868
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,160
the full amount, you can still just pocket all the money they

869
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,520
gave you, whether you can even afford to do the thing or not,

870
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,760
you know, it's more of like a donation charity kind of thing,

871
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,840
which I mean, I'm not opposed to it, but Indiegogo is where

872
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,880
scummy kick starters that couldn't make it on Kickstarter go for a

873
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,480
second run.

874
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,200
Yeah, to be fair, or perhaps something like, you know, like

875
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,920
like a pity party like guys, I'm being abused by myself. I need

876
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,840
to move out of my house where my Tulpa lives. I need to leave

877
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,960
him behind, you know, you know, so like my you make, you know,

878
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,120
half the money you're looking for that's still helpful. Maybe

879
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,080
something like that would be appropriate. I don't know. I'm

880
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,120
just thinking about when it could be a good idea.

881
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,640
I want to I want to get into now the topic of kick starters, I

882
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,360
have a problem with and I'm not talking about the obviously

883
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,840
bad ones, the ones that everyone thinks are like a scam or

884
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,200
something like that. But I am talking about the ones that

885
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,560
turn out bad. And I feel like we we should have known and to to

886
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,120
that come to mind and I was thinking about doing a vlog

887
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,920
about this anyways, why I'm gonna get into this rant here is

888
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,320
mighty number nine. And while it remains to be seen if it will

889
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,440
be good, that Castlevania one what's a bloodstained lords

890
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,840
bloodstained bloodstained will be good. I don't know man. I've

891
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,200
I've seen I've seen some of the like footage of the game. It

892
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,000
doesn't. Okay, what bothers me about it is that it doesn't look

893
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,880
as good as Castlevania. You know, like it doesn't look as good as

894
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,920
Symphony of the Night, which is everyone's paying for it

895
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,040
because they want it to be another Symphony of the Night. But

896
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,960
it doesn't look as good as Symphony of the Night. What's

897
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,680
the point?

898
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,720
It doesn't look as good. Are you talking visually or

899
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,480
mechanically?

900
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,120
Visually, mostly. Okay, because I mean, we're close. Because I

901
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,400
mean, the thing is that it looks 3d now. So it's it looks

902
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,160
substantially better than anything that they could have

903
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,400
done at the time of Symphony of the Night. But the thing is

904
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,120
that Symphony of the Night, you're thinking about in terms

905
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,080
of PS one aesthetics. And yeah, Symphony of the Night was

906
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,280
impressive for a PS one.

907
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,120
No, I'm thinking of it in terms of if you look at both right

908
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,720
now, Symphony of the Night looks fucking great. And that game

909
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,000
looks like shit. Because that game has this goofy fucking 2.5d

910
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,040
shitty graphics, where the characters look floaty as fuck.

911
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,960
And there's no like, there's not enough frames to the animation

912
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,200
to have that satisfying line.

913
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,080
Hang on. That's, that's, it's, it's kind of irrelevant how, how

914
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,280
pretty the game looks because you just won't fund it. But what's

915
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,520
important about the situation is whether or not what they're

916
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,360
doing is deceptive or is like

917
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,920
not that it's deceptive, but you know, here's what bothers me

918
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,520
about both of these cases, specifically with why I think

919
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,120
they got funded, right? Because it's, it's nostalgia. It's one

920
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,200
is a guy who's saying who's saying I created Castlevania

921
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,680
Symphony of the Night, you guys all love that game. They won't

922
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,720
let me make another one. So help me make another one. And then

923
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,800
this other guy, KG Nefune, like I made Mega Man, you all love

924
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,720
Mega Man, they won't let me make another one, help me make

925
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,160
another one. But like, why are they not able to make another

926
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,520
one?

927
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,120
The profound. Okay, so there's a difference.

928
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Capcom's a piece of shit.

929
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,400
Capcom's a piece of shit. Konami is an enormous piece of

930
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,760
shit. Konami is the biggest piece of shit in the world. And

931
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,640
they will literally do stuff not to make money, just despite

932
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,400
the people who work for them. But the difference, the difference

933
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,480
between KG Nefune and Koji Igarashi, Ega, Ega. Yeah, that's

934
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,800
right, Egarashi. Koji Igarashi is that Inafune is a producer,

935
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,360
whereas Igarashi is actually a game designer. And that's what I

936
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,360
think the key difference between those campaigns is because

937
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,760
what I'm getting is staying with Mighty Number nine was, I have

938
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,280
a game idea, I'm going to take your money and hire another

939
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,120
company to make it for me, which is basically like the grown up

940
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,880
million dollar version of that guy in game design chat rooms who

941
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,600
says he's the ideas guy.

942
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,480
My favorite guy.

943
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,520
Here's what I'm getting at, though.

944
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,080
That guy's got it all figured out, man.

945
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,760
Castlevania Symphony of the Night. That game is is legendary.

946
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But Igarashi then made like eight more games that were the

947
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
exact same fucking thing.

948
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,160
And they're great.

949
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,880
And they're great.

950
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,440
I love every single one of them.

951
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Dawn of Sorrow.

952
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,440
I already have so many fucking good best, best one.

953
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,080
Dawn of Sorrow's best Castlevania.

954
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,240
How do you guys all play the last DS game?

955
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,400
Did you make it that far?

956
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,800
Was that Order of Ecclesia?

957
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,720
Because that was a great game.

958
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,240
Yeah, that was a great game.

959
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,400
I played every single one since Castlevania of the Night.

960
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Was Ecclesia the one with the paintings?

961
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,200
Because the paintings one was fucking cool.

962
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,640
No, that was that was Portrait of Ruin.

963
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,720
Portrait of Ruin, right?

964
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,880
That was so good.

965
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,480
I'm telling you, dude, they were all good up to Order of Ecclesia.

966
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,960
Well, how about Mega Man?

967
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,360
Do you know anybody who played every Mega Man game?

968
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,360
Because that's the thing.

969
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,680
They made a ton in both of these cases.

970
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,920
Both of these are franchises that they were not performing as well

971
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,080
by the end of their life.

972
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,280
You know, these are games that were selling less and less

973
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,520
that were getting lower and lower metacritic scores, you know.

974
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,480
And like so when when the creators come back and are like,

975
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,600
hey, remember me?

976
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,240
I made Symphony of the Night.

977
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,320
I'm thinking, yeah, but you also made all those other games

978
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,760
that you're not mentioning that no one cares about as much as Symphony of the Night.

979
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,040
Or, hey, I made Mega Man.

980
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,840
And I'm like, yeah, but they made 10 Mega Mans.

981
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,640
And by Mega Man 10, no one was buying it anymore.

982
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,040
You know, that's why they're not making Mega Man.

983
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,680
I didn't speak to market forces about Castlevania,

984
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,000
but I will say that Ecclesia was a great game.

985
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,040
And if they just made the more in that spirit,

986
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,560
then we would have some great games.

987
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,160
I think that Konami just chose not to for whatever reason.

988
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,080
Konami chooses like Konami just straight up is a shitty company.

989
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,480
Like this is this is this is like a cannon fact.

990
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,880
They have no idea what they are.

991
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,960
Yeah, they have no idea what the market wants, right?

992
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,560
They like they are there's there's a lot of writing out there about how shit.

993
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,720
Konami, they they are their their solution to continuing

994
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,880
Metal Gear Solid without without

995
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,320
Hideo Kojima involved.

996
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,880
Yeah, why am I having so much trouble remembering Japanese names today?

997
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,440
Anyway, their solution to continuing MGS without Kojima involved

998
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,360
is fucking Call of Duty Zombies, like not even anything above that.

999
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:35,360
It's just Call of Duty Zombies in in a parallel universe to Metal Gear to present

1000
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,480
to present like a good and bad side of this.

1001
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,560
And like why I think it's working,

1002
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,680
but also why I think a lot of people are getting disappointed

1003
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,800
is because I think that what's great about Kickstarter

1004
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,840
is it allows those people who do still care to give like more money

1005
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,760
than they could have given to just buying the game.

1006
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,240
You know, like most people think of it in terms of I bought this game.

1007
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,880
It was twenty five dollars.

1008
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,880
But even if I love it more than every other game I've ever bought,

1009
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,920
it's still you know, it's it's a game.

1010
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,200
It's twenty five dollars.

1011
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,920
But if you're someone who actually feels that strongly about it

1012
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,800
and like what's great about Kickstarter and Patreon is you can just throw

1013
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,440
as much money as it as you feel, you know.

1014
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,480
And I think that's something that's very powerful

1015
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,080
and it's becoming more and more apparent that people can do that when like

1016
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,800
one of my favorite Vati video videos is where he just shows that he's bought

1017
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,760
Dark Souls like six times, like every time he just feels a swell of emotion

1018
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,320
about how much he loves Dark Souls, he buys it again, you know.

1019
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,320
And I'm like, that's awesome because if if these games are being made

1020
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,040
for just that niche audience and that niche audience felt so strongly about it

1021
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,000
that they're willing to just give whatever it takes, then like cool.

1022
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,520
But I think that once these games escape

1023
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,680
because of the fact that, you know, a big deal is made about it

1024
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,320
because it's a Kickstarter and all that and and everyone's like, yeah,

1025
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,800
I remember Symphony of the Night and then they play the game

1026
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,840
and they're going to be like, oh, this isn't, you know,

1027
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,560
this isn't the best game ever made like I thought it was going to be

1028
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,480
because you raised so much money for a Kickstarter and I thought of Symphony of the Night.

1029
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,760
And it's like, yeah, but you should have been expecting

1030
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,560
like Order of Ecclesia or like the later games are the ones that, you know,

1031
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,720
the people who still care about this one, you know, the amount of money

1032
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,000
that they raised for the amount of money that they raised for a Kickstarter

1033
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,960
is a fraction of the budget of like a triple A video game.

1034
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:25,360
Like even even the biggest kick starters out there are still like.

1035
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,000
They're they're huge budgets for.

1036
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,200
Didn't Shenmue three like break every record

1037
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,160
and that was only like a tenth of the total cost or something that it needed

1038
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,360
to be like Shenmue three could only exist on Kickstarter

1039
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,880
because Sony was like, OK, we will pony up ten times as much money

1040
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,640
as what people are putting into this Kickstarter because the Kickstarter shows

1041
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,760
a market willingness to engage with the product.

1042
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,480
But like the thing with bloodstained that I think is good compared to.

1043
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,840
Mighty number nine, there were never not Mega Man like games on the market.

1044
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,680
You know, like like Shovel Knight is a much better Mega Man game.

1045
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,880
Then then Mighty number nine is there are tons of people

1046
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,480
making Mega Man like games.

1047
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,320
There are tons of people making Metroidvania games, too,

1048
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,800
but nothing that is like Castlevania.

1049
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,360
Watch out, we got some people who are going to get triggered by that word.

1050
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,040
Well, all right, I mean, I'll go to that.

1051
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,280
But I think but I think so much of what's integral

1052
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,360
to what makes those Castlevania games fun, the Egavania games

1053
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,720
was the production values, the spirits are so great.

1054
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,240
And the the the the hit sparks and flashes as as a Egoraptor put it, you know,

1055
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,240
when he was he was talking about how the Egavania games

1056
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,120
don't have the same like depth of control and absolutely godly animation.

1057
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,440
The I mean, not the animation, but the fucking character art

1058
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,880
that was fucking shat on for Dawn of Sorrow and Portrait of Ruin.

1059
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,080
I'm still mad about it.

1060
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,680
But at least they fix it for at least yeah.

1061
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,240
Oh, yeah, they are there was shit.

1062
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,880
But but like I just think that people aren't realizing that

1063
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,320
like you cannot fund them just making you your favorite game again.

1064
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,600
You know, no, you're not going to be that way.

1065
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,240
You're never going to you when you buy Metal Gear Solid 5,

1066
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,160
the money gets evenly split between Konami's like slot machine division

1067
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,480
and the game division. They don't give a shit. No.

1068
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,840
You're never going to just crowd fund

1069
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,960
like the same best game you played before unless it's, you know, it like if.

1070
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,080
OK, if if Toby Fox came out with a Kickstarter,

1071
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,480
like we could expect that it might be a game that's as good as Undertale

1072
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,880
because Undertale was a Kickstarter game.

1073
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,800
It was always for $10,000. Right.

1074
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,240
But but but Toby Fox doesn't know.

1075
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,800
No, but Toby Fox doesn't have to kickstart

1076
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,600
Undertale to probably not because well, not anymore.

1077
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,560
Not any more. Toby Fox is actually a millionaire now.

1078
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,880
Right. Well, I mean, OK.

1079
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,120
And that's something to keep in mind.

1080
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,280
Like, like I put I put some money in.

1081
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,440
But that's from sales of a fantastic.

1082
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,560
Yes, exactly. He deserves it.

1083
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,960
And I deserve some money because that's original content.

1084
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,160
And original content is what deserves money.

1085
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,720
Not. Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

1086
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,480
I agree. I agree, Jeff.

1087
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,040
I couldn't agree more. You've been debunked here by the memebusters.

1088
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,240
Once again, Digi.

1089
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,520
Anyway, I put money into that game indivisible.

1090
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,880
Right. Because of the fact that it's the same people who did Skullgirls.

1091
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,360
I'm so I'm so I'm so lacking in things to say this episode.

1092
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,200
I got a chip in and say the indivisible

1093
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Kickstarter looked like fucking garbage.

1094
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,560
Oh, I was so pretty.

1095
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,600
I'm not necessarily convinced that it's going to play the demo.

1096
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,120
It fucking sucked.

1097
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,000
It wasn't great. The demo was not good, but it also was a prototype.

1098
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,760
It was a prototype. It was a process.

1099
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,520
I was a big naysayer, too. I don't know.

1100
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,440
It happened. And now I'm saying whatever.

1101
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,280
Like, it's not a huge difference.

1102
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,680
But they released it as a fucking teaser for this is what our game

1103
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,600
is going to be like. And it was at least as like a product prototype.

1104
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,240
Like what you would do if you were like, you know, when you have a building,

1105
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,160
you're going to build and you build a little scale model of it to show people

1106
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,000
this is what the building will look like. That's what a prototype is.

1107
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,280
That's why they called it that.

1108
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,960
Yeah. And it wasn't a demo.

1109
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,920
And it is. It's it's like you're in Zoolander right now, Ben.

1110
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,520
Like like with the with the music, you know, the school for ants.

1111
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,120
You're like, this is how are they going to play this game?

1112
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,200
How do you judge this game? It's not even finished yet.

1113
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,160
It's got it's only a beta. No, no, no.

1114
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,380
It's accurately judge what it's.

1115
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:32,200
No, no, Ben, Ben want to kind of let just just a sec, Ben.

1116
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,600
Prototype is not a beta.

1117
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,480
A prototype is not an alpha.

1118
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,080
A prototype. I don't care.

1119
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,520
Where did you use? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1120
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,880
I'm showcasing what it was.

1121
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,720
No, it is not.

1122
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,320
Ben, it's it's a. No, it is not a prototype.

1123
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,080
Ben, Ben, Ben, can we please clarify exactly

1124
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,520
what your complaint is about the game that it wasn't fun and it was bad just it

1125
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:00,200
just a sec okay just a sec Ben yeah right a prototype is not any of the code

1126
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:06,480
that will go into the final game at all it is are you telling me that the yes I

1127
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,280
am telling you type that I played there's no resemblance at all to the game

1128
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:16,880
that I don't answer that that's a trap the prototype that you played is a

1129
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,800
testing bed for things that they will use in the final code the thing is when

1130
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,520
you make a video game nothing that you fucking put into the prototype goes into

1131
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:34,040
the final game except for maybe art assets in the same way as if you drew a

1132
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:40,280
bunch of shitty concept art that was just like napkin concept art for a comic

1133
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,840
that you want to work on and then you did the comic later and somebody saw that

1134
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,680
napkin and was like well this comic looks like fucking garbage I'm not gonna

1135
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,160
read it that's what you're doing look Jeff don't that's what you're doing me for

1136
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,960
one thing and for second thing the fact that they included this prototype with

1137
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,120
their Kickstarter means that they deemed it representative of their product and

1138
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:11,920
it was bad I took the prototype to be that they were saying hey this is

1139
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,280
generally what our game is going to play and look and feel like if that's your

1140
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,400
thing and donate you know not that it's going to literally be this that it's you

1141
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,920
know here's what the mechanics are like so because it's kind of hard to describe

1142
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,920
on paper just by saying yeah it's super Metroid I didn't alchemy profile I didn't

1143
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,880
like them yeah I didn't like them again can we at least agree can we at least

1144
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,040
agree that it is reasonable for Ben to come to a negative impression of the

1145
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,280
game based on the prototype and not be interested I don't think that's

1146
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,080
unreasonable I just think that it would be unreasonable to think that the final

1147
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:50,840
product will be reflective of okay but the case then what is even really the

1148
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,240
use of it if it like if you can just with this argument then what's the point

1149
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,160
prototype is the same point as the or is the same purpose as concept art on a

1150
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,320
Kickstarter again it's we this is the idea that we're trying to go for this is

1151
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:11,240
the sort of thing that we will be doing but we will have the game I have

1152
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,600
to have to raise this point now exactly what what all right but what is the

1153
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,640
difference at this point between a criticism of bull shots and a criticism

1154
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,160
of a game that may play because they called it a prototype exactly they call it

1155
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,120
unfinished they call it unfinished gameplay footage in their advertisements

1156
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,880
when they do you know yeah but this wasn't an advertisement for the game it's a

1157
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,640
prototype similar if it wasn't an advertisement what the fuck was it it's

1158
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:42,320
a fucking prototype it's a proof it's something to show to investors you're

1159
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,960
paying for a kickstarter you're an investor the whole if the information is

1160
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,480
useless why included the information accurate it's fair to be judged either

1161
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:57,320
way you lose and I know Nate it's simple it's fucking simple okay all right it's

1162
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,360
a prototype it is not an advertisement for the game but they are putting it out

1163
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,200
there as part of their Kickstarter campaign to show that they are being

1164
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,920
open with their contributors in the same way that they would be open with

1165
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,280
investors which is a good strategy for a Kickstarter okay but if I'm so well it

1166
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,520
was a bad strategy for me because I played it all right there you go fair

1167
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,400
enough Ben but if I play it and I just if I was wrong that it got funded and I

1168
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,080
hate it all right hang on if I play it and I really like it and I give money

1169
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,480
and then I get the game of the end and it has lost the qualities that I liked

1170
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,880
initially I mean who's who's gonna take responsibility for that that seems like

1171
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,560
a reasonable I think the fact that they literally said this is a prototype that

1172
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:50,680
in no way resembles the final how does that put it on the donor to literally

1173
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:57,680
say to the donor this is not what you're getting so please don't why this is what

1174
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,440
you're not what you're getting then what is the use of showing it is to a

1175
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,200
certain extent what you're getting it's a matter of degrees it's a matter of

1176
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,040
degrees I think I think there's a lot you want to answer if do you think that

1177
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,640
it would have been better if all the Kickstarter said was okay here's how it

1178
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,240
works basically the the triangle button makes this character attack and the

1179
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,760
square button makes this character attack you'll totally get it once you

1180
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,760
know once the game's out you'll totally get what we're talking about but just

1181
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,720
trust us it makes sense you know so so yeah so just put money in or would it be

1182
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,000
better to just say look okay here's like the controls you know look at it here it

1183
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,920
is here's like you know jump around a little bit you like the feel of that

1184
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,200
okay that's basically what this is gonna be that's what a prototype I see what

1185
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,080
you're saying and I agree that I don't hate the idea of a prototype to introduce

1186
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,560
people to the gameplay but when you kind of when you have this concern of like

1187
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,680
this is prototype footage or this is a prototype gameplay you can't expect this

1188
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,280
to necessarily be the end result then I just wonder like there's going to be some

1189
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,600
disconnect between people who liked what was there initially and the things that

1190
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,680
they end up with in the end and I just think that that's kind of causing a

1191
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,080
potential problem that's that's all and I think it's a nuance I think it's a

1192
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:12,000
nuanced issue you know caveat mentor buyer beware if you can't figure out from

1193
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
the fact that they said it's a prototype that it might not be the same game then

1194
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,800
you might be literally retarded and a human idiot well you know I just think

1195
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,840
that it's it takes you're right you know you have to think about it that's

1196
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,600
true money if you aren't certain you like I gave money to it because of the

1197
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,760
fact that I like skull girls and skull girls was a Kickstarter project I and

1198
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,080
the ideas behind it are promising I love the character designers work it's the

1199
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,560
kind of thing she's the best I it's a guy I it's a girl we're talking about

1200
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:49,000
there's a guy what there's not drawn by the guy who did the art for you and I

1201
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,720
talked about this there I was familiar with the girl who was like the lead

1202
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,440
animator yeah but I think that's a distinct person from the character

1203
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:05,200
designer yeah yeah I want to go on a date I'm available but the designer is

1204
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Alex who's a guy I met him he signed a copy of his art book for me so well

1205
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:17,680
tell him to let me meet his girlfriend anyways you know I just I see it as

1206
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:23,960
this is a project that is of a scale that makes sense on Kickstarter and like I

1207
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,160
know I kind of feel like I know what I'm getting whereas with something like a

1208
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,960
like a ukulele for instance where like I know that everyone really hopes that

1209
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,360
hey it's the old Rareware boys these are the people who gave us Banjo-Kazooie but

1210
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:42,240
Banjo-Kazooie was a triple-a game and I don't think it's good like even if it is

1211
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,800
a good game it's not gonna be as good as Banjo-Kazooie it's just that's

1212
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,920
I think it's distinctly possible that it could be again I think it's

1213
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,040
distinctly possible that it could be because the thing about the thing about

1214
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:01,400
Banjo-Kazooie is that that game as much as the aesthetics are important in a

1215
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,520
Rareware game the most important thing in a Rareware game is juice and I guess

1216
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:17,320
okay so juices juices a slang term for game feel right if you get if you get

1217
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,680
the juice right watch Mark Brown game makers toolkit he talks about that in a

1218
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,720
video I got a brown for I don't see any reason why it couldn't be as good as

1219
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,760
Banjo-Kazooie yeah it could be if it's a different like if there's something

1220
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,360
different about it but if it's literally just trying to be Banjo-Kazooie then

1221
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,960
even if it was like mechanically identical it won't have as much polish in

1222
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,240
the graphics or the animations no no but it's not no way it'll be as good it's

1223
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,000
not gonna be mechanically identical their whole idea like their whole thing

1224
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,400
that they're selling it as like Banjo-Kazooie is that it's a a open-world

1225
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,480
character platformer where you have two characters who work in concert to do

1226
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,200
different moves instead of one and you know what sucks about this whole thing

1227
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,840
I'm sorry your finisher thought and yeah they're yeah well I mean that was

1228
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:15,600
basically it I was just gonna say that like like a got a bat on the head of a

1229
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:22,840
chameleon yeah is a very different mechanically carer character that is a

1230
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:28,360
very different mechanical character from a bear with a bird in the backpack I

1231
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:33,080
think well let me see it might be exactly the same intentionally you know

1232
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:38,680
maybe the beta that they put out or the alpha or whatever stage they're at right

1233
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,080
now does show like a lot of different moves and the moves the moveset for the

1234
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,920
character is very very different like there's a lot of gliding and I mean it's

1235
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,200
possible if it is if it is a more unique game whereas opposed to like how you

1236
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,920
know like the Castlevania thing and the the mighty number nine thing are like

1237
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,080
just basically exactly the same but mighty number nine had dashing you idiot

1238
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,400
so did Mega Man X not change the game actually Mega Man X as shown in your

1239
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,800
Raptors sequel it is dashing changed everything in Mega Man X so so it's the

1240
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,960
same you know if you're just gonna make but that X was good so like yeah well

1241
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,420
I'm just saying like you know mighty number nine and that Castlevania game by

1242
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:21,140
virtue of trying to be the exact same thing and this is a you know I'm making

1243
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,160
assumptions here I mean not about mine right now and everyone knows that was it

1244
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:30,520
but like about the you know the the Castlevania game if if it tries to be the

1245
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,640
exact same thing as Symphony of the Night then just by the fact that they

1246
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:39,200
don't have you know the same amounts of or quality of people working on it means

1247
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,880
it will not be as good a Symphony of the Night you know even if it is good and

1248
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,560
well if you could lately is like mechanically different enough and

1249
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,240
inventive enough it could be better and hell even if they just modernize the

1250
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,920
fucking live system I'll probably beat it and I couldn't I could not beat

1251
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,720
Banjo-Kazooie because the live system pissed me off so badly and you know what

1252
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,440
that brings me to the to the biggest meme that needs to die by the way every

1253
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,920
episode of the PCP is a continuing extension of the meme that needs to die

1254
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,800
it's like we're in Star Trek the next generation where the test never ended for

1255
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:17,280
humanity from episode one but what the biggest problem is capitalism it's the

1256
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,560
fact that we have to do things to make money to live and you can't just make

1257
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,520
art for its own sake you have to make art profitable you have to do things so

1258
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,880
that you can live when are we gonna fucking get our shit together and

1259
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:33,840
invent whatever the fuck things it is that make not communism no I ain't no

1260
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,840
fucking pinko don't you look at me with that pink eye you piece of shit just say

1261
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:41,040
you're talking about the automatic star Trek we need those things that make

1262
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,920
everything you need we need to no longer worry about having to survive by if we

1263
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,720
have those if it if we that's exactly right if we have those if once like my

1264
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,060
little pony but once once we live close scarcity we are gonna be in a

1265
01:06:55,060 --> 01:07:00,600
communist world or something where I know I'm not a socialist yeah socialist

1266
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,880
world honestly we'll need a new we'll need a new paradigm where what isn't a

1267
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,160
whole different but is viewed but but like the yeah the thing is yeah that's

1268
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:16,640
right that's right cuz capitalism only functions as long as the supply of food

1269
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:23,040
is lower than the demand for labor and at like we don't even need to have food

1270
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,520
synthesizers to get past that point we're at the point where we can automate

1271
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,160
all farming we're at the point where we can automate all fucking food delivery

1272
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,400
and we're close to the point where we can automate building shelter which is

1273
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,700
the three necessities that people need at this point the only forgot smashing

1274
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:51,280
puss my dog no that's that's that's what I'm getting to the puss smashing the

1275
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,640
thing is the thing is the thing is at the point when we reach that the there's

1276
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,000
gonna be four necessary sectors one of which we shouldn't be we shouldn't be

1277
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,800
part of capitalism in the first place which is medicine medicine should just

1278
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,440
be right right everybody one of which is pornography smash and puss one of

1279
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:17,120
which okay sure is art and one of which is managing money and if we can just

1280
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,080
figure out a way to get the people who fuck good and the people who make art

1281
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:27,520
good to do that for the public good cuz they enjoy it and just give them food

1282
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,520
to be happy then we could get rid of the fuckers whose only job is moving money

1283
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,960
around for other people yeah we can get rid of fucking money and then we're

1284
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,680
done be that would be great and but by the way while we're talking about

1285
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,440
Star Trek there's oh there's only one issue with this and it's that there's

1286
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,800
this one great episode of the next generation where some some guys like

1287
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,280
from like the 21st century or like a 22nd or whatever where capitalism still

1288
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,040
existed wake up and like Picard has a talk with one of them and there was this

1289
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,440
one guy who was a rich man and he's like Picard I would like to see my accounts

1290
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,920
from my various banking institutions and know how my finances have been doing in

1291
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,480
the 300 years I've been asleep or whatever and Picard's like well buddy

1292
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,680
things don't work that way anymore money doesn't exist so you have no more

1293
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,480
influence over the world than anybody else around you and this guy is very

1294
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,840
disturbed to hear that not because he's worried about his personal safety or

1295
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:19,560
getting all the food you want those things are available to everyone just as

1296
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,160
a right of being alive in the Federation but what he's concerned about is that he

1297
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,960
no longer has power and control over his destiny in the way that he once had and

1298
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,240
you know it's it's just a fascinating thing to think that even when you can

1299
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,600
eliminate all the bare essentials we still theoretically in Star Trek they

1300
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,880
kind of figured this out but we might theoretically still have this urge to

1301
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:47,560
just rule over each other and kill and kill and rape our own butts I mean I mean

1302
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:56,280
if we want to get pretentious you know it's the will to power you know I read

1303
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:10,640
that buddy is that actually in Zeno saga I don't know yeah no all of the Zeno

1304
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:19,280
like Zeno saga and Zeno gears all of those are loosely based on it's so

1305
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:28,960
fucking weird yeah anyway the will to power is like a separate part of like

1306
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:35,480
human consciousness and that is yeah but that's like something we can move past

1307
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,440
if we just agree to not be fucking asshole yeah you know that that's the

1308
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,440
thing to in Picard's you know world like in the 24th century with Picard like

1309
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,160
they had pretty much all gotten over that most most humans had whereas this guy

1310
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,920
was a relic from the past which is why he was still kind of driven by this urge

1311
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,800
that had been weeded out of society so I don't like even in Star Trek they had

1312
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,600
fixed you know if you've seen Star Trek beyond no I have not so start Star Trek

1313
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,280
beyond is great it was written by Simon Pegg who actually gets Star Trek so it's

1314
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,360
not like the previous two Star Trek movies where it's that's what I've heard

1315
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:17,720
that's what I've heard and the villain is a guy who this is kind of a spoiler

1316
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:26,440
let's just say everybody the core the core conflict of Star Trek beyond is

1317
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:32,840
about the Federation ideals versus warlike pre-Federation ideals that's the

1318
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,640
most interesting kind of conflict and the the idea that the like the Federation

1319
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,760
I mean if we if we want to talk about truly great visionaries we can talk

1320
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,880
about how Matt Pat from Game Theory did that theory about how the Federation is

1321
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:53,280
fascist which is very incorrect that's not true at all but there is a

1322
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,040
restriction of freedom when you don't have a capitalist system that's that's

1323
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,560
just yeah like this of course there's going to be compromises no matter what

1324
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,480
system you put in place even capitalism has I mean there's the basic you know

1325
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,600
rules you your your right to extend your fist ends at my nose you know all that

1326
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,320
all that kind of shit and and yeah I mean like capitalism has like like we

1327
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,480
don't have pure capitalism we have rules against monopolies because it's super

1328
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:24,920
obvious that monopolies make capitalism stop by the way what is to those who

1329
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,200
aren't aware what is the most successful and popular program in American

1330
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,560
history Medicare which is a socialist program so it's not like yeah you know

1331
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,760
we got other shit and you want to know what else people really fucking like a

1332
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:42,920
lot fired apartments police not true sometimes we've got we got it what are

1333

we doing the crowdfunding yeah crowdfunding is a let's bring this back

1334
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:54,320
crowdfunding is a stopgap between capitalism and the socialist utopia that

1335
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,880
our Lord and Savior Bernie Sanders will eventually bring us into and Gene
