00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, and welcome to another episode of the PCP, The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint, and with me today, I have Tom Oliver. Thank you for joining me, Tom.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're all about melodrama today, apparently. I would like to ask you, what is to be done about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Your thoughts.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I think we just need to line them all up in like a big line together, and then you just got to get like one semi-attractive looking woman to walk up to them, and then just be like, have a Red Bull, and they'll all be friends. That's what TV has taught me.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What? Wait, Red Bull doesn't make friends, it gives you wings.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, if they're wings, they'll all-

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, no, no. I think you're right, but it's got to be Mentos. It doesn't matter what comes, fresh goes better in life, and then like, oh, an Israeli, someone in the Israeli Defense Force, you know, he's like pounding-

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's the fresh maker, not the peacemaker.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He's like beating a child's head in with the butt of his rifle, but then like, you know, his little, like, his emaciated little, the Palestinian kids, like, emaciated little brother is like, wait, sir, it holds up a Mentos?

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And he goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, and he takes some, and then they're like, ah, forget about it, ah, you little scamp. And that's- I could see it, I could see it.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why aren't we in charge of international relations? We can get this all solved in a day.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Mentos Trio. The Mentos Trio could have solved, could have, we could have had peace in the Middle East back when I was like 14.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Have I- Wait a second. I've mentioned the Mentos Trio before. Have I ever explained what that was?

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Maybe. I'm only here for like half the episodes now, so.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's true. That's true. Okay, I think I mentioned this once, but let me tell you about a period in my life.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When I was like- I'm going to be so embarrassed if I have told the story before and I just forgot.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But when I was like 12, 13, maybe a little younger even, I went to this summer camp.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Not a camp, really, but like a program for gifted children, because I was so smart.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's what your parents told you, huh? That's what you're going?

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know. It was called College Academy, and it was basically like kids during the summer.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was like- it was sort of like a mock college, like you would pick your classes, and then in the course of the day you would go between classes,

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and then you go to lunch, and then you go to two more classes. It was sort of like pretend college for kids.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's like a prepare yourself for the future kind of thing.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And you, a future cartoonist, needed this desperately.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, I had potential back then.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But on the bus ride to and from College Academy, I don't know, there were these older kids who I thought were so cool,

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and like a couple years later, some of them would graduate, and eventually I joined their inner circle,

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and they called themselves the Mentos Trio, and what they would do is they would sit at the back of the bus to College Academy,

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and they would buy Mentos before every bus ride, and they would write- they would take paper, like a pencil paper,

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and they would write like Mentos the Freshmaker on paper, and they would wait for the bus to stop at a red light and wait for a car behind the bus to pull up close,

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and then they would like flip back and like look through the windows in the back of the bus and slam the paper on the back window,

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and they would give thumbs up and big smiles and hold the Mentos like, yeah, Mentos, the Freshmaker,

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and just see what the car behind them would do, and that was it. That was the Mentos Trio.

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And these are the people you thought were cool.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Listen, they had passion.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You know, I can't deny that. This sounds like something out of a webcomic.

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This sounds like something that could be in Tales Against Troll or something, and I would believe it.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It does. It's pretty zany. It's pretty wacky.

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ben, do you think it became a cartoonist because your entire childhood was just something out of an early 2000s webcomic?

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, no. I thought it was normal back then.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But sometimes you get good reactions, though.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Sometimes there was one guy who flipped us off and then peeled out in a U-turn, like he was mad.

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Most of the time, people would either just ignore it or sometimes people would give thumbs up back.

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That was the most common thing, as you might expect.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, you're just playing the long game to get those golden reactions, either positive or negative, I suppose.

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Gotta wade through the shit.

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ah, it was good times. It was good times.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think they thought I was a loser because I was a little kid, but then a couple of them graduated and they were like,

49
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
well, we have to let Ben join because there's no longer three of us.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh man, can't be the Mentos duo. That's just not nearly as good.

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's just lame, no. The people behind the bus would laugh at us.

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The balance between base and cringe is that three-person dynamic.

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's it. If there's only two of you, you just look like some weird lone losers, right?

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But you can't get a third person to join your little Mentos cult?

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Three's a crap, so then it's the cool thing to do.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For just two people, just like, oh god, those sad, pathetic young men.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's just a tray, and what were the shooter's names?

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know, I don't.

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
From the Columbine, the Columbine shooters.

60
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why do you think I would know the shooter's names from Columbine?

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know, they're famous.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I know the names of the last five Ultraman, I don't know, the Columbine shooters.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My knowledge is very fucked up.

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It was Trey Parker and Matt Stone, I believe.

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, right, that was the duo that you joined to become the Mentos trio.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And who then went on to shoot up Columbine, famously.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, you know.

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you want to get a show on Comedy Central, you got to really prove that you're committed to the bit.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Good times, good times.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay, so now, that's pretty much it.

71
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There's nothing else to say about the Mentos trio, but that was the deal with it.

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was not familiar with that story, so you at least never told me it before.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Good, good, good, good.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Me and Gib did the bonus episode this week.

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We did the Minesweeper challenge.

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We did the Minesweeper, I guess, race or battle or whatever.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Which you can see for $5 a month over on patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I got to say, I think that that bonus episode, it has twists and turns.

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Was it better than the Dark Souls race?

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, the Dark Souls race.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have to say yes, we're trying to sell this right now.

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, I could say that I can waffle and I don't have to commit to anything.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I can say, well, it's apples and oranges.

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, it's a different kind of quality.

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's better than the Yellow episode, for sure.

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's better than the Dark Souls race.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's better than the Pokemon race.

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's better than what's the most viewed video on our channel.

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know.

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It used to be the DigiTrixie calls Mumkey, the one where she explains why Mumkey was kicked.

91
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That was the most popular for a while.

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
For a long time.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
For a year or more.

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That explains a lot, I guess.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And then I think finally, we were like, guys, we don't want this here.

96
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This sucks.

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All the lectures that are on here had less views than that.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Wait a minute.

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait a minute, that might be right.

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That might have been the most popular after the lectures, actually.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, okay.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's a little better.

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why the most?

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh my God, it's both your lectures are the most popular.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, by a wide margin.

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh my God, am I the king of this channel now?

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That was a ground-breaking piece of content.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It was the video that set the trend.

109
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It was the video that set the trend.

110
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It was the video that set the trend.

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was the video that set the trend.

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was the video that set the trend.

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It was the video that set the trend.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It was the video that set the trend.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was the video that set the trend.

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was the video that set the trend.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It was the video that set the trend.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was the video that set the trend.

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It was the video that set the trend.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You know, it was.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It was.

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Man, it'd be really great if there was another one.

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If there was a follow-up to that, God, it just seems like it's about time.

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If only that existed.

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It is time.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It is time.

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I've been feeling bad about that.

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have...

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, I have...

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I hope I'm not giving the game away here.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But I mean, I need to get my secret project done

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
before I want to release that.

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I feel like...

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I feel a little bit like zonked out.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I feel a little bit like...

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know what's going on.

137
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know what's going on in the news.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know what I should be angry about this week.

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The last two days, I've done basically nothing except work on that.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And it's...

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Which is good.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Which is what I should be doing.

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I've said this before, but it's probably stupid.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Objectively, it's probably stupid that I haven't released that yet.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But there is a reason why I need it released in a particular order.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Maybe not a good one, a reason that anyone would agree with.

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But there is a reason.

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
At least you have a game plan and you're sticking to it, I guess.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I do.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The commenters will let us know if they respect that decision in any way, shape, or form.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I do think that...

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think originally I wanted...

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, I want to make posting that an event.

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to attach with it an announcement that I was going to do.

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Maybe some kind of...

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was thinking I will read every issue of Sonichu on my Twitch channel

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to raise money for charity or something.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
To make a big event out of it.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know if I want to do that anymore.

160
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Part of me is just like...

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When it's time, I'm maybe just going to say fuck it.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Just put it out there who cares.

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It could be fun.

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Depends how much extra effort it would require.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You'd have to have special guests, Christine Westin Chandler, to show up.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
To voice themselves in the comic.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
She's been on my channel before.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I know. It's not outside the realm of possibility.

169
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you really wanted to raise money for charity, that's what you would do.

170
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That would be the power move.

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't know about it.

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know if the crowd that would be attracted by Chris being on a thing would be very likely to give anything to anyone.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I feel like people within your sphere, though, would be doubly invested in a situation like that.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Maybe.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's possible.

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Every time I do or say a Chris-related thing,

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
there's a new crop of people that show up to be like,

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Chris, get a job!

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Chris, get a job, Chris!

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Fuck's sake!

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's never going to happen.

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't think so.

184
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's just unhirable.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Some people are unhirable.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Some people are just dedicated to other people

187
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
need to get jobs, raise kids, and have families.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Some people are angry when people don't do that.

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
These people come out of the woodwork

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
when Chris is being discussed on the internet.

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's funny how these people are berating Chris

192
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
or just doing the same thing over and over again,

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
wasting their time chasing an impossible goal

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
when they themselves are chasing the impossible goal

195
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
of getting him to stop doing that.

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We're getting her to stop doing that, I should say.

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So they're both committed to the same hubris.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
They're like Batman and the Joker.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They're two sides of the same coin.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
One can never defeat the other.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's true.

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
They need each other.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a symbiotic relationship.

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I mean, it's kind of true.

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Without the trolls, what would Chris be?

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I mean, so much of Sonichu is about dealing with trolls.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's true.

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sonichu would be nothing.

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What she conceives to be trolls, yeah.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It makes you think really thought-provoking.

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What else was I gonna...

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm like, hey, what's...

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Tell me something.

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, I did it.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I did the thing.

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I watched the Snyder Cut of Justice League,

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
because it came out on Friday.

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I watched the whole thing, all four hours in one sitting.

219
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I have been hearing about the Snyder Cut.

220
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And I don't want to...

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I mean, I didn't see the original movie,

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
so I'm not gonna watch the Snyder Cut either.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I would not watch it if you did not see the original.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In fact, no one should really watch it at all,

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but it was just one of those things where it's like,

226
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm so curious as what...

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I saw a Stereo's Coconut on Twitter said

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
that he did think the Snyder Cut was better than the original.

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I agree. I think it was better.

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It was more, as strange as this to say,

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
it was more cohesive just because there was one person

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
in charge of the vision than the studio meddling hodgepodge

233
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
that was the theatrical cut, because of course I saw that too.

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is a video by Foldable Human.

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you know who that is?

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, but that's a terrifying username.

237
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He used to use a little cardboard box puppet

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
as sort of his mouthpiece, as sort of his avatar.

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He just dropped Dan Olson.

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He's dropped that for a long time,

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but I think that was originally why he was called Foldable Human.

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Now it just sounds lovecrafty and terrifying.

243
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, I've never thought of it like that,

244
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
but I guess I could see what you mean.

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But he made a video about folding ideas.

246
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Folding ideas is what the channel is called.

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, okay. I've heard of folding ideas. Yeah, yeah.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, okay, okay.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, he made a video about the Snyder Cut a year or more ago

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
saying it doesn't exist.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There is no completed Snyder Cut.

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So I don't know.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
People have been calling for the Snyder Cut for years,

254
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but the Snyder Cut now, it's not something that existed all along.

255
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's like, it must have been something that was made in response to the outcry.

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
From what I've read is that only, like, okay.

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So the original Cut, I think, was under two hours at the theatrical release.

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And almost, like half of it was just new footage they re-shot with Joss Whedon.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then this version that just came out is four hours and two minutes.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And only five minutes of that was new footage.

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Everything else that was replaced was footage that was cut from the original version.

262
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So there's, like, I think an hour and 45 minutes of footage from the original version that got cut.

263
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Does the Snyder Cut not include the Joss Whedon stuff?

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, none of the Joss Whedon stuff is in the Snyder Cut.

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's all just the original stuff.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because, like, there was, like, over two hours of shit they cut from the theatrical release

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
or in place with the Joss Whedon things.

268
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And then they re-tweeted a lot of stuff.

269
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So, yeah, it was, it's kind of dumb just because, like, you, it's like, okay,

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
for four years people have been clamoring for the Snyder Cut.

271
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And they release it and it's clear that you watch it.

272
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's like, oh, this was a part one.

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So it kind of ends super open for, like, all this new stuff that you just know is not going to happen.

274
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And, like, the five minutes of new footage was, like, the cliffhanger ending of this movie.

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's like, so you recorded a stinger for a movie that you know is not going to get made?

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like, it was really fucking weird.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Hmm, I see, I see.

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Because, like, spoilers, at the end, like, Martian Manhunter shows up and he's like,

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
hey, Batman, I'm Martian Manhunter.

280
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm gonna help you fight.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And Batman's like, cool.

282
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then it ends and it's like, oh, I can't wait to never see this movie

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
where Martian Manhunter exists.

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Awesome.

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I saw a tweet from Brianna Joy Gray.

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think she was watching the Snyder Cut.

287
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And someone said, she said, like, I guess Martian Manhunter shows up

288
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and Ben Affleck goes like, who the fuck are you?

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And she said, like, thank you.

290
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I was wondering too.

291
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And then she said, Martian, the name Martian Manhunter is so descriptive

292
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
without being clarifying at all.

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

294
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Like, if you don't, like, if you don't know who that is.

295
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This cut of the movie would never have worked in theaters

296
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
because it just drops a ton of, like, comic lore without any explanation

297
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and doesn't try and make it any way approachable.

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Like, Darkseid's just there, like, trying to get to Earth

299
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and he's like, I need to go to Earth.

300
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It has the anti-life equation.

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And, like, they don't explain what the anti-life equation is

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
or what it means.

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's just a bunch of, like, CG monsters talking about this thing

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
for, like, two hours.

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And it just assumes that, like, you've read comic books,

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
like, you know what the anti-life equation is

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and why Darkseid wants it, right?

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And it's pretty funny.

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's, I mean, I guess that's what the hardcore fans want.

310
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So, like, it sounds like, it sounds like some people

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
will be pretty pleased about that, I guess.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I mean, like, in the original, in, like, the theatrical cut,

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
like, that came out first, the whole back end of the movie

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
is, like, the main, like, throwaway villain guy Steppenwolf.

315
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He, like, sets up a base in this, like, abandoned, like,

316
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Russian town that has, like, a couple people in there

317
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and the whole fight is happening while they're trying

318
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to, like, evacuate the people that are living in this town.

319
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think some cute little fucking, like, one-liners

320
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and, like, funny scenes of, like, the Flash pushing

321
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
this truck away of, like, these, like, old couple

322
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and then Superman's, like, carrying an entire building

323
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and he's like, oh, I feel shitty because I'm not a strong

324
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Superman, like, dumb shit like that.

325
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And the Snyder Cut, there's, it's just an abandoned town

326
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and nobody's there, so they destroy the entire fucking thing

327
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
in this fight and it's so much, such a different tone

328
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and, like, of course, everything's shot in the dark

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
in this version and in the original theatrical cut

330
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
it was all brightened up and stuff and for some reason

331
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
when Superman comes back, he wears a black suit

332
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
but they changed it back to the normal colors

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
in the original theatrical cut, but in this one,

334
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
he's just wearing a black costume just because

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Zack Snyder, I guess?

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Was he given the comics or...

337
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I mean, he did have a black costume in the comics.

338
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't know if that was a reference to that or...

339
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It was just strange because there was no reason for him

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to wear another costume because, like, in the movie,

341
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
they go on to, like, a Kryptonian ship

342
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and it has, like, his normal costume in there

343
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
but, like, he just wears black because I guess it's cooler?

344
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't know.

345
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The whole movie's in 4.3 also.

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It is cooler.

347
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's probably the weirdest, most jarring thing

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
because there was a bunch of articles.

349
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
4.3 is like...

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The Snyder Cut is?

351
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah, the Snyder Cut's in 4.3 aspect ratio,

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
not widescreen.

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Why?

354
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think it was because originally it was shot

355
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
in a different aspect ratio for IMAX theaters

356
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and, like, instead of, like, trying to adjust it

357
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
for 16x9, like, because I think widescreen

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
or IMAX is taller or something, I don't know,

359
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I didn't look into it too much, but, like, yeah,

360
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it's all in 4.3, the entire thing.

361
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Speaking of...

362
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Not to force a subject change,

363
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but speaking of 4.3 aspect ratio,

364
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I've been watching a lot of, or I've been mostly listening to,

365
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
a lot of Ross's Game Dungeon recently, you know that?

366
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
From Accursed Farms, the YouTube channel?

367
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No. What is that?

368
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Well, I mean, it's just, like, videos that a guy makes

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
where he talks about games, and, like, a lot of the games

370
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that he plays are, like, a lot of older stuff.

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's not all older stuff, but a lot of older stuff.

372
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Like, stuff like the Commodore 64 or the Amiga,

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but also stuff, like, older classics, stuff like,

374
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
like, Deus Ex, the original Deus Ex and stuff.

375
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Weird, like, point-and-click adventure games.

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He plays a lot of point-and-click adventure games

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that I've never heard of.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The reason I heard about this channel was because

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
when I made the lecture about Jennifer Dane writes,

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
a lot of people, I talked about that old game she made,

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Boppin, and I guess Ross's Game Dungeon had,

382
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
from years ago, Ross's Game Dungeon had an episode about Boppin,

383
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and a lot of people had heard of Boppin before from that.

384
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I see.

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay, Ross is very...

386
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He does, like, text stuff.

387
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He says he's not good with computers,

388
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but he's way better with them than me.

389
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Like, he will, like, emulate games,

390
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and he will, like, go into the code

391
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and, like, hack it specific...

392
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't know if it's hacking, but, you know,

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
he will modify the code to make games, like, play in widescreen,

394
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
even if they, like, natively run in 4.3.

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He, like, hates games that don't run in widescreen,

396
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and he will, like...

397
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He will take, like, pains to make these, like,

398
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
old, like, Windows 32-era game,

399
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
like, 3D games run on widescreen.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't know.

401
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He's passionately against, like, shaders

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that cause aliasing on pixels in games.

403
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He gets, like, upset about that. I don't know.

404
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh, like, like, anti-aliasing?

405
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Like, smoothing out the pixels and stuff?

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah.

407
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That's a huge pet peeve of mine, too,

408
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
but I've never gone and, like,

409
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
tried to put something in 16x9 that's in 4.3.

410
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't mind the anti-aliasing.

411
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That doesn't bug me too much.

412
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Every time I play Doom, and, like,

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
it has the anti-aliasing on by default,

414
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
it smooths out all the sprites, and I'm just like,

415
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
no, I want my pixels.

416
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Wait, so, no, no,

417
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
what he hates is when

418
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
like, um,

419
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is when the pixels aren't smoothed.

420
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, my God.

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What a monster.

422
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Like, when, well, he'll, like,

423
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
there's a video, a clip that he shows sometimes,

424
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
there's, like, power lines,

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and there's wires going between the power lines,

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and the pixels on the power line are anti-aliased,

427
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
so they're all, like, individual pixels,

428
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and they kind of, like, fizzle and, like, pop in and out, right?

429
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
As you move your field of view,

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and, like, the tiny little wire moves across the screen.

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You know what I'm saying?

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Uh, sort of.

433
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Uh, okay, I don't know.

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I would have to find the screenshot.

435
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's just the low resolution.

436
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They were just fucking with it.

437
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And, like, a texture looks like it's all, like,

438
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
staticky, right, as you move,

439
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
because the pixels are, like,

440
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I like pixels.

442
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I like when old games look fucked up.

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, I mean, it's good.

444
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You have to, that's, like, part of the aesthetic.

445
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Ugh.

446
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I don't know, he'll play these fucking, like,

447
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
20-year-old games and be like,

448
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
ah.

449
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Why does this not look like a modern game?

450
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I have to, I have to, I have to, though,

451
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
he's like, this isn't good.

452
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I gotta go in and, like, modify the game's code

453
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and, like, lock the game to, like, a higher frame rate,

454
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and, like, overclock my fucking processor

455
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
to, like, make the game run at 60 frames per second

456
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
when it originally ran at, like,

457
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
10.4 or whatever.

458
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh...

459
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Sure.

460
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't...

461
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
He has, he just has such a completely, completely...

462
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That must be a nightmare.

463
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I know a lot of, like, early 3D games,

464
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
they would tie all their physics to frame rate.

465
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So, like, you would have to, like,

466
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
completely, like, redo the whole physics engine

467
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
to get it to work.

468
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He has such a completely different way

469
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
of engaging with the medium of video games.

470
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That is an idea.

471
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That is, uh...

472
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I want to say autism, but no.

473
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's something.

474
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't know.

475
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's that weird laser focus that people have

476
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
about certain specific things.

477
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

478
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah.

479
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I, um...

480
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I've been, I guess, I guess, binging it

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
because, um, I...

482
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Have just been trying to...

483
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Because I've been trying to crank out work

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
on the thing, on the secret thing,

485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and I just...

486
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I've found that that's a good thing

487
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that, like, I don't really need to pay attention to.

488
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You know, that's, that's the hurdle.

489
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That's the problem, is you want,

490
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you want content to put on

491
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to just be noise in the background

492
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and the danger is that, oh, it'll be too interesting

493
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and you'll find yourself having to, like,

494
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
pay attention to it instead of the work you want to be doing.

495
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You know, I do that all the time.

496
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I was doing that with critical role

497
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and it just got too interesting

498
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and so I just tabbed back over to it.

499
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You just got to listen to, like, music.

500
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Just, like, lo-fi, instrumental.

501
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't like music.

502
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Just something to occupy the sound space.

503
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm just...

504
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Music doesn't do that for me.

505
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Music doesn't, like, occupy...

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean, sometimes it does.

507
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Sometimes I'll use, like, rainy mood

508
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and I'll just put on, like, you know, like a thunderstorm,

509
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
like, on loop for, like, 30 hours and just do that.

510
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Well, I use that to sleep.

511
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I do that to sleep sometimes, too.

512
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Just, like, some sort of ambient noise.

513
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't know, just, like, real silence bothers me.

514
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's, like...

515
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It doesn't bother me if I'm...

516
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If I start working on something

517
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and I actually, like, get into working on it,

518
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
it doesn't matter if, like, it's quiet or not.

519
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't even notice.

520
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
But, like, when I'm starting,

521
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I feel, like, it's, like, harder for me to start

522
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
because I feel, like, oh, it's quiet.

523
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Like, my mind isn't occupied.

524
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Like, something is...

525
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I need something.

526
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's, like, the fact that there's no noise

527
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
or is, like, distracting almost.

528
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah.

529
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, I guess that's how I'm gonna describe it.

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I find that, like, in the beginning,

531
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I need something to, kind of, like, occupy that part of my brain.

532
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then I'll get into it for a while,

533
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
like, usually within, like, a half an hour to 45 minutes,

534
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
my brain will start to drift, regardless of what I'm doing,

535
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
unless I'm, like, stuck on something.

536
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If I'm having, like, a problem, like, my brain will just laser-focus

537
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
on trying to get that fixed while, like, raging.

538
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But other than that, like, my brain always starts to drift.

539
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And if I have something that's interesting on the background,

540
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
like, you know, like, Critical Role or, like, YouTube videos or something,

541
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'll just, like, drift back towards that

542
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and forget what I was doing.

543
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And then two hours later, I'm like,

544
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
why am I watching Best of the Worst Episode 75 for the fifth time?

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I should be working.

546
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So, like, music is just the safe thing,

547
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
because, like, I'll just open the tab,

548
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and it'll be the little raccoon walking on the sidewalk,

549
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and I'll be like, yep, she's still walking,

550
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and then I can go back and do what I'm doing.

551
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm supposed to be working.

552
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh, it's so bad.

553
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Now I'm supposed to be working right now.

554
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I woke up today at 11, and I was like,

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
oh, I got, like, four hours to work on my secret project

556
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
before the podcast starts.

557
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But then I didn't, and I went and got food,

558
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and then I don't even know what happened.

559
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The podcast is just the worst.

560
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The podcast is a nightmare.

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It fucks up your whole day, right?

562
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It really is. It does for me.

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's in the middle of the day, so it's like,

564
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
it's not like you can get it out of the way early,

565
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
or it's not like you can wrap everything up before it at night.

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's just like, no matter what you start,

567
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
or when you start it, it interrupts it.

568
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah.

569
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's like, lately, I've seen a couple of, like,

570
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
you know, haha-relatable comics

571
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that I have been, like,

572
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
yes.

573
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I do, it is relatable

574
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
about, like,

575
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I saw one that was, like,

576
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
you know, oh,

577
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
only I have to do something

578
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
in four hours.

579
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Guess I can't, I can't do anything.

580
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yeah.

581
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And the podcast does that every Sunday to me.

582
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I can't do anything before, because, oh,

583
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
in, like, six hours from now, I have to do the podcast,

584
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and then afterwards, like, oh, well,

585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I have to go to sleep in, like, five hours from now,

586
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
so I can't do anything.

587
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I've been, like, trying to push myself through that,

588
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
but something that helped me is, like,

589
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
after I did the PCP,

590
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I would usually also record the bonus podcast

591
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I do for my patrons on Sunday as well.

592
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It was, like, another hour on top of that,

593
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and, like, I got to move this to another day.

594
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Yeah.

595
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

596
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I missed my

597
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
patron

598
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
podcast this month. I missed it.

599
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I failed them.

600
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But it's okay,

601
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I made an announcement. I said,

602
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
yes, I missed the Q&A, yes, I missed the podcast.

603
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
However, however,

604
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm going to do another one

605
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
after the secret thing is,

606
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
after the demo of the secret thing is done,

607
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the, like, the semi,

608
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
the patrons only, like,

609
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
early version is done.

610
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And then I'll do a Q&A

611
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
where I talk about that specifically.

612
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I have a plan.

613
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's all part of the plan.

614
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I missed sending out the

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
merch package for this quarter

616
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because I've been doing all these secret projects.

617
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So I just said to everyone

618
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
on that tier on Patreon, I was like,

619
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll just do a double, a double size

620
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
next quarter.

621
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So in April, you'll get two t-shirts, two 3D prints,

622
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
four posters, and a bunch of other stuff

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
instead of the two and ones that I usually send.

624
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I wanted to complain

625
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
about

626
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
problems I was

627
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
encountering on the work,

628
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
on the project with patrons

629
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
because, like, I'm only

630
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
talking to patrons about it.

631
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But so I went into my Discord

632
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
because I have a patrons-only channel

633
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and nobody was in there and I was like,

634
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
what is this? And I realized

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
that Discord patron integration

636
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
had been broken for, like, months.

637
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What? Is it really?

638
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, not in general,

639
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
just on my account.

640
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, shit, I rely on that too.

641
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No, my account had just, like,

642
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I had set it up before,

643
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
but, like, I look back and it just, like, isn't

644
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
there anymore. It, like, it didn't know

645
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
that my, it didn't have my

646
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
server attached, it didn't have the, like,

647
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
patron roles attached to it.

648
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So I fixed that

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and then I, and then

650
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
it dragged a bunch of people, like, into

651
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
my server who I think had been in there

652
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and had left. I think they, like,

653
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
weren't interested in

654
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
but they came back

655
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and so I had a captive audience

656
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that I could complain to about,

657
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
ah, it's too hard, though.

658
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's too hard.

659
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Half of them just, like, what the fuck are you talking about?

660
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I haven't been in here for six months.

661
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I got, um,

662
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I got some, I got some helpful,

663
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I actually got some helpful feedback from a couple of them.

664
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, yeah. It was pretty, it was good.

665
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It helped me, it helped me cope.

666
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I was seething, at first I was seething,

667
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
but afterwards I was

668
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
successfully coping, so

669
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that was an improvement.

670
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Excellent.

671
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Uh,

672
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
yes.

673
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I have too many secret projects right now.

674
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm working on three

675
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and a half secret projects all at the same time.

676
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
How do you,

677
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
you can't work on three at once.

678
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I know, but, but I'm trying anyways.

679
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It sucks.

680
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
What?

681
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Why would you do this?

682
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Because I only have

683
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
eight more years left before I turn

684
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
40 and I'm gonna kill myself

685
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
because no one should be allowed to be that old,

686
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
so I gotta, I gotta make these last,

687
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
this last,

688
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
less than a decade count.

689
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We're gonna, we're gonna look like Prince Harry by then.

690
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh, God.

691
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Don't even say that.

692
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Have you? Okay.

693
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Every time I go on the internet,

694
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I go on Twitter and I realize like

695
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
19 year olds are conscious.

696
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm just like, I am irrelevant.

697
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I am a fossil.

698
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I should, I literally should be dead.

699
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's the worst feeling of all time.

700
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah.

701
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean,

702
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
yeah.

703
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Um,

704
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
it, it, it, I know what you mean.

705
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I wouldn't, it, it wouldn't bother me.

706
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It wouldn't bother me

707
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
except that

708
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't

709
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I don't know how

710
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
to, I don't know.

711
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
If I were still like

712
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
doing my, my work, whatever, doing what I do,

713
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
it would be fine.

714
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Except that I feel like I haven't found any

715
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
new audience in a long time

716
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and that really bothers me and I don't know what to do about it.

717
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well.

718
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm not growing.

719
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The fact that I'm old, the fact that I'm old doesn't,

720
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
doesn't bother me too much

721
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
except for the fact that oh, I've, I've gotten this

722
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
old and yet I feel like I have not

723
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
grown in a while. Ben. Am I,

724
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
am I stagnant now? No, it's because you're doing

725
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
the same thing that I am because it's the reason I haven't

726
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
grown in any fashion either

727
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
in the last like couple years is because

728
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
we're both doing secret projects.

729
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Nobody knows what the fuck we're working on.

730
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The way

731
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
to be successful is you have to broadcast

732
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
everything you're doing constantly.

733
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That's true. That's true.

734
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's true.

735
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
My secret project,

736
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I guess, I guess when mine is

737
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
done, I can probably hype it up to a certain

738
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
extent. I could see maybe

739
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I could see maybe getting a little bit

740
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of word of mouth buzz. I'm not keeping

741
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
my secret project secret until

742
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
it's done. I'm just keeping it secret until

743
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
it's at a state where there's something worth

744
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
presenting because especially one

745
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
of them right now is just so early

746
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that it would be boring

747
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
to even talk about.

748
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Well, I think mine

749
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I think mine isn't actually going to take me.

750
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I mean, if I were if I

751
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
keep working at the pace that I've been working

752
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
on the last couple days, I think

753
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I think that like the early

754
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
version will be done this week and the

755
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
the final version

756
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean who know. I mean, you know

757
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
it's one of those things where like I

758
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
could work on it for another year

759
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and just keep like adding stuff, adding

760
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
stuff, adding stuff, but like I won't do that.

761
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think mine are going to take at least two years.

762
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh, OK

763
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
mine's not like that. Mine's not that big.

764
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's a nightmare. Yeah.

765
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That is a nightmare. Oh my God.

766
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And that's like the first the first of three

767
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
like I have three projects I'm working on

768
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
right now, but the biggest of the three

769
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
is the smallest of a three part larger

770
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
secret project that will probably take 20 years.

771
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
20 years.

772
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
20 years.

773
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
20 years.

774
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You can't you can't plan 20 years.

775
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm not I'm not even thinking about the rest of it, but just

776
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
like thinking about like how slow I work.

777
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
There's not even going to be. Yeah, like I'm dead

778
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
in eight going to be in America in 20 years.

779
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

780
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So that's never going to happen. So I'm not thinking about it, but.

781
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Speaking.

782
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Speaking of the collapse of America.

783
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I did I did something.

784
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I did something a little crazy.

785
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I did something a little wacky. Oh, yeah.

786
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I sold my Bitcoin.

787
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh my God, really? Why?

788
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I sold because

789
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
because I bought

790
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
some last month

791
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
with the plan that I would hold

792
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
until the stimmy thinking that the stimmy

793
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
would cause a bump.

794
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Which didn't really happen,

795
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
but it went up anyway.

796
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But you know, it was up to almost 62

797
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and then it went down to like the mid 50s

798
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and then it went back up to like the high 50s

799
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and I was looking at this kind of wobbling

800
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and I was like,

801
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I expect a crash at some point.

802
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know if it'll be immediate,

803
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but like sometime this year,

804
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I expect that it will drop significantly.

805
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And I think

806
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I've gained a little bit.

807
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I've gained I've made a little money

808
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
from the rise.

809
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And the last time,

810
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
the last time I held,

811
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
you know, I could have just held and held and held,

812
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
but I also could have just sold

813
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
earlier and I would have made money there too.

814
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The reason why I didn't make money earlier

815
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
was that I held too long.

816
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I was thinking maybe like, maybe now is the time

817
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
to like sell.

818
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So I can lock in what gains I've made

819
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and wait for,

820
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I mean, it could be wrong, maybe there won't be any crash,

821
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but if there is, maybe now is the time

822
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to try and like beat it out.

823
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So that's what I did.

824
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I sold at about 58

825
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
on down a little bit since then.

826
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's at 57.4.

827
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So I feel

828
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I feel like,

829
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I don't know.

830
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I feel good. I feel good having sold.

831
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm like, I'm kind of done.

832
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm done with it for now.

833
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I don't really

834
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't understand why Bitcoin is so valuable

835
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
other than it was the first like the novelty

836
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
of it because like everything that's

837
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
happening in the crypto space seems to be built

838
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
on top of it.

839
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So like, yeah, like the whole NFT thing

840
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we're talking about last week, that's all built on top of Ethereum

841
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and things like that. Like I was watching some stuff

842
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
about Ethereum in general and they were saying

843
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
how like Ethereum was built because

844
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Bitcoin wasn't sophisticated

845
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
enough to build more

846
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
applications on top of it.

847
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So Ethereum was built because

848
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Bitcoin sucked and

849
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
for some reason, Bitcoin's worth like 60

850
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
times the amount and

851
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it makes no sense.

852
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah, I think the common sense answer,

853
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I think the obvious answer is the right one.

854
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I just think it's the first one that more people know about.

855
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah, and that's it.

856
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I think like

857
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
even though the first one

858
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
it's less sophisticated. Yeah, I think people just

859
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
don't understand crypto like including me.

860
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So like anytime something cool with the blockchain

861
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
happens, I think people just attribute it to

862
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Bitcoin, even though it probably has nothing to do with it.

863
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, for sure.

864
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Because I'm sure if you talked about NFTs to most

865
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
people, they'd be like, oh, the Bitcoin thing.

866
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's like, no, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

867
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't know that until I go deeper and like started looking

868
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
at it. So I don't fucking know.

869
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I keep thinking like maybe I should just

870
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
like start investing hardcore in Ethereum

871
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
because I feel like that's set to blow up

872
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
soon. But

873
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
this is the first time I've opened

874
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
my stock portfolio

875
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in like a week and a half

876
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and you know what?

877
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I just stopped caring.

878
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm in the red right now. I feel nothing.

879
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's okay.

880
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Dogecoin is up

881
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
to 0.57.

882
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So that means I still have up almost $300

883
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
of my initial investment.

884
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Dogecoin...

885
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Wait, is it up?

886
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It looked like it was very gradually

887
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
trickling down.

888
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's trickling down right now.

889
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
From the last time I looked at my portfolio

890
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
it was at 0.5 last time I looked.

891
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Now it's at 0.57.

892
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Wait, what is Ethereum?

893
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm trying to find my...

894
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Okay, here's my

895
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Ethereum to Bitcoin. I don't care about that.

896
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What's Ethereum to USD?

897
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Show me Ethereum to USD.

898
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Ethereum is 1,796 currently.

899
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It is...

900
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay, it's...

901
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It had the exact same bump

902
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
as Bitcoin did. They move almost

903
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
in lockstep.

904
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
On the 14th they both had

905
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
a pretty substantial little jump

906
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and then hold and then like an equal drop afterwards.

907
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's why I think

908
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
people just

909
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
equivalent all

910
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
crypto stuff with Bitcoin. That's why

911
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
all the coins, all the altcoins

912
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
seems to just mirror it.

913
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I don't know.

914
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
This is not legal financial advice.

915
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

916
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm just looking at tiny graphs on Robinhood.

917
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It is literally

918
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
just that when people are

919
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
investing in one crypto

920
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
they are likely to invest

921
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
in others at the same time, right?

922
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Is that why they move together?

923
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I feel like cryptocurrency

924
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
reminds me a lot of Linux

925
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and open source in general. It's totally open

926
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
so everybody can make their own versions

927
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
of it, but that just makes it so complicated

928
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
that most people don't understand.

929
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's like trying to explain

930
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
to somebody the difference between

931
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Linux Mint and Debian.

932
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Aren't they Linux? It's like, yeah,

933
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
but they're different in this way.

934
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It's like trying to explain the difference

935
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
between Gabogubu and Dubugaba.

936
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's like, you know,

937
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
some people just don't understand what these things are.

938
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Including me.

939
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I just know that they're different. I don't know how.

940
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Hey, guys, what's going on?

941
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Hey!

942
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
We're talking about stupid shit.

943
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We're talking about Bitcoin.

944
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I sold all my Bitcoin.

945
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, you fucking fool.

946
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's going to go to the moon.

947
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You fucking paper hands, paper hands.

948
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's going to...

949
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I think it's going to crash sometime this year.

950
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
If it's going to crash, I want to be there when it happens.

951
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
What's GME at right now? I haven't looked at that.

952
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Maybe down to like 30 or 40.

953
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
GME is still at 200 bucks.

954
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Holy shit. You want to ride that rollercoaster?

955
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah, GME like fully recovered.

956
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It makes me so mad.

957
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
For reference,

958
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
the money that I made

959
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
back from this latest Bitcoin rally

960
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
made up for about half

961
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
of what I lost in GME.

962
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I was hoping it would fully recoup it,

963
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
but I would rather recoup half of it

964
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
than wait for a crash

965
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and lose everything like I did last time.

966
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
If GME

967
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
tanks again, maybe I'll buy some.

968
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
There's apparently more life

969
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
in this fucking...

970
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Whatever.

971
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I would say something, but

972
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
what the fuck do I know?

973
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I sold my GME at 50 bucks,

974
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so don't listen to me.

975
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Obviously, I'm an idiot.

976
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I was saying like trying to understand

977
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
GME is like trying to understand

978
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
why a slot machine lands on all sevens.

979
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It just seems completely arbitrary.

980
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean, I know that the

981
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
second rise had to do with

982
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
the previous

983
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
president stepping down and a new one

984
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
taking over, but I have

985
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
no clue why that would cause the company

986
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
to quadruple in value.

987
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
What's so special about this guy?

988
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Maybe he's a good president,

989
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
a good executive.

990
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I think before he became the president of the company,

991
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
he bought a fuck ton of the shares

992
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and then I know

993
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
they landed a big deal with Microsoft.

994
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
They got a big cash

995
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
infusion for Microsoft and now they have

996
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
this partnership where all

997
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Xboxes sold through GameStop,

998
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
they get a cut of all digital sales from

999
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
that console and shit like that, so there's

1000
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
a big deal they're working on right now.

1001
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Okay, that makes a little more sense.

1002
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Okay.

1003
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
All right.

1004
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, I don't fucking know.

1005
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Money is dumb and I hate it.

1006
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I mean, I love money,

1007
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
but I hate how much I love it.

1008
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I love money, but I hate markets.

1009
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I like markets

1010
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
for non-essential

1011
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
things.

1012
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I think markets are good in the abstract

1013
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
when they're not tied to

1014
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
an inelastic

1015
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
demand, things like

1016
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
food and healthcare.

1017
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
What are these things you're saying?

1018
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm talking about

1019
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I love rubber bands.

1020
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm doing Voshism, I'm doing market socialism.

1021
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Vote for Biden.

1022
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
If I use

1023
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
words big enough that I've heard on live streams,

1024
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
people will think I know what I'm talking about.

1025
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm sorry, I don't have an opinion about that.

1026
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Vosh hasn't done a stream on it yet.

1027
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I won't.

1028
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I refuse.

1029
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Unironically, there are tons of people who think like that.

1030
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I know, I know.

1031
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
For a minute there,

1032
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I was on a Destiny kick and then a Vosh kick,

1033
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
but I'm over it.

1034
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I haven't even been keeping up with my favorite

1035
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
breadtuber, Big Joel.

1036
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Big Joel?

1037
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Big Joel, I love Big Joel.

1038
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Big Joel and Destiny got into a big fight.

1039
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That was pretty funny.

1040
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I didn't watch the stream,

1041
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
but I saw Big Joel's tweets about it

1042
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and Destiny seems like a huge asshole.

1043
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Destiny was being

1044
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
a huge but

1045
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
he was just sort of...

1046
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
As far as I remember,

1047
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
it was Joel having a take

1048
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
on something and Destiny

1049
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
they had a back and forth

1050
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and they disagreed whatever, but afterwards

1051
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Joel was like, well, that was that

1052
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and I don't agree with Destiny

1053
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and Destiny said Joel was a fucking

1054
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
scum-fuck piece of shit for

1055
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
saying that on Twitter afterwards.

1056
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Like he's a lying scum-fuck

1057
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and I was like, Destiny,

1058
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
you are using words that are so

1059
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
overblown for the situation all the time.

1060
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I saw the tweets

1061
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
that were posted afterwards and it seemed like

1062
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
cause he was trying to be conciliatory

1063
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
on stream and then he got off and said

1064
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
this sounds so... I guess if you want to

1065
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
care about your fucking CD player

1066
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
or something, I think there's something like

1067
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
you know what? I'm talking about this

1068
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and I realized that A

1069
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
it meant so little to me

1070
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that I barely remember the circumstances

1071
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and B, I don't give a single fuck

1072
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
so I...

1073
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm invested in Big Joel

1074
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm invested in Big Joel

1075
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm pro-Joel and anti-Destiny now

1076
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
so I'm committed, I have a team

1077
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I've been going back and forth on Destiny

1078
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I mean, for a while there

1079
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I thought after that big row

1080
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
he and Vosh had about

1081
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
where Destiny just seems so

1082
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
unreasonable and so unwilling

1083
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
and I was just like

1084
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you piece of shit

1085
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I don't like you now

1086
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and then I watched another video of his

1087
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
where he was like

1088
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
converting like a

1089
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
right-leaning person's

1090
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
perception of... That's old Destiny

1091
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That's where Destiny is good

1092
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Old Destiny was good

1093
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
No, it wasn't old

1094
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It was a very recent stream

1095
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
So almost like people are nuanced

1096
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and you can agree with certain positions

1097
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and disagree with other positions

1098
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I mean, that's like

1099
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
if he's talking to a right-winger

1100
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
then obviously he seems good

1101
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
in comparison but then he talks to

1102
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
like a socialist and he's like

1103
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
but actually, you know

1104
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Deadly Force should be used

1105
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
by the state

1106
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
by the state in support

1107
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
of capital or whatever

1108
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's just that I feel like

1109
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
his methods of

1110
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
being the way he is

1111
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
speaks more to

1112
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
right-leaning people

1113
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and gets them to engage with ideas

1114
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
they wouldn't otherwise engage with

1115
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
more so than like other

1116
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
like Worsh

1117
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Worsh does it as well but

1118
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
when Destiny talks to

1119
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
a right-leaning person

1120
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
they're more likely...

1121
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Is Destiny the first stop

1122
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
on the alt-left pipeline?

1123
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I think for a lot of people he is

1124
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
because like

1125
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the whole John Tron thing

1126
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
got a lot of people who are just fans of John Tron

1127
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and not political in any way

1128
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
to like

1129
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
at first they were mad at him

1130
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
but if they actually watched it they'd be like

1131
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
oh John, that doesn't sound right

1132
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
then they start to doubt

1133
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
the people they idolize

1134
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and then that gets a lot of people thinking different

1135
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
If I can't trust John Tron then

1136
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
what's left for me?

1137
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Well, I was so hesitant to like

1138
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
hate on John Tron

1139
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
at all, I didn't really do any of that stuff

1140
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and he was funny

1141
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
cause like it's John Tron

1142
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
cause it's John Tron, like he's not a bad guy

1143
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
like he's a funny guy

1144
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
he's just a chubby funny guy

1145
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
He's not technically a white nationalist

1146
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
he just says the things that they say

1147
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
He would never say anything terrible

1148
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
he can't like

1149
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
he can't have like any like fucked up ideas

1150
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
or anything

1151
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
because if he did

1152
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that would mean that such things

1153
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
they're like deeply ingrained in our culture

1154
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
in a way that's like invisible and insidious

1155
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and that would be fucked up

1156
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It would

1157
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So I think Destiny has

1158
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
has worth in that

1159
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
aspect of like moving people to the left

1160
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
generally on a lot of other things

1161
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
he's kind of

1162
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
an annoying asshole

1163
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
He's a lib, it's literally just the problem

1164
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
is that he's a lib so he looks good

1165
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
in comparison to right wingers and bad

1166
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
in comparison to lefties and like that's

1167
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
it

1168
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So when he's talking to

1169
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
a MAGA kid or whatever it's like

1170
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
he got the dunk in

1171
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't think he's like a terrible person

1172
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
but it's like

1173
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
stances in

1174
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
like no but I would

1175
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
early on

1176
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
hate Destiny as a person

1177
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
because of the way he would interact with people

1178
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
and that's not a good way to hate someone

1179
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
you know like you should hate someone

1180
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
having

1181
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
disagreements but like being able to

1182
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
have fun with them anyway because they're

1183
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
kind of he's alright

1184
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
when he's a human being

1185
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
he's not like the worst person ever

1186
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
like I've flipped flopped on

1187
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
the extent to which

1188
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I hate a person

1189
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
like Destiny and like you know what

1190
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
ultimately he's just a guy

1191
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I shouldn't get too worked up about

1192
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Destiny this or that

1193
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Exactly

1194
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I just I reached a point

1195
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I reached a point where I had

1196
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
heard enough I had heard enough

1197
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
fucking debates on the internet

1198
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I know everything already

1199
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I unsubbed from all the debates

1200
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I blocked all the recommendations for them on my

1201
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
YouTube and literally the next day

1202
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I felt better because I didn't see

1203
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
bad ideas anymore

1204
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I was like oh my god

1205
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
this is a great idea

1206
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
all the time people spend

1207
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
listening to debate bros on twitch

1208
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
would be better spent

1209
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
investing in bitcoin

1210
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
doesn't take that long to do that

1211
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
you should take the more

1212
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
time you spend investing in bitcoin

1213
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
the better your results will be

1214
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I promise

1215
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I just I just see instead of seeing

1216
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Destiny and Vosh stream recommendations

1217
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
on my YouTube I just see like

1218
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
every episode of best of the worst now

1219
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm like ah life is good again

1220
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
this is great

1221
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
can you block certain channels on YouTube

1222
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
yeah you just like click the little dots

1223
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
on the thumbnail and you go don't recommend

1224
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
channel and it's like okay

1225
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I've never done that

1226
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
but I might start doing that

1227
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
it's incredible because every time you see like some

1228
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
stupid viral video that like somehow got back

1229
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
in the algorithm you're just like never show me this again

1230
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
what really bugs me is twitter

1231
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
twitter has started recommending me

1232
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
like topics

1233
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
it didn't use

1234
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
did you install the better twitter plugin yet?

1235
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
no I'll do that right now

1236
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'll do that

1237
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
it keeps recommending me

1238
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
it tried to get me to follow Elon musk

1239
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
as a topic the other day and I have never

1240
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
been so insulted in my entire life

1241
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I have never been more disgusted

1242
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
um

1243
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
you can tell it to not

1244
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
recommend you that topic anymore

1245
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but it will continue to recommend you other topics

1246
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I think the only

1247
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
the only like weird thing about the better twitter plugin

1248
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
is that when it blocks stuff

1249
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
it doesn't like get rid of the space

1250
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
it's just a gap of like

1251
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
what would be there and it's just blank

1252
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
which is kind of weird but it's also good

1253
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
because it gives you a moment to be like wait a minute

1254
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
you can appreciate that the software is doing something

1255
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
what am I doing with my life right now

1256
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm just like scrolling for the last 15 minutes

1257
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and now I'm just there's just nothing there to distract

1258
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
my brain I realize what I'm doing I'm like

1259
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I have better things to do in my life right now

1260
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
so it's kind of a power move in disguise

1261
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
yeah

1262
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
better twitter hide retweets

1263
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
refresh oh it doesn't even need to refresh

1264
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
wow there's nothing here

1265
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
it's all gone

1266
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
your entire time on it just destroyed

1267
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
better twitter is

1268
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
is just nothing

1269
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
yeah that says a lot

1270
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
it's a better version yeah

1271
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
makes you think thought provoking

1272
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
uh

1273
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
oof

1274
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Gib did you forget about daylight savings time

1275
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I didn't forget I was

1276
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I was having a wolf I was wolf

1277
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
pilling my parents

1278
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I don't know what the fuck that means

1279
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that sounds terrifying

1280
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
that sounds terrible

1281
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
you know wolf peck I must have talked about it before

1282
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
no it's a band

1283
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
like a funky like

1284
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
contemporary funky comedy

1285
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
not comedy but like really good musicians

1286
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
um and

1287
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I don't think you've ever mentioned this before

1288
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I've definitely mentioned it but maybe it didn't stick

1289
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
because it wasn't that interesting at the time

1290
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
but like wolf pilling

1291
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
is when you show people

1292
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
wolf peck live at Madison Square Garden

1293
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
concert and then they go oh

1294
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
oh it's so cool

1295
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and good and then they love it

1296
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
that's

1297
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
that's how I was doing that I was busy

1298
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
oh I

1299
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I clicked over to it and there's a guy

1300
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
going into

1301
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
a little saxophone and oh yeah

1302
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
like okay

1303
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
oh it is a tiny saxophone

1304
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
it's him and

1305
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
he's he's plucking he's plucking a violin

1306
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
no no it's a mandolin

1307
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I think

1308
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
oh okay

1309
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
yeah that those are

1310
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
another guy I'm not sure

1311
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
what his name is

1312
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
but I know these guys from from youtube videos

1313
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I found them I was looking at music

1314
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000

1315
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000

1316
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
they do lots of instrumental and funky

1317
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and soulful

1318
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
stuff that's wholesome and cool

1319
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and they're very very very talented

1320
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
go listen to the wolf peck

1321
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000

1322
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000

1328
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
okay

1329
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I get it so we put that on the tv

1330
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and my parents were like wow

1331
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
like what years this is

1332
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
you know music these

1334
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000

1335
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
they couldn't even believe it was 2019

1336
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
culture death

1337
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
yeah yeah yeah

1338
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I've never

1339
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
making real music in the year of our lord

1340
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
2020

1341
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
it's because it's like

1342
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
my parents they don't use youtube

1343
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and so much new cool music

1344
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
is on youtube but it's not like on tv

1345
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
they would never see something like wolf peck ever

1346
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
but people like me who are hip and trendy

1347
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
do see it

1348
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm all in the know on the cool

1349
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
new bands that are around

1350
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like wolf peck and

1351
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
loose coal and

1352
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
stuff

1353
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
damn

1354
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
you must be popular

1355
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
no

1356
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
despite all my music knowledge

1357
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
despite everything

1358
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
my existence is meaningless

1359
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
ah cringe

1360
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
but also based

1361
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
what else

1362
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
before you showed up

1363
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
we were talking about

1364
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
all our secret projects and shit

1365
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and um

1366
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
shit like that and not saying anything

1367
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
because they're too secret to be discussed

1368
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
yeah it's a great topic for a podcast

1369
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
super interesting

1370
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
did you see my little Clarissa animation

1371
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I made

1372
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
it was on twitter

1373
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
she gets a gun out

1374
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
she gets a gun out

1375
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I just thought that was nice

1376
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
but if you haven't seen it

1377
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I will grab it

1378
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I need to learn to animate so bad

1379
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
oh wait

1380
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
oh I see it

1381
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
oh yeah

1382
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I wasn't feeling so good over the last week

1383
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
so I didn't really

1384
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
manage to do anything

1385
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
but I just picked up

1386
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
procreate on ipad has

1387
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
like a animation assist thing where each layer

1388
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
becomes like an onion skin for another layer

1389
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
so I just

1390
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
did a little thing and I was like yeah it's pretty good

1391
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I guess I still have like skill in that area

1392
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
the follow through on the holster is really good

1393
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
oh yeah didn't you like study animation

1394
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
like at school or something

1395
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
like I got a degree in it like or something

1396
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
oh my wow

1397
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
weird

1398
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
it's almost like I have

1399
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
should be incredible

1400
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
but I'm not I'm just sort of alright

1401
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
hmm

1402
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the

1403
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
it's good

1404
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
follow through

1405
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
did she get shot in the head at the end?

1406
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
yeah she does

1407
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
damn

1408
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I wasn't sure if it was her

1409
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
shooting her own gun and being like

1410
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
or okay okay now I know

1411
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I have been

1412
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I have been I think

1413
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I've been more productive this week and the reason

1414
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
why was because I have

1415
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I had a game of Noida

1416
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
that went really really far

1417
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and it took me a long

1418
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I spent like a day and a half just like

1419
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
having the most

1420
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
the most the furthest game of

1421
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Noida I've played and when

1422
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
when I finally died I was like

1423
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I'm sick of this shit

1424
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
uh no more

1425
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and I haven't played Noida since

1426
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and it's good

1427
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
because you could that shit can

1428
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
eat up your whole day if you let it

1429
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
that's video games

1430
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that's video games

1431
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I mean that game

1432
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
it took me it literally took me like

1433
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
30 hours and I think I just stayed up

1434
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
for like 30 hours straight

1435
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
oh my god

1436
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
just becoming just becoming a Noida god

1437
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
uh uh

1438
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
by the end I had like

1439
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I had these like teleporting wands

1440
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
with like modifiers to make the teleport

1441
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
spells like have really low duration

1442
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
so I would just hold down

1443
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
the button and just like

1444
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
machine gun out like short

1445
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
teleport spells that would just make me like

1446
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
like across the screen like

1447
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
so I could just like shoot across the

1448
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
entire world

1449
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
uh in in in like

1450
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
a minute but like

1451
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
because like you can't really control the direction

1452
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I you're like spazzing around

1453
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
the screen you're like up down left

1454
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
but like generally

1455
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
sort of making progress in a left word

1456
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
or right word or upward direction

1457
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
uh

1458
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and uh

1459
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
just going around and like shooting like

1460
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I had a wand that would shoot out like a big

1461
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
like shotgun spread of black

1462
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
holes that would just eat like

1463
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
all the terrain in front of me and I was just

1464
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
like going through these caverns

1465
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
just like

1466
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
just like just annihilating

1467
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
like literally annihilating all the terrain

1468
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
in front just like just just just going through

1469
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the world just erasing it behind

1470
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
me it was pretty cool

1471
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
um but then I touched some polymorphine

1472
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
and I died uh which is

1473
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
pretty much the only thing that can kill you

1474
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
at that point in the game uh and that's

1475
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
what happened wow sad

1476
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
sad yeah

1477
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
boy but I'm

1478
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
but when I but after after like 30 hours

1479
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
sunk into it when I died I was kind of like

1480
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm glad like thank

1481
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
you I'm free I'm free and I

1482
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
hate this game now uh

1483
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
uh for a while anyway

1484
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
uh my the spell is broken

1485
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
uh

1486
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
for how long

1487
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
all I had to do oh it turns out all I had to do

1488
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
uh to break my noida addiction

1489
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
was just indulge

1490
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
it so hard

1491
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
that it uh

1492
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
that uh I don't know

1493
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
things just fix themselves

1494
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
for no reason yeah

1495
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
yeah basically it's like

1496
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
cigarettes you know

1497
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
you gotta smoke all these cigarettes now

1498
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
you gotta smoke the whole

1499
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
you gotta smoke the whole carton

1500
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and then that'll teach you

1501
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
kid

1502
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
that's definitely how it works I've saw it on TV

1503
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
oh

1504
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1505
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I uh I

1506
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
found this um

1507
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
well I didn't find it somebody

1508
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
posted it and I was like oh that sounds like fun

1509
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
um it's a

1510
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
geography what is it

1511
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
online dot satara dot com

1512
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
it's a it's a guess

1513
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
we'll find where the country is

1514
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
on the map every single country

1515
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
on the earth and click on it

1516
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and you get three tries before it just tells you

1517
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
where it is and if you get it right

1518
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
immediately it it's like

1519
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
bright it goes white but if you get

1520
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
it wrong um it becomes

1521
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
red and you have to fill in the the entire

1522
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
world and I played this

1523
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and I realized how pathetic

1524
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
my knowledge of geography of

1525
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
particularly Africa is

1526
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm like Africa was just like

1527
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
you know you don't learn about African

1528
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
there's so many countries

1529
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
in Africa and like they're so big

1530
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
there's no way they're like

1531
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the same country they're not

1532
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
even slightly similar there's so much

1533
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
you know landmass there

1534
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
so I went on like a on a

1535
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
geography learning binge

1536
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I went to I went to

1537
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
just a random like

1538
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
country in Africa that I got completely wrong

1539
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
didn't know what it was what the flag was

1540
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
whatever some of them I thought

1541
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
were like in South America or like

1542
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
fucking

1543
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Middle East or whatever I'm just I'm done

1544
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
it was so so embarrassing

1545
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and I picked a flag I picked

1546
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
a flag and then I just

1547
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Wikipediaed it and then I just looked

1548
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
into it and then

1549
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I feel like I want to do that for every country

1550
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that I got wrong I just want to know the shape of the country

1551
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
the flag and a little bit about

1552
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
the culture of it and like the history

1553
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
yesterday I was looking at

1554
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Mali which is

1555
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
like North

1556
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
West Africa

1557
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and that's like

1558
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
got a cultural

1559
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
like story about

1560
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
like an emperor who

1561
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
appears to have inspired the Lion King

1562
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm not sure whether that's true

1563
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
but he was called the Lion King

1564
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
he's like the emperor of Mali

1565
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
of the Mali empire

1566
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and he was like you know all that stuff

1567
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and that was cool and then I was looking

1568
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
into like what was the rape of

1569
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Africa actually like what happened why did that happen

1570
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
and I looked into like

1571
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
how Africa was

1572
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
divvied up between European nations who were just like

1573
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
curving up the land to get

1574
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
resources because of a economic

1575
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
depression they thought well we'll just

1576
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
we'll just rape Africa let's do it

1577
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and they fought over Africa

1578
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
why not and they split it up

1579
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and that's where some of the weird borders in

1580
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Africa that are completely straight lines that's

1581
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
the Europeans I mean all of it

1582
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
before before

1583
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Africa was like

1584
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
divvied up into those countries

1585
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
they had like empires that overlapped each other

1586
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
there were no like the entirety

1587
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
of Africa was not

1588
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
owned by any individual like

1589
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
country wasn't like split up

1590
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
which is weird to look at as a map

1591
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
because it's like there's a big

1592
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
blob there that is no one's there

1593
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
apparently there's not even

1594
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
no borders no government or nothing

1595
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
just little

1596
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
smaller blobs that don't even fill the entirety

1597
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
of the landmass of Africa like what the fuck

1598
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I've never seen I've never even considered

1599
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
that you can have a world where

1600
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
the borders don't technically like

1601
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
line up to touching each other

1602
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
but that's like the ultimate like

1603
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
if you

1604
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
if you try to conquer the world and everybody's

1605
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
got a stake and everybody has a flag and

1606
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
everybody's fighting eventually all the borders

1607
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
will touch

1608
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
it doesn't didn't need to be like

1609
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
that now this is just interesting I'm just on

1610
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
a big learning curve learning time

1611
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
that's why I posted that tweet of me

1612
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
learning it was so fun

1613
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
to learn so much I felt so good

1614
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
about it

1615
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I'm on the site

1616
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
right now

1617
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
it gave me a bunch of like hard balls

1618
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
right off the bat

1619
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
there's so many countries in the world

1620
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
what the fuck is San Marino

1621
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
yeah it includes like tiny

1622
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
islands that are technically their own nations

1623
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
as well like groups of islands as well

1624
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
so like

1625
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Lichtenstein

1626
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Lichtenstein is in the middle of Europe

1627
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I think

1628
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
it is it's between

1629
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I thought Luxembourg was Lichtenstein

1630
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I think it's between

1631
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Switzerland and is that Hungary

1632
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
oh god

1633
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
oh god I thought I knew

1634
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000

1635
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000

1636
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Netherlands I know where Netherlands is

1637
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Luxembourg

1638
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
it's one of these cities

1639
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
it's this tiny little thing yeah yeah next to

1640
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
something okay I'm

1641
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm a fucking genius

1642
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
so I wanted to

1643
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I would encourage everyone

1644
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
to go to this link and play this game

1645
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
see what you know about the world

1646
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
because it's fun just like

1647
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
having some reason to look into

1648
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
something because there's so much information out there

1649
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and

1650
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
learning is fun I didn't know that

1651
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
yeah you hear

1652
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
about learning

1653
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
fucking Bulgaria

1654
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Hungary

1655
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Slovenia

1656
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
these aren't real

1657
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
they're in the Eurovision Song Contest

1658
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and we always lose

1659
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
UK always loses the Eurovision Song Contest

1660
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
because they hate us

1661
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
what the fuck is that

1662
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
what the fuck is that

1663
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
it's a

1664
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
a song contest that is

1665
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
it's like the Olympics

1666
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
but for singing and in Europe

1667
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
it includes Russia and Australia

1668
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
so it's like

1669
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Europe's got talent

1670
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I guess Russia is Europe

1671
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
it just like stretches all the way to

1672
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
other parts of the world

1673
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Russia's so big

1674
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Cyprus

1675
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
yeah Cyprus

1676
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
oh it's a tiny little

1677
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
why is Cyprus

1678
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
considered Europe

1679
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
it's like south of fucking Turkey

1680
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
yeah Turkey's in the Eurovision Song Contest

1681
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
as well

1682
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I guess Turkey is considered

1683
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
part of

1684
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
the Middle East slash Northern Africa

1685
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
why is Turkey

1686
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
not part of Europe

1687
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but Cyprus is that's insane

1688
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
the only ones in Africa

1689
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I remember getting was Egypt

1690
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
South Africa the Central African Republic

1691
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
for obvious reasons because they just

1692
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
tell you where they are

1693
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and then like Algeria

1694
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and the rest I didn't know

1695
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
what the fuck is Andorra

1696
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000

1697
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I saw Avatar

1698
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I remember Andorra

1699
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Europe why I know where that is

1700
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
because it's funny

1701
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
okay it's between France

1702
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and Spain

1703
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
then we'd be like talking about

1704
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
things that nobody can see

1705
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000

in my opinion

1783
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
your ideas have merit but I don't like

1784
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
the cut of your gym so you're gonna die

1785
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
now

1786
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
solid

1787
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
to follow

1788
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
what the fuck to follow

1789
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
to follow oh I actually got it in the third

1790
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
such a place

1791
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
it's an island in Africa

1792
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
no it's an island near

1793
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
fucking Indonesia

1794
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I see

1795
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Vietnam I know that

1796
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I actually

1797
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
don't know where

1798
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Vietnam is exactly or like what it looks

1799
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
like

1800
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
it's just the low channel and it's on the coast

1801
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
oh okay

1802
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
that makes sense

1803
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
um

1804
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
alright

1805
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
um yeah anyway

1806
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
let's move on from

1807
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
where is the country

1808
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000

1811
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and then come back and say I learned this

1812
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
this is an educational podcast

1813
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
here before someone said I learned Ben's

1814
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
bad with Bitcoin

1815
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
no no no no you're gonna you laugh

1816
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
now but the dip is coming the dip

1817
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
is coming well here's here's the thing

1818
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
if you do one thing and I do the opposite at least

1819
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
one of us might get rich

1820
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
hmm that's a good idea for a podcast

1821
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
you guys just always do the opposite of everything

1822
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
each episode someone's always

1823
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
right and you call it the always right podcast

1824
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
if you

1825
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
always right

1826
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
somebody yeah one person

1827
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
that'd be so bad like one person buys

1828
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
tons of Bitcoin the other one

1829
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
wait doesn't sells it doesn't buy

1830
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
it doesn't

1831
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
buy something else

1832
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
it's like one of us made the better investment

1833
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
one of us was right

1834
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Christ you can either buy

1835
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
or not and if you don't

1836
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
and it goes up you feel

1837
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
sad

1838
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
wait okay well they would be like okay

1839
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
one person invests like

1840
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I don't know maybe a thousand dollars

1841
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
into Bitcoin and the other

1842
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
person just has a pot of like a thousand

1843
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
dollars USD

1844
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and then

1845
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
yeah yeah you just you start with

1846
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
a pot that you pay that you

1847
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
set aside for yourself and then

1848
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
once one

1849
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
sells when the other buys and and vice yeah

1850
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
you could do it it would be great

1851
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
uh

1852
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
the PCP the only podcast where we

1853
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
have ideas for better podcasts

1854
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
on our show one ends up rich

1855
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and the other ends up poor and then

1856
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
the rich one buys the poor one

1857
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
into servitude and then

1858
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
let's play channel

1859
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and then and then well

1860
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and then they get a new guy in to be the

1861
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
new other guy

1862
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
he's got to buy in his own pot and then

1863
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
the goal and you know whoever wins

1864
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
that contest buys the other

1865
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
two and it's just like a rolling ball

1866
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and like each time

1867
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
a new person ends up owning all the other

1868
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
ones until they become

1869
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
a multinational corporation yeah

1870
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and then and they start a let's play channel

1871
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
and then they start a they start

1872
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
a service they start like a like a video

1873
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
streaming service like Polaris or something

1874
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000

favorite primates

1903
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
yeah

1904
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
there's so many to choose from

1905
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
gonna have to go with human

1906
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
probably something like a

1907
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
maybe like maybe like a lemur

1908
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000

1909
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
monkeys and apes and all that

1910

lemurs are pretty cool

1911
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
lemurs are yeah I like lemurs

1912
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
because I think monkeys

1913
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
and apes in general are pretty ugly

1914
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
but lemurs like just look like a

1915
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
they're sort of like a cute like

1916
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
cat looking thing so I think they're like

1917
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
less off-putting yeah they're sort of almost

1918
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
squarely

1919
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
yeah and they're in the Madagascar

1920
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000

1921
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000

1926
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
they do

1927
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
predictably um my favorite is the gibbon

1928
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
mmm

1929
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I didn't see the text on this game

1930
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
yeah that's me

1931
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Mikey going to get his gun

1932
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
just

1933
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
the way they hold their hands up

1934
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
he's pretty good

1935
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
such long arms like whoa

1936
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I gotta put them somewhere otherwise they'll drag on the ground

1937
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
do they not have tails

1938
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
no gibbons are like

1939
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
they're like teddy bears

1940
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
that's pretty good

1941
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
he's got his fucking like ice climbers face

1942
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
yeah he's got like a

1943
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
like a built-in parka

1944
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
built-in

1945
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
just reminds me of all the way

1946
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
back in the day on the furry

1947
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
episode of the pzp

1948
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
where one of you guys said that my persona

1949
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
was an orangutan and I've never forgotten

1950
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I think that was me

1951
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I think it was you actually

1952
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
because you're lanky

1953
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I know to this day I'm just like oh no

1954
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
this is why I can't ever go outside

1955
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
no one wants to see the orangutan

1956
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
in the store

1957
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I'm sorry

1958
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
orangutans

1959
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I promise it's not because

1960
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
you're as hideous as an orangutan

1961
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I'm pretty close though

1962
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
look at these guys

1963
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
they love each other

1964
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
incredible

1965
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I need to find my orangutan gf I guess

1966
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
oh these guys

1967
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
God look at them

1968
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
ew

1969
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
this is what you see when you see me

1970
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I thought they were bigger

1971
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
they're so short

1972
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
there are probably like different types

1973
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I think the kind of orangutan that have the

1974
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
weird like flesh

1975
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
like side head

1976
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
things

1977
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
maybe I wasn't thinking of an orangutan

1978
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
what is king louie in jungle book

1979
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
what kind of monkey is he with the really long arms

1980
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
is he an orangutan

1981
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
he's just an idealized disney orangutan

1982
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and not the real nightmares

1983
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
we have to share the earth with

1984
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
why do some of them look like this

1985
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
what is that going on there

1986
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
that is incredible

1987
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I feel like it might be an alpha male thing

1988
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
like the alpha male grows those on the side of its head

1989
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and then everyone else is just normal

1990
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
is that really what happens

1991
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
like a lion's mane or something

1992
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
maybe some different types

1993
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm gonna go learn some stuff

1994
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
hashtag learning

1995
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
this is just a learn podcast now

1996
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
look at things the viewers can't see

1997
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
and talk about them

1998
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
the name orangutan means

1999
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
man of the forest in the Malay language

2000
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
man of the forest

2001
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
in what language? in Malay

2002
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Malaysia

2003
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
flanged male bornians

2004
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Sumatran and Tapanuli

2005
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
okay so some orangutans

2006
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
are called flanged

2007
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
which means they have the flange

2008
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
okay okay

2009
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
the flange look at this

2010
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
this guy

2011
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
these are the same type

2012
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
adult male

2013
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and female Tapanuli orangutans

2014
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
so I think it is a male female thing

2015
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
that orangutan has a sick beard

2016
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I'm gonna give him that

2017
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
pretty powerful

2018
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
hmm

2019
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
you know I'm turning around on this

2020
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I wonder if this is where ginshers came from

2021
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
hmm

2022
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
oh wait a minute look at this

2023
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
okay these ones

2024
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
are flanged in an unflanged male here

2025
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
oh it's like

2026
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
circumcision

2027
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
some of them have their flanges cut off

2028
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and then they lose sensation

2029
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
oh no

2030
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
are you just saying that

2031
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
where are you reading this

2032
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
no yes some orangutans

2033
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
they do facial circumcision

2034
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
it's like a

2035
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
they've learned how to use tools but only for that

2036
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
yeah some

2037
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
orangutans are the original

2038
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Hebrew rabbis that invented the practice

2039
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
actually

2040
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
oh

2041
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
that's where it comes from

2042
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
we're learning a lot today

2043
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and

2044
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
yeah I can't

2045
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I can't really make out a clear rhyme or reason

2046
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
to like which

2047
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
ones of them are fucked up in the face

2048
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
they're not fucked up

2049
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
they're just big

2050
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I mean compared to the other face that's an improvement

2051
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
let's be real

2052
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
we have mumps

2053
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
a little bit

2054
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
control f

2055
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
flanged

2056
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
control f

2057
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
okay

2058
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
adult males may develop distinctive cheek

2059
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
pads or flanges

2060
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
younger males do not and resemble

2061
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
okay so

2062
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I don't think it's all types of orangutans

2063
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
males get the flanges

2064
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
but only the males get it

2065
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and like in some

2066
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
strains of the

2067
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
that is bizarre

2068
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I wonder what the evolutionary advantage of that

2069
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
is that cause it to stick

2070
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
okay okay they may exhibit

2071
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
males become sexually mature

2072
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
around age 15 they may exhibit

2073
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
arrested development by not developing

2074
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
the distinctive cheek pads pronounced throat

2075
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
pouches long fur or long

2076
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
calls I don't know what a call is

2077
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
until a resident

2078
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
dominant male is absent

2079
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
the transformation from unflanged

2080
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
can occur quickly

2081
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
flanged males attract females in estrus

2082
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
with their characteristic long calls

2083
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
which may also suppress development in younger males

2084
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
what the fuck

2085
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
are you fucking kidding me

2086
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
that doesn't sound real

2087
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
what you're what this is saying

2088
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
is that in a fucking orangutan tribe

2089
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
one like the fucking patriarch

2090
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
orangutan has a flanged face

2091
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
and all the other males are just like

2092
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
they go unflanged and then if that like

2093
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
top flanged guy

2094
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
dies then like one of the other guys

2095
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
is like I'm the new daddy

2096
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
now and then his face will

2097
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
fucking transform

2098
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and then you giant rat

2099
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
how

2100
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
becomes the new giant rat

2101
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
how that's like that's like if humans

2102
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
like there was just like one muscular

2103
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
guy and if he died someone randomly

2104
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
in your town just became muscular

2105
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
wait look at this this is insane

2106
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
listen to this

2107
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
unflanged males

2108
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
wander widely in search of estrus females

2109
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
and oh my god

2110
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and upon finding one will force

2111
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
copulation on her

2112
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
the occurrence of which is unusually high among mammals

2113
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
females prefer to mate

2114
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
with the fitter flanged males

2115
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and seek their company for protection

2116
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
non ovulating males do not usually

2117
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
non ovulating females do not

2118
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
usually resist copulation with unflanged males

2119
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
as the chance of conception is low

2120
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
resident males may form

2121
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
consort ships that last for days

2122
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
weeks or months after copulation

2123
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
homosexual behavior has been recorded

2124
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
in the context of both affiliative and

2125
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
aggressive interactions

2126
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
holy shit

2127
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
so is this like we officially

2128
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
learned too much on this podcast now

2129
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
if you don't have the flange

2130
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
then you're basically

2131
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
an incel orangutan

2132
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
yes it's literally

2133
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
virgins and chads it's real

2134
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
it's just biology guys

2135
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
that's what we've learned today

2136
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
guys if you're a chad put like flanged

2137
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
in your bio

2138
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
if you're flanged

2139
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
if you're flanged all the

2140
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
fucking bitches

2141
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
want your dick and if you

2142
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
if you're unflanged you fucking form

2143
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
a fucking roving rape gang

2144
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
or you have to kill the flanged

2145
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
you gotta kill him so you can

2146
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
become the new flanged

2147
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I wonder if

2148
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that happens I wonder if

2149
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
because I know in like silverback

2150
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
in silverback tribes

2151
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
like the younger males

2152
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
will like challenge the silverback

2153
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
for like dominance

2154
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I wonder if that happens in orangutans

2155
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
is it weird that nature

2156
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
literally puts a target on the face of the

2157
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
alphas of orangutans

2158
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
like it just leads your fist

2159
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
leads your fist directly

2160
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
well that's why there's such chads

2161
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
because like they

2162
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
you know the only way to be the coolest

2163
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
is to be

2164
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
susceptible to like

2165
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
assassination

2166
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
that's like the power move

2167
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
his chad hitbox is twice as big

2168
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
flanged grow

2169
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
what the fuck

2170
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I'm trying to find

2171
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Ben you said you played so much noida

2172
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
you just couldn't stand anymore

2173
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
we're overdosing on learning right now

2174
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
to the point where I don't want to learn anymore

2175
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
no we could always learn more there's always more to learn

2176
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
okay I'm reading about

2177
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
their social life

2178
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
adult males are dominant over sub adult males

2179
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
yeah okay

2180
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
orangutans will form traveling groups

2181
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
between different food sources

2182
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
consort ships

2183
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
between an adult male and a female

2184
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
social grooming

2185
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
is uncommon among orangutans

2186
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
well that's good

2187
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
this knowledge makes the plan of the eight movies

2188
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
so much more scary

2189
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
they might just be like serial rapists

2190
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
but at least they don't groom

2191
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
each other

2192
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
you wouldn't find them on a discord

2193
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
okay it seems like

2194
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
maybe they don't

2195
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
really form like big

2196
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
tribes so maybe it's not

2197
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
like one

2198
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
flanged male

2199
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
like sort of dominates

2200
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
the gorillas have like the one silverback kind of like dominates everything

2201
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I think orangutans

2202
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
like more live on their own

2203
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
so maybe it's not so much that like the

2204
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
they start out in a jungle by them

2205
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
they build their house

2206
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and

2207
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
they kill creepers

2208
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
all man

2209
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
they go to the nether

2210
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and they play minecraft

2211
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
they play some minecraft and monkeys

2212
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
orangutans play minecraft

2213
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
orangutans disperse

2214
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and establish their home ranges by age 11

2215
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
females tend to settle close to their mothers

2216
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
while males disperse much farther

2217
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
but may include their natal birth range

2218
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
within their new home range

2219
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
they enter a transient phase

2220
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
which lasts until a male

2221
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
which lasts until a male can challenge

2222
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and displace a dominant resident male from his home range

2223
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
both resident and transient orangutans

2224
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
aggregate on large fruiting trees

2225
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
the fruit

2226
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
yeah okay

2227
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
so they have like individual little areas

2228
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and then a village where they all eat fruit

2229
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
they all kind of

2230
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
individual zones that are theirs

2231
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
but they all sort of like

2232
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
they all sort of consort with one another

2233
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
in like a wider range

2234
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
are you saying they all get on jungle twitter

2235
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and fight each other just like we do

2236
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
they all

2237
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
yeah which is way cooler

2238
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
as god intended

2239
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
exactly

2240
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I don't know so what do we think

2241
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
has this made us more or less inclined

2242
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
to return to monk

2243
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
it's a real mixed bag I think

2244
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
yeah it's

2245
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
their strengths and weaknesses

2246
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I like

2247
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
relatively low levels of testosterone

2248
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
interesting

2249
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I like that they just kind of like

2250
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
they hit

2251
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
they hit like adolescence

2252
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
and then they're like well I'm out

2253
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and they just go and like find a little like

2254
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
tree clearing and like this is my now

2255
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
but like they still kind of like

2256
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
hang out

2257
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
with like you know

2258
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
orangutans around and they have like neighbors

2259
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
and like oh hey

2260
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
can I borrow a cup of sugar

2261
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
it's the equivalent of having

2262
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
full diamond full enchanted

2263
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
diamond armor

2264
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
all this learning about

2265
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
orangutan society really makes that first

2266
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
gift with the heart wipe kind of insidious

2267
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
oh yeah that he's an

2268
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
unflanged

2269
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
god he's manipulating her

2270
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
yeah

2271
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
orangutans communicate with various sounds

2272
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
males will make long calls

2273
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
to attract okay by call they mean like

2274
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
an actual like they're yelling

2275
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
what else would they be

2276
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
get on like an hour long phone call

2277
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I don't know I thought maybe it was like a term

2278
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
for some part of their anatomy

2279
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
that like humans don't have

2280
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
like a waddle or so

2281
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I don't know maybe

2282
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
males will make long calls but they'll attract females

2283
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and to advertise themselves to other males

2284
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
what

2285
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
just to let them know like hey guys don't

2286
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
don't fuck around I'm here

2287
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
these are divided into three parts

2288
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
they begin with grumbles climax

2289
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
with pulses and end with bubbles

2290
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
what did you say

2291
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I said the call

2292
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
begins with grumbles

2293
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
climaxes with pulses

2294
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
and ends with bubbles

2295
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
both sexes will try to intimidate

2296
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
conspecifics

2297
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
cons intimidate

2298
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
conspecifics

2299
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
with a series of low guttural noises known collectively

2300
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
as the rolling call

2301
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
when annoyed an orangutan will suck in air

2302
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
through purse lips making a kissing sound

2303
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
known as the kiss squeak

2304
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
mothers reproduce

2305
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
mothers produce throat scrapes to keep in contact

2306
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
with their offspring

2307
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
what

2308
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
they

2309
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
my son you haven't

2310
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
you haven't answered my throat scrapes in months

2311
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
what are you doing

2312
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
are you eating well

2313
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
infants make soft hoots when distressed

2314
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
orangutans are also known to produce

2315
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
smacks or blow raspberries

2316
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
when making a nest

2317
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
okay

2318
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
so they just make a bunch of weird

2319
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
a bunch of weird

2320
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
sounds all the time

2321
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
they're fucking kissing noise

2322
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
they just sound like freaks

2323
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
that's gross

2324
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
they are freaks

2325
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
they're demons

2326
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
they're deem forest demons

2327
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
they don't want to return to monkey anymore

2328
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
so tom that's you basically that's you

2329
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
by the way

2330
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I've just become more and more subtly insulted

2331
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
by ben's comment from five years ago

2332
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I read this and I

2333
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
uninformed by all this information

2334
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I read this and I think Tommy Oliver

2335
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
yeah you know

2336
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
what can I say

2337
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
he's been known to

2338
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
produce smacks or blow raspberries

2339
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
when making a nest

2340
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
you know I mean

2341
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
yeah

2342
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
he caught me

2343
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
he's been known to begin with grumbles

2344
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
climax with pulses and end with bubbles

2345
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
hasn't everybody at least once

2346
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
just me

2347
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
it's relatable

2348
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
it's like

2349
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
orangutan relatable comics

2350
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
is like oh that feel when

2351
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
that feel when your mother

2352
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
is throat scraping at you

2353
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
oh god

2354
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm trying to

2355
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I'm trying to force copulation mom

2356
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'm not flanged yet already

2357
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
oh are you flanged yet honey

2358
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
no mom

2359
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I'm working on it

2360
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I'm finding a dominant male to challenge

2361
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
god

2362
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
this is fucked up

2363
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
this is too fucked up

2364
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
ehhh

2365
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
learning

2366
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
voicemails

2367
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
yeah save me

2368
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
ok

2369
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
wait voicemails might be even worse shit

2370
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
yeah it just so happens

2371
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
that all the voicemails are about orangutans

2372
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and there's a complete coincidence

2373
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
never ends

2374
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
do you have them open are we ready to go

2375
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
oh yeah yeah yeah

2376
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
you gotta look at it

2377
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
you gotta look at the voicemails

2378
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
there's more than one page

2379
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
yeah let's

2380
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
let's keep a brisk pace up on these

2381
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
please

2382
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
alright the first one

2383
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
is munchie crab rave

2384
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
are we seeing this

2385
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
are we seeing this

2386
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
ok 3 2 1

2387
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
go

2388
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I had just finished chucking a bang energy

2389
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
it was a new flavor

2390
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
power punch it tasted like the sweetest

2391
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
syrup you could imagine

2392
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I thought I'd take a look

2393
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
at munchie's channel

2394
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
we live some old memories

2395
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
we watch an episode of arm retrieval

2396
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
only to see

2397
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
it's all privatized

2398
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
lost to time

2399
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
like slime

2400
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
like permanent rain

2401
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
like pseudointellectual vlogs

2402
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
magenta filters on them

2403
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I'm not asking for an apology

2404
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I'm not asking for forgiveness

2405
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I just want an explanation

2406
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
that you're

2407
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
you're talking about munchie's channel

2408
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I don't know

2409
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
anything about that

2410
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
we're not in charge of it unfortunately

2411
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
in fact I didn't even know the whole channel was privatized

2412
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I didn't know that arm retrieval was

2413
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
privatized I didn't know that

2414
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I learned that

2415
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
but

2416
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Ethan's channel does have

2417
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
a cool

2418
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
thing from it

2419
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
you can find that

2420
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
munchie just didn't want

2421
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
his stuff online anymore

2422
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
that's as much of an explanation

2423
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
as we can give

2424
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
yeah that's

2425
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
pretty much all he said to any of us about it

2426
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
it is what it is

2427
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
yeah

2428
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I think munchie's experiencing what we all were

2429
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
happy we didn't

2430
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
because we were like seven years older

2431
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
of our entire teenage life being on the internet

2432
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
for everyone to see

2433
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
just hurts

2434
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
just hurts

2435
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I guess that's true

2436
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
yeah

2437
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I would probably not like to see

2438
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
some of the posts that I made

2439
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
on like accounts that I had

2440
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
when I was like

2441
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
16

2442
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
yeah

2443
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
oh well

2444
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
it's his content

2445
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
it's his content to do

2446
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
what he likes with at the end of the day

2447
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
yeah

2448
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
okay next one is called

2449
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
misbendering

2450
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
not a huge deal I just

2451
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
want to talk

2452
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
okay three two one

2453
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
go

2454
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
so I think Ben was kind of

2455
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
dismissive on the podcast last week

2456
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
when he was like

2457
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
he misgendered this person on

2458
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Twitter and they

2459
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
were like hey my pronouns are in my bio

2460
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I didn't read your bio because

2461
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
if you called them she

2462
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
that's because

2463
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
based on either the way they look or their actions

2464
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
or something you assume

2465
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
they were female I guess

2466
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and it's like a fucking

2467
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
it's a fucking meme to be like

2468
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
did you just assume my gender

2469
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
it's nothing but

2470
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
if you do assume someone's gender

2471
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
because of the way they look or the way they're acting

2472
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and they're like

2473
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
that's not correct

2474
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
you know that

2475
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
can be upsetting to people if

2476
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
they think

2477
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
they're being perceived as this other

2478
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
gender and demonstrably

2479
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
they were because of

2480
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
the way you referred to them and I don't know

2481
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
in cases like that I think

2482
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
you do have to have some kind of

2483
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
compassion for other people

2484
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I think you should probably

2485
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
apologize in situations like that

2486
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
to give a sincere apology I would have to

2487
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
feel remorse

2488
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
why would I feel remorse for a simple

2489
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
honest mistake

2490
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I wouldn't so

2491
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
there we go did I make a mistake yes

2492
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
do I feel bad about it no

2493
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
not really

2494
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
sure

2495
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
there was no malicious intent

2496
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
sure there was no malicious intent

2497
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
but like

2498
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I think the issue is the response

2499
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
when you make a mistake of

2500
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
something

2501
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
it's fine to have made the mistake

2502
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
so long as you say oh sorry

2503
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
just any indication that you

2504
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I acknowledge

2505
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
that I did make a mistake

2506
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I acknowledge that

2507
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I just think it's like

2508
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I don't know

2509
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
good polite

2510
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
to say it

2511
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I didn't want to be polite to this person

2512
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I know but like

2513
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
cringe though

2514
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
little cringe

2515
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I don't

2516
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
just don't think so

2517
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I think it's pretty

2518
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
value neutral you had one

2519
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
tweet worth of context for this

2520
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
person and based on that

2521
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
tweet which was completely gender neutral

2522
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
and the profile picture which seemed to be

2523
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
if I recall like it was pink it was pink

2524
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
it was like some character right it was

2525
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
some sort of it was pink and it was a

2526
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
pink character and also they

2527
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
had not not that this makes

2528
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
it any less of a mistake because it was

2529
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
but like they did the reason why I assumed

2530
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
is because they had a pink

2531
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
avatar and they had

2532
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
they had like the two female

2533
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
symbols like interlocking

2534
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
in their bio

2535
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
like the I guess it's the lesbian symbol

2536
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
or something two female things

2537
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
like linked so you know

2538
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
this is why I assumed it wasn't a

2539
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
it wasn't a Ronius assumption it's a fair

2540
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
assumption to make there was a

2541
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
mistake made I think

2542
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
people's problem with this interaction

2543
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
why we're still talking about it three weeks later

2544
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
is because your response seemed

2545
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
dismissive and not

2546
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
like

2547
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
actively

2548
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
apologizing

2549
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I think the thing is this person was not

2550
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
but the thing is that the person who was

2551
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
accusing you wasn't trying to be like

2552
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
oh by the way you're mistaken

2553
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
it was like you just

2554
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
basically

2555
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
did a hate crime feel bad about it

2556
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
and like when you're putting the back foot like that

2557
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
it's like fuck that

2558
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
it's not even that

2559
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
it's not even that it's that

2560
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I just

2561
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I think an apology

2562
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
an apology

2563
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
you give an apology when

2564
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
you feel bad about

2565
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
something you did and you want

2566
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I mean there's there's a there's a there's like

2567
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
a sincere reason

2568
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
and you can do it because you have

2569
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
realized that you were in the wrong

2570
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and you want to express

2571
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
that you have changed

2572
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
right or you can give an

2573
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
apology because you want to

2574
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
reconcile with someone

2575
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
and you want to let them know

2576
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
that you are sorry so that they will forgive you

2577
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and

2578
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
one I don't feel any remorse

2579
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
for making

2580
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
a simple honest error

2581
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I do I I don't feel bad about

2582
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
that and I hate

2583
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
this person and I don't care

2584
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
if they forgive me

2585
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
therefore what is the what would be

2586
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
the justification

2587
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
for making an apology I can't think of one

2588
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I can't

2589
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I can acknowledge the error

2590
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
which I did my response did acknowledge

2591
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
that I was in error I feel like that

2592
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
is all that is called for

2593
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I disagree but I can't

2594
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I don't know how I would frame my

2595
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I don't know how to say it

2596
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I think the problem is optics

2597
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
just I mean I don't I really don't

2598
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
care but just because we have the class

2599
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I really don't care either it's an optics issue

2600
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
because you already had people making assumptions

2601
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
negative assumptions about you during this

2602
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
discussion that you were like some crazy right

2603
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
ring person

2604
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
and by not like immediately

2605
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
capitulating to like

2606
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
the gender question to just reinforce those

2607
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
assumptions where if you would like

2608
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
actually made a response like oh I'm sorry

2609
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I didn't mean that like it probably would put everybody

2610
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
who had made these assumptions like

2611
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
challenge those assumptions and made them

2612
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
slightly reconsider even for a second

2613
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
day apologizing would have done

2614
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
wouldn't have done anything in the grand scheme of

2615
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
things but like in this micro

2616
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
exchange that for some reason were all

2617
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
really focused on

2618
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
it probably would have been a better move

2619
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
from optics perspective

2620
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
to be more

2621
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
transparently apologetic

2622
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
well I mean if if

2623
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
by that you mean that

2624
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I would not be receiving

2625
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
voicemails saying um you should have apologized

2626
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
then yeah apologizing

2627
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
would have prevented that one thing I

2628
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
would would say is like

2629
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
the

2630
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
disagreement you had with this person was based on

2631
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
the other thing you said not that you

2632
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
um

2633
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
you know misgendered them that was just an extra aside

2634
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
um I think

2635
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
it's

2636
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
to

2637
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
to you know stay true

2638
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
to you know yourself and say well

2639
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I don't feel remorse so why would I need to apologize

2640
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I don't want them to forgive me

2641
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
it's

2642
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
nah I can't

2643
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I can't think of the right way to say this

2644
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I'm gonna I'm going to like make

2645
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
the wrong point and then you're gonna get the

2646
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
right idea I need to like write it down

2647
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
but like it's very subtle

2648
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
God

2649
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'm stupid I hate being stupid I hate not being

2650
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
able to quick wittedly

2651
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
think of an entire argument

2652
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
out of nowhere

2653
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I feel I feel I feel pretty

2654
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
rock solid on this I feel like

2655
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
based on based on what an

2656
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
apology is and what function it serves

2657
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
one was not necessary in this

2658
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
situation

2659
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
by definition I have

2660
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I've laid it down

2661
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I'm lodged

2662
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
my logical brain

2663
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
has uh

2664
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
it's cracked the case

2665
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I'm so fucking angry

2666
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
with myself I can't figure out how to say this

2667
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
God

2668
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
alright next voicemail if I can

2669
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
say and then come back next week

2670
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
okay okay

2671
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
okay

2672
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
fine

2673
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
next one is I will never fucking forgive you

2674
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
well three

2675
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
three two one go

2676
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
you fucking fools you fucking cretins I hate you so much

2677
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I'm really behind the podcast but

2678
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
fucking I left the voicemail

2679
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
talking about mind sweeper saying oh mind sweeper

2680
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
online has no guessing mode where you won't have to

2681
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
guess and then the whole like rest

2682
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
of that episode and then the next episode

2683
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
talking about like oh mind sweeper you

2684
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
have to guess you're always going to

2685
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
come into scenarios where you pretty much just have to guess

2686
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
and no that's literally Ben is like oh

2687
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
oh mind sweeper is a game where you

2688
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
make educated guesses no if you think that's

2689
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
what mind sweeper is you just don't understand

2690
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
what it is the vast majority of the time you are

2691
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
very far back exactly where the bombs are

2692
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
it's very far by we very specific

2693
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
scenarios where it's just impossible

2694
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
to figure it out exactly and you can

2695
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
write an algorithm to prevent those scenarios

2696
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
from happening when you generate

2697
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
a map and that's what no guessing mode is

2698
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
oh my fucking okay I tell you these things

2699
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
because I care because I care about you

2700
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
and I care about mind sweeper

2701
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
and what do you do you dash my hopes

2702
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
you crush my heart you stab me

2703
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
in my fucking soul and you say no

2704
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
mind sweeper oh you just

2705
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
you don't heed my words you just

2706
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
go along playing mind sweeper

2707
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
in the dumb stupid infuriating

2708
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
way where you do have to guess because you

2709
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
don't you just don't listen why don't

2710
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
you listen what's the point of this guy

2711
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000

and watch that but also

2728
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
the no guessing mode I've tried it

2729
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
um I don't like it

2730
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
there's something annoying about

2731
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
the first one like I haven't tried it

2732
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
you go to no guessing mode you click

2733
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
is like an X this is the first

2734
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
thing you click and you actually

2735
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
cannot click anything else you have to click

2736
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
this space so often it opens up

2737
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
like a three by three

2738
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
space and from there it's like

2739
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
oh god I don't know how to figure

2740
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
myself out of this one

2741
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
it's so it's so small I like

2742
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
the freedom of being able to click randomly

2743
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
and get lucky to get like a bigger

2744
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
start or to go to all four corners

2745
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
so that when I get to those places

2746
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
you know the likelihood

2747
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
that I have to guess

2748
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
at the very end is minimal

2749
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I can do

2750
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
expert mind sweeper now quite easily

2751
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
and it's fun

2752
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
and

2753
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
you don't mind the

2754
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
the fact that sometimes you have to guess

2755
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
the no guessing mode is just worse an experience

2756
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
because even though you don't have to guess

2757
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
uh it's less

2758
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I don't know it's less fast paced

2759
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I have to start really slow all the time

2760
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I like going to the corners first

2761
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
it's just good it's just easy

2762
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
uh based

2763
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
uh based though

2764
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000

2765
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000

2766
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000

in Argentina

2773
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I set the league

2774
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000

2775
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000

and made a nine

2777
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
this isn't

2778
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
the first time I tried

2779
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000

2785
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
imagine getting rejected from the league of name fuckers

2786
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000

2787
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
the seediest

2788
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000

01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
low lowest gaggle of

2800
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000

2801
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
and I just hope that you all can become people

2802
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000

2803
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000

forgot to do

2841
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
something very important last week

2842
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I know what it is

2843
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
which was to remind ben to please catch up on one piece

2844
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
ben this is your weekly reminder to catch up on one piece

2845
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
thank you bye

2846
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
it's so hard though

2847
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
reading is just so hard

2848
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
but you've kicked your noida addiction

2849
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
now you have time

2850
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
should you spend 30 hours straight

2851
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
catching up on one piece this week

2852
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
instead of 30 hours playing a noida run

2853
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I'm on a kick though

2854
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I'm on a really good kick of getting worked on

2855
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
on my secret project

2856
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I'm gonna try and stick that out

2857
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I'm gonna try and ride that

2858
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
ben you are a pro-crastinator

2859
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
you cannot be working right now

2860
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Drew I have

2861
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
defied my nature

2862
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I have temporarily put it aside

2863
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I think

2864
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
it's gonna be

2865
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
one piece though

2866
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I'll get around

2867
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
to it

2868
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
imagine the feeling of slaying this person

2869
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
for actually

2870
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
not giving him the ability to continue sending

2871
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
these voicemails

2872
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
he just wants

2873
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
for me

2874
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
next voicemail is called

2875
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000

2879
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000

2880
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Samurai-sama

2881

01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
in the right

2883
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
of this

2884
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Samurai-sama want to make

2885
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
something clear

2886
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Samurai-sama

2887
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000

2888
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000

samurai sensei

2899
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000

2900
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
but different

2901
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
did we make that mistake

2902
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
did we

2903
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I don't remember

2904
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I don't think so

2905
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I know that Kasady is a she

2906
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
and Samurai is a he

2907
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
because Samurai is a character

2908
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
by which I mean he's a real person

2909
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
who dogs me

2910
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
in real life

2911
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I guess I might have made

2912
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I might have made that mistake

2913
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
because when I think about it

2914
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I'm not sure how to

2915
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
with the

2916
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
using pronouns to refer to a character

2917
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
played by a trans person

2918
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
who is the other gender of the character

2919
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
there are no pronouns

2920
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
there are no pronouns or just

2921
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
what even is a pronoun really

2922
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
when you get right down to it

2923
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
what really is a pronoun really

2924
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
when you get down to it

2925
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
what even is

2926
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
a

2927
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
pronoun crastinators

2928
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
the pronoun crastinators

2929
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
there it is we did it

2930
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
we got there

2931
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
the pronoun

2932
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
okay whatever next voicemail

2933
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
is called radcon4

2934
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
over one year later

2935
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
three two one go

2936
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
there was some confusion on this

2937
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Ben and co the day that

2938
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
we recorded that thing about

2939
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
radcon4 was the

2940
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
anniversary of it

2941
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
yeah we're over a year lads

2942
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I knew that

2943
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
that was the whole point I thought

2944
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
or I knew

2945
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
it was around I didn't know

2946
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
whether it was the exact one year anniversary

2947
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
but yeah this is the

2948
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
the pronoun

2949
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
cast

2950
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
yes the pronoun cast

2951
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
about radcon

2952
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
that's what they're talking about

2953
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
next one is called victimless crime

2954
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
in quotes three

2955
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
two one go

2956
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
this is a message to

2957
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
younger or more impressionable listeners

2958
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
of the podcast who don't know better

2959
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
and this is coming on the show before but

2960
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
don't shoplift

2961
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
don't fucking do it it's a joke

2962
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
don't shoplift

2963
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
if you do it you're gonna get caught

2964
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
and you're gonna get fucked really bad

2965
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
if you do get caught

2966
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
it's gonna happen the people in this podcast

2967
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
are fools

2968
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
they're naive idiots they don't know what they're talking about

2969
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
it's a joke don't actually

2970
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
shoplift don't be stupid

2971
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
alright

2972
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I mean definitely don't

2973
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
getting caught would be really bad

2974
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
so definitely don't get caught

2975
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
if you get caught shoplifting

2976
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
you have done it wrong

2977
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
and you have done it you have fucked up

2978
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I don't condone getting caught

2979
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
shoplifting

2980
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
yeah I mean I would never do it

2981
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
because I am scared of consequences

2982
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
and I would assume

2983
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
it would fail

2984
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
like it's not a thing

2985
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I would have pulled victimless crime

2986
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I think

2987
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
the implication here is that the victim

2988
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
is the person who will get caught

2989
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and get in trouble which is true

2990
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
that is probably the main victim

2991
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
of shoplifting

2992
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
the real crime is getting close

2993
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
yeah

2994
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
the real crime is punishing someone

2995
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
for stealing from a faceless corporation

2996
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I would feel super bad

2997
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
if I was like shoplifting is morally

2998
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
neutral

2999
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
well I will do it then

3000
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
and then they did it

3001
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
and then they got caught and there were

3002
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
terrible legal consequences for them

3003
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
that would just be awful and terrible

3004
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
and not worth it at all

3005
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I would say that podcast told me

3006
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
to do it and their mom gets all pissed

3007
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I knew podcasts were the work

3008
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
of the devil

3009
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I don't know how young

3010
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
and impressionable our audience is

3011
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I feel like most of them

3012
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
are like

3013
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
super young

3014
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
they wouldn't all be late teens and up

3015
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
obviously

3016
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
don't shoplift

3017
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
if it's

3018
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
difficult

3019
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
just

3020
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I think what we've said in the past is

3021
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
what we've said in the past is that

3022
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
shoplifting from a large corporation

3023
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
is not a morally wrong thing

3024
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
to do it's just a shame

3025
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
that you can get caught for it and that sucks

3026
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I wouldn't condone it

3027
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
myself I know Ben might

3028
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
because Ben's like more into it

3029
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
than I am

3030
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I would say that it's morally neutral

3031
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
it's neither good nor bad

3032
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
well yeah

3033
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I would just

3034
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I've never been caught

3035
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
shoplifting so

3036
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I don't even know

3037
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
what would happen

3038
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
it probably depends a lot

3039
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
on who catches you

3040
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
and what store you're at

3041
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
and whatever

3042
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
so I don't even know what the consequence

3043
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
would be

3044
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I feel like in certain stores shoplifting would be so much easier

3045
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
now because everybody has to wear masks

3046
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
so they can't identify you and a lot of stores can't chase

3047
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
after you so what are they going to do

3048
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
some kind of mask came and stole our shit

3049
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
most stores can't chase after you

3050
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
the only one who can

3051
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
arrest you for it is if there's

3052
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
a plainclothes police officer on the scene

3053
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
the store cannot

3054
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
apprehend you

3055
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
and hold you against your will

3056
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
or like tackle you or like that's completely illegal

3057
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
they basically have

3058
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
the store itself has like

3059
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
no I don't know they might hire

3060
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
someone who is like a

3061
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I think there are certain credentials

3062
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
some people can have that do like allow

3063
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
them to do that on behalf of like law enforcement

3064
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
but like

3065
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
a store employee can't a normal store employee can't

3066
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
like

3067
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
seize you and stop you from leaving the grounds

3068
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
and like punish you or whatever

3069
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
they simply don't have the authority

3070
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
so I would say if you do get caught

3071
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
shopping probably the thing to do

3072
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
is try and lie your way out of it

3073
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
and if it doesn't work just run

3074
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
and like

3075
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
almost in most cases

3076
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
they will simply have no recourse

3077
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
again I have never had to do that

3078
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
so I don't really know and I guess I'm talking

3079
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
out my ass

3080
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
getting in trouble with the law is scary

3081
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
because it's the law

3082
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
so for that reason I wouldn't

3083
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
suggest trying it

3084
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
yeah

3085
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
yeah

3086
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
the potential consequences are usually not

3087
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
worth a couple of dollars you might save

3088
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
on something getting a rap sheet in the first place

3089
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
getting a criminal record is super bad

3090
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
and definitely not worth anything

3091
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
you can shoplift

3092
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I think if you're the sort of person

3093
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
who is able to listen to the procrastinators

3094
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
podcast

3095
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
then you're probably not

3096
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
in a position where you need

3097
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
to shoplift

3098
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
really probably okay

3099
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
what do you mean by that

3100
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
well you have access to the internet

3101
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
you have

3102
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
time to listen to such a stupid

3103
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
podcast

3104
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
this is like you're doing

3105
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
the same bit that that streamer

3106
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
did that girl who said like

3107
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
if you have time to watch my stream

3108
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
you have time

3109
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
to donate to me to donate 5 bucks

3110
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
to subscribe

3111
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
instead of that I'm saying you probably don't need to

3112
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
risk a criminal record

3113
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I'm not saying donate to the podcast

3114
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I think it's a better message

3115
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I'm saying that

3116
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I would say

3117
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I would suggest

3118
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
that anyone listening go out

3119
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
and shoplift right now and then donate

3120
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
whatever they saved

3121
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
to the patreon

3122
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
is my

3123
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I don't know

3124
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I mean

3125
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I'm sure there are people

3126
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
listening right now who are in economic

3127
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
distress

3128
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm listening and I'm in economic distress

3129
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
that'll be true

3130
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
for a lot of people

3131
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
but I mean those people still

3132
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
it would be probably

3133
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
it wouldn't help

3134
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
them to get fucking arrested

3135
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
like the amount of

3136
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
money saved

3137
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
sometimes proportional to the

3138
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
largeness of the thing you're stealing

3139
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
like if you try and steal a fridge

3140
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
that's gonna be a little difficult

3141
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
if you try and get the steal like a candy bar

3142
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
you can probably put it in your pocket

3143
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
steal small

3144
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
things that have a high price

3145
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
per ounce

3146
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
like fucking diamond jewelry

3147
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
yes for example

3148
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
things like cheese

3149
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
things like cheese are like

3150
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
pretty high

3151
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
in a grocery store

3152
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I would say cheese is small

3153
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
high in calories and relatively high

3154
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
costs per weight so it makes a good thing

3155
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
that you can just slip into your pocket

3156
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
and pretend you didn't realize you had

3157
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
or something like

3158
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
like steve

3159
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
or something like

3160
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
vanilla extract

3161
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
or a tiny little bottle of vanilla extract

3162
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
might cost like 12 bucks

3163
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
but you just pop it in my pocket

3164
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
and it's like well I just won't pay that

3165
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
for instance I mean I'm just

3166
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
thinking off the top of my cup here

3167
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
not like I would know or anything

3168
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
not like I thought about it

3169
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
all these examples sound like things that you would

3170
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
probably eat on the daily

3171
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
they're so specific

3172
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
they're so stevia's keto

3173
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
no it's not

3174
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
cheese and stevia both keto how interesting

3175
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
hmm

3176
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
like I said I haven't been going to stores

3177
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I just order my groceries now

3178
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
but if I did I don't know

3179
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
probably wouldn't be worth the risk at this point

3180
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
um yeah don't do it

3181
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I guess that's my

3182
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
probably don't do it

3183
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
probably don't do it but if you do

3184
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I won't think you're a bad person

3185
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
but it's probably not worth it most of the time

3186
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
okay there we go

3187
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
next voicemail

3188
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
is bring back tectonic improvements

3189
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
and gamers tavern

3190
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
three two one

3191
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
go

3192
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
hi I'm calling to say

3193
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
that you should bring back tectonic

3194
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
improv and gamers tavern

3195
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
okay and as you well know

3196
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
that one concerned

3197
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
caller is equal to one

3198
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
billion listeners easily

3199
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
which means you should really

3200
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
take this advice

3201
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
very very seriously

3202
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
okay again

3203
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
gamers tavern and tectonic

3204
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
improv

3205
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
okay one done an episode

3206
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000

um

3208
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I know tectonic was with cheesy that one time

3209
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
no I don't

3210
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I think tectonic was on

3211
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
twice

3212
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
the one tectonic was on

3213
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
first

3214
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
gamers tavern might have also been on that one

3215
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I don't know

3216
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
yeah I remember but yeah

3217
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
those guys are cool

3218
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
we could have one of them back

3219
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
recently I haven't had

3220
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
guests in a while

3221
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
shocking realization

3222
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
three two one go

3223
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000

3224
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
are gay

3225
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
like they just sound really gay

3226
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
no

3227
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I don't know it could just be me but like

3228
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I just get like gay vibes from them

3229
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
that sounds

3230
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
very silly

3231
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
that's ridiculous listen to yourself you sound

01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000

02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
they're all female

3235
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
right

3236
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
gay

3237
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
what a concept

3238
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000

you should totally check out the game ever hood

3242
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
it's like psychedelic undertale with

3243
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
guitar hero bullet hell battles that's

3244
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000

is another thing okay what's the dug

3249
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000

well done ever heard never yeah

3251
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
this looks like a rhythm

3252
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
game it's good I see the under

3253
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I see the undertale reference

3254
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
reference

3255
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
is this a video game reference

3256
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
oh it is

3257
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
looks kind of neat this looks kind of cool

3258
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I've heard the fuck about it as well

3259
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
wait I'm gonna do like a

3260
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
something I'm gonna do a thumbnail

3261
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
show me a

3262
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
yeah this is flowery see

3263
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
that's flowery that's flowery right there

3264
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
honestly yeah this is a little

3265
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
to undertale actually

3266
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
it's unapologetically undertale

3267
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
this is it almost

3268
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
seems like the amount

3269
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
to which this is referencing

3270
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
undertale is like part of the joke

3271
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
or something

3272
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I just think it's a marketing strategy

3273
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I think it's a marketing strategy maybe

3274
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I mean people are talking about it so it

3275
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
clearly worked it's like undertale

3276
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
with guitar hero with guns

3277
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
it's like even the font for the game

3278
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
it's like hey it's the undertale font

3279
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
basically but we just it looks exactly like

3280
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
undertale of yeah

3281
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
which is fine they even have I guess undertale

3282
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
is like a they do have someone looks just

3283
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
like Gino the art for this guy

3284
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
is Gino it's that's Gino

3285
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
it's ridiculous our boy

3286
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
okay pretty good

3287
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
all right

3288
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
is undertale like

3289
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
has it become sort of a

3290
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
sort of genre like a pseudo

3291
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
genre no undertale likes

3292
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
are those a thing

3293
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I was that's what I'm thinking are they I mean

3294
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
they are this one clearly

3295
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I feel like in a way

3296
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
yes but then it's more that the

3297
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
undertale and like Lisa

3298
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
and earthbound are all part of the same

3299
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
earthbound are

3300
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
G genre earthbound like

3301
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
would be

3302
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
weirdo weirdo RPG

3303
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
yeah I it's probably

3304
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
that like that genre

3305
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
of weirdo RPG

3306
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
is the is the group

3307
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
but then like undertale is such a like

3308
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
influential

3309
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
piece of it that it has

3310
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
like it's its own influence

3311
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I say that it's had a lot

3312
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
of influence on other like

3313
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
subsequent games in the

3314
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
name I got a name so for

3315
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
earthbound likes that are undertale

3316
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
adjacent we call them

3317
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
other tale

3318
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
mmm that's good

3319
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I dig it that's that's cute

3320
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
that's cute

3321
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
this game looks kind of this game looks

3322
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
kind of neat though would you sacrifice

3323
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
your humanity to receive

3324
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
immortality yes

3325
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
everhood trailer yes of course I would

3326
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
in a heartbeat answer

3327
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
100% defy humanity

3328
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
you I mean part of you part of

3329
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
being human is to be mortal so like you

3330
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
just necessarily give up

3331
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
now that see the thing they

3332
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
they say they don't tell you is that the

3333
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
part of humanity they take is

3334
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
your IQ

3335
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
they take all of your IQ

3336
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
oh no

3337
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
no I'll just

3338
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
become flanchless orangutans living

3339
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
forever cursed to wander looking for

3340
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
they take your flanges away but you can live

3341
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
forever

3342
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
who would want to live without flanges

3343
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
this is

3344
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
this is the plot of my new other tale

3345
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
game that's coming out that I'm working

3346
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
on is it's going to be like

3347
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
you start you're a humble

3348
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
little rice farmer

3349
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
until one day

3350
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
a fucking a fucking goblin

3351
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
goblin shows up

3352
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
a goblin appears

3353
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
and he steals all your equals

3354
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
your rice he's skilled no he steals

3355
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
all your IQ points and he scatters

3356
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
all 100 of your IQ

3357
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
points to the far corners of the

3358
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
earth and you have to go get

3359
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
them

3360
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
how do you even get the first one

3361
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
here that's the toughest

3362
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
one that's the toughest one

3363
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
you gotta that would be a funny idea

3364
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
the game gets easier as you go instead of harder

3365
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
yeah the first thing is the most difficult

3366
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
part of the game the final boss

3367
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
is like learning how to walk again

3368
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
like the

3369
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
the first one is maybe like

3370
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
you just like gotta like mash

3371
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
one button

3372
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
just pound a button like a thousand times

3373
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
and that's the only thing you can do and eventually

3374
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
the game's 50 hours long but the first

3375
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
point back and now you can move

3376
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
jabbing one button over and over again to get your first IQ

3377
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
point that's like right in front of you

3378
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
then there's just two hours of the rest

3379
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
of the game

3380
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
that mischievous goblin though

3381
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
the IQ goblin he's just like

3382
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
haha I've got the points

3383
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I will send them away

3384
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
he's very

3385
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
sinister

3386
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
next voicemail is called

3387
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
the entire thing

3388
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
three two one go

3389
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I've had was the

3390
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
voicemail kind of wish

3391
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
the pcp

3392
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
fellas would do a super best

3393
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
friends and just make a video

3394
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
telling everyone they

3395
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
don't enjoy slash

3396
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
they can't work with each other

3397
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
anymore instead of trying

3398
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
to drag this podcast

3399
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
along off

3400
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
legacy alone watch

3401
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
as I ingest this entire

3402
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
cock

3403
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
hey yeah

3404
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
hey yeah

3405
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
was that a cookie I sounded like a comment

3406
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
that may have been posted I haven't

3407
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
read yet it might be

3408
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
it sounds it sounds like

3409
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
sort of an amalgam of all

3410
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
the of all the sorts of

3411
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
comments that say like

3412
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I used to I used to

3413
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
like the podcast more the podcast

3414
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
should just die

3415
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
or whatever I think the

3416
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
obvious thing missing from this analysis

3417
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
is that we still

3418
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
can work together just fine

3419
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
we're still here the podcast

3420
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
you're listening to we're here doing it

3421
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
we're doing it right now we're making

3422
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
it happen we're proving all the haters wrong

3423
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
does anybody has anybody have

3424
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
any dissolutions at this point that Nate and

3425
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Trixie and munchie don't

3426
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
like being on the podcast

3427
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
is that still unclear

3428
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
what I feel like

3429
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
a year of doing this should make it pretty obvious

3430
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
what is the pcp

3431
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
if not a podcast

3432
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
persevering after all

3433
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
the person ever less

3434
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
podcast

3435
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
nevertheless we persisted

3436
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
mmm

3437
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
uh this guy

3438
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
this guy is a fucking bitch

3439
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and I hope he enjoys that cock

3440
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
okay

3441
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
same

3442
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
yeah next one

3443
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
is called bringing it back

3444
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
three two one go

3445
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
at work today a man

3446
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
tried to circumcise himself

3447
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
he didn't finish the job

3448
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
it's really alarming

3449
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
agreed

3450
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
that sucks

3451
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
well

3452
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
why would you do it to yourself

3453
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
get a professional

3454
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
well you can um

3455
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
you might uh it might be

3456
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
you know you can always

3457
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
it's good though

3458
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
it's good to go to your genitals with a knife

3459
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I mean what's the harm

3460
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
because I mean at least

3461
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
at least it hurts

3462
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
he didn't do enough circumcision

3463
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
right but that's okay because you can always circumcise

3464
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
more

3465
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
the real danger is doing too much circumcision

3466
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
because you can't

3467
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
reduce the amount to which

3468
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
you were circumcised later

3469
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
so I would I would advise that if you

3470
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
want to be circumcised

3471
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
do it in little pieces

3472
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
just do it like cut like just slice off

3473
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
a piece of your foreskin

3474
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
and then come back with a knife

3475
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
and chop up the next like the next millimeter

3476
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
of it and then just

3477
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
every time the last one heals

3478
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
why would it make a sound

3479
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
that's the sound of the butcher knife

3480
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
hitting the hitting the

3481
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
what you call it the chopping block

3482
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
the cutting board

3483
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
chopping cock

3484
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
chopping cock you might say

3485
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
um little baby steps

3486
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
baby steps

3487
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
baby 12 steps to the perfect

3488
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
circumcised cock

3489
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000

I guess like I guess like I didn't know there was a discord

3503
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I guess I could join the I haven't listened to it

3505
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
uh

3506
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000

be a guest on there maybe I don't know

3508
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
they had

3509
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
one they had

3510
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
they had a guest

3511
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
or a pair of guests

3512
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
that were really annoying most of the time

3513
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
they're fine but there was one episode

3514
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
animorphine time that had two guests

3515
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
who I just couldn't stand

3516
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
they were it was a married couple

3517
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
and

3518
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
the wife

3519
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
just kept shrieking

3520
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
every time her husband

3521
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
said anything the husband was very much

3522
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
like very dry since if humor

3523
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
deadpan delivery and every time

3524
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
he said anything like

3525
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I wouldn't say darker edgy

3526
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
but he would he would be like sarcastic right

3527
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
every time he said anything sarcastic

3528
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
the wife would just start shrieking

3529
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I hated her

3530
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I hated them so much

3531
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
so my goal would be to be better

3532
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
than them

3533
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I feel like you'd be like hey can I talk about

3534
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
animorphine you guys on a podcast

3535
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
we did this whole big video about it

3536
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
there was some sexism

3537
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
and edgy jokes in that video

3538
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
sorry you're cancelled

3539
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
they would um

3540
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
you know I saw

3541
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I was randomly recommended a video

3542
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
from a youtube channel

3543
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
that was talking about animorphs

3544
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
and he sort of offhandedly

3545
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
mentioned your lecture and put up like a thumbnail

3546
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
it wasn't a huge channel

3547
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
or anything it was um

3548
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I think it was recommended

3549
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
to me after watching a James Tullos

3550
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
video someone else was just

3551
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
talking about

3552
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
someone else did like an animorph some

3553
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000

I thought he was talking about something else but uh

3586
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000

3587
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000

3593
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
the race shooter

3594
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
or a serial killer

3595
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000

3596
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
like he he's like the

3597
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
the platonic model

3598
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
to aspire to he's he laid out the

3599
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
blueprint for the rest of us

3600
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
the rest of us need only

3601
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
need only perfect his

3602
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
formula

3603
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
based

3604
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
next voicemail is called

3605
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I Have Solved Mario's

3606
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Picross 3 2 1

3607
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
go

3608
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I have developed a full proof method

3609
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
to beat Picross all you need to do

3610
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
is get Mario's

3611
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Picross on emulator or with the

3612
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
switch SNES collection

3613
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
and then before

3614
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
you pick a square you just

3615
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
make a save state then you click

3616
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
the square and if you blow up

3617
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
we'll then just load your save state

3618
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
and pick another square and just keep doing that until you win

3619
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
and that's how you

3620
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
solve Picross forever

3621
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I'm a genius

3622
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
that's so much smarter than you Gib

3623
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
uh

3624
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I can't believe I've been

3625
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
bested so easily

3626
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
you're all like oh well you can

3627
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
logically deduce that to this square

3628
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
and this square no

3629
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
detective shit

3630
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000

3631
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I'm here doing detective work and that guy's

3645
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
it was an audio show

3646
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
most dicks probably

3647
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
could

3648
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
just geometrically speaking

3649
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
next one is called Hi Ben

3650
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
3 2 1 go

3651
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I

3652
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
am going

3653
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
to fuck

3654
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
the best guy

3655
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
ever because

3656
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
his butthole

3657
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
is supple

3658
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
just like his brother

3659
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
wait

3660
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
oh the fucking modulator

3661
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
okay

3662
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
next one is called Hi Ben 2

3663
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
let's try this again

3664
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
3 2 1 go

3665
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
that was way better

3666
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
the modulation just added so much

3667
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
sound quality

3668
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
and the dog squeaking as well

3669
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
the squealing

3670
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
the squealing mammal

3671
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
don't incentivize those kinds of things

3672
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
did you hear that shit Tom

3673
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
oh oh yes

3674
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
oh yes

3675
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
the next one is called The End

3676
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
and its own reward

3677
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
and okay the email attached is called

3678
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
an end to cluster punk at

3679
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
sad.time so

3680
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I'm prepared to cry

3681
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
3 2 1 go

3682
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
could enjoying the process

3683
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
be its own reward

3684
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I think yes

3685
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
yes

3686
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
yes

3687
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I think

3688
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I think this is

3689
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
the end

3690
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
of the bear

3691
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
suck

3692
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
if you want to call it that

3693
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
how far we've come

3694
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
to an end

3695
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
in so short a time

3696
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
in fact the only things that are good

3697
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
are things that stop immediately

3698
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
and they never come back

3699
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I wonder what he's going to do next

3700
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
just like

3701
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
my wand

3702
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
just like my teleport wand in Noida

3703
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
that shot the really short teleport bolts really fast

3704
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
that made me go

3705
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
you get an end really fast

3706
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
and that makes it good

3707
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
next voicemail is called

3708
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
bacon bacon surprise

3709
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
3 2 1 go

3710
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
why

3711
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
he's 10 feet wide

3712
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and armed to the teeth

3713
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
cut this big bacon

3714
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
bastard

3715
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
best to the bear and me

3716
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
okay I was wrong

3717
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
it's not over

3718
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
it's just totally wrong

3719
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
that was only the beginning

3720
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
so the bacon man

3721
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
is that what

3722
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
it's a bacon man

3723
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
is it like a redditor is that what they mean

3724
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I think the bear

3725
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
has the edge

3726
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
being a carnivore

3727
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
wait bears eat meat right

3728
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I mean I know they eat honey

3729
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
they eat fish out of the river

3730
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
and they'll kill humans

3731
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
sometimes

3732
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
bears eat anything they don't fuck around

3733
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
okay

3734
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
even spaghetti

3735
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
even spaghetti but not macaroni

3736
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
cause they've never heard of such a thing

3737
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I know that feel

3738
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
next voicemail is called

3739
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
the monopoly man

3740
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
who remember promised

3741
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
was it 2,000 doge coin

3742
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
to whoever made the best

3743
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
league of nate fuckers video

3744
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
so let's see what he has to say for himself

3745
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
3 2 1 go

3746
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000

3747
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000

3748
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
fuck are you

3749
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
money

3750
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I'm here to tell everyone

3751
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
that whoever becomes president

3752
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
will not only get 2,000 doge coin

3753
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
but also the rights to nate's body

3754
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
the league will entrust him

3755
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
with his health

3756
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
and thirst

3757
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
ho ho ho

3758
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
this was the monopoly man

3759
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
good luck everybody

3760
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
such a long pause

3761
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I thought it was over

3762
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
it's like he had to check his script

3763
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
to see that

3764
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
he had to turn the page

3765
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
ho ho ho

3766
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
well I guess the stakes

3767
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
have been raised

3768
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
next voicemail

3769
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000

what is this

3788
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
I know

3789
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I've heard of it

3790
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I think it's a manga

3791
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
it's a japanese dojin

3792
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
soft visual novel series

3793
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
okay

3794
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
it's what the

3795
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
it's what Beatrice is from

3796
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
it's what that name is from

3797
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
but where's the game oh wait it's a

3798
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
yeah yeah visual novel video game I think

3799
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I like that being on a we

3800
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
microphone that was good

3801
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
yeah I

3802
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
think this caller might be

3803
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
disappointed because I don't know

3804
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
anything about it

3805
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
lol

3806
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
uh guys

3807
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I thought there's

3808
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
why did everyone shut up

3809
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
yeah I thought there was a problem with the call

3810
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I was like everyone's one saying anything

3811
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
what the fuck okay well I guess

3812
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
next I guess next voicemail

3813
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I thought that awkward's pause out

3814
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
no no no no

3815
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
there was another one too there was another

3816
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
long awkward pause before

3817
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
keep it all in

3818
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
it's all part of the experience

3819
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
you know who cuts their awkward pauses out

3820
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
the pizza party podcast they do

3821
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
we can't stoop to that level

3822
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
it's dishonest frankly it's despicable

3823
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
say in the comments if you

3824
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
watch only for the awkward pauses

3825
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I need

3826
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
my I appreciate naturalism

3827
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
naturalism in my podcasts

3828
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I need to feel

3829
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
the pain

3830
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
the pain that the podcasters

3831
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
are experiencing

3832
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
uh the next voicemail

3833
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000

3838
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I must have Nate's come

3839
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
so I may enter the most

3840
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
true ketosis

3841
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
with Nate's come

3842
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I can make the best

3843
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
keto gummies

3844
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
all out of commies

3845
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
but there's still

3846
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
one problem

3847
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I don't have Nate's come yet

3848
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
to get it

3849
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I'll have to join the league

3850
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
of Nate fuckers

3851
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
they're

3852
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
they're still working on

3853
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
getting it

3854
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I think the bureaucracy

3855
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
the administration of the league

3856
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
is too much red tape

3857
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
they can't get anything done

3858
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
they all have

3859
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
different ideas

3860
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
of how best to fuck Nate

3861
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
they can't vote on anything

3862
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
if they all came at the same time

3863
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
but if they all came to Nate

3864
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
at the same time Nate doesn't have that many holes

3865
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
it's not even gonna work

3866
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
it would be

3867
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
all the dicks

3868
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
they would just clog

3869
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
they would just bump against each other

3870
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
it would be like

3871
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
the thing with mr burns

3872
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
and the diseases

3873
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
and the germs too many germs

3874
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
that they can't get all squeezed through the door

3875
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
so there's so many

3876
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Nate fuckers that Nate is completely

3877
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
protected

3878
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
complete virgin

3879
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
they just can't fuck

3880
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
they can't fuck

3881
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
I wonder if Michelle is in the league

3882
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
who do you think started it

3883
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I don't know

3884
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
the league seems to want to cuck Michelle

3885
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
but I mean they could

3886
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
she's like the shadow

3887
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
there's like a hooded figure

3888
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Michelle's part of the Nate Chastity brigade

3889
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
there's a hooded

3890
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
maybe there's a hooded figure

3891
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
who appears only in hologram form

3892
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
who leads the league of Nate fuckers

3893
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
secretly Michelle under the hood

3894
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
I don't know

3895
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
we'll never know

3896
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
this really is a tales gets trolled

3897
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
so I gotta go now

3898
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
so many faces

3899
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
do you ever wonder what it's like for that one person

3900
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
every week who's not subscribed

3901
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
who just stumbles upon an episode

3902
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
and gets to this portion

3903
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
what the fuck is wrong with these people

3904
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I have

3905
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
nothing but disdain

3906
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
for anyone who isn't subscribed already

3907
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
every episode is someone's first episode

3908
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I seek to pun it

3909
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I don't know if that's true

3910
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I'm not sure if

3911
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
maybe

3912
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
no

3913
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
no no every episode is someone's last episode

3914
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
that's what that's the actual

3915
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
that's definitely true

3916
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
the turnover rate

3917
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
is just astronomical

3918
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
next voicemail is called

3919
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Phrygian Meetup

3920
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
3 2 1

3921
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
3 2 1

3922
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
go

3923
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
so when are we getting the files from the meetup

3924
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
it's been a year

3925
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
maybe you could just dump them somewhere

3926
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I don't know

3927
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
on that subject though

3928
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
being some of the guys from the meetup are getting back together

3929
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
and having our own radcon next week

3930
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
so PCP fans

3931
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
we'll have some new lectures for you soon

3932
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
20 bucks says I get mine out before Ben

3933
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
if you do it next week

3934
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
yeah you probably will get it out before me

3935
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
if you're fast

3936
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I mean good luck

3937
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
and godspeed and

3938
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I am praying for you

3939
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
yes

3940
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
cool

3941
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
people do lectures

3942
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
people doing their own lectures is cool

3943
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I like it

3944
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
we should find

3945
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
the meetup footage

3946
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I need to talk to Victor somehow

3947
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Trixie has it right

3948
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
she was the one who was collecting all the footage

3949
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
at the end of the day

3950
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I guess she must have it

3951
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I don't know

3952
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
what a fucking nightmare

3953
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
we're gonna have to

3954
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
bang on the door again

3955
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
we've been banging on the door

3956
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
we've been banging on the door

3957
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
she just doesn't give a fuck

3958
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
she just doesn't give a fuck

3959
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
we're gonna have to reach out to Nate

3960
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
and or Victor and just be like

3961
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
look

3962
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
you guys both have a head on your shoulders

3963
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
you guys have a sense of responsibility

3964
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
please help

3965
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I'm not even sure what it is

3966
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
that she's got

3967
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
well just to find out

3968
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
you mean the film from the meetup

3969
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
the meetup behind the scene

3970
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
thrust the behind the scene stuff

3971
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
okay

3972
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
yeah

3973
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
because at the end of every day

3974
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
because she brought

3975
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
her desktop to the house

3976
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
and we would just dump all the footage

3977
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
that we had onto there

3978
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
because she was supposed to be putting the behind the scenes up every day

3979
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
big mistake

3980
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
that was the plan

3981
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
things did not go according to plan

3982
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
nightmare nightmare nightmare

3983
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
um

3984
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
okay well

3985
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
we'll try to do something about that

3986
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
maybe

3987
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
do our best

3988
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
next one is called

3989
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
mind sweeper gone rogue

3990
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
three two one go

3991
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
demon crawl

3992
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
is a mind sweeper

3993
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
roguelike

3994
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
demon crawl

3995
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
oh let's see

3996
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
fascinating

3997
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
oh look it's mind sweeper

3998
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
but there's treasure chests

3999
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
let's get

4000
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
what makes it a roguelike

4001
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
and not

4002
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
just a series of mind sweeper levels

4003
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
nothing

4004
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
i think mind sweeper itself

4005
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
could be classified as a roguelike

4006
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
it does have perma death

4007
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
that's true

4008
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
and it's procedurally generated

4009
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
interesting

4010
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
looks vaguely interesting

4011
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
yeah

4012
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
next voicemail is called

4013
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000

4016
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
on the thing

4017
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
it's a picture of some digivices

4018
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
i guess

4019
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
there we go

4020
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
dude those look sick

4021
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
yeah these are like

4022
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
is this the new version

4023
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
that released like last year

4024
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
i didn't even know there was a new version

4025
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
but it's black and red

4026
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
that's my favorite color combination

4027
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
because i'm an edge lord

4028
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
it's got bielzomon on the cover

4029
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
who's fucking murdered leomon

4030
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
it was fucking sick

4031
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
the one in the bottom

4032
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
who rode around a motorcycle

4033
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
who was dressed in leather

4034
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
and he fucking murdered one of the kids

4035
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
didgymon in cold blood

4036
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
and she cried about it and was awesome

4037
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
is it the one with the big blue wings

4038
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
and the gun

4039
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
and the gun

4040
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
okay the voicemail

4041
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
digital monster x 3 2 1 go

4042
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
an english version

4043
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
of the digital monster x was just announced

4044
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
so what's the difference between that

4045
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
and the version 20 of which tom has

4046
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
well first of all the english version

4047
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
of both are gonna be way cheaper than the japanese counterpart

4048
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
so now you have two options to pick from

4049
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
however

4050
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
here's the thing with the version 20

4051
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
you get a raise 2 digimon at a time

4052
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
and you have 10 aches to choose from

4053
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
evolution branches

4054
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
meanwhile the dmx only lets you raise one digimon at a time

4055
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
you only get one egg

4056
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
but the evolution tree and all the things in that branches

4057
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
far more than any of the version

4058
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
20th eggs

4059
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
and finally it has like an rpg quest mode

4060
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
so if you're fighting a 20th versus a 20th

4061
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
or an x versus an x

4062
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
they have a little mini game you can do

4063
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
so there's a little bit of skill in fighting

4064
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
but if you're fighting a 20th versus an x

4065
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
not so much

4066
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
so if you do a royal rumble you're probably gonna want to stick

4067
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
to all 20th's

4068
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
or all x

4069
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
and I believe the version 20th

4070
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
is the more beginner friendly of the two

4071
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
however if you do the 20th

4072
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
you enjoy it

4073
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
but you want something new I then highly recommend

4074
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
checking out the x when it comes out

4075
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
I gotta watch a review

4076
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
on that um

4077
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
digimon youtubers channel

4078
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
what was his name

4079
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
oh god I don't remember

4080
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I can't remember his name

4081
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
it's not out yet

4082
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
but when it is

4083
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
digimon digital monster

4084
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
x is a brand new digital

4085
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
monster virtual pet which is focusing

4086
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
on x antibody

4087
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
digimon

4088
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I don't know what that means

4089
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
several mechanics from the

4090
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
digimon pendulum x series

4091
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
also make a return such as the xai

4092
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
system this is gobbledygook

4093
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
yeah there's a ton of

4094
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
digimon vpets that came out in Japan

4095
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
like one version before

4096
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
these re-releases came out in the states

4097
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
there's a lot that I don't know about

4098
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
all I know is I just

4099
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
went to Amazon to look for one and then they're related

4100
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
there was the detamers d-arc

4101
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
that I had

4102
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
like three of back in the day and they're all gone now

4103
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
and they're selling used for $573

4104
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
uh

4105
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
digimon's were so much money

4106
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
cause it's like old and discontinued

4107
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
is that why it's expensive

4108
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
thousands of dollars worth of digimon merged

4109
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
that just got lost when we moved houses

4110
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
back in the day and it really hurts my soul

4111
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
to know I could like pay off my student loans with

4112
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
digimon toys but I can't

4113
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
cause they're gone

4114
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
oh no

4115
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
I wonder if, I mean I had

4116
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I had an old digimon

4117
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
from back in the day

4118
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
it's no way it's worth anything

4119
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
like the old

4120
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
pre-pokemon ones even

4121
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
those are worth a little bit

4122
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
hmm

4123
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
maybe I should look it up

4124
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
the next voicemail is called

4125
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
well it's just an image link

4126
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
and this is the image

4127
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
attached it's a drawing

4128
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
of a bird man

4129
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
looks pretty cool

4130
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
so voicemail in 3, 2, 1, go

4131
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000

02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
seek to plunder your fortress

4133
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
and steal what is yours

4134
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000

4136
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
bird, bird men

4137
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
are warning us that bandits

4138
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
are going to plunder our fortress

4139
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
uh

4140
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
DM I'd like to make a sleight of hand check

4141
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
to try and steal pickpocket from the bird man

4142
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
no you don't

4143
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
you don't say

4144
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
DM I want to make a sleight of hand check

4145
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000

to pick the bird man's pockets

4147
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
and then the DM says

4148
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
okay make a sleight of hand check

4149
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
did you see what I did there

4150
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
that's how you fucking do it

4151
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
you don't

4152
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
talk in mechanical terms

4153
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
the DM tells you the rules

4154
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
bitch

4155
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I tick limitarily

4156
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
lays an egg

4157
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
and then I make an omelet with it

4158
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
um

4159
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
DM is the bird man

4160
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
sexy

4161
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
you got the image

4162
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
oh I guess I have to choose myself

4163
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
uh okay no

4164
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
his head is too small

4165
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
and he has no pupils

4166
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
he has no pupils I don't mind that so much

4167
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
DM do I believe this bird

4168
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
do I believe this bird's claim

4169
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
or do I find it dubious

4170
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
okay alright I guess

4171
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
you can make a sense mode of check

4172
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
we're not the DM we gotta wait till next week

4173
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
to know what all these options are

4174
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I will

4175
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
okay my

4176
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
uh I mean

4177
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
I don't care I don't care what this bird man says

4178
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
okay we'll just we'll maintain normal

4179
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
fortifications we're always on guard

4180
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
we're always on guard from bandits right we run a tight ship

4181
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
uh

4182
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
this is not helpful we all take

4183
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
watch and shifts at night you know to make sure

4184
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
that nobody syncs up on our encampment during

4185
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
the evening we will

4186
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
redouble our usual efforts

4187
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
at repelling invaders

4188
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
bird man you are

4189
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
you are dismissed

4190
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
get out of here

4191
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
no does he have any weapons

4192
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
maybe he could help us defend

4193
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
defend our uh our encampment

4194
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
is he armed? no

4195
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
does he seem to have any arcane

4196
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
gifts that could help

4197
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I don't want him in the fort

4198
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
he's not one of us

4199
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
why are you speciesist

4200
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
is he who knows

4201
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I don't

4202
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
in this world it's killer be killed

4203
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I think he's more likely

4204
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
trying to pull some kind of ruse on us

4205
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
well that's why you have to

4206
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
see if we can leave them first

4207
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
I dare not say the mechanics name

4208
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
just in case I set you off again

4209
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
but

4210
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
fair enough

4211
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
I don't believe it

4212
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
believe it or not

4213
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
believe it or don't believe it

4214
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I'm still like well what whatever

4215
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
whatever

4216
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
no

4217
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
okay that's my take

4218
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
wait I gotta

4219
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
roll a d20

4220
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I gotta see what I get for my insight

4221
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I like it it's hard

4222
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
it's hard and it's annoying

4223
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
but I like it when like

4224
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I got an 18 plus my modifier for insight

4225
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
I think

4226
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
when you do a sense motive check

4227
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
it's better if the dm rolls

4228
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I feel like the roll should be secret

4229
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
like you shouldn't know like oh I got a great roll

4230
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
or oh I got a terrible roll

4231
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
because then you know what's real and what's not

4232
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
but I mean

4233
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
we're limited

4234
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I feel like it helps with immersion

4235
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
if the dm rolls does all the rolls

4236
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
but it also it kind of like empowers the player to feel like

4237
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
their stats are doing well

4238
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
if they know what the roll is

4239
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
so it really depends on what side of the equation you want to kind of

4240
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
it depends on the roll

4241
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I don't do this for like an attack or something

4242
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
or like most even something like picking a lock

4243
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
I would let the player roll but for something like sense motive

4244
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
like

4245
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
if the entire party rolls sense motive

4246
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
and you know you get a bunch of rolls

4247
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I think it's better if they don't know what they rolled

4248
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
because then all they know is who believes

4249
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
and who doesn't

4250
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
and then all they can do is like okay well

4251
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
this guy has got a good intuition stat

4252
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
he's like usually pretty perceptive

4253
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
maybe we should believe

4254
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
him because he's more likely to be right

4255
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
but you never know

4256
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
sometimes it could be wrong

4257
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I think that's the best way to do it

4258
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
usually an insight

4259
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
something that's just a character

4260
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
and two it's like internally

4261
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
so even just like having the roll be

4262
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
announced is difficult

4263
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
like that's kind of like

4264
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
the struggle with table top is like

4265
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
even knowing that you

4266
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
had to make a roll for it at all

4267
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
is sort of giving the game away a little bit

4268
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I think that

4269
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
if you think about it the numbers

4270
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
the rolling of the dice

4271
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
is to offset

4272
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
the fact that you can't literally

4273
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
do these things in real life

4274
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
if you have charisma

4275
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
like not in real life but in the game

4276
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
you roll a high number

4277
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
if you don't know what you rolled

4278
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
and you have to convince your party

4279
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
of something

4280
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
if you don't personally have charisma

4281
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
but you rolled a high enough how are you supposed to

4282
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
like you can't really convince them

4283
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
with your real life stats

4284
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I think

4285
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
that in a case like that

4286
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
you shouldn't be able to

4287
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
just like make

4288
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
I think it's better if generally

4289
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
you don't like roll charisma

4290
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
checks to convince your party of things

4291
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
because then you

4292
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
if you make a really high roll

4293
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
then that ends up forcing other players

4294
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
to play their characters

4295
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
in a way that they don't actually want to

4296
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
unless it's like a physical check

4297
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
that just happens naturally

4298
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
like if the players believe you or not

4299
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
it's just a matter of you being able to convince them

4300
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
at the table

4301
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
that's a point where the rules

4302
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
kind of break down

4303
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
where the rules and the role playing

4304
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
kind of clash with each other

4305
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
and you sort of have to choose which one

4306
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
you're going to prioritize

4307
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
there

4308
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
some character just imagining

4309
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
you have to convince a guard

4310
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
to let you in

4311
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
let me in, you want to let me in

4312
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
and it's like not convincing at all

4313
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
but they roll a really high number so it works

4314
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
and then everything seems a little stupid

4315
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
well at that point it's up to the DM

4316
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
whether they want to allow it to happen

4317
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
or not

4318
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
the DM has the last say

4319
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
even like in a situation where you roll a nat 20

4320
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
if it's like I'm rolling

4321
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
to like fucking insta kill God

4322
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
like you're not going to get a success on a nat 20

4323
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
because like with skill checks

4324
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
a nat 20 isn't an instant success

4325
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
it's just 20 plus your score

4326
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
because you can set up a debility check

4327
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
like that outside of damage

4328
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
to be like 47

4329
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
or something insane like that

4330
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
that you just can't clear

4331
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
if they were trying to lie their way in

4332
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
and they just said like let me in

4333
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
cause you want to

4334
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
I would probably be like as the DM

4335
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I'd say like that's not even a lie

4336
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
like you just fucked it up

4337
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
it doesn't matter what you roll

4338
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
like you simply didn't do the thing

4339
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
it still depends on whether the roll is

4340
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
for the

4341
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
like how good the lie is

4342
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
or like the stupidity of the guard

4343
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
in question

4344
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
I think letting the players roll

4345
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
even if you know that they're not going to

4346
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
succeed just helps the game feel more

4347
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
feels like they're actively participating

4348
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
you should definitely

4349
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
you should definitely make them roll

4350
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
sometimes when there's

4351
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
like literally no purpose to it

4352
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
just so they don't know

4353
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
what's real and what's not

4354
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
yeah that's a good

4355
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
that's a good DMing

4356
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
if you roll a 20 on a strength

4357
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
and they're trying to push a boulder

4358
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
it doesn't matter how strong

4359
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
they roll they can't push it

4360
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
too big

4361
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
unless they have like some kind of like superhuman

4362
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
strength score

4363
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
but like most normal characters won't

4364
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
like you can roll a nat 20 on a strength check

4365
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
and be like your muscles flex real nice

4366
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
and everyone thinks you look cool with the rock doesn't

4367
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
it's DM's discretion but I think

4368
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
if you did that and you roll the nat

4369
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
20 I might be tempted to be like

4370
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
it is physically impossible to move this boulder

4371
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
but it just so happens that it was

4372
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
sitting on some like unstable ground

4373
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
which kind of gives in and the boulder moves

4374
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
like maybe

4375
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
it depends

4376
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
there was an interesting like uh like simplified

4377
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
rule set for tabletop I was looking at

4378
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
that was based on 2d6's

4379
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
and it was like under under 7 was

4380
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
a failure

4381
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
and 9 was a yes but

4382
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
so like you succeed at what you have to do

4383
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
but something bad happens

4384
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
and then like an 11 or 12 was just a straight success

4385
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I thought that was pretty interesting

4386
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
that is interesting like that's like improv

4387
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
yeah the yes yes but

4388
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
that's cool

4389
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
it's kind of like

4390
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
I like that because it follows the like the rule

4391
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
of storytelling that it's not like

4392
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
it's it's like

4393
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
what is it like that there's that tray parker matt stone

4394
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
talk where they talk about

4395
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
the columbine shooters

4396
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
yeah the columbine shooter

4397
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
it's it's not yes and that's the improv thing

4398
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
it's like

4399
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
they're talking about like a story has to progress

4400
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
according to like

4401
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
and then

4402
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
because

4403
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
and then and then and then it's and then

4404
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
so therefore

4405
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
you know it's like one one

4406
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
leads into the other and there's like some sort of

4407
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I don't know

4408
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
I guess it's not quite the same

4409
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
never mind

4410
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
next voicemail is called

4411
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Sam 3 2 1

4412
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
go

4413
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
hey guys

4414
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
so this is the first time I'm

4415
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
doing one of these

4416
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
so my apologies

4417
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
if

4418
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
correctly or you're doing good

4419
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
incorrect format

4420
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
but I'm in college

4421
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
and

4422
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
because of the virus and all

4423
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
I don't have any friends

4424
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
pretty lonely

4425
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I'm stuck in a room all day

4426
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I was just wondering

4427
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
if you guys had any advice on how to

4428
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
make friends in college

4429
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
or how to meet new people

4430
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
I mean to do it

4431
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
I hope you all have a great day

4432
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
I mean I the whole

4433
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
the whole virus situation is

4434
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
a little bit

4435
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
nobody knows how to cope with that

4436
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
yeah I mean obviously

4437
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
we didn't have to deal with that when we were

4438
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
in college because there was no

4439
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
coronavirus at the time

4440
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
I mean I can give you the usual

4441
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
fucking

4442
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
advice under normal circumstances

4443
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
it would be join

4444
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
groups, join extracurriculars

4445
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
join like study groups for your classes

4446
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
or whatever

4447
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
chat with your classmates after class

4448
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
and I don't know

4449
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
see what they're up to and

4450
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
make

4451
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
not to

4452
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
I'm going to sound a little salty

4453
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
but making friends in college is so fucking easy

4454
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
it's so easy

4455
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
and if you can't do it in college

4456
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
then you might as well just fucking kill yourself

4457
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
because that's the easiest time and you're fucked

4458
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
uh no

4459
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
that was a terrible thing

4460
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
a terrible thing I just said

4461
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
the thing is like it's easy to make friends

4462
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
in college because like you have a bunch of people

4463
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
the same age it's easy to find

4464
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
like people who are pursuing the same kind of

4465
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
general goals that you are because

4466
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
there's tons of like

4467
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
clubs and stuff but

4468
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
in the current situation

4469
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
that's all undercut

4470
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
the point of college is like it's a bunch

4471
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
of people of like a similar background

4472
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
generally who are all

4473
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
convened together to spend years

4474
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
doing structured activities

4475
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
with one another like it's the

4476
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
it's like the ultimate like

4477
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
like acquaintance building

4478
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
engine

4479
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
uh after school

4480
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
out of school it's like

4481
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
nothing is like that anymore

4482
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
if it wasn't for the internet I would have made a single friend

4483
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
from 2011

4484
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
to now

4485
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
because I haven't I literally haven't made a single friend

4486
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
in the real world in the last decade

4487
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
I made

4488
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
uh I've met

4489
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
I've met some a couple

4490
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
people in the real world but like not

4491
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
yeah mainly I've made friends

4492
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
that I originally knew through the internet

4493
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
uh cringe

4494
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
uh cringe

4495
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
um

4496
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
oh man

4497
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
yeah the coronavirus

4498
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
with not being able to like

4499
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
physically be with people

4500
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
from college is probably

4501
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I'm sure the coronavirus

4502
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
is making it ten times harder

4503
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
than it's supposed to be so

4504
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
yeah I mean college makes it

4505
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
easier but the coronavirus makes it way harder

4506
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
so maybe it balances out

4507
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
at the very least if you have like zoom

4508
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
groups or discord groups or whatever

4509
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
for your classes talking

4510
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
those I just really all I can

4511
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
think of yeah joining clubs

4512
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
and groups is good there's

4513
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
one that you want that doesn't exist

4514
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
try starting one and uh

4515
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I would say what happens nobody

4516
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
shows interest and you're in the exact same

4517
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
position you're in now so I would say

4518
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
get vaccinated

4519
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
early if possible

4520
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
I know that's not possible for everyone

4521
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
and then

4522
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
after you know after the coronavirus

4523
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
is dealt with to whatever extent it can be

4524
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
be I don't know

4525
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
this is hard and I don't and I

4526
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
struggle to do this as well but like

4527
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
just try and like be

4528
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
out of your room

4529
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
be out in places

4530
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
I know it sounds stupid it sounds

4531
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
like what's the point of that like what I'm just gonna go

4532
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
and like stand somewhere like yes

4533
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
to a certain to a certain extent yes

4534
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
you should just like leave your room

4535
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
and go somewhere

4536
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
any literally anywhere anywhere other

4537
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
people are simply for the sake

4538
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
of being there there's just like a commons area

4539
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
where you could like get snacks

4540
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
and just tables like sit and like study

4541
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
and do stuff like out

4542
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
of your room I spent a lot of time there and I would just

4543
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
like run into people I knew from class because like

4544
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
it was right above the cafeteria so when people would

4545
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
get food they'd walk by there and I would just say hi

4546
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
it was a good place to kind of just like

4547
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
naturally start conversation with people

4548
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
that you like had seen around

4549
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
so something like that when the weather gets

4550
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
better just being outside

4551
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
if you're on campus like just working outside

4552
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
doing some studying outside and like

4553
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
just just kind of like reaching out

4554
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
to somebody who you've seen in class

4555
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
and you might have an interest

4556
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
in striking up conversation with even

4557
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
if like you don't know

4558
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
exactly what the conversation is

4559
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
going to be about just like putting yourself

4560
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
in the situation even though it feels like really

4561
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
scary of just like saying hi to somebody

4562
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
you'll naturally get better at doing it

4563
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
so it'll be

4564
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
easier going forward each time to talk to

4565
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
more people

4566
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
yeah

4567
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I think that's pretty

4568
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
good advice

4569
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
I think we've pretty much solved this guy's whole

4570
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
life now

4571
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I think he's good

4572
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
you're welcome

4573
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Sam

4574
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
let us know how it goes I guess

4575
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
the last voicemail

4576
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I think is called

4577
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
download ruffle

4578
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
3 2 1 go

4579
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
boy download ruffle

4580
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
it's a flash emulator that can install your browser

4581
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
as well as your computer

4582
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
preserve flash as much as you can

4583
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
download ruffle right now

4584
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
okay

4585
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
okay

4586
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
I like playing the old flash

4587
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
video games online

4588
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
so is what I'm hearing

4589
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
that if you have ruffle

4590
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
you can play old flash games

4591
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
is that

4592
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
it seems to be saying

4593
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
so it's basically just someone remade flash

4594
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
it's probably like some sort of emulator

4595
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I don't

4596
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I mean

4597
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
what's the difference

4598
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
yeah flash player emulator written in rust

4599
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
yeah it just emulates

4600
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
the flash environment

4601
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
but it's written

4602
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
I assume it's written in rust but it probably

4603
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
works with the html5 so it runs in modern web browsers

4604
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
without

4605
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
I mean flash is just a program

4606
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
flash is just software how do you

4607
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
emulate software don't you just

4608
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
wouldn't you just have

4609
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
written the software again

4610
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
it's I mean it's the same way you emulate

4611
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
like a super nintendo I guess

4612
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
super nintendo is a software

4613
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
well it's hardware and software

4614
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
sure and like you're emulating the hardware

4615
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
and the software that it runs

4616
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
in order to run the applications

4617
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
and you're just emulating

4618
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
the software of flash player

4619
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
I guess so I guess so

4620
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
well that's I mean I'm glad there's a

4621
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
I'm glad there's an alternative

4622
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
I'm glad there's a plant based alternative

4623
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
to flash

4624
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
does this mean I can read old homestuck

4625
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
maybe

4626
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I don't know

4627
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
wait does old homestuck even exist anymore

4628
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I mean the MS Paint Adventures

4629
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
got like redirected to homestuck.com

4630
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
so I don't know

4631
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
actually if all that stuff is there

4632
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
but I think a few pages have like

4633
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
you can go to the top right and like

4634
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
switch to the flash version of the page

4635
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
like cascade

4636
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
which is way way better

4637
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
than the video

4638
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
on the ruffle homepage they have a

4639
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
version of alien hominid running in ruffle

4640
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
you can just play alien hominid on here

4641
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
hell yeah

4642
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
that's pretty based

4643
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
download ruffle I guess

4644
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
well we're at two hours

4645
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
and 50 minutes

4646
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
and eliazar says keep it under three

4647
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
hours so

4648
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I guess it's time to die

4649
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
we did it

4650
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000

02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I have one thing

4672
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
that I do want to mention before the end of the episode

4673
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
and it is a little personal

4674
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
project it's not my project

4675
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
it's a project that I am involved in

4676
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
and I think maybe some people

4677
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
would appreciate knowing about it

4678
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
there is a comic anthology

4679
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000

4680
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000

pretty neat

4694
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
I don't know

4695
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
comic artists are always looking for this kind of shit

4696
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
would I be able to

4697
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000

you could submit

4700
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
anything you had made

4701
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
and I don't know

4702
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
I am not one of the people making it

4703
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
so I don't know what the criteria is

4704
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I mean yeah

4705
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I saw you tweet about it but I haven't watched the video yet

4706
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
I posted a tweet about it

4707
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
I will put a link

4708
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
please put a link in the description

4709
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
to this video

4710
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
from the kato youtube channel

4711
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
announcing this anthology

4712
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000

and I should disclaimer

4716
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I am I guess

4717
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
something involved in the production of it

4718
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
so this is not

4719
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I guess I

4720
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
what's the word is it a conflict of interest

4721
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
and if I were a fucking

4722
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
if I had for a comic artist

4723
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
lol I would want

4724
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
to get paid to have my shit printed

4725
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
so uh okay that's all

4726
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
goodbye

4727
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
anything else

4728
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
no that's it

4729
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
okay

4730
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
then I will die

4731
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
now

4732
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
