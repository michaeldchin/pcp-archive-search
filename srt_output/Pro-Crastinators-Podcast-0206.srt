00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,080
the best guy ever and let's see here we've got Gibbontake over here.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,440
Hey guys, go to Gibbontake.site to read comics that I make. This is a, I'm gonna chill my

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,680
comics forever every single time I speak.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,760
That's an option. We've got Tom Oliver over here.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,600
Why is Final Fantasy VII Remake sold out on Amazon?

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Sold out?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,040
It's sold out. We can't fucking buy it and I refuse to buy a digital copy.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,240
You're a better man than I. I bought digital.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Bullshit.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Coward.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
I just don't care.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,640
I just don't have the hard drive space. I've done the research, apparently it takes

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,960
up less space on your hard drive if you have a disc.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,680
That makes sense. I believe it's, it was 87 gigs if I remember correctly.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Ooh.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
It's a lot of space.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Holy shit.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
A lot of fucking space.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
And we've got...

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
For one third of a game.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,200
Less than that, bro. Less than that. But we've got her here.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Endless Jess, of course.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Hey, it's me doing my yearly like three episodes of this show before I get to be here again.

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
Guys, we've got to talk about this fucking, what you just said.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,480
This whole, this digital copy standalone. Oh wait, Nate did this himself, but you know

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
him.

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
You know me.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,480
So like, I was, it was like the day before the game came out and I was looking at it like

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,880
it was like, oh, pre-order now and you can download the game early and then it will unlock

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
at midnight.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,760
So I'm like, yeah, okay.

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
I mean, it's like no one can go out.

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,880
So I can't get a physical copy, I guess I might as well do this.

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,280
So it's like, okay, there's like standard edition for $60.

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,880
There's like the big edition for $80.

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,760
And like the big edition just has like a cactar summon and a carbuncle and a useless digital

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
art book.

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,000
Seems like, you know, not worth it, but it's like, ah, it might as well.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,240
I guess I have to, you know, get the main, the big edition.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Yeah.

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
They got me by the balls.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,840
That's, we always knew that would be the case.

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,200
But so I get that and like the download before midnight thing doesn't work.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,360
It doesn't do that for me.

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,800
I don't know if there's some kind of like, you have to learn to code to figure out how

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
to get it to actually do that.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
You do have to learn to code.

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Yeah.

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,280
So like, I bought it and like, I'm like, where, I don't understand.

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Someone helped me and then I fell asleep and I woke up at like, you know, in the morning

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,600
and it like, it still wasn't there and I'm like, oh, come on.

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
What is this?

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
That's ridiculous.

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,640
I woke up on Christmas morning and finding like just a shit in a box instead of what

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,280
you wanted, which was a different kind of shit in a box in this case, a shit without

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,800
a box.

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
It's like that thing when parents say like, listen son, we're not going to buy you any

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,400
presents, but we're going to go out the day after Christmas or like two days and we'll

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,560
go buy you gifts and it's like, well, mom and dad, I mean, you know, I appreciate that's

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
economical.

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,080
I, you know, it's unfortunate that you don't love me, but you know, I mean, we can, we

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,400
can make this work, I guess.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,560
But then the next day, I ended up having it.

65
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,520
I ended up having to go out for some reason and go to Walmart and like wade through the

66
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,440
sea of boomers and they're stupid little masks and everyone's got like, everyone's got like

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,480
a cute little camouflage pattern, like mask now and like little colors.

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Like it's just, it's just a fashion statement now.

69
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,400
We're all okay with it.

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
We're all just okay with this.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
It's totally fine.

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
It's the new normal.

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
You know, my mom, my mom made us a bunch of masks and sent them to us while I was out

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
at the grocery store.

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
We were wearing our masks.

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Michelle, like a, like a cute little dog one, a lady just says like, Hey, where'd you get

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
those masks?

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
And I'm like, oh, my mom made them for us.

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,400
She's like, can I buy some from her, please?

80
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,440
Give me her contact information so I can have a mask.

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,840
And yeah, that's happening.

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
It's cool now.

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,960
There's nothing weird or wrong about it at all.

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,640
In fact, everyone was rightfully looking at me with disdain for not wearing a mask and

85
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,960
looking at me like the scum of the earth and just a mutant crawling up from the sewers

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,840
and walking among the streets to infect everyone in the populace for the crime of not wearing

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
a mask on my trip to Walmart.

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,880
But anyways, I'm at Walmart and I'm looking at the games behind the glass case and there

89
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
it is.

90
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
There's the physical copy.

91
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,200
First of all, I didn't realize that the physical copy would be fucking beautiful.

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,040
And it's, it's, it's the white, it's exactly like the original box, the same box art.

93
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,100
And I'm just like, well, too bad I already spent 80 bucks for the fucking digital.

94
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,000
And then I see the price tag.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's 50 bucks.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The, why?

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, that's right.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They always mark it down.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's true.

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why is the physical copy 50 bucks?

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And the digital is at least 60.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's a Walmart thing.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is that just a Walmart thing?

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For whatever reason?

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,240
The reason is go to Walmart to buy your games because they just mark down like all games

107
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
$10.

108
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I don't know why.

109
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Oh my God, what a crock of shit.

110
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
I was so mad.

111
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,320
I almost, I actually got the virus right then and there just because I was so upset.

112
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,600
It found its way through, it found like a weakness in my constitution and it got inside

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
me in that moment.

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,920
You're going to be hearing a lot of this of me in the coming weeks and months.

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,000
But there's some, seeing, I know nobody in the world cares, seeing the cover, I just

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Google it, seeing the cover of this game being a long rectangle and not a square makes

117
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,480
me unreasonably angry.

118
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,440
It makes me want to rip my heart out and stop it on the, it's supposed to be a square.

119
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
It's like Square Enix.

120
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Remember that company guys?

121
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,960
You are such an autist.

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
It's not even funny.

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,360
It's supposed to be a soft square made out of some kind of, made out of like noodle material.

124
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Oh boy.

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,680
The disc should be a square shaped disc.

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,200
The only one of its kind.

127
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,280
The only thing about that, I, well, I don't know, my story is bad.

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm just previncing with that information.

129
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,480
And it's just that I also downloaded the game pre-order because I just had to have, I just

130
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,600
had to have that extra chocobo chick materia that you get as a DLC pre-order bonus.

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
I didn't want it.

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,800
I didn't fucking, is there no option to just not get the pre-order things?

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,680
I literally hate them and don't want them.

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,320
I just want, okay, whatever.

135
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,680
But the, I realized in order to download it or when I bought the game, I'm like, why

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
isn't this downloading?

137
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,000
I should see something on my thing right now.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What's going on?

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,960
I, I Googled it and figured out in order to download ahead of time, you have to fucking

140
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,800
like navigate into like several sub menus and like, like choose to like preload the game

141
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
in like a week.

142
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
You'd think that would be like, I remember doing this before.

143
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,760
When you buy a game, there's like with Kingdom Hearts 3 on the screen, on the PlayStation

144
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
download library or whatever, or on the store, you just press X and it fucking downloads

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
and that's all you had to do it.

146
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Why was this game different than you?

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,600
I had to go, I had to Google how to figure out how to download the game and navigate

148
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
to another weird menu.

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
It just had to be something.

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,840
That's not a game problem with a game, but what, what the fuck?

151
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
What was that?

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
It was a query.

153
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,800
They have to, they just, Square Enix can't help themselves.

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,120
They have something good and they just have to meddle with it.

155
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Maybe it was like Sony.

156
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
Like maybe it's a, the platform itself is the problem, like they changed something about

157
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
how it works now.

158
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
I don't know.

159
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,200
I don't know if that's their fault, but like that night after I had purchased it digitally

160
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,480
and then fallen asleep, you know, before I woke up the next morning, that night I actually

161
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:51,560
had a dream about Final Fantasy seven and it was like, like I had a dream that I was

162
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,800
wrong and the game was good and it was beautiful.

163
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,160
It was like, this is not a bit.

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
This really happened.

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
I had this dream.

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Sure.

167
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,720
And like in my dream, like Cloud and Tifa both had like Southern Hick Drawls cause they're

168
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,640
fucking Backwoods white folk.

169
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,800
Tifa's a cowboy.

170
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,800
And there was like all this like weird, like the, like the new stuff was like expanding

171
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
rather than like taking away and it was all like appropriate and respectful and it was

172
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
all good and wonderful.

173
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,520
And I'm like, oh my God, I was wrong.

174
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,800
I'm so happy to have been wrong.

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,000
And then I woke up back in the real world and realized I still have yet to play it.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,520
And I'm like, oh no, oh, it can't possibly live up to my dream that I had.

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,440
So anyways, then I played it and I, well, okay.

178
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,400
First of all, I don't know how to fucking say this.

179
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,440
I assume you have a ton of complicated feelings that are hard to express.

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I do.

181
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I know I do.

182
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,680
First of all, like it's fucking phenomenal.

183
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Like the game is fucking amazing.

184
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,320
Like, just like we said last week, like eight year old me has died and gone to heaven playing

185
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
this game right now.

186
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,080
Like I just got to wear, but like also I was right about everything.

187
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
You know?

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Yeah.

189
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Yep.

190
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Yep.

191
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,880
So like, I like, I just got to wear like, I got to where you meet Tifa and you go to

192
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,600
the bar and you're in the slums and I'm just like looking around and like there's the bar

193
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
and there's the plate.

194
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,960
I can look in the sky and see how the, like the sun is shining through in certain spots

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,440
of the plate and I can see like this massive area that is now the slums and I can go around

196
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,160
and cloud has a little apartment right next to Tifa and there's like this little section

197
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,800
where you're just walking around with Tifa just going about your day doing side missions.

198
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,600
I did every side mission I could and just like, this is like the comfiest.

199
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,640
This is the best thing that's ever happened to me in my life is just I'm walking around

200
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,560
the slums with like the original waifu, my original wife Tifa.

201
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm just walking around with her like going on side missions and like this is all I've

202
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,320
ever wanted in my entire life.

203
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,320
You go to the bar and like, you can actually, you can go behind the bar now.

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,800
Like my whole life, I've wanted to go behind that bar and you can't do it in the original

205
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
game and now you can, 10 out of 10, it's the greatest game ever made.

206
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,800
They fucking, you know, and so, and there's like, and there's like, there's like missions

207
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
where you, you learn more about the members of Avalanche.

208
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,200
They're really like trying to make you care more about Biggs and Wedge and Jesse.

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,960
You go to like Jesse's parents house and, you know, it's this, you meet, you know, you

210
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,320
have to sneak into her dad's room and her dad's, this is a kind of a spoiler, I guess,

211
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,400
but whatever you sneak into it, it's early in the game.

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,000
You sneak into her dad's room, her dad's got Mako Poisoning, he's there and you learn

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,480
about her, you learn about her plight.

214
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,920
You see cloud like starting to warm up like, like, I was so afraid that they would like

215
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,240
have him just be advent children cloud the whole game, just like the smoke.

216
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Yeah.

217
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
No, he starts out like, correct.

218
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
He's like, he's like a trying really hard to be a nonchalant badass.

219
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,200
And like, you almost buy it at first, but it starts like, you see cracks in it as you

220
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
keep playing.

221
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,360
And then he starts warming up as he learns more about the members of Avalanche and their

222
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
plight.

223
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,520
He starts remembering how much he cares about Tifa, like the characterization is like actually

224
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
on point.

225
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
The voice acting is like, mostly incredible.

226
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Like most of the characters are so well cast for once Tifa sounds great.

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
I think the dialogue is like actually good.

228
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,280
I can't believe, I cannot believe that the dialogue is good and like well written and

229
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,880
like how people actually talk and it doesn't feel like weird or like anime-ish and all

230
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
that.

231
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
And like I'm playing it.

232
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,360
So I'm like, I'm like five or six hours into it and this is a moment where I'm, I'm just

233
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
taking it in.

234
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm just, I'm playing darts and I'm in the bar and I'm talking to Barrett and I'm looking

235
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,400
at Merlene and she's like scaring Barrett says, don't scare my daughter, you fool.

236
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,320
And I'm talking to Tifa and she's making me a drink and everything is great and it's

237
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
all wonderful and I'm in fucking heaven and I'm standing outside and I'm just looking

238
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
at the bar.

239
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm looking at seventh heaven.

240
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
I have died and gone to seventh heaven.

241
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm looking at the plate above.

242
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm looking at the dirt on the ground below.

243
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm looking at all the ramshackle fucking shacks all over the fucking slums and I'm

244
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
like this is it.

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
This is the, I can't believe it.

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,200
Maybe I was wrong.

247
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,840
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe this can be an actual good experience.

248
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,080
And then the Nomura character shows up.

249
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,600
You're riding on your motorcycle and they do a little motorcycle mission and here comes

250
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,840
this guy, this new character called like Doge or Douche or something, some stupid fucking

251
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
name.

252
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,560
He's got like a stupid haircut and he's got a goatee like it's 1999 and he fucking, you

253
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,840
know, he looks more 1999 than the game which came out in the 90s and he's fucking, he's

254
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,040
coming in on a motorcycle and of course that's where the advent children, flippy fucking motorcycle

255
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,320
sword fights have to start and I'm just watching the scene.

256
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,920
I'm in it and I'm going oh my god you were doing so well but Square Enix just can't help

257
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
themselves.

258
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,200
Nomura couldn't help himself.

259
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,320
They had to create this guy and stick him in here unnecessarily just, and he's just,

260
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,360
and this guy starts talking.

261
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
The fucking words.

262
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,920
I mean you said no anime dialogue but then this guy shows up and the words that come

263
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,760
out of this guy, it's like he's from a different game.

264
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,680
It's like every other character is in a totally different game and the dialogue is actually

265
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,200
decent and good.

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,920
And then this guy comes in like he came in from the crisis core universe.

267
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,280
He found a wormhole and found his way into this game and instantly the quality of the

268
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,600
whole thing nose dives immediately and he just starts talking in poetry and he starts

269
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,360
talking like Genesis like quoting plays and sonnets and shit and he's going oh the flames

270
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
of our rivalry shall burn forever.

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,720
I can't wait to have sword fights forever.

272
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,880
You're my fated rival because everyone is gay for each other.

273
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,480
Let's be gay for each other and let's scissor, let's have a nice motorcycle scissor sword

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
fight.

275
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm so happy to have found my fated rival in this world.

276
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,880
The dying embers of my heart, my romance and my passion and I'm like what happened?

277
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,520
In five minutes the game went from the most incredible thing, like all my dreams came

278
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,000
true to then all my nightmares have come true like right one after another.

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,440
Hold on just a second.

280
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,080
That sounds like it was tongue in cheek.

281
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,560
Did Cloud give a shit about this guy?

282
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,360
No, Cloud rightfully hated him and wanted nothing to do with him.

283
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,640
Thank God for that.

284
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,840
But just like the fact that this character exists and like they just had to-

285
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Yeah, you've got to think that like this is what Nomura considered like worthy of an

286
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,760
addition to the tapestry that is the story of like this guy who's just basically like

287
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,320
a Genesis character like you said.

288
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,520
He's extremely similar to Genesis and he has equally advent children moves.

289
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,760
I mean these are just all the elements that I don't know about everybody else but I hope

290
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,360
to see very little of and to have more of just the other stuff.

291
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,400
And the thing is, it's like I get the idea behind this character and it's not even a

292
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
bad idea like you see him and they go-

293
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Do you see a soldier who's like not-

294
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Yes, a soldier.

295
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
That's good.

296
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
That's good stuff.

297
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Oh, he's a soldier and you read his bio.

298
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,320
He's like a soldier third class and like he's got like the suspenders and the outfit and

299
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,880
it's like it is a legitimately good idea to like expand in little ways like having another

300
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,000
soldier to be like a rival to Cloud throughout the game.

301
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's cool.

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's great.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,920
Why do they have to be this?

304
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,240
You know, I've got a nuanced point and I'm making a video about this.

305
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm about 18 hours into the game.

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
I am blasting through this thing.

307
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,520
I'm going to be done with it soon and I have so much to say about it in one maybe more

308
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,800
videos, I don't know.

309
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,720
But about this character, there's a moment later when, okay, you know when you meet Reno,

310
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,000
when you arrive in Eris's whatever, you crash through the ceiling of the church and whatever

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
and Reno's there.

312
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Reno had a fascinating point of dialogue that in retrospect, like this is a moment that

313
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,600
I think the remake is like literally better in the- because there's like additional levels

314
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,200
of expressiveness it can do and it's that specifically Reno says like, who are you?

315
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Cloud says, ex-soldier.

316
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Reno's like, really?

317
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
What class?

318
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,360
And Cloud says, first class.

319
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,640
Reno, when hearing, and maybe this was in the original, I'm going to replay it to double

320
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
check.

321
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,560
Reno like laughs and is like, bro, like it's obviously a joke that you're a first class

322
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
soldier.

323
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,760
Like I can tell you're not that powerful or something.

324
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,640
What that did for me was make me be like, oh, you know what this is doing all at once?

325
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,160
What it's doing is it is throwing into question like the validity of Cloud's story in a very

326
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,840
reasonable way that characters who like, who are in the know would actually be able

327
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,440
to like, with a degree of authority on the matter, like question specific elements of

328
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,200
Cloud's story, especially considering we have already met a soldier third class.

329
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,880
Like I know it's no more of stuff.

330
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,720
And like that guy seems barely more powerful than or like Cloud seems like only a bit stronger

331
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
than that guy.

332
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,880
Now there is issues with this because like Cloud is doing literal advent children shit

333
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
that like no one has ever done in the history of the world.

334
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,200
So it doesn't the power scaling does not really make sense once that stuff has been included.

335
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,720
But I mean, combat was always kind of an abstraction.

336
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,880
I'm guessing they're continuing that with like the cutscene combat as well.

337
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,360
I don't know.

338
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,600
But like that's a moment that they've taken what already exists and just added a little

339
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
bit of extra detail.

340
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Yeah.

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,400
And they're making a lot of story more like I'm shocked at how the only point I wanted

342
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
to get about that.

343
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,640
And it was just that the issue about that is that the game is already like everything

344
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,760
I said just there is set up for the mystery of who is Cloud?

345
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,280
Like what is his backstory?

346
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,320
That's all those points I just said are adding to that mystery that was in the original.

347
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,960
The problem is that mystery itself is not maintained in this remake in the same way

348
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,800
it was in the original, which leads me to believe they don't understand what they're

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,400
doing with these additional details.

350
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,760
They are just putting new things in.

351
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,360
Some of them hit the mark, but they shatter the illusion in this game, which is supposed

352
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,960
to be the first fifth or sixth of the fucking game where that information is not supposed

353
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,080
to be known yet.

354
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,920
So like ultimately, what was the point of it?

355
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,760
It's such a fucking one foot one step forward.

356
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,400
How is the mystery revealed?

357
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,600
I mean, I don't want to spoil it for you.

358
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,120
I'm aware what like they you are very cleanly aware it is stated to you that cloud is not

359
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
a soldier.

360
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:19,160
This piece of my worry of that is that I mean, like I'm at the point now we're like because

361
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,920
it's so clear that they did actually give a shit more than I gave them credit for, you

362
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,080
know, or more than I assumed they would like, I'm shocked at how many little things there

363
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,600
are like that Reno line you mentioned where it's just like, oh, this is like a good addition

364
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
to the canon.

365
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,400
Like I like this more of this please.

366
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,560
And like just little moments where like things are expanded or like are touched upon.

367
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,360
I'm shocked at how much there's that that I like I guess my worry is that they're going

368
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,440
to cram all the character development into this first game.

369
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,280
And then what the fuck do you do for the next, you know, five games, bro, they've got no

370
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
plan.

371
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Yeah, they've got no plan.

372
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,720
It just seems like they're really I can feel how the story is set up in this one that they're

373
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,560
kind of rushing through these character beats that, you know, in the original game throughout

374
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
the whole game.

375
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
I mean, that's definitely true.

376
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,200
I mean, Sephiroth's appearance after the first fucking mission could could not be clear as

377
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
to exact.

378
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,520
Oh my God, Jesse, the thing that maybe the most angry, I wonder if you I don't know if

379
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,800
you also noticed that I mean, it's very clear in the story, but it made me this is the moment

380
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,520
I was like these people are fucking up blowing up their own reactor.

381
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,920
Yes, it's the chin.

382
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,400
Are you kidding me?

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Are you fine?

384
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,320
You're rewriting Avalanche's role in the story.

385
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:45,360
That is the worst change in the game so far.

386
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,280
You mentioned that and flip shit because I played the demo a couple of weeks ago.

387
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,600
I know you guys didn't and to make it clear for everybody in the audience, I've never

388
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,240
played Final Fantasy 7 and I haven't on purpose.

389
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,720
I want to play the remake without the perspective of all the baggage that you guys have just

390
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,200
just as an experiment.

391
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,960
And so I play the demo and I did a podcast on it and I specifically mentioned that scene.

392
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,680
I was like, I am 99% certain this is an addition to the remake and was not the original game.

393
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,320
You don't have to be a nostalgia fag.

394
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,960
You just have to have a functional fucking brain.

395
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Because it just felt so fucking like the lot.

396
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,880
If we can't have the main characters be underwritten terrorists anymore, even though the whole point

397
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,720
is that they have an arc and they learn their lesson, they change people.

398
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,320
Later on, fucking like Jesse's arc is like feeling guilt about the terrorist things they

399
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
caused.

400
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,600
So like, oh my God, on the one side, we get our characters feeling guilty about the collateral

401
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
damage.

402
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,720
And on the other side, from a meta perspective, we're aware that they're pure as the fucking

403
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,480
driven snow and they have nothing to feel bad about.

404
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,320
They literally did nothing wrong.

405
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,960
And you like other characters in this remake?

406
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,240
I don't know if you saw this line.

407
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,040
There's a line about, look, whatever, there's like before Crisis Shit about how Avalanche

408
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,320
is like a large organization and just barrets like Cell of Avalanche that was never clearly

409
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
raised in all but whatever.

410
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
It's before Crisis Bullshit.

411
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
They expand it in like some side games.

412
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,520
Yeah, it's in the Jesse mission and suddenly there's like other Avalanche cells that come

413
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,520
out to like, apparently they have some rivalry with you because like, oh, they don't like

414
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
the way we do things.

415
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Like, what are you talking about?

416
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
What is this?

417
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,960
Dude, they say, this is the fucking, this is the thing.

418
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,680
Those other ones are like paramilitary organizations.

419
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,600
But Barrett Cell is specifically called like, they're ostracized because they're too radical

420
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
is what they say.

421
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,360
And yet, we're shown that like, no, they're actually all good, like they would never hurt

422
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
anybody.

423
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,600
And so how is Barrett Cell, how is it, how are they also the ones who are too radical

424
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,360
and also the ones who are like understaffed and like have no weapons and no money?

425
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
It doesn't make sense.

426
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
It makes no sense.

427
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Like the whole point of them is that they have nothing.

428
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
They're like a startup.

429
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,760
And the worst thing about it, maybe the worst thing about it is how cucked Barrett and our

430
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,200
Avalanche guys are by being shown to be so ineffectual, even when they are able to like

431
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,880
do a little terrorism.

432
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,080
The bomb does nothing and they're robbed of all agency in the story.

433
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,200
The implication in the original game, in fact, I think they even flat out state this, when

434
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,920
you go to Cosmo Canyon, Barrett went to Cosmo Canyon as a young man early on and that's where

435
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,320
he got the idea to form Avalanche.

436
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,160
It is a grassroots organization that came up from the slums of poverty.

437
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,560
It is not a paramilitary, you know, coalition that spans the globe and has access to God.

438
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
It is now.

439
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,800
So like, I think there was a line in the original where Jesse is like, oh, I think the blasting

440
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
agent was too powerful.

441
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,840
I think I made it too powerful by mistake.

442
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,480
You know, so that was in there, but at least it was still her mistake.

443
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,520
It was her, you know, like they still did it.

444
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,800
They're still culpable for killing all these people and blowing up the reactor.

445
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,600
And now like that line is still in there in the new one.

446
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,000
In fact, they make a whole side vision audit of her like, oh, I got to go get a weaker

447
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
blasting agent because I feel guilty.

448
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Okay.

449
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,520
Well, you feel guilty, but we're going to find out later.

450
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
You didn't even do it.

451
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
It's not even your fault.

452
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
You did nothing wrong.

453
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
So what's the point?

454
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,560
And then she's a waifu, Jesse.

455
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,920
She's not allowed to do anything.

456
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,400
She's not allowed to have any character.

457
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,160
She's there to be sexualized and observed for us.

458
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,320
That's her only role.

459
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
That's all that these characters exist for.

460
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,080
And then like, and then there's the part where, like I started out praising it.

461
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Now like now that I think about it, you know, it's like you start thinking about it and

462
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
then you get more into what you hate about it.

463
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,800
Like the part where, you know, there's this slightly clumsy bit of dialogue where Tifa

464
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,680
says she feels trapped and she only says that so that later cloud can have his flashback

465
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
of her as a kid's thing.

466
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,160
If I'm ever trapped or in danger, you'll come save me.

467
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,560
And it's like that whole scene where she's going like, oh, I just feel trapped in this.

468
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't, I don't like what we're doing.

469
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,640
We're, we're going too far, you know, you know, the other characters like Jesse has

470
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,200
a line where she's like, oh, Tifa's heart's not really in it.

471
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,320
And it's like Tifa in the original game was a vengeful fucking rage fuel.

472
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
She hated Shinra.

473
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,920
Remember how they killed her family and village and, you know, her famous line when her like

474
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,600
dad is dying in the maker reactor is like, I hate Shinra.

475
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I hate Mako.

476
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I hate soldier.

477
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
I hate them all.

478
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
No, no, no, no.

479
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
She's a delicate flower, Jesse.

480
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,800
She's not allowed to be a to have anger in her heart.

481
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
She has to be pure.

482
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,480
Our thighs are too thin.

483
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
They are too thin.

484
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,600
It's little too small at times.

485
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,760
Hey, I've got, I do want to say that I do agree with your initial sentiment.

486
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
There's a lot of good stuff.

487
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
And let me say two moments.

488
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,560
I cried at exactly one time, exactly one time out of pure emotion.

489
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,160
And it was, this is, it was like the shortest scene ever, but this is always fucking, okay,

490
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
you go through the bombing mission at the beginning, right?

491
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,840
And like Barrett's such a fucking asshole piece of shit.

492
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,480
When you get home after that mission, Barrett walks in the door and Marlene runs to him.

493
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,560
I fucking burst into fucking tears.

494
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,200
I've never felt anything more.

495
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,040
Barrett and Marlene are the best part of this fucking game.

496
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,200
And you know what's sad?

497
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,560
They cut out like tons of their fucking scenes.

498
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,680
We don't even get to see them together most of the time because we've changed how the

499
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
story, whatever.

500
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,920
I mean, that's a, that's a nitpick, but I fucking love Marlene and she doesn't have

501
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
enough of a presence.

502
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
For my taste.

503
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
There's so much good in it.

504
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,920
But I just know that everything good in it is going to be sabotaged by something else

505
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
in it.

506
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
That's shitty.

507
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
You know, like, I love that.

508
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,000
Like, I love how they, like, they took so much care and attention to detail on certain

509
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
things.

510
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,960
Like they even remembered like a minor character like Johnny.

511
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,680
He's in the game for like a little, like I was like, oh my God, I can't believe it.

512
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,440
That's really cool.

513
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
But I just know he's going to come back later.

514
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,840
Yeah, he's going to come back later and fuck Tifa in front of you or something.

515
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
How exciting.

516
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,800
I was reading a little bit of developer commentary about like the original stuff and Johnny was

517
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
like in the original.

518
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,120
So there's another thing going on here.

519
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,480
Johnny was originally planned to have a larger role in the original game.

520
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,880
Okay, they couldn't add that due to like time or like things didn't work out.

521
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,440
But now that there's a remake, they like take that opportunity to expand that role.

522
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,400
I have mixed feelings about that because like, I mean, I won't get into the big spoilers

523
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
later.

524
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,840
But like whatever your plans were when you made a game originally, like I love the game

525
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,160
that you did make.

526
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,200
I don't love this game that exists in Nomura's mind that he wish he had made, you know, 23

527
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,440
years ago or whatever.

528
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,520
I don't know about that game.

529
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
I don't care about that game.

530
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,280
So that is no, that does not affect me in any justification that like, oh, new bad things

531
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,200
are in because they were planned to be in the original doesn't matter.

532
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Not important.

533
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Don't care.

534
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,680
But, you know, speaking of coloring good things with bad stuff, there was another scene

535
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I really loved.

536
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,680
Really my other favorite part of the game.

537
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,080
And it was just in the original after you save Eris from Reno and you escape, you run

538
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,360
across the rooftops.

539
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,920
I got to that scene in this game.

540
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,160
It's much longer as, excuse me, everything in this game takes a million times longer,

541
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
which is kind of annoying.

542
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,640
But it's just a simple scene of you and Eris walking along rooftops, getting to know each

543
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,480
other, kind of bonding and doing all that stuff.

544
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,200
And that scene was charming and delightful and was absolutely beautiful.

545
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,320
That was like the time I took the most time to just observe how amazing this game looks

546
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,120
and how, I mean, to be, to simply be able to pan the camera up and see the underside

547
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,000
of the MiGar plates.

548
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,560
That's like the point where I like, where I was like standing in front of the bar and

549
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,680
I was like looking around my surroundings and just taking it in and just like looking

550
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,960
up and seeing the fucking pizza in the sky.

551
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,960
And like the parts where it's unfinished and the sunlight is coming through, I'm just

552
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
like, it looks beautiful.

553
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
It looks so good.

554
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Hell yeah.

555
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,320
There are some people out there who are shitting on it because like a lot of the, I don't

556
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,160
know if you've noticed, a lot of the textures and background images are extremely grainy

557
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
and...

558
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Yeah, that's something that only the nerd would notice.

559
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I don't fucking give a shit.

560
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
I have noticed, but I don't really give a shit.

561
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,040
I mean, like the original game was like programmed to the box of matches, so.

562
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,960
I would argue that while this game...

563
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,600
Because together with Scotch tape and thumbtacks.

564
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
I mean, that's true.

565
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Since this game is trying to create a, as I said in my video years ago, a more complex

566
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
illusion.

567
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,640
Any breaks stand out more and are more jarring, but I mean, you know, whatever, who really

568
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
gives a shit.

569
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
I love the gameplay.

570
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
I don't know.

571
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Like it feels good to fight.

572
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,480
I love the little additions, like being able to level up the buster sword so that I can

573
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,800
keep using it throughout the game if I feel like, instead of like immediately having to

574
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
switch it out.

575
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
That's cool.

576
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Yeah.

577
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
That's a nice feature.

578
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
That's a nice feature.

579
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I mean, I don't know.

580
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,480
I love seeing the material on Tifa's gauntlet and cutscenes and like...

581
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,000
I gotta say, I've always wanted more of that shit and it looks really cool.

582
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,720
As a tech demo of Final Fantasy 7, I basically can have no complaints.

583
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,920
It's like the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

584
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:47,760
The one thing that I also do appreciate is that the game is literally called Final Fantasy

585
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,040
7 Remake.

586
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,720
It's on the box.

587
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,680
So there can be no believing that this is Final Fantasy 7 for anyone.

588
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,400
If you believe that it is, you're wrong and get out, except for the parts that I like

589
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,720
which are correct and good and it can't.

590
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,040
But all the parts that I like are not canon.

591
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
I mean...

592
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,720
That is a big thing, like calling it a remake.

593
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,600
One thing I've always hated, it just comes down to the Googling.

594
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,400
Like you Google the name of a thing, knowing that there is an original and a remake that

595
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:21,560
is exactly the same thing and you come up with like the thing you don't want every time.

596
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,880
You have to clarify and it's just annoying.

597
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,480
Good thing you don't have to type Final Fantasy 7 2020 or whatever to distinguish it.

598
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,560
Yeah, Sonic 06 and whatever.

599
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Yeah, there's a lot to say about this game.

600
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,280
We'll all keep coming back to say more about this game until we've all beaten it.

601
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
And then for years after.

602
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I just found it on Target.com and ordered it.

603
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,200
It'll be here in a few days and I'll be able to weigh in on it more next week.

604
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
There you go.

605
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Hell yeah.

606
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,800
Presuming that the rest of this game and the following games in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake

607
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:09,200
series are of a similar ratio of new good shit and new bad shit, would you recommend assuming

608
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
that is what you've played so far?

609
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,960
The thing about that is you are not allowed to publicly state your opinion of this game

610
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,440
as a remake until you have beaten it.

611
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
You're just not allowed.

612
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,840
Jesse you have to beat this game before you because the things that happen I mean are

613
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,320
just a note of note until somebody says yeah, play it because I have no real burning desire

614
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,160
to play Final Fantasy 7 again.

615
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,760
It was a good time but like I need to know like I need someone I trust to say yes, please.

616
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,960
I mean I feel a little bit raped because I never had an option but to play this game.

617
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,640
It literally I had no choice.

618
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,400
I had to do it, I've been abused and all I'm saying is.

619
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,920
It was like being drawn to the Earth Crater.

620
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
It's in my DNA.

621
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Reunion had to happen.

622
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
It's what this is reunion.

623
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
That's right.

624
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Oh Lord.

625
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,360
This really is reunion.

626
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,560
Is this a meta commentary Nomura?

627
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Are you trying to...

628
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,560
He's made our lives Final Fantasy 7.

629
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,200
That's the real trick to all of it.

630
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,440
Playing the original infected us with Jenova cells and they're just trying to...

631
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,480
How likely is it that the ending is going to be like explicit one way or the other what

632
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,760
happened?

633
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
What happened with what?

634
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,680
Well you know at the very end there's the last cutscene where it's like it cuts to like

635
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,640
years in the future and you don't really know whether they survived or what happened

636
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
exactly.

637
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Oh God.

638
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
No.

639
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Well first of all there's...

640
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,520
I can't say anything.

641
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,040
But I don't fucking know.

642
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
I do know.

643
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Can I make him explode?

644
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
I'm going to explode.

645
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:52,280
I do like the Sephiroth dialogue more than I thought I would even though he's you know

646
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,160
shoehorned in way earlier than he should be.

647
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,800
I mean like obviously they could not keep him a surprise like he was in the original

648
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
game.

649
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,560
That's just something that they could not replicate.

650
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,280
So I guess I understand the reasoning of like I mean like if like who doesn't know

651
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,680
who Sephiroth is like who doesn't know that he exists.

652
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,360
But I mean by that logic Jesse I mean I get like I was talking with some people about

653
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
this.

654
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,240
Final Fantasy 7 is different from other remakes because this game is like mostly known specifically

655
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,920
for its story as opposed to other games.

656
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,600
It's like it's two different games because like there's so much of it that has so much

657
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,520
attention to detail and is so clearly trying to be like a one to one representation of

658
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,880
the original game that is exactly perfect and exactly right.

659
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,000
But then there's also completely new shit and rearranged shit and stuff that's like totally

660
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
off the wall zany.

661
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,520
And it's like how are both of these philosophies coexisting in the same game.

662
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
It's Namora right.

663
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,000
That's what I would assume.

664
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah.

665
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's pretty clear.

666
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Short hand answer for everything.

667
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,680
They just felt they needed filler and you know there's some sections of the filler that

668
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,280
I don't love at all.

669
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,800
I can't help as a guy who played the original but be aware every moment of every mission

670
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,320
that I'm like like this game is just wasting my time in between story beats that I know

671
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
are there.

672
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,920
I did like the one line where Cloud like first sees this apparition of Sephiroth and he's

673
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,640
like oh I killed you and Sephiroth is like you did or something like that like oh you're

674
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
dead.

675
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
He goes that's it.

676
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,600
He goes you're dead and Sephiroth goes I am like fuck you buddy I'm right here motherfucker.

677
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,040
I wish that they would just go crazy with it and have them talk like an idiot like it's

678
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,880
me I'm fucking Sephiroth buddy fucker I'm right here you're here to fuck up your day

679
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
dude.

680
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
That'd be cool.

681
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah I mean.

682
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,000
Well I'm like I am you know I'm sure that they're going to go over the top with this

683
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,960
and make Sephiroth like totally gay for Cloud like they always do now whereas like in the

684
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,760
original game Sephiroth like didn't really give a fuck about Cloud at any point.

685
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,240
You know Sephiroth's first line in Final Fantasy 7 to Cloud on the SS Junon or whatever

686
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,840
the ship's called.

687
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,320
It's literally who are you.

688
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,960
Yeah that's his line to Cloud.

689
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,000
Cloud was literally just a grunt who got lucky.

690
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,400
He's not like Sephiroth's fated rival.

691
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,280
In what way is Cloud any more important than any of those shambling like empty husks of

692
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
clones.

693
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
He's not.

694
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,360
And that's like all Sephiroth's dialogue is like he keeps saying you're nothing you're

695
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,600
nobody special you're a puppet you're my little fucking meat puppet to do what I want

696
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,640
you suck you're not even cool bro that's this is the whole problem the meta has infected

697
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,080
the shit it's all about like destiny now and shit that's uh it's like.

698
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,400
We'll get there.

699
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,240
Hey what one other point I was I was saying how much I like that heiress like rooftop

700
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,800
exploring I just fucking hate modern games and how like you you know like you know those

701
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,400
little arrows that you walk up to so that they're like an automatic motion going down

702
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,000
a ladder takes like 10 fucking hours every time ever jumping across a little gap the

703
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,040
charm of seeing Cloud slowly balance across a fucking beam as he walks along is not enough

704
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
to justify how much of my time is being wasted in the reactor where it has that section it's

705
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,560
like okay you've got to run fast when the when the lasers are off and it's like yeah like

706
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,960
I couldn't do it because when you press run he doesn't immediately run he has to go into

707
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,360
his animation of like starting to run because it has to be like a realistic thing now and

708
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,200
it's like that kind of modern games design I hope there's not more of those fucking lasers

709
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,720
because that sucked I think the thing that felt really drawing to me playing the demo

710
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,520
at least was that like when you're not in combat like the controls are different you know like

711
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,360
because you can't like swing the sword really or do any of the like movement stuff that you do

712
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,000
in combat outside of it because in the original game you have overworld controls and then you're

713
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,560
in turn based combat and I know they're trying to replicate that but it's like at the laser part

714
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,560
I'm like man if I had my fucking dodge roll right now I could get through this a lot easier

715
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,600
you know I am I'm constantly pressing R2 to run not realizing there's still an enemy on the screen

716
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,360
and it goes into like the tactical menu and it's just like a little thing around every time I'm

717
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,640
like god damn it I wanted to run that's just another really annoying thing the way like one of the

718
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,520
reasons I love Kingdom Hearts 2 so much is that like you're you do the same things all the time

719
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,320
there's no like in combat you do different stuff the control scheme is consistent and when you use

720
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,720
like a dry form or whatever like all you do is you get new abilities you haven't lost anything

721
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,200
why that like that gets changed in Kingdom Hearts 3 where you just like swap out movesets

722
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,280
why do video games still have a dedicated run button when the analog stick has been around for

723
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,120
literally 20 years well it's a sprint button in this case but I'd get what you said why do that

724
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,560
like why bother like why not just I mean I would assume you know I mean I was thinking about this

725
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,480
the other day like like um you know you push the stick to move and like why is there a slow

726
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,280
movement like why do you have to get running shoes in Pokemon there's no reason to walk yeah um

727
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:01,600
but I I've realized that I mean in certain small situations certain smaller areas where you need to

728
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,480
walk a short distance between things you don't want to overshoot it all the time that's true being

729
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,960
able to walk is useful I would rather have a Tom's point about the analog stick solves that yeah if

730
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,240
you just tilt it a little bit as opposed to the thing it's it's it's easier to just push the

731
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,880
direction all the way than it is to like but like it's not like it's not like daintily in the remake

732
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,000
you have because you're always gonna want to the thing is like in the remake you it's not like

733
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,320
you're running you're walking and running it's that you're running and then running a little bit

734
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,200
faster I mean that's it's very strange hey you know the only game the only game I recall that is silly

735
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,680
that did this well I was playing for my banjo video I was playing a little game called banjo

736
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,360
twoy in order to get this one jiggy there's a sleeping plant that you got to like really slow

737
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,440
creep up on for like an extended period of time and it was actually I was playing on an emulator

738
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,520
and it was like it was like literally impossible I had to remap the entire controller to get it to

739
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,520
work I was looking around apparently that's like a very common issue with that sequence of the game

740
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,600
but yeah you walk slow which is a little creepo sneak no noise animation you get the jiggy and

741
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:12,720
I was like this is the best game ever banjo twoy remake featuring genesis remember when uh in the

742
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,040
banjo twoy remake gruntilda came down and said uh banjo I will never be a memory I shall give you

743
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,920
despair banjo I loved that oh god the fucking the literal feathers that cloud keeps seeing

744
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:35,760
oh enough with the literal feathers I hate birds I hate birds man I hate birds the fucking wing

745
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,080
shit is this I hate it I've always hated it I'll always hate it you didn't have a fucking wing

746
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,680
one winged angel is not a literal fucking aspect of his character it's like a metaphorical it sounds

747
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,240
spooky like name of his fucking theme song he doesn't have to have a fucking wing I just like

748
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,480
the point it again sephiroth was literally never a one winged angel even in the original game what

749
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,560
he had was one arm got replaced with a wing when he turned into safer sephiroth for one fight and

750
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,960
that became he was like a weird judaeo christian like 15 winged angel yeah and it was fucking

751
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,800
based it was fucking sick why doesn't he turn to that instead of pull out his wing all the time

752
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,080
safer sephiroth fucking ruled but uh fucking whatever fucking new sephiroth always pulling

753
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:29,760
out his wing when no one wants to see it stupid ass I hate no thing but a chicken wing I'm gonna

754
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,400
fry that chicken wing sephiroth anyway Jesse you gotta let me know when you beat this game I would

755
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm very eager to hear what you think you should do a video like a double I I've been recording

756
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,960
all my gameplay so I that's no doubt do something with it I I've been doing the PlayStation when I

757
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,280
see something happen that I'm like oh that made me smile and then I see another and I'm like oh

758
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,760
that made me fall into deep depression yeah do a snap that little shit thanks PlayStation for the

759
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,800
players speaking of speaking of PlayStation games I've been playing a better game than Final Fantasy

760
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,040
impossible uh Ratchet and Clank 2 I've been streaming it non-stop every single day I love

761
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,320
Ratchet and Clank 2 how's that going yeah it's going great I for the first time I've decided to 100

762
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,080
percent complete it doing all of the the special skill point things and and uh you know there's a

763
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,960
lot of secret shit in those games a lot of good stuff to find yeah I mean like compared to modern

764
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,040
games there's not like hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of millions of like checklists like

765
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,840
get 100 well yeah uh fucking it's what's known as a good game not a bad game yes it's a game that

766
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,320
has the no fluff in it and everything is good um and the combat's great and I've just been I've

767
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,200
had in the time of my life playing old video games hey why would you why would you ever need to play

768
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,760
a new video game what is the why do people spend money when Ratchet and Clank 2 already exists

769
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,960
because people don't want to spend time uh like analyzing what game would actually be like most

770
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,360
satisfying or enjoyable for them they just want the zeitgeist to present them with a new thing

771
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,480
to get on board with which I don't blame them for I mean people love being part of the zeitgeist

772
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,640
we were talking about that a few episodes ago like yeah people just love to be in the know

773
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,480
even if they don't give a shit or maybe it wasn't on the episode I was talking about this on

774
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,080
my stream on GibbonGaming.com youtube.com slash Gibbon Gaming where you can go and watch all

775
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,280
those streams they're all titled the same because I don't care and it's it's hard to understand

776
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:43,040
which part comes first um but um like the the the idea that um people will get into media more

777
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,600
so to be part of a conversation than they would to like enrich their lives or entertain themselves

778
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,280
uh like generally speaking if there's a new thing and everyone's talking about it you're like well

779
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,200
I I guess I should and you do it even though there's better things that you could be doing

780
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,120
and you know there are there's always like a big backlog of like the greatest things ever made

781
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,960
that you haven't got around to yet but it's not it's not culturally relevant right now

782
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,880
that sucks to give people to give people a little bit of credit like it's not purely malicious at

783
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,800
least from the consumer side because a lot of people they're just they just you know things are

784
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,160
just presented and they're like yeah sure okay I mean I'll watch that so it's not you know it's

785
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:33,280
just a product of the way we live I just like you know there's been like um some reservation uh of

786
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,200
like playing the same game over and over again forever like I only play like 20 games and they're

787
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:46,400
all ps2 games and then sometimes it's Dark Souls it's like I I'm I'm missing out on all of these

788
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,040
great experiences but I'm also having a lot of fun and I don't really care so I don't know how to

789
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,920
feel about it hmm yeah I don't know everyone's just got to decide how they want to live and what

790
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,720
they want to do you know there's nothing wrong with playing the same game over and over your whole

791
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,880
life because I mean you know how much will your life real will your fucking soul level up if you

792
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,160
play more games versus playing the same games to a degree sure it'll give you more experience

793
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,000
but these things are all fairly arbitrary in what you do with your life anyways I was just

794
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,200
thinking about it because it's like if you personally are bored then obviously try something new

795
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:30,400
um yep but like I just am able I mean I can't play the same game like multiple times in a row

796
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,760
all the way through but there's a health there's like a enough games in my like nostalgia rotation

797
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,640
I can just sort of loop back around and doing doing you know I played Okami recently yeah

798
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,440
I told him I know you've beaten that I think I just did a few days ago it was fucking sick

799
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,800
what do you think uh it was fucking great it's the best Zelda game ever made

800
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,760
because it's actually fun and not gay and formulaic and like it it obscures the formulaic nature of

801
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,840
the Zelda format in a way that's much more fun and you can like zendots things and slice them in

802
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:12,960
half and the brush techniques are all fucking lit the game looks gorgeous uh the puzzles aren't like

803
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,720
overly obtuse or annoying except for some of them what we need is an Okami remake in HD like you

804
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,840
know you know we just need to no no no I mean like we need to remake the game like fix the stuff that

805
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,560
was bad like the art style for example we need realism we need realism we got to get rid of

806
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,880
the game the game unironically was originally going to be a realistic style you go when you

807
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,880
beat the game you unlock the original alpha trailer and it was a realistic game yeah and then they

808
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,640
changed it at some point that is amazing I gotta go check that out sometime there was another

809
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,120
trailer that you unlock for beating the game where uh there's like another older build of the game

810
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,560
where the reflector that Amaterasu carries around is like a fucking cannon and you just like fight

811
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,200
all these other guys and blow shit up I was like I want to play this bill what the fuck that does

812
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,600
look sick and then if you dig back far enough you find the true alpha version of the game

813
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,200
simply known as road toads and things would just expand from there yeah think about it they're

814
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,720
very similar a little thing rides a bigger thing that moves it around how is that not road toads I

815
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,160
ask you it's the same game yeah you soon looked a little different in road toads it was a toad

816
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:24,000
it all worked out in the end yeah okami's great uh it's so good I loved it and uh I'm really mad

817
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,400
that I was 12 demon fangs away from s ranking the entire game without even realizing I had no

818
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,880
ideas being ranked on my performance could you not go back and just get those to achieve an s

819
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,360
rank perhaps I don't know well if you know the save file you probably can yeah but it's just like

820
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,200
the joy of like just accidentally s ranking the game on your first playthrough that makes sense

821
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,880
it's just this that serendipitous moment was just taken away from me and uh I'll never forgive myself

822
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,760
for such dismal failure alas alas there's so many fun ways to play a game speed running trying to s

823
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,440
rank everything I don't know just being a yeah I feel like idiot not even beating the story playing

824
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,800
playing a game over and over again I think it's like a precursor to trying to speed run it like I

825
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,240
tried to speed run retching clank 2 to get to the new game plus where like the game is actually

826
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,440
a lot better because they have the bolt multiplier yeah if you if you don't get hit you can multiply

827
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,640
the bolts you get and you get times 20 and then you get a load of money and then you're rich and

828
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,680
buy loads of guns um but like speed running is hard and I couldn't do it but I did manage to beat

829
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,680
the whole game like in six hours on stream so that's not bad wait okami no no no retching

830
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,720
clank 2 and I got to the new game plus and I've been streaming that at a reasonable pace getting

831
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,880
all the skill points uh yeah I'm thinking of doing like once I've done that I'll do retching

832
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,560
clank 3 do the exact same thing and then I'll do jack and dexter jack 2 jack 3 and then slide 2

833
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,160
slide 3 and I'll just be like a playstation stream boy hell yeah it's it's it's the perfect

834
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,640
version of like what hypocrites should have been it's not like hypocrite was just my excuse to play

835
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,080
these games again and analyze them and figure out why why they're so cool and explain to people

836
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,000
why they're cool but I realized while streaming that I can do that analysis on the fly with examples

837
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,880
so it's it's just a lot easier to just play the game and then say oh this bit this is right

838
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,080
and here's why uh and then like oh this part is bullshit and here's why although I do go on a lot

839
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:34,160
of like um angry rants when it's not actually bullshit uh because I'm like a rager I'm like a

840
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,240
rage gamer I'm a big rage quit guy and I love that about myself it's the coolest thing about me

841
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:47,520
is that I rage quit things and I and I say no I respect it greatly it's fucking cool yeah

842
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,680
that's sick dude that's sick you should title them slightly more and uh informationally so that

843
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,920
anyone can discern one from the other just a little you should title them less informationally you

844
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,920
should title them like just like strings of shit you should title them uh in some way so that when

845
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,520
I go to your homepage the names form like some ascii art thing that I can you know put the pieces

846
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,520
it's like a big smiley face you should just title them video game one video game two video game

847
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:25,760
footage just no parts just video game every single video human person plays video game on stream

848
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:35,280
yeah but he's also sounds great god I I want to be done with this fucking remake so bad I

849
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,240
want to just set me free I've got probably 10 hours to go at least oh god I'm at the uh I'm at

850
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,720
the pillar falling part right now when I was going down you know I started playing like a second run

851
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,800
of resident evil 3 right before like this came out yeah because like and like like you said like

852
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,840
you play it more and you get faster at it it's like a precursor to the speed running so like I'm

853
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,640
playing at the second time and realizing that like I complained about it being too short originally

854
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,040
it's even shorter than I thought now that I know where everything is I'm just like I'm done with it

855
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,400
in five minutes then I'm like and I'm like oh my god should I play it again to get this stupid

856
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,240
like extra knife and this stupid unlimited sorry if I don't even want it I don't even want to like

857
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,160
what is the point of these of these power-ups for a game I don't even want to play anymore I'm just

858
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,600
like by the end of it I was like please Final Fantasy 7 remake deliver me from this set me free

859
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:34,080
from resident evil 3 even if you're bad so is there any upside to playing it again have you

860
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,840
discovered any joys you missed no it was bullshit they gave you like you get like store points to

861
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,200
like buy like these meaningless upgrades but all the upgrades suck and the one that I bought was like

862
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:52,240
for like 7 000 points it's like a hot knife and it's like oh this sick yeah this hot knife

863
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:59,760
this hot knife will carve through but zombies like fucking butter yeah bro speaking of speaking of

864
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,840
store points uh have you seen this shit by any chance have you uh uh you better need not lay a

865
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:12,080
finger on my butter finger says cloud strife in canon of Final Fantasy 7 remake by two participating

products upload your receipt and score unique dlc for the Final Fantasy 7 remake an exclusive ps4

867
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,320
dynamic theme container I saw an image of this I thought it was a joke it was just an image of

868
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:29,840
you get dlc bro finger next to him as much as I can see cloud being a butter finger guy I don't

869
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:36,960
approve of this anyways he's just sort of like staring at you like you're gonna buy one it's

870
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,800
just his default art from like the fucking by the and jesse jesse I don't know if this perplexes you

871
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,760
for decades I have been continually vexed by the fact that every fucking incarnation of cloud

872
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,480
strife has his fucking uniform a different color yes is it purple is it blue is it black he

873
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,760
literally looks black here in the game he usually looks blue sometimes it's a little purple just

874
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,560
making purple it's like it's like there are times when like the lighting you look at it like oh I

875
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,200
guess that almost kind of looks purple or blue baby but then the rest of the time it looks black

876
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,320
depend you know it's like just settle on a color just make it purple it was always purple the original

877
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,400
purple is an unrealistic color jesse it's not too unrealistic we can't have that in the game it's

878
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,240
that's hokey 90s purple it's not purple it's just so fucking unrealistic but that spiky hair that

879
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,040
defies gravity that's the realism I want to go back to the 90s I miss when things were colorful

880
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:41,280
and fun and cool what happened it wasn't even like downplayed purple or cloth purple it was just

881
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,720
bright one solid brick of a color purple the whole game no matter what the lighting was inside

882
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,280
outside didn't matter always so retarded that you had a main character just wearing this giant

883
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,120
purple fucking jumpsuit I fucking loved it uh you know what gives me like more joy I'll just

884
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,520
be walking along and in the distance I will see it's almost like character designs like standing

885
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,640
out and being cool like is good in a video game I just see the little bit of it's it's this it's

886
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,000
this one thing the red on Tifa's gloves I don't know why I get such emotional comfort by seeing

887
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,840
that there's like some color on Tifa's design yes it's just that beautiful red color everything

888
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,640
else is like realistic and gritty and like low color but the bright red they toned it down too

889
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,200
there used to be more but just something about that it makes me happy imagine imagine it's like

890
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,240
Naruto with this big orange jumpsuit it was like remade and he had like a like a light brown

891
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,480
sort of like a leather coat remakes her mistake bro remakes like oh it's more realistic he blends

892
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,920
in the dark he's like no Naruto is stupid he needs to be he's a fucking idiot that that it forms

893
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,160
his character almost that he's so stupid that he wears yeah that's a question yellow that's a

894
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:02,240
thing to ponder does cloud wearing purple do anything for his character well and not really

895
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,680
not really know although it's always been weird to me that okay just in the even in the original

896
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,480
we see other soldiers specifically only they are like enemies in battle sometimes you will

897
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,520
occasionally fight like soldier third class soldier second class maybe even first class I

898
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,360
can't remember or not if those are an enemy somewhere they they're wearing like blue and

899
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:28,160
red if I remember you like never see another purple wearing soldier except for Zach so I did I

900
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:33,600
don't know did cloud steal his clothes why is what is Zach wear purple I don't know uh like

901
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,840
that's one of those things that's like that's a detail that's in his head I assume that's the

902
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,120
I just assume that like if it is like a part of his memory is like uh Zach likes purple and then

903
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:51,920
so cloud also does maybe well it seems like the the soldier's first class we're just told look

904
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,240
there's kind of a uniform that you can wear but you can pretty much dress however the hell you

905
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:03,120
want Sephiroth you can get away with with dressing like a outer space biker I don't give a shit you

906
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,760
know which is cool yeah I mean that that would make sense to me it's just that I mean guys guys

907
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,520
guys we need to make a remake to answer this question why the fuck uh okay you know what it

908
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,360
doesn't matter it's been retconned he literally wears blue now uh as did all the fucking soldiers

909
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,040
in crisis corps which thank god that game came into existence and you know made Zach the literal

910
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,480
plot device that he was into the I do not understand why people love Zach so much I don't

911
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,360
fucking understand it I love Zach before you were fucking born you piece of shit and I loved him for

912
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,680
the right reasons yeah and in fact I loved him less when crisis corps came out because crisis corps

913
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,160
was lame and stupid and made because they flanderized him to fucking hell they made him like literally

914
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:52,320
Jesus and like angel wings and shit god it you look like you look like you're a guy who hates thing

915
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:58,320
when you have any kind of like criticism of thing and they like it's like oh we're the heroes man

916
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:05,360
we're the fucking heroes who want more good fucking what's his face being a god but no I

917
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,920
fuck you you're stupid if you like if you like crisis corps you are stupid what are you what are

918
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,320
you fucking hey hey guys what are you going on hashtag just slurping I got pasta remember remember

919
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,160
when you did that during the buster cast and all the half the comments are just like Ben why are you

920
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:28,080
doing I I did hear about that literally what one comment one comment was like wait a minute I

921
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,240
cannot listen to this because there's a yeah there are like two comments on that video when I look

922
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,200
at guys I've got I've got an update oh this is fascinating uh okay I was slightly wrong about

923
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,240
this I'm looking back at the enemy design of finalized seven characters and we can see because

924
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,840
there are soldier enemies that you fight in places you fight I found it at the very least

925
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,760
there's a soldier third class and a soldier first class that are like fodder enemies you know obviously

926
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,040
the first class is like a late game enemy or whatever are they like the soldier first classes

927
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,680
they do wear purple and brown boots exactly as cloud wears basically you're talking about the

928
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,960
file fancy seven original yeah here look at this look at this right here yeah but are those like

929
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,320
soldier or are all those like soldiers you know like this is a wikipedia entry for soldier first

930
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,280
as a soldier first class which you fight sector eight when you return to midgar later in the game

931
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,960
and there you fucking go it looks just like I mean they're a little darker but that's that's

932
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,320
clouds costume yeah that's fucking clouds outfit weird there you go that guy I yeah I don't remember

933
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,960
you do fight a couple of soldiers man I really like soldier soldier itself is one of the most

934
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,280
undeveloped fucking things in final fantasy seven and they thought that crisis core was like the

935
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,800
right way to flesh it out it was not it was not the right way to flesh it out uh they fucked it

936
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,200
like a daytime soap it was like the most homo erotic like weird pansy shit it was just like

937
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,360
this constant like like the whole the entire game soundtrack is just wonderwall being played

938
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,640
like drunkenly in the background while all these characters are soliloquizing that's that's that's

939
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,600
soliloquizing that's a word that's that's a sick remix of non non biori and wonderwall which I will

940
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,120
put in the links down below and you should listen to it because it's great uh every fine okay you

941
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,840
make a game everybody loves it then you make a sequel and you have to take the things that the

942
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:19,040
people loved and you make them like way more important than they ever were intended to be

943
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,000
originally because the meta has infected your story holy shit soliloquize is a word

944
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:34,960
soliloquize I knew I was fucking smart ah whatever soliloquize well it just sounded so wrong coming

945
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:41,360
out of me like I've never actually spoken the verb of soliloquy before hey you know what else

946
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:46,000
is beautiful I you remember the fucking hard edge remember the hard edge from final master seven

947
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,400
which is that weird ass fucking sword which is like a blunt tip yeah it kind of fans out and it's

948
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,280
got sick ass kanji on it that I don't know what it means but it's fucking cool that that hey guess

949
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,960
what that weapon it's in the game uh it's cool I love final fantasy seven uh just looking at it

950
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,880
makes me happy this whole game is kind of you know that really hd like incredibly sexy designed

951
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,360
that like some girl did of tifa that like leaked onto the internet somewhere as like her fucking

952
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,840
senior project that should have been this whole game one in the game I mean it's so much better I

953
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,920
mean it's incredibly hot it's pretty sexualized so I get why they wouldn't use it but like the whole

954
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,560
game has a lot of just that it's just that making things real making it amazing uh and making it

955
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,400
fucking 3d texture I can see the fabric like a little like

956
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,960
bestiary and like read about all the little enemies you fight and like the assessment area

957
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,200
being like more robust and like having little paragraphs just a little paragraph about everything

958
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:47,440
I fight is so cool and adds so much to it wait are you get do you guys think the final fantasy

959
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,800
seven remake is good we've been we've been debating that we amongst ourselves it is a very complicated

960
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:58,160
issue Ben I think even you Ben if you played it to simply be able to control okay after the

961
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:04,000
fucking two hours of mandatory scripted scenes of literally like not gameplay when you finally get

962
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,480
to like seventh heaven and you look around town you see tifa and you look up at the plates of

963
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,520
midgar and you're like holy shit they made this real it's like I think it's almost impossible to

964
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,520
not be stunned it's so good in every way except that it's filled with dumb bullshit that sucks

965
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,400
Ben I will be I would love to regale you with the tales of the massive failures of the game

966
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:32,320
you are telling me does not sound cool at all you really you think so yeah well if you if I like

967
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:38,880
fan art of things I like fan art of final fantasy seven I I enjoy such things as as fan art this

968
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,440
game is like the best fan art ever made I think we're just an agreement here that like just seeing

969
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,280
the stuff is in itself a cool experience but like there's an internal war going on inside me every

970
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,720
second I'm playing between what sucks and what's cool I don't want to be unfair and I even want to

971
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,640
give them credit that like a lot of it can be annoying and just gets in the way and I don't

972
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,360
think the dialogue is particularly well written overall but there are moments of just like chilling

973
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,920
in this world with like a little bit of ambient dialogue that does just make shit feel fucking

974
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,560
real like what I've always wanted the child I can't deny there are two wolves and one wolf

975
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:20,080
sucks and one wolf doesn't suck and which one is stronger is the one you feed one wolf is cringe

976
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:25,280
and the other is base exactly that's right and then they found it wrong I don't know I guess I'd

977
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,560
have to see it but I hope there's there's issues oh boy none of us have yet beaten the game so like

978
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,840
well I've heard and I've seen much of the the ending and what they do with it I'm waiting to see

979
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:46,000
sex bathtub scene I don't know yet I I don't want to spoil it but I mean well okay I'll just say

980
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,080
that's gone no that that's gone they cut that now there is other extremely homoerotic things

981
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:57,200
happening so like I'm sure many will be satisfied but that particular thing is not in the game

982
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,480
you know that's what I like I want I want good old-fashioned physical homoeroticism not lame

983
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,960
emotional homoeroticism like in crisis bro they've got the worst of all worlds they've got anime

984
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:14,240
homoeroticism I saw a clip or a gift or something of like going to like buy panties so that cloud

985
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:20,880
can be sexy for don something and he can wear this the women's underwear and it's like okay

986
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,320
lol you didn't do that there's definitely other stuff walking around a wall market in general

987
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:33,760
like again as a tech demo is like holy shit this is like this is amazing to see the fucking lights

988
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,240
and see Don Cornio's mansion and I don't know meet the amazing donut steel new OCs that have been

989
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:47,600
added I mean that part sucks but uh I don't know it's it there's so much going on in my brain

990
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:54,880
when I play this game it really is like very painful does does it feel like Final Fantasy 7

991
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,360
at times it really does at times it absolutely does at other times no at other times no it

992
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:06,640
does not um I mean we talked about it for a while but like when like there's a new soldier third

993
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,360
class guy who just comes in and is the most like advent children like retarded OC over the top crisis

994
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:19,280
core motherfucker that guy fucking sucks the fight with him was fun but you know the combat's a

995
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,720
separate thing that guy sucks uh was annoying oh and of course I mean they fucking introduced the

996
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:30,080
motorcycle chase stuff early on yeah man Final Fantasy 7 had so many like amazing one-off little

997
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,360
minigames yeah playing through that game is it's like holy shit like a new minigame just

998
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,320
unlike apropos fucking nothing it never uses the same trick like more times than it needs to

999
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,800
you know most of them it only happens once you know and if you want to do them again you go to the

1000
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,160
yeah the gold saucer as a containment area for like replaying minigames you loved so cool just

1001
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,400
snowboarding oh my god I love snowboarding in that fucking game yesterday could ever possibly imagine

1002
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,880
because there's young which makes them automatically stupid and capable of forming thoughts but just

1003
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,480
try you know to imagine you know you're playing a game and you think the game is just this for like

1004
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,680
12 hours and then all of a sudden out of nowhere there's a crazy cool motorcycle chase that you've

1005
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,040
never seen before in a video game in your life because it's a PlayStation one and the graphics

1006
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,760
are mind-blowing to you and you know then you go out and you think like okay this whole game takes

1007
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,240
place in a city and then you get out of the city and you go what the hell there's a whole planet

1008
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,840
to explore what not in this game baby not in this fucking game there is one city to explore

1009
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,920
you know I feel like a lot of people I'm definitely gonna talk about that when I make a video but

1010
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,600
like I feel like a lot of people will say things like like okay modern games are filled with like

1011
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:45,680
basically what you guys are describing here like like busy work and like side stuff you don't have

1012
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,240
to do like I played darts in this game I thought that was pretty fun I enjoyed the little dart

1013
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,680
minigame and I won and I got a little prize for it that was cool but I don't know it's I guess it's

1014
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,320
hard to articulate but it's just a matter of like context it's probably the fact that like

1015
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,680
Final Fantasy 7 as a game originally is so consistent in that there's like two modes of

1016
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,800
operation you're running around talking to people or you're in combat it's super consistent

1017
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:17,360
nothing any deviation from that felt like a side quest they were side quests the game was packed

1018
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,840
with side quests but none of it felt like you're just going to some point on a map that says like

1019
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:27,200
oh this activates a quest Jesse you tell me you tell me you enjoyed going to hunt those fucking rats

1020
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,760
as a side mission in this game you can't you can't tell me you enjoyed that I actually like it forced

1021
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,840
a laugh out of me like a like a snide contemptuous laugh because like it's so generic every RPG

1022
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,880
you start out with a rat mission at the beginning like they had generic is the keyword yeah for these

1023
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:49,120
additions and like oh don't you love meeting this amazing cast of characters of like nameless

1024
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:53,680
shop owner number one yeah I don't know I didn't hate those you know there's a there's another big

1025
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:59,120
veneer here and it's just another modern games thing I fucking hate voice acting I just want it

1026
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,920
gone I just wanted gone from all games I don't give a fuck if you need voice acting to get attached

1027
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,480
to a game it literally makes it worse because then I can hear these terrible English voice actors

1028
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,320
just give me text I can fill in the blanks I don't need voices yeah when it when it's when it's

1029
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:20,160
voice acting genuine question has voice acting ever made a game better well okay such a thing

1030
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,720
is good performances do exist Metal Gear Solid okay it is a game famous for its voice actor

1031
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:33,680
okay um I'll give you that one okay some games it makes sense other games it does not I would

1032
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:39,280
argue that because this game has such a retarded story and has so many fucking weird stupid plot

1033
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,200
details and they insist on shoving so many characters in our faith I have actually war

1034
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:49,200
men or memories of many of like remember when cloud went into like in the sector seven slums

1035
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,920
next to seventh heaven you walk into a house and there's like that section where it's like cloud

1036
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:59,040
lecturing those guys on like how to fight like what combat is there's a lot of really funny

1037
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,760
dialogue laced in there about cloud being cocky those guys being like teach a sensei like come on

1038
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:12,640
bro teaches what to do as text I like all that stuff when it's voiced it feels forced and overdone

1039
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:18,160
and annoying and I'm gonna I'm gonna disagree with you I I agree with the spirit of your argument

1040
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:24,400
but but I think I'm in the camp of in this game so far I've thought I've been very very impressed

1041
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,280
by the voice casting and acting and the dialogue I think it's all been really good I mean like

1042
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,000
whoever the name is who's playing Tifa like as soon as I heard her talk I'm like oh my god that

1043
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,360
sounds good like that sounds how I'd want her to sound whereas I think before she was played by

1044
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,360
Christy Carlson Romano and Advent Children and it just sounded like a girl you know but she

1045
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,120
sounds like she's got some years lived in her you know she sounds like she's got some city miles

1046
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:57,200
and I suppose I know what you mean and like Barrett I think is perfect I think like he nails

1047
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,360
like the Barrett being tough but he also nails the Barrett being sweet with his daughter and stuff

1048
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,520
and like you can buy that this character has like a heart exterior and has a good heart

1049
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,720
kind of like my favorite character I mean I've always fucking loved Barrett he's just

1050
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,240
wonderful to see although he's legitimately scary sometimes he kind of scares me because he's so big

1051
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:25,040
and I fear black men you know just across the board I'm assuming that cloud is still Steve

1052
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,040
Burton like he's been for years I think he's really good in this game better if it is the same

1053
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:35,520
guy it comes off like it's a lot better in this game I don't know and like this the dialogue to me

1054
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:42,000
for the most part feels like real people talking and it's better than I thought it would be and like

1055
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,640
I said it takes an immediate nosedive as soon as crisis course shows up on his fucking motorcycle

1056
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,880
you know just to be clear none of my complaint I mean I don't know I think a lot of it is kind of

1057
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,840
generically anime like dub voice stuff like I tried to do in Japanese I was like I can't tell

1058
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,640
these fucking gooks are saying fuck this shit I went back to English the one the one that I don't

1059
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:07,200
like as much though is wedge I oh I liked wedge he had like a unique kind of raspy yeah he sounds

1060
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:13,520
like a like a really like a sweet little fat boy um but I don't like I don't like that all of his

1061
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,880
dialogue is about being fat well I was going to say the problem is the writing not the voice

1062
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,120
yeah that's the one area where I'm like can't wedge say something different besides

1063
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:29,440
flanderization I mean I I don't know if you agree but I would start like flanderization is the theme

1064
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,920
of this game is it really flanderization in wedges case because he didn't actually say much of

1065
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,040
anything in the original okay no I was gonna say he has always been like a silly character who wasn't

1066
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:43,680
that serious so that that's fair he was always like a cloud fanboy so they got that aspect oh you

1067
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,280
know what actually I take it back because he has there's more to him just being fat but I thought

1068
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,200
they were laying it on a little bit thick with the constant I'm running on empty guys I need pizza

1069
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,320
and my fat little piggy belly but it's so relatable though but it's a symptom of the disease and

1070
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:05,680
quota whatever of because there's just more stuff characters need to say because we need to give them

1071
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,000
more lines like the writers are sitting there like okay what do we got for wedge like what can we

1072
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,240
have this guy say and they just think we know one thing and one thing alone about wedge that he's fat

1073
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,760
we this is why we have like the design bible right you're flipping you got like

1074
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,520
character sketches and like bios is written in like wedge it's just blank they're like

1075
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,720
scrambled to come up with some something to say about them you know I think Ben you I bet you

1076
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:36,720
would agree with me look this is the thing kumars and waifu heads are gonna fucking love this shit

1077
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:44,400
I hate it what and it is exactly how I believe it's that how much they have cranked up Jesse's

1078
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:51,040
obsession with cloud oh my god she is so fucking thirsty oh didn't she just like damn did she just

1079
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:57,360
like I okay honestly I don't really remember what Jesse was like are you she oh I remember like him

1080
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:02,000
or did she just like think he was yes because he was like really strong she did she did like him she

1081
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,880
was flirty and she was kind of like a klutz all of that is in the game but there's like a lot more

1082
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,440
of the first thing that's what I'm saying about flanderization they're they were like in their

1083
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,040
design bible what do we know about Jesse like okay she was kind of the smart one okay we can keep

1084
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,640
that also she loves cloud well this is advent children writing boys let's crank that shit up to 11

1085
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,560
she worship is the fucking ground he walks on she's so into him instantly I was like I was like

1086
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:33,120
Jesse it makes her pathetic yeah at a certain point I was like okay why is she this thirsty

1087
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,040
and then like there is kind of like a line that lampshades it a little bit where wedge is like

1088
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,800
hey cloud uh just so you know don't fall for it she just likes to fuck with guys

1089
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:45,040
you know I'm like I don't know wedge maybe she just likes to fuck with you because that might be

1090
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:51,280
believable if we if we ever saw her flirt with another man ever at any point but we don't and

1091
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:57,760
there's only directly apart where it's like one character's like oh uh bigs is pretty neurotic

1092
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:03,040
and like the next time you see bigs he's like sweeping outside of his house like doing like

1093
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,280
you're gonna rabbit from Winnie the Pooh shit like yeah like he wasn't doing anything neurotic

1094
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,440
before that line but then someone said it and now it's like oh don't yes I am now that you

1095
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:18,880
mentioned it I'm sweeping the dirt outside my house for some reason I did think I oh boy I did

1096
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,480
really like I mean she's not just flirty they did try to make more to her I really like the

1097
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,680
mission going to her house bro I want to be an actress I fucking hated it I hate it all oh my

1098
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:36,080
god I loved just like I liked how that was the moment where cloud started to warm up because he

1099
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,920
sneaks into the house and he sees her dad with mako poisoning mako poisoning if I can whatever

1100
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:47,200
I'm calling it mako I don't give a shit exactly mako poisoning and so then you know you're talking

1101
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,960
to bigs and wedge outside and there's that scene where they're walking down the street just kind

1102
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,680
of talking about her upbringing and how she came to join avalanche and you can you can see that cloud

1103
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,920
is like kind of like understanding and like relating to the mako poisoning stuff because

1104
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,480
like he's bent through all kinds of like mako infusions shit as we'll find out more of later

1105
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,360
and he's just like yeah okay and it's like I like I love that little scene it was like really kind of

1106
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,400
heartwarming and like kind of like uh like as like you know the fucking Stephen King or the boys

1107
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,520
in the woods they find the body you know it was like that kind of feeling and I was like yeah

1108
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,480
I like this so they I don't know maybe they'll flesh her out even more but I like the flushing

1109
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:30,400
you know I didn't hate it but let's not forget there's that section and then the roche like

1110
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,400
thing happens immediately afterward I know everything good that I want to say it's don't

1111
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,680
forget then then that guy shows up and and the other thing is I have to weigh that okay we get

1112
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,680
some additional characterization of Jesse I think it okay it's it's okay I don't I don't hate it

1113
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,880
instantly but I mean it's filled with like dialogue of of wedge bill oh my belly's so full of the

1114
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:55,360
midgar special pizza I want to eat a whole pizza myself just see oh please uh but the and then

1115
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,360
I'm weighing that at every moment in my head which I think is totally fair to do

1116
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,520
versus you know what happened in the original cloud went to sleep and then we got to the next

1117
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,480
reactor mission and it was fucking sick uh and like I'm just thinking like I could be doing that

1118
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,200
right now I could be moving the plot forward I could be you know I don't know I like to have

1119
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:25,280
the time to breathe and like walk around the slums and do the side missions I had plenty as it was

1120
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:31,840
but I get your point just watched gun buster and die buster and been once again reminded

1121
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:39,200
that shorter is always better there's never a time when a story can be made longer and better

1122
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:48,160
you have to choose one uh yeah I don't know um the idea that like oh they just they just expanded

1123
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,640
all these character traits and like made it last a lot longer is kind of like oof I don't know about

1124
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,560
that I don't know about that you gotta ask the quite like so they're expanding them they're

1125
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,160
filling in more detail who's writing that dialogue to what end and I I mean my general argument would

1126
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:07,040
be like overall it's not worth it they're not adding enough to these characters to justify

1127
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,360
like they kind of have to because like that that's another it's a totally separate thing

1128
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:16,880
once it was decided they were making a game out of a tenth of a game they had to fill that time

1129
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,840
so there like was no option so like you can fucking game gonna be bro they haven't told us

1130
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,880
anything about that no one knows it's totally a mystery but I can tell you that this game

1131
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:32,480
encompasses about four hours of the original out of like a 40 50 hour game that's you know

1132
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:40,160
a tenth of the runtime I can't I can't fucking wait till the ps6 comes out so I can finally buy

1133
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,800
Final Fantasy 7 remake complete edition on four discs won't that be fun well it's gonna be really fun

1134
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,120
when the initial parts look terrible compared to the end parts and it you know yeah well thanks

1135
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,600
they'll have to remake the remake well I'm glad Square Enix figured out how they're gonna stay

1136
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:00,000
afloat for the next 20 years I I mean I still I still insist okay economic times are you actually

1137
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
can't wait for Nate Nate at the ripe old age of 50 recording his podcast about the end of Final Fantasy

1138
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,600
7 I'll be there baby I'll be there you know I've got a little story to tell just to put a cap on this

1139
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:17,600
well first of all I don't um uh I I think given what I know about the end of this game I I think

1140
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,960
by prediction will come true that I think sales for volume two or whatever it's called will be

1141
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,520
nothing compared this game has been very successful of course it has yeah I think that the next one

1142
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:33,120
will not be similar what what if they just like they sold the first one it was wildly successful

1143
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,840
but they're like okay but the sequel will never be as successful so we're just we're just they might

1144
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,880
just gonna call it here they might know what I would not even blame them or be surprised if they

1145
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:49,840
did that not at all not at all uh but here's my quick little story it's just when I was a kid in

1146
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,640
in like middle school and high school me and my friends all loved this game and we talked about

1147
01:14:54,720 --> 01:15:02,320
it and we we even back in fucking like 2001 like 2000 even before that fucking 99 and shit

1148
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:09,360
we were like okay maybe not 99 a couple years later it came out in 97 probably like 2004-2005

1149
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,960
when they were starting to legitimately make remasters of Final Fantasy 1 and 2 and 4 and

1150
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,400
Fidever got one neither did 6 but like and Final Fantasy 4 got like a 3d remake on the DS

1151
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,160
Final Fantasy anthology on the ps1 there you go which is uh that's one and two or is that

1152
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:30,960
five and six five and six right right when they released those on PlayStation one

1153
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:37,600
back in the day so okay boy like my mind has been filled with the prospect of a Final Fantasy 7

1154
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:43,200
remake since I was a fucking child I've been dreaming of it coming out and you know it's not

1155
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:49,680
just about me me and my friends we we basically made a pact that whatever happened we would like

1156
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:55,840
at the time we were kids we were like man we'll buy whatever console imagine we might buy a ps3

1157
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:01,440
if we have to to get this remake we'll save up our pennies and we'll save our allowance when we're

1158
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:07,920
like 30 that's right when we're 45 you know what's happened since then every single one of those

1159
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,920
friends has lost interest I am the only one left of that group who still cares I was just talking

1160
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,440
to my college friends the other day none of them care they have all lost it's only me now I'm aware

1161
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,640
this game is successful but I think that is very interesting I know exactly who they're marketing

1162
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:31,120
this to and it's not me and uh I just think it's and now that it's here and I'm seeing what they're

1163
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:38,720
doing with it now that I mean I basically know what the ending is uh I just there's just I don't

1164
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,760
know what I'm saying there's just no no respect and in my mind there's no hope uh for I mean look

1165
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:49,120
I gave up hope years ago years ago I gave up hope we knew again that there would be no respect

1166
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:55,040
and no hope and like you said there there's parts that are good man this part that some people cared

1167
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,320
some people loved what they were doing uh but like the I mean what's most important this is a story

1168
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,960
driven game the fact that like there is are even you Jesse have gotten to parts where they've said

1169
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,480
like we need to change destiny things need to be we need to set right things that are wrong

1170
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,960
like the the the ghosts the time ghosts that show up at the very beginning to fuck with things uh

1171
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,360
is there is there a fucking point is there maybe some

1172
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,840
like plot thing in final phase seven that's considered like maybe like a sad event or

1173
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,840
like a tragic event that like maybe we might want to try to avoid maybe something that might be like

1174
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,320
one of the most iconic spoilers in all of all time is there something like that in five of seven

1175
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:40,160
I I can't think of anything but uh you know it would sure be okay stop stop dancing around

1176
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:44,000
and spoiling shit without spoiling it Nate I know what you're getting at I can fucking read

1177
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,040
between the lines here enough yeah we can stop talking about this I want to be surprised by at

1178
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:55,120
least something yeah okay okay and again I'm just this is just speculation but the only

1179
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,440
like positive thing as someone who has no context just listening to this conversation

1180
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:05,840
the only positive thing that I can possibly see of like the crazy fan boys and that comes around

1181
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:12,400
from final fantasy seven is that if the hardcore fans like you Nate are super pissed off by this

1182
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:17,600
entire project when it hits pc you know someone's gonna mod out all the bullshit and they'll have

1183
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,200
like the fan director cut where it's just like all the good shit and all the bad shit's gone

1184
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,480
and you'll just have that and and you'll just be able to get it from the fucking nexus and it'll

1185
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:35,280
be fine again I I don't want them to keep raping my game I just uh would prefer they did not do

1186
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:41,440
that personally I will seek all right so we've talked a lot about a game that is maybe

1187
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,960
maybe good maybe bad maybe kind of bad let's talk about a game that is unequivocally good

1188
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,640
that is perfect okay let's talk about animal crossing guess do you guys play animal crossing

1189
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:00,000
we are all stuck inside we're all quarantined it's it's animal crossing season baby it's the

1190
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,440
opposite of that one summer when everyone went out and played pokemon go now is the plague times

1191
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,280
when everyone's stuck at home playing animal crossing this is what we're doing hey hey we're

1202
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:14,720
okay so my my project right now is um I am uh I am trying to breed roses balloons right now I'm

1203
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:21,040
breeding roses I looked up a guide it's I want to I want to make I want to bleed breed black

1204
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,760
roses and purple roses and you have to you have to do all this bullshit you have to you

1205
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,880
have to plant them in a certain way and like wait and my my rose beds have been planted for days

1206
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:37,520
I have I have created two black roses and one purple rose and today a freak anomaly occurred

1207
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:43,680
and somehow a pink rose was bred out of what red roses which is not supposed to be able to happen

1208
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:49,600
nevertheless there it is staring me in the face in defiance of all facts and logic can you transpose

1209
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,200
flowers between areas without destroying them because I've had issues with that do you have to

1210
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:58,240
dig them up correctly you just dig them up you can't you can't destroy them unless you sell them

1211
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:04,560
or okay okay cool yeah in fact you can even water them dig them up and replant them and they're

1212
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:13,440
still watered sick for the rest of the day um based uh you know yeah I upgraded my house yeah I gave

1217
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,360
switch charger on some trip somewhere so I can't play any well hey that's okay it just

1218
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:51,760
uses a usbc you can uh you can get a cheap one of those I can do a what it's it's a usbc uh like

1219
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:59,520
generic uh plug I'm literally using my phone charger right now to charge my switch yeah cool

1220
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,680
it could be done there you go you're welcome hippo are you gonna say something no I was just

1221
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:10,640
well yes I was uh there's a balloon I found a balloon please have my last recipe it's gotta be

1222
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:17,760
an egg balloon it is an egg balloon oh my god is this it live please oh it's a fucking sky egg I'm

1223
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:24,080
sorry you're gonna need those sky eggs for the final right spoilers but after you get the final recipe

1224
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:28,720
he gives you another recipe that you have to then craft I've got a million eggs I can trade them in

1225
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,800
for that I'll be I'll be good it's it's like this is a perfect example but um

1226
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,400
animal crossing has been extremely amusing to me because everybody I know is playing it

1227
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:45,280
and um a lot of the people I know playing it are big gamers and this this cute little fun game about

1228
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:53,520
like having animals and a house on an island has most of the discussion I see is like hardcore

1229
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:00,800
gamer goon like min maxing like strategizing graphics like graphs like like spreadsheets of like

1230
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:06,320
it's it's so intense maximizing your returns on the stock market return at price it's hell yeah

1231
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,960
dude hell yeah it's so much of that it's really funny to listen to have you guys seen Hideki Kamiya

1232
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:15,600
is like tweeting tons of animal crossing shit that he's playing right now he's got like a weird like

1233
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:21,120
he's got just like his ground laid out with like sorted massive amounts of items like on the on

1234
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,440
his fucking open field I don't know what he's doing but uh he's doing something and it's very

1235
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,720
interesting it's just like if I were to play the game I don't have a switch but if I did uh you

1236
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:34,400
know I would I would consider it because it's it looks pretty cute and I've never played an animal

1237
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:40,320
crossing game before but like to be in the conversation is like everybody is talking about

1238
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:46,160
like extreme shit and I would probably just be like chopping logs or doing whatever like I

1239
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:55,680
missed my chance to invest in the stock market um today because I was too late to catch the uh the

1240
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:01,760
turnip pig another balloon it's just so funny no idea if I'd even like animal crossing I've never

1241
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,640
played it before I have like pocket cam installed on my iPad I figured to give that a shot you know

1242
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:12,000
Tom I think you like the actual I played I played the old um I played the old one on the like the

1243
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:19,600
the 3ds uh yeah uh yeah I think I played new leaf um and like I was into it for a while you know

1244
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,240
eventually I you know I fully upgraded my house got on my island taken care of and I was like okay

1245
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:29,680
I did everything I keep thinking maybe I'll just start playing animal crossing and then I look at

1246
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,880
my computer and the little doom eternal icon I'm like I'd much rather kill demons again I just

1247
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:40,640
play I mean I still to beat the fucking last level of doom eternal I think animal crossing is pretty

1248
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:45,680
fun you know the way the way to play at hardcore I don't know like it's tell me please I want the

1249
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:51,120
stretch well I mean maybe I'm doing it wrong but all you do is you just um like you have the little

1250
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:57,360
like nook miles plus uh mini goals you just you just do those yep like you just run around doing

1251
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,560
those and everything else takes care of itself you do those uh and yeah that's that's true pretty

1252
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,440
much that incentivizes you do you do those and then what do you do with any recipes that you think

1253
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,080
look really cool and you want like a cool leather sofa or something yeah well what do you do with

1254
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,080
the miles though because you can cash them in to go to different islands you yeah you explore other

1255
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:22,720
islands you spend that well you I mean have you like upgraded your inventory oh I one time yes

1256
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:27,440
oh dude get the final get the full inventory upgrade how big is it like how many you can get

1257
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:32,880
two upgrades up to four rows okay why the fuck have I not done that already all right yeah um

1258
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,640
that's what I need I mean yeah I'm pretty much at the point where I don't have anything essential

1259
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:42,400
to spend my miles on anymore so yeah yeah it all just just buying like telephone poles and street

1260
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,760
lamps and stuff just put out you know you know I I was given a fucking uh one of those oh I bought

1261
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:54,960
the uh the god's giant Godzilla that's that's hanging out next to my town hall now actually

1262
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,520
just this morning isabel moved in the wife who was here boys whip your dicks out wait here we go oh

1263
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:08,320
I expanded okay because I um my friend had already been playing because right because

1264
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,200
there's only one island per switch so my friend had already been on the island he had already

1265
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:18,080
done a bunch of stuff he had built like a couple of bridges and things so I moved in and like the

1266
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,840
town hall is already built there's already bridges and stuff like I already have access to the store

1267
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,840
so I kind of had it easy because he did he like took care of a lot of the bullshit

1268
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,320
he gave me some stone so I could make axes like right off the out the gate you know uh I do have

1269
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:39,040
a little story about Animal Crossing this is I was thinking of making a video but now my brain

1270
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:45,120
has just been consumed by uh by uh the remake the final seven remake and stuff so like I still might

1271
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,560
make this this might be one of those instances where me talking about it means I'll never make it

1272
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,840
but fuck it I can get it out there somewhere it's just that so I was playing Animal Crossing and

1273
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,520
there's a certain point you hit okay there's this feature that when you when you eat a fruit uh and

1274
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,640
it makes your like you're like super effective and so yeah mistakenly I accidentally shattered

1275
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:10,160
like every rock on my island they grow like the first day they do grow back but this was extremely

1276
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:15,120
frustrating me when I realized what I had done uh and for like two days I was getting like no iron

1277
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,760
and it was at the point where your bottleneck where you have to give them iron to like upgrade to like

1278
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,480
build the the shop or whatever to to keep like the progression of the town going or whatever oh okay

1279
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:29,120
yeah I never had to do that sure sure but I did though because I'm Michelle and I are both playing

1280
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:34,480
but I play more than she does um a typical man you know the woman just fucking dragging her ass um

1281
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:43,120
but uh a man's a man's place is in is in the home building furniture catching butterflies

1282
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:52,000
planting flowers and doing interior decorating um and whatnot so I uh so the the bottleneck of that

1283
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:58,720
iron ore was making me see to put it lightly and for days I was getting like two iron at a time

1284
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,520
because I had so few rocks and because it was also um you know Easter season so I was getting those

1285
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,200
fucking eggs instead of any fucking I'm so excited that the eggs will be gone I hate them every time I

1286
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,960
hit a rock and eggs pop out I'd like one of my dick pops out and I have to jack it out of rage

1287
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:21,520
it's infuriating yeah uh that's how it goes so so I was even doing you know you use the thing you

1288
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:26,880
travel to other islands I haven't I have literally I have never found a fossil I only find what

1289
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:33,280
eggs yes insane that's crazy yeah uh truly shocking truly shocking well yeah eggs need to

1290
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:37,680
fucking die and they'll be gone tomorrow thank god um so I was bottlenecked with this iron ore

1291
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,960
it made me so pissed and you know I was like uh you know what fuck this game this game's literally

1292
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:47,360
bad uh it's terrible it wastes my fucking time and of course you have to say every action in the

1293
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:54,400
game is designed to be comfy as opposed to efficient and like give you a little like talk you talk to

1294
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,880
people oh they'll tell you about your day you walk into the store they waste a full second of your

1295
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:03,680
life as they say hello instead of just letting you walk in and get your fucking business trading

1296
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:09,920
trading eggs trading eggs with the Easter Bunny one at a time one at a time it takes forever it's

1297
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,120
a nightmare it takes like 12 lines of dialogue just to do it I can't you have to click so many

1298
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:20,000
fucking menus okay it's awful so so at a certain point I said you know what literally fuck this game

1299
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,120
I'm never playing it again I'm gonna go play fucking factorial so I'd never played factorial but I

1300
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:30,800
wait when was this this was I mean this all happened within the last like seven ten days something like

1301
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:40,240
that earlier today it was like a week ago or something um so I I started playing factorial

1302
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:46,240
and I was like oh god yes uh this this game is designed for efficiency it feels so fucking good

1303
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,640
it's like it's like um oh shit what's that fucking game we have got it on this switch

1304
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:55,840
it's that game where you build an island and you aim to animal crossing new horizons it's

1305
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,640
something like that no wait it's right there on my menu forager it's like forager combined with

1306
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,480
like starcraft so it's just about building buildings make an efficient and it's it's

1307
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:09,760
amazing I've seen destiny play it a few times I was always curious um it's all about building

1308
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,120
treadmills and creating these elaborate circuit systems in order to generate items that are used

1309
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:21,760
to build more complex items uh whatever it's a very complicated like you design factories basically

1310
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,680
and layouts and stuff and for a while I was like oh god we know it from the mathematosis video

1311
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:30,960
oh I oh shit he's oh I gotta watch that instantly because I fucking love that game now he's done

1312
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,760
he's done videos on like this game and like every other game this company has ever made

1313
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:41,360
oh that was those guys this is uh one of those guys fucking yeah what is it called uh yeah he's done

1314
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:46,320
he's done a whole series those were great but I didn't fucking miss that completely I didn't

1315
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:51,840
understand them I thought they were neat to look at this game uh okay it's awesome until it became

1316
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,640
the worst game I've ever played in my fucking life uh and it it it just hits a point where it

1317
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:02,320
seems like the theme of the entire episode this game was great until it's animal crossing was so

1318
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,960
great until these fucking eggs showed up and yeah listen listen it's just that I was playing the

1319
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:12,160
factorial loved it for like two days and then you you hit a certain point where like okay I've got

1320
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:16,640
a factory going you're okay basically in order to progress you need to generate like these potions

1321
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:21,600
you start with like red potion then you go to like whatever like green then like blue to make

1322
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:26,560
those potions you need like weird combinations of different like tools that you have to have

1323
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:32,000
factories generating and stuff like but it gets exponentially more complicated to get each of

1324
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,400
them I hit the point where I was just like fuck this I'm not doing that you can't hold me hostage

1325
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:43,600
making any more of these fucking potions I give up and it was just too complicated my brain is

1326
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,120
too small and at that point I picked up animal crossing I'm like you know this game's actually

1327
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:53,440
pretty good it's not maybe maybe efficiency and aiming for like autistic factory simulator isn't

1328
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:58,400
always good sometimes you just want to shake a tree and get a coconut and that's what I'm doing

1329
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:03,520
that's what I'm doing at this very moment and it feels pretty fucking good oh god so it's been a

1330
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:09,200
journey it's and I still might make a video where that where I encapsulate this arc in a more artistic

1331
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:14,160
way but this has been my uh this has been my journey through these games efficiency pretty cool

1332
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,880
for a while but then I kind of get fucking sick of it and you just want to talk to a buddy yeah

1333
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,920
yeah well not well not the bunny someone else I hate the fucking bunny but uh I don't know Tom

1334
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,680
who who who are your villagers okay I've got a fucking hamburger ass looking sheep she looks

but this is cool wait I think I can remember them all I'm oh okay all of our favorite is um um

1352
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:28,960
always like thinking about things like huh uh eggs you're made of candy and like they taste

1353
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:35,760
really good it's almost like it's all designed on purpose he's aware that he's a video game

1354
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,760
character yes quack quack we all we all like Weber he gave us medicine when we got stung by wasps

1355
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:48,480
oh that's nice and uh uh uh there's um fauna is a deer she's fine she's my neighbor right now

1356
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:56,400
best guy is bam who is like a a stag or something he's like a blue like like deer stag and he is

1357
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:02,240
like a weightlifter and he's always like making shit in his house and when he goes outside Noja he

1358
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:07,120
literally like puts his arms he goes to the beach puts his arms behind him and Naruto runs around

1359
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:11,680
the beach like he's pretending to run like he's pretending to headbutt stuff and the other day

1360
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:19,520
I talked to him and he was like hey hey Ben looking built kablang and I was like yes I love bam

1361
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:25,760
he's my favorite um so those are my boys is this game like any kind of substantial improvement over

1362
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:31,680
Animal Crossing GameCube from 20 years ago or is it just there are some tiny efficiency improvements

1363
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,880
because everything I hear from it I didn't play the GameCube one so I don't know what that one

1364
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,240
was missing it's got like a new crafting system well everything I hear about Animal Crossing

1365
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:45,840
you know it's never this Animal Crossing is good for this reason it's always Animal Crossing is good

1366
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,880
like every time they're all the same game comes out there's no information anywhere

1367
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:58,720
then the crafting is definitely an improvement yeah it adds a lot um other than that I mean

1368
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:04,400
it's basically the same game just with more stuff yeah I think maybe there could be that there's

1369
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:10,240
space in the world for like an extreme in-depth analysis of all the Animal Crossing games well

1370
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:14,720
that's true because because I have the same problem like Animal Crossing is just beloved by everyone

1371
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:21,760
but like I mean there's just two things do I do I need to really play it it's it's cute things and

1372
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:29,200
it's like a very like gripping like a progression loop yeah of like of like they get you get a lot

1373
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:34,640
of rewards and there's a lot of like shit to work towards mm-hmm like in a meta sense Animal

1374
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:40,400
Crossing exists in two states pre-Isabel and post-Isabel when Isabel became like the most

1375
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:45,040
important aspect of Animal Crossing in-game though she just doesn't do anything I mean she

1376
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:50,800
won't if she fucking works behind a desk I gotta tell you I'm very proud of myself uh Caleb found

1377
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:56,480
my friend Caleb founded the island he named it Yakitori Island and uh I designed the flag and

1378
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:03,040
it is a yakitori hey that's it's all coming together baby it's just a chicken on a stick

1379
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:06,640
just today since Isabel moved in I was able to change the flag I'm going to make it some kind

1380
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:12,000
of pirate flag possibly but cool that's why I did the old days with my my ds version I put I put the

1381
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,080
New Los Angeles City theme song in as the town tune but I don't really think it fits so I think

1382
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,000
I'm gonna change it do you have to construct the song at a note so I was gonna do that I just didn't

1383
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,840
get to it yet yeah yeah yeah they give you a little like fucking Mario Mario maker like uh oh that's

1384
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:35,840
cool a tune creator to maybe all people give me a little like do do do do do do do do do do do

1385
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:42,080
wait wait you gotta give it a do do do do wait no as soon as I'm done with this I'm gonna go and

1386
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:51,920
I'm gonna make that the town tune good idea good idea uh yeah it's gotta be quite a few

1387
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,640
are there any skull masks that we can get I want to be sans there's I have a skull floor and I have

1388
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:04,480
a skull wallpaper it's really good is sans a killer or a rowdy I would have to say he's a killer I

1389
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:11,360
I don't know I feel like sans is a juvie killer aligned maybe he might just be like a really tough

1390
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:20,320
juvie yeah yeah I mean if it's like papyrus and sans like papyrus is the rowdy of the two and

1391
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,960
it's definitely killer or of the two but they might just both be juvies I don't know

1392
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:32,080
sans is too powerful he's above the gang war yeah that's true pretentious fuck

1393
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:40,320
so yeah animal crossing I'll try and get pictures of my rose garden please do please do

1394
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:45,360
get us the flag and let's see what things look like that hell yes I'll show that shit off

1395
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:51,200
mine is not impressive enough should I like um hey okay I haven't done any like multiplayer

1396
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:56,640
with it is like if I just like show my like my like island profile will it have like a

1397
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,880
number on it that people can use to like send me stuff you know I don't I haven't done anything with

1398
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:08,320
it yet um if I knew I'd I'd say but I could be I could be like hey guys here's my island number

1399
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:15,520
you can mail me things if you want maybe I that might do unboxing videos I've seen I've seen

1400
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,080
people posting like their custom designs online and I think you can just like type the number in

1401
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:25,360
like a serial number and just get it that's yeah there's something like that um or you might have

1402
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:29,520
to like send you might have to buy it from them or something there might it might be more complicated

1403
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:35,360
than just knowing the number I did I did enjoy very much being able to this wasn't an online thing

1404
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:39,920
but I sent Michelle a letter from the post office that said uh something along the lines of like

1405
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:48,480
dear Michelle fuck you get off my island uh sign Nate I um my um my my friend Dube was uh he was

1406
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:54,640
watching me play and he he was like Ben you're stripping the island bear of all its resources

1407
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,760
like you've like taken all the rocks and all the and all the fruits and I was like I left

1409
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,280

1410
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:15,520
vegetation so I denuding denuding I'm pretty sure that's a word so I went to the post office

and I sent him a stimulus package of 10 000 bells and I said sorry for denuding and uh that was my

1412
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:29,040

1465
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:47,120
ketu okay have written in before let's see what you got go hey pro crest leaders i got a major

1466
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:52,880
time critical life or death situation here and i need answers post haste if you've read my twitter

1467
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:59,200
i know ben has i plan on doing a lecture video like you guys did with radcon but there is a catch

1468
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:05,280
we live in a post-covid society and i can't get outside to preach to people about warrior cats

1469
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:11,040
because every second i spend in the presence of lesser beings is another percentage take up for

1470
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:17,040
the chance of be keeling over and dying to the virus the question is should i live stream a lecture

1471
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:24,960
and open up the chat for community members to discuss or put up a discord call get some friends in

1472
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:30,560
record do you have anything else in mind also the finalists for choices are more or less decided

1473
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:37,280
i'm just trying to figure out do i want to do one on warrior cats or magic the gathering

1474
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:42,080
i need to know please respond okay foxy socks

1475
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:49,440
personally i'd much rather see a lecture on magic the gathering just because i play it and

1476
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:54,480
i don't know enough about the lore there's so many novels and shit i read quite a bit of it um i think

1477
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:01,760
i mean on the one hand i know less about warrior cats yeah on the other hand is it funny like is

1478
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:07,440
the lore of that's the question i was gonna say is it fun to summarize like grand like uh like

1479
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:13,120
magic would i be would i be surprised by what i heard is on the other hand though fucking like

1480
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:18,400
magic is like no one knows the fucking lore of the magic series that's a good one that's like um

1481
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:24,640
it's like um like kingdom hearts is like nobody's played all these fucking games but came out to

1482
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:30,240
is way funnier just inherently because it's so retarded so i mean if it was me if you're really

1483
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:34,400
split between them personally i'd go for warrior cats but i can't tell you what to do i don't know

1484
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:40,960
which is uh well warrior cats seems easy the magic one will be successful because yeah that's

1485
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:46,080
probably true warrior cats would be too warrior cats has like a big internet like cult five magic

1486
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:51,520
the gathering would be more successful maybe because more people are familiar with magic the

1487
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:57,040
gathering and lots of those people don't know the lore and might be interested so you know that's

1488
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:03,200
probably a safer bet honestly in terms in terms of the other half of his question uh how to do it

1489
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:09,680
when there's virus i i don't know how well a discord call with people shouting at you through the

1490
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:14,640
screen while you're like doing a thing like i don't know whether that would have the same effect

1491
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:23,040
you could do it that way okay here's i mean just do a warrior cats lecture get a bunch of cats and

1492
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:31,040
have them yeah you could i mean yeah i i agree like you could do it live stream i do think it

1493
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,440
wouldn't be the same you your your quest your if you want to do it live you know your choices are

1494
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:43,120
like either wait till the pandemic ends or maybe is there could there be a way to do it while social

1495
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:47,680
distancing just don't come within six feet of anyone while you keep everyone six feet apart

1496
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:52,480
the thing is like lectures are basically video essays but with people in the room

1497
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:57,200
and then it's more of like a like a real physical thing i don't think it can be underestimated

1498
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:02,080
how important the people in the room thing is for the the the atmosphere helps with the if you're

1499
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:06,560
just standing there talking to a camera you may as well be making a video about it rather than

1500
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:13,360
like a long uninterrupted unedited thing i mean well what's your time frame too like if you're

1501
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:18,240
willing to wait a month a month a lot of things could change for this might be longer than a month

1502
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:22,640
it might it certainly well could go be dead in a month in which case yeah i suppose so

1503
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:26,880
uh i mean if it was me i think what i would do was like based on the crew i've got

1504
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,640
i would probably like i can't recommend this to you because maybe it's a little irresponsible

1505
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:34,400
i would just try to like vet them like okay guys like are you are you sick you've been going out

1506
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,560
what's what's your deal and if not i'd be like okay i'm gonna take a risk and just like get to

1507
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:45,040
i mean i think it's you're not supposed to do that no i mean it might be low key it might be low

1508
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:51,600
key illegal oh that it's i don't know whether it's illegal it should be and i wouldn't respect

1509
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:56,400
and like enforceable to like yeah i'll push you back into your house if you get caught well it's

1510
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:01,760
well the point is i mean the point is it's that it's irresponsible yeah here's what i think you

1511
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:06,400
could i think you could do it in a responsible way okay say you've got like a bunch of say you've

1512
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:11,520
got like maybe one location that you want to go do it in and you all go do it and like

1513
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:19,520
i don't know you wear gloves just wash your hands you take all the vitamins that you have in your

1514
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:27,120
house all the vitamins and then you get uh like just eat them up no you get apple cider vinegar

1515
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:32,080
and like the spiciest chili powder that you have and you put it all in a blender and you drink

1516
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:36,720
a whole thing of it and then you're immune to everything forever and you'll become a super

1517
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:41,680
human that's like a plant and so then it won't have an effect on you and you can do whatever you

1518
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:48,400
want there you go i think if you know people it's all about brewing the right potions

1519
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,720
i just think i would say if you can find a place that you can do it that everyone could

1520
01:50:54,720 --> 01:51:00,480
like get together like deep clean and then sure yeah sanitizer and wash your hands a lot

1521
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:06,320
it would probably be okay i hope you don't i hope no one dies as a result of me saying this

1522
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:12,320
just don't touch each other don't breathe on each other six six six six feet away six six six

1523
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:17,840
indeed six six six feet away if preferably just get like a fucking air hang out no more no less

1524
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:23,440
you know i mean i mean we all waited until radcon to do a lecture that took two years

1525
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,800
sweet until the fucking pandemic's over yeah he doesn't sound like this is like urgent use the

1526
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:31,760
time to take notes hasn't even decided what he's gonna do yet exactly so i mean to be fair a lot

1527
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,400
of us kind of made up our mind while we were there so you could do you could do like rehearsals like

1528
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:42,240
none of us i don't think do like live rehearsals where we try to speak the whole thing i i know i

1529
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:47,360
probably needed to do on yeah yeah oh by the way did i mention have you guys seen my my one piece

1530
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:52,400
lecture has cleared 100 000 views not bad not too shabby not too shabby i got recommended it

1531
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,800
did oh that's oh that's the bet you know i'll just tell you guys i've made

1532
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:03,360
about over 300 off that video i'm very glad that i did not i was so close to just letting it be

1533
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:08,800
demonetized i was this fucking close i was like why was it demonetized well because i put okay this

1534
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:14,640
is the weird thing that it's the binks sake song from the show that like got claimed at times i just

1535
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:19,600
did a little creative editing to just like remove a little bit actually like the singing vocal part

1536
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:26,240
was like the most the end song i originally wanted the whole like like the fucking straw hat crew

1537
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:29,760
and the rolling pirates on thriller bark where they sing it with brook and stuff i wanted like

1538
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:35,440
the voices of the crowd singing it kind of weirdly fades out now that was not intended that was just

1539
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,880
to avoid copyright stuff so anyway i'm glad that i did and uh thank thank you jesus for

1540
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,760
hooking me up with that one i want to say i think it's cool foxy that you're thinking about doing

1541
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,920
a lecture i think i think it would be cool if more people just kind of did like hey i'll do a

1542
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:57,040
lecture in the style of the pcp uh one other person did one uh tectonic improv did one on top

1543
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:01,920
of the floor the lore of the lore of lingkara i haven't watched that which is but it's good it's

1544
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:10,160
cool i i do know a bit about lingkara yeah i mean it's the it's the in universe like story of his

1545
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:16,400
yeah like like his the like i don't want to watch all those reviews to get that so i

1546
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:24,560
of course no ever since our men yeah you guys are aware of me um back years and years and years ago

1547
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:31,440
when i posted the video of me and lingkara yeah at the time i met him at the fucking whatever i

1548
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:35,360
don't remember that was before i followed you but i am aware of it i think it's amazing couldn't see

1549
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:41,280
the video but i have seen clips of it and i have seen it at some point so yeah i was at um

1550
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:49,280
yoma con in detroit i think it was like 2011 and i was like i was just a little like baby boy

1551
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:55,440
youtuber this was during my that guy at the glasses forums days yep and um for some reason

1552
01:53:55,440 --> 01:54:01,760
i was just like up in one of the halls just like sitting there just like grumpily eating a lemon

1553
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:08,800
like with the skin on it and everything because right because for i don't even know why i did this

1554
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:13,760
but i like i oh because someone was like passing out lemons for some reason like being quirky

1555
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:19,040
like i was like oh you think that you're quirky i'll show you fucking quirky so i'm you know so

1556
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,720
i said the person i was with i was like hey fill me i'm just gonna sit here i'm gonna eat this whole

1557
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:28,640
lemon and no one can stop me no one tried to stop me but that didn't matter so i sat there but

1558
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,640
nonetheless the point was yeah and i like and i did i ate the whole lemon i was chewing through

1559
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:38,240
the fucking rind and the fucking the gristle and the grime and the grit of the bone all the bones

1560
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:44,960
cracking yeah the blood of this lemon pouring down my chin and i and i got the whole thing down

1561
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:49,760
and i was like yeah and i was feeling like a real badass and and like in the middle of it

1562
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:56,640
like linkara was like just happened to be passing by and uh like i noticed him and i was like hey

1563
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:03,600
you it's something and like there was like this weird altercation or like i was like i was like

1564
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:08,320
trying to like be like a badass heal like eating this lemon for no reason and he probably had no

1565
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:14,240
fucking idea what was going on whatsoever but he came up and he was like playing into it and he

1566
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:21,040
like did his man punch thing and he's like i am a man and went to punch me and like and i and i

1567
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:25,840
totally no sold it like an asshole and i'm like well i've got a lemon and i just kept eating the

1568
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:31,600
lemon in front of him like aggressively eating a lemon at linkara until he like got sad and walked

1569
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:37,760
away like like defeated um man i feel like if i could go back and do it again i would have like

1570
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,000
oversold the punch i would have like flipped back over a railing and died that would have been fun

1571
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,920
yeah but i was but in the moment i was just like how dare you try to be cooler than me while i'm

1572
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:51,280
eating a lemon you son of a bitch and so like i ate it at him and he got he he was he was destroyed

1573
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:56,720
and no one ever heard from linkara ever again and i'm sorry this video is my it's my fault that

1574
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:02,080
that got the glasses was went on play in horseshoe finale i think i've put clips of it in various

1575
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:06,560
videos i think the i've definitely seen it and i think it's in horseshoe finale is that video

1576
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:11,760
available somewhere no the full video i think it was called horseshoe finale yeah right on youtube

1577
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:17,440
the full video of it was on like blip before blip went down i think is why it's no longer available

1578
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:22,880
but yeah you can see clips of it in various places well regardless uh regardless on the point of

1579
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:27,600
doing lectures whatnot i mean i've been thrilled uh to see link link in the description to tectonic

1608
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,680
doing that shit are you i have not yet done it but i have been a little tempted here in there

1609
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:30,400
since it's calib switch he made it very clear he's like hey yeah you can play my island you do whatever

1610
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:36,000
you want yeah one rule is no fucking clock manipulation because that's for cowards and you

1611
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
cheat not only the game but yourself yourself you didn't grow you didn't evolve you didn't

1612
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,800
so that's why i'm stuck waiting waiting in three three whole days of waiting to have bred uh four

1613
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:55,120
special crossbreed roses but soon soon the population will explode once i get to that

1614
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:02,160
man talk about a game wasting your time yeah in game time it's about the journey yeah fair uh

1615
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:07,120
okay let's go to our next voicemail uh this one is simply called you should be able to solve this

1616
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:12,320
take it away hey fellas disappointed that you didn't get the crab and a half question correct

1617
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,960
you should have been able to solve it really i don't know what was the answer much easier one

1618
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:25,360
oh whatever a bat and a ball cost a dollar ten in total a bat and a ball a dollar ten

1619
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:33,920
the bat costs a dollar more than the ball how much does the ball cost okay now you really truly

1620
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:42,080
honestly and ironically should be able to solve this i think i think it's yeah five cents easy

1621
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:48,480
i'm not gonna play your fucking head games that is yeah that is easy i'm mad okay he says we got

1622
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:53,360
the crab and a half question wrong but he doesn't tell us what the answer is that that is frustrating

1623
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:59,680
that is frustrating what was this one a bat in a ball or a bat i don't understand a bat and a ball

1624
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:05,120
like like a baseball bat and a baseball okay a bat and a ball cost a dollar ten the bat costs a

1625
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:10,000
dollar more so the answer is the ball yeah the ball costs five cents the bat costs a dollar five

1626
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:16,960
easy two i really feel like the problem with the crab question if we got it wrong i think it's

1627
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:23,200
because it was phrased confusingly what was the crab that's the point of these riddles or or questions

1628
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:28,400
is that they're supposed it was like a complicated thing like two crabs get in half the crabs get

1629
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:32,720
out i don't know it's all the birds trying to push you towards making like this obvious answer that

1630
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:37,360
is actually the dumb answer but it's just some like your head first so you just blurt it out

1631
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:42,400
because you don't give a shit the they're phrased confusingly purposely to make you think the obvious

1632
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,120
answer but it's not actually because it sounds i guess that would have been two weeks ago was it

1633
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:54,160
really it feels like this forever ago on friday on friday or on yes yes two days ago when we

1634
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:59,840
recorded this the new episode came out i had no idea that a week had gone by that i had not been

1636
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,840

1637
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:20,400
the time lost in the sauce hmm oh time to go make that wobbling zipper toy fuck yeah and then i'll be

1640
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:43,520

1641
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:51,600
i'm legally a faggot now um yeah i can't really control it uh it would just make me sad for you

1642
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:56,800
know like give or take two minutes you know we're tuning in every week to the pcp zibatsu cast

1643
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:03,280
shitting on you know my my new internet dad's shitting on the corpses of my old dead internet

1644
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:10,880

1645
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:17,920
some insider baseball on that uh as a as an old zibatsu head um that's funny on two levels not

1646
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:25,120
only because they're all like you know like a live irl none of them have died since uh also because

1647
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:31,040
all of their you know all of the solo channels they predictably made afterwards uh they're all

1648
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:36,800
shit and terrible and boring uh because the fuck is none of them are funny by themselves without

1649
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:42,480
anyone to play off of and they everything interesting they have to say i've already heard them say it

1650
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:47,440
multiple times over the course of years since 2013 when they first started the friendcast

1651
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:55,520
uh so i guess what i'm trying to say is shut down r slash two best friends play you fucking idiots

1652
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:01,200
are in denial it's your last bastion of hope shut down hope become bitter like me

1653
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:08,640
okay okay zibatsu is a japanese term referring to industrial and financial business conglomerates

1654
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:12,720
in the empire of japan whose influence and size allowed control over significant parts of the

1655
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:20,880
japanese economy from the meiji period until the end of world war two okay listen listen at at the

1656
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:25,680
beginning of last episode that only tom was here for i i said a little piece about like oh you know

1657
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:29,600
i heard about zibatsu like i'd heard the term i actually went and looked it up and it is like a

1658
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:33,920
like it's exactly what bends it it's like a cool term that would kind of apply and now i i get what

1659
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:38,080
it meant to the two best friends to the pcb the point was that we are a zibatsu

1660
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:44,640
in the beginning very briefly at the beginning yeah yeah what how did it come up

1661
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:49,200
i got i just started talking i had just been looking it up and i just thought it was funny

1662
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,920
because i i thought it was like a wrestling zibatsu yeah as nat was there was a whole

1663
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:58,320
there was a goddamn story where i was like i can't remember why i was googling the company nissan

1664
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:02,720
for some reason and i was like i don't know and it said nissan was formed out of like the

1665
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:08,560
nissan zibatsu and i'm like what the fuck wait what and then i just followed that thread and i

1666
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:12,160
was like oh it's the thing that's why they called themselves that's a business conglomerate makes

1667
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:20,640
sense okay guys i solved it i found the answer here oh that makes me very mad already is that

1668
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:26,720
out of angst business to business whiteboard oh my god listen to this i don't want to actually

1669
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:34,720
listen to it can i no well just go animate that ain't good all right put that this is so fun no

1670
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:41,520
this is so good it's like text to speech explaining what a word i'm upset i'm not having a good time

1671
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:46,720
anymore why is this oh dude we found this is how this is how you do a social distancing uh pcp

1672
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:51,840
lecture we figured out the format maybe you type out the script and you do it in like go animate

1673
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:59,200
rayman things with albert einstein whoa ben how do you get star fragments what the fuck is that

1674
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:06,880
thanks professor that explains zibatsu no problem you get star fragments nate by um at night i have

1675
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:13,040
another recipe for a star one that blathers sister gave to me but yeah the way that you get star

1676
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:18,800
pieces is apparently at night sometimes shooting stars happen and if you are looking at the sky

1677
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:23,760
like you have the camera all the way up and you see a shooting star you hit a to make a wish

1678
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:29,520
and if you do that then the next morning star pieces will appear on the beach whoa yeah and

1679
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:34,320
that's how you get star pieces i'll fucking have to do that so i can make this stupid ass wand uh

1680
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:42,320
sick based yeah well anyway moving on from that uh zibatsu's are cool rest in peace two best friends

1681
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:47,040
or whatever uh yeah there you go that's it all right we've got another here's an exciting voicemail

1682
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:55,280
simply called re final fantasy seven uh okay take it away one thing that i'm reading about about

1683
02:06:55,280 --> 02:07:00,640
this final fantasy seven remake that nate will probably never even read about because he has

1684
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:07,760
a tiny brain is uh this one very minor part that i'm like kind of upset about um at the beginning

1685
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:13,520
of the game when you do the mako bombing thing that and you put the timer on the bomb in the

1686
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:18,160
original game wasn't it like 10 minutes you had 10 minutes to like get the fuck out of there

1687
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:23,840
and uh i got out of there like you know first try like it's not that hard but in this game

1688
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:30,880
it gives you like a choice between 20 minutes or 30 minutes and uh chose 20 minutes and still left

1689
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:37,120
with like less than 10 minutes like i left before 10 minutes had even passed what's the

1690
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:43,120
fucking point if like really what really holds your hands with that timer and this new one uh the

1691
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:48,080
boss fight doesn't even count the timer doesn't start until after the scorpion fight is that true

1692
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:53,440
of the game too no no i remember the the the timer starts and then the boss happens like oh

1693
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:57,440
shoot i gotta defeat this guy while the time is going and like the little part where we're sounds

1694
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:01,440
like a good way to build tension in an action indeed it does the little part where jesse hurts

1695
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:06,160
her leg and you go over to savor in the original that was a choice because it was taking time from

1696
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:11,600
your clock you know you were choosing to go rescuer uh in the new one the clock stops during this

1697
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:17,280
scene for this cut scene for no reason the clock stops while you're helping her up it's the little

1698
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:21,280
things to me that reveal that these people don't know what they're doing i don't care that it's the

1699
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:26,240
same people they've lost their touch if that's what's happened it doesn't matter um i don't whatever

1700
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:31,760
it's not all bad but yeah i mean little things like that like the whole game has changed so like

1701
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:36,000
theoretically with like different mechanics that you could make you could design a game where it's

1702
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,640
perfectly appropriate to give someone 20 minutes instead of 10 to do x things but they did that

1703
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:45,600
and then also made the game way easier and baby you like if you want if you want to cut those out

1704
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:52,640
just give a little extra time to do the boss and the thing i love like small moral choices that

1705
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:56,960
i actually have to make the idea of like oh i might not get out in time because i don't know how

1706
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:03,360
much longer this is i i but i need to go save jesse uh uh you know what i mean i don't know i feel

1707
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:08,000
like a lot of this is informed by the meta it's because like because everyone knows it's so weird

1708
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
who is this game for people who have played it before or people who haven't it's i'm very confused

1709
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,640
about that it's both that's why it's for it i'll tell you who it's for it's for casuals who played

1710
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:22,480
the game but don't understand it hmm it's for people who it's for people who vaguely remember

1711
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:27,760
Final Fantasy 7 and see the new one and can go oh my god a Final Fantasy 7 remake oh my god

1712
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:32,880
everything's blowing my mind and you know those people will probably love it oh yeah i'm sure

1713
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:40,000
you know all of it i'm fine yeah are you know those people oh that's me i hate myself you got me

1714
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:46,560
all right whatever let's go to the next one yeah we can complain all day about that uh okay last

02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:36,320
starter page just which ones are available which ones have been like unlocked uh that would make

1776

1777
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:47,440

now the two are unlocked i should update okay i will do that cool also absolutely i was just

1779
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:57,760
thinking red man is very blocky because he is a pixel man is that going to be yeah i think we

1780
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:02,960
might have to change that oh okay yeah i i don't know if that would i threw it in there because

1781
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:08,960
it was like funny mm-hmm i see and it is iconic face but yeah we can we could approximate we

1782
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:13,840
would probably have to not do it in like a pixel form yeah and also what's going on with this play

1794
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:27,280
sparring or whatever um the the amounts we were fighting over in the slime fest was like

1795
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:31,920
because shamblers had shut down the city and no one had been able to play for like a long time

1796
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:37,760
we literally went with like eight and nine million like you could make that in one day uh but that's

1797
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:43,200
what we had to work with god do i miss the stock market and the stonks god damn well not in season

1801
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:06,160
pin of some stripe that would be excellent you know you know that's not a bad idea um i might

1802
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:10,800
make one and just see if anyone cares i made oh you know i wanted to make one that was like

1803
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:16,160
like a weather warning for bicarbonate rain yeah good idea good idea like it may be like a yellow

1804
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:21,040
triangle with like a cloud and like maybe the chemical symbol for like bicarbonate soda or

1805
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:27,680
something bicarbonate bicarbonate rain downpour again and i want a pin to reflect yeah i fucked

1806
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:32,160
around with it i didn't settle on a design but maybe i'll make one and see if anyone likes it

1807
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:36,960
that's a good i'd like it i like it yeah i i think that's cool if i had to choose i'd probably get

1809
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:51,280

1810
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:55,200
city oh i gotta say i love the slime coin i mean the slime coin of course is kind of number one

1811
02:18:55,200 --> 02:19:00,480
that's i mean the slide we could make the slime coin as a pin too if we wanted but like right now

1812
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:05,440
it's just i like it as a coin i'm sick in new los angeles city you would see people wearing

1813
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:11,440
like killer pins rowdy pins of course those people just would be wearing those um you you if someone

1814
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:16,480
were a muck trainer you might see them wearing the muck league badge uh they might have a podron

1815
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:20,720
pin to them as it exists right now though i do have an issue with this i am the so those are the ones

1816
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:26,240

1817
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:31,200
